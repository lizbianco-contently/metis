Mr. President, for a few weeks in March 2010, Alan Frumin \nwas one of the most talked about men in the entire city of Washington. \nThe Senate was poised to send a historic health care reform bill to \nPresident Obama's desk for him to sign, but the usual procedural \nhurdles stood in the way.\n  Health care policy staffers were camped out in Alan Frumin's office \nstudying Senate procedure and precedent. But despite the pressure, \ndespite the national spotlight, Mr. Frumin remained calm and \nprofessional through what must have been one of the most intense \nmoments of his career. For a very few weeks, every Capitol Hill \nreporter knew his name for sure. His respectable face was on every \npolitical news blog. Every political science professor talked about \nhim. Even a few folks outside the beltway learned what on Earth was a \nSenate Parliamentarian. What do they do? He was briefly a Washington \ncelebrity. But for those of us who work in the Senate, Alan Frumin has \nalways been a star, even when very few of us knew who he was or what \njob he did. But it did not take us long after coming to the Senate to \nlearn that quickly.\n  Alan has served in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate since \n1977. In his 18 years as chief Parliamentarian, he has made countless \ndifficult decisions with composure. He has a knowledge of complex rules \nthat certainly would be deemed to be extraordinary. These are rules \nthat are convoluted, and procedures are somewhat unique. But he \nunderstands every one of them.\n  He is, above all, impartial to a fault. I have been upset at Alan a \nfew times when I wished he were not so impartial, but he has always \nbeen impartial. That is why he is the only Parliamentarian ever to be \nhired by both Democratic and Republican leaders to serve in this \ncrucial role. In fact, he was retained in his position despite a change\n\n[[Page S176]]\n\nof Senate control four times by five different majority leaders.\n  One cannot be an effective Parliamentarian without being fairminded \nand judicious, but Alan Frumin also brings to the job a willingness to \nhear both sides of an argument and consider every side of the issue. He \nhas patience. I have never heard him raise his voice. I never saw him \nto be agitated. He is always calm and cool. What a wonderful example he \nis for all of us.\n  The truth is, Senate Parliamentarians aren't simply appointed, they \ngrow into the job. So I am pleased that the talented Elizabeth \nMacDonough, who has worked for Alan for a decade, will succeed him. \nElizabeth will be the sixth person to hold the job of Parliamentarian \nsince it was created in 1935, and the first woman. She steps into very \nlarge shoes.\n  I will miss Alan's experience and guidance greatly, but I wish him \nall of the best in his retirement. But he is really not going to \nretire; he is going to continue to edit Riddick's Senate Procedure, the \nofficial book of Senate procedure, and no one is more qualified than \nAlan to do this.\n  Congratulations, Alan. Thank you very much for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S176-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me also add some words about Alan \nFrumin. For those who are not aware of what the Parliamentarian does \naround here, he is sort of like an umpire in a ball game calling balls \nand strikes. It should not surprise anyone to hear that we have not \nalways agreed on those calls. But it is not an easy job to be an umpire \nfor 100 Senators. It is not easy to keep up with 200 years of \nprecedents. And to Alan's credit, he never hesitates to admit when he \nthought he got something wrong.\n  Alan has a deep love for the Senate and the people who make it work. \nFrom the elevator operators and the cooks to the most senior Senators, \nhe keeps up relationships with all of them. He cares a lot about this \ninstitution, and he has the service to show for it.\n  As the majority leader indicated, Alan has been here since 1974--\nlonger than all but just a handful of us. So he has really seen it all. \nWe will miss his devotion and his intellect. We are glad he has been \nable to spend more time with his wife Jill and his daughter Allie. I \nknow they love to travel. Hopefully they will be able to do more of \nthat.\n  Thank you, Alan, for four decades of service to this institution we \nall love and admire, and good luck in everything that lies ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S176-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               STOCK ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last night the Senate voted to proceed \nto the STOCK Act--a bill, incidentally, that was coauthored by two \nRepublicans. I am glad the majority leader is going to allow amendments \nfor a change. Up until a few years ago, the Senate has been known as a \nforum for open-ended debate. The minority party may not have always \ngotten its way, but at least it knew it would always be heard. It is \nsomething we have not done nearly enough of in these past few years. I \nhope it does not prove to be a false promise. I expect Senators on both \nsides of the aisle will have a number of amendments to this \nlegislation.\n  But one thing that stands out is the fact that the President is \ncalling on Congress to live up to a standard he is not requiring of his \nown employees. So I think we can expect at least one amendment that \ncalls on executive branch employees to live up to the same standards \nthey would set for others. If the goal is for everyone to play by the \nsame rules, that should not mean just some of us, and it certainly \nshould not leave out those in the executive branch who, after all, have \naccess to the most privileged information of all.\n  So the goal in the course of this floor debate will be to make sure \nthe executive branch--those most likely to take advantage of insider \ninformation--is fully and adequately covered by this regulation.\n  But let's be clear. President Obama is not interested in this bill \nbecause it would address the Nation's most pressing challenges. Of \ncourse it will not. He is interested in it because it allows him to \nchange the subject. The more folks are talking about Congress, the less \nthey are talking about the President's own dismal economic record. \nFrankly, for a President who has presided over a 43-percent increase in \nthe national debt in just 3 years and the stain of the first ever \ndowngrade of America's credit rating, I can certainly understand why he \nwould want to change the subject. I can see why he would rather be \ntalking about Congress or the Super Bowl or the weather or anything \nother than his own failed economic policies. But the problems we face \nare too grave and too urgent, and every day the President spends time \ntrying to change the topic instead of changing the direction of the \neconomy is another day he is failing the American people who elected \nhim.\n  Now, the President can pretend he just showed up. He can try to \nconvince people, as he tried to do this weekend, that the economy is \nmoving in the right direction, but he is not fooling anybody. Americans \nknow we are living in an economy that has been weighted down and held \nback by legislation he passed with the help of a big Democratic \nmajority in each House of Congress. Americans know we are living in the \nObama economy now--we are living in the Obama economy right now--and \nthey are tired of a President who spends his time blaming others for an \neconomy he put in place. They want the President to lead.\n  I have yet to see a survey in the past year that shows Americans \nagreeing with the President on the direction of the country or the \neconomy. The ones I have seen all say the opposite. Wide bipartisan \nmajorities believe the country is on the wrong track.\n  For small business owners, the people we are counting on to create \njobs in this country, the numbers are even starker. According to a \nrecent survey conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 85 percent--85 \npercent--of small business owners say the economy is on the wrong \ntrack. Eighty-four percent of them say the size of the national debt \nmakes them unsure about the future of their businesses. Eighty-six \npercent worry that regulations, restrictions, and taxes will hurt their \nability to do business. Just about three-quarters of them say the \nPresident's health care bill will make it harder for them to hire. In \nother words, it is a huge drag on job creation.\n  If I were the President, I would probably rather be talking about \nCongress too. I understand why he would rather be talking about what \nCongress may or may not do rather than what he has already done. He \nwould rather be talking about what Congress may or may not do rather \nthan what he has already done. But he has a job to do. He was elected \nto do something about the problems we face, not blame others for our \nproblems. He was elected to take responsibility for his own actions, \nnot pretend they somehow never happened.\n  Today the Congressional Budget Office will release an annual report \non the Nation's finances. We do not know all the particulars, but I can \ntell you this: It will not paint a very rosy picture. Our fiscal \nproblems are serious, and every day that the President refuses to \naddress them, they become harder to solve.\n  So my message to the White House this morning is simple: It is time \nto lead.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S176-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, many years ago when I graduated from\n\n[[Page S177]]\n\nGeorgetown Law School, I was offered a job by the Lieutenant Governor \nof Illinois, Paul Simon. He asked if I would join his staff in \nSpringfield, IL, in the State capital and if I would serve as his \nsenate parliamentarian. I jumped at the chance. I was in desperate need \nof a job with a wife, a baby, and another one on the way.\n  Deep in debt, I skipped my commencement exercise to get out and on \nthe payroll in Springfield of the Illinois State Senate. The first day \nI walked in on the job at the Lieutenant Governor's office they handed \nme the senate rule book. It was the first time I had ever seen it. They \nparked me in a chair next to the presiding officer of the Illinois \nSenate, the Lieutenant Governor, and said: Now you are here to give \nadvice.\n  I spent every waking moment reading that rule book and trying to \nunderstand what it meant. There wasn't a course like that in law school \nor anything that gave me guidance as to what I was to do. I made a lot \nof stupid mistakes, and I learned along the way what it meant to be a \nsenate parliamentarian.\n  It was a humbling experience, in many respects, to learn this new \nbody of law, how it applied to the everyday business of the Illinois \nState Senate. It was equally humbling to be in a position where your \nvoice was never heard but your rulings were repeated by so many.\n  I recall that many years later--14 years later--I was elected to the \nU.S. House of Representatives. After serving 12 of those 14 years in \nthe office of the Illinois State Senate Parliamentarian, I cannot \ndescribe to you the heady feeling I had when I went on the floor of the \nU.S. House of Representatives, they handed me the gavel, and I actually \npresided over the U.S. House. After 14 years of silence as the Illinois \nState Senate Parliamentarian, I was speaking before one of the greatest \nlegislative bodies in the world. So I have some appreciation for the \nrole of a parliamentarian, and particularly for the contribution of \npeople such as Alan Frumin. In some respects, it is a thankless job, \nbecause you are bound to make some people upset. As the majority leader \nmentioned, we respect Alan's impartiality as Parliamentarian, but many \ntimes we go back to our office and are critical of it at the same time. \nWe hope he will rule in our favor instead of the other way.\n  Alan has been faithful to precedent, to the rules of the Senate, and \nthat is all we can ask of a person who serves in his position. He has \nto tolerate the titanic egos that occupy this Chamber. I used to say \nthat the majority leader is the captain of a small boat full of titanic \negos. That is the nature of this institution. Alan has been called on \nmore often than most to deal with the peculiarities of even my \ncolleagues and myself.\n  I wish him the best after more than 35 years of service to the \nCongress, both in the House and the Senate. I am glad he is going to \ncontinue at least on the research side to establish a body precedent \nthat will guide the Senate and the Congress in the years to come.\n  Alan, thank you so much for all the service you have given to the \nSenate, to the Congress, and to the United States.\n  To Elizabeth MacDonough, congratulations. It is great you will be \ncoming into this new role. It is precedent-setting in and of itself \nthat you will be the first woman to serve as the U.S. Senate \nParliamentarian. We all respect very much your professionalism and look \nforward to working with you--even when you give us disappointing \nrulings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S177-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S177-S178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened to the comments made by the \nRepublican leader about how he believed President Obama is trying to \nchange the topic and not talk about the economy and, rather, talk about \nethical standards in the U.S. Congress. I have to say this is an issue \nthat resonates with me personally because, as I mentioned earlier, I \nhave been honored to have been brought up in public service by two \noutstanding individuals, former U.S. Senators Paul Simon and, before \nhim, Paul Douglas. Both of these men had integrity as a hallmark. Even \nas people in Illinois disagreed from time to time with their positions \non issues, they never questioned their honesty. That is my background, \nmy training, and I have tried to continue in that tradition.\n  I accepted the standard, which was first initiated by Senator Paul \nDouglas and carried on by Senator Paul Simon, of making a complete \nincome and asset disclosure every single year. I think if I look back \nnow, I can trace it back to my earliest campaign, certainly back to my \ntime in the office of the Lieutenant Governor. Almost every year I made \nthat disclosure. There was some embarrassment in the early years, \nbecause my wife and I were broke and we showed a negative net worth \nbecause of student loans. We suffered some chiding and embarrassment \nover that. Over the years, even my wife got to where she didn't pay \nmuch attention on April 15 when I released all this information.\n  What we are considering on the floor is a tough issue. It is this: \nWhen you earn something as a Congressman or Senator, what should you do \nto take care that you don't capitalize on that, that you don't turn \nthat into part of a personal decision that might enrich you? It is a \nlegitimate issue, and I support the legislation that is on the floor, \nthough I think it will be challenging to implement.\n  We should never capitalize on insider information, private \ninformation given to us in our public capacity, to enrich ourselves, \nperiod, no questions asked. What we have before us now is an \nopportunity to call for more timely disclosure of those transactions \nthat Members of Congress--in this case Senators--engage in that might \nor could have some relationship to information they learned in their \nofficial capacity.\n  I quickly add that this is a challenge because, honestly, in our work \nin the Senate we are exposed to a spectrum of information on virtually \nevery topic. People sit and talk to us, those in an official capacity \nand also unofficially, about the future of the European Community, what \nwill happen there, and if the European economy goes down or up, what \nimpact will it have on the United States. We learn these things in \nmeetings; we think about them as we vote on measures on the floor. \nObviously, they are being discussed widely in the public realm as well. \nSo drawing those lines in a careful, responsible way is going to be a \nchallenge for us.\n  But disclosure is still the best antidote to the misuse of this \npublic information. I don't think it is wrong for the President to \nchallenge us or for the Republican leader to challenge the executive \nbranch at the same level. That is fair. You know I am friendly to the \nPresident. I am a member of his party and was a personal friend to him \nbefore he was elected, and I still am today. He should accept the \nchallenge from the Senator from Kentucky to look at the standards \nwithin the executive branch to see if they meet at least the minimum \nstandards set by this legislation. We should look at it, as well, in \nterms of our responsibilities as Senators.\n  I take exception to the comments made by the Republican leader when \nit comes to the state of the economy and the role of the executive. The \nSenator from Kentucky said there has been change in the national debt, \nsince the President was elected, by an increase of 4 percent. I am sure \nthat is close to true if not true in detail. But look at the \ncircumstances. When President Clinton left office and turned the keys \nover to President George W. Bush, the national debt was $5 trillion, \nand the next year's budget would have been the third in a row in \nsurplus by $120 billion--not a bad welcome gift from the outgoing \nPresident, William Jefferson Clinton.\n\n  Now fast forward 8 years as President Bush left office and handed the \nkeys to President Obama--quite a different world. Instead of a national \ndebt of $5 trillion, 8 years later, it was $11 trillion, more than \ndouble under President George W. Bush, a fiscal conservative by his own \nself-description. Look at what he left for President Obama in his first \nbudget, in the first year: a $1.2 trillion deficit. Not a surplus, but \na deficit 10 times as large as the surplus left by President Clinton. \nThat is what President Obama inherited.\n  He said in the State of the Union Address that we had lost 3 million \njobs in the 6 months preceding his being sworn in and another 3 million \nbefore his stimulus bill was passed and implemented. Six million jobs \nwere gone;\n\n[[Page S178]]\n\n750,000 people lost their jobs the month President Obama was sworn into \noffice.\n  Now Senator McConnell comes to the floor and says that is President \nObama's fault. I don't think that is a fair characterization. I think \nthe President would accept responsibility not only for his time in \noffice but for the decisions he has made. But to saddle him with the \nlegacy of the previous President and his economic policies is \nfundamentally unfair.\n  The Senator from Kentucky says, don't forget, it was on President \nObama's watch that a rating agency downgraded the credit rating of the \nUnited States. True. If you read the downgrade, it is not about the \nstate of the economy, it was about the state of politics in Washington. \nWe were downgraded by Standard & Poor's because they believed that we \nwere incapable, as a divided government, to make important decisions \nfor this Nation.\n  How did they reach that conclusion? Perhaps it was because of this \ndivided government, with the tea party dominance in the House of \nRepresentatives, that led us into a position in 2011 where we faced two \ngovernment shutdowns and one shutdown of the economy in the same year. \nThis weakened economy, suffering from recession, still had to worry \nabout whether the fights between the House and the Senate would lead to \neven more economic peril. That is why we were downgraded. Don't blame \nthe President for that. We can blame ourselves--at least partially--for \nthe downgrade. Let me say that too.\n  We know there is uncertainty about the future. People are waiting for \ncertainty when it comes to the value of real estate, the future of \njobs, and business. I understand that. But things are moving in the \nright direction. Last week, we learned that our economy grew at a rate \nof 2.8 percent in the last 3 months of 2011--the strongest quarter of \nthe year--and it shows that the chances of double-dip recession are \nreceding.\n  In 2011, the unemployment rate fell from 9 to 8.5. The private sector \nadded more jobs in 2011 than in any year since 2005. The American \nmanufacturing sector was growing for the first time since the late \n1990s.\n  The Republicans don't want to credit this President as they should. \nThere are 3 million new private sector jobs. The weakness in our \nunemployment figures reflects the loss of public sector jobs. Federal, \nState, and local employment has gone down as the revenues of government \nhave decreased.\n  But this recovery is still fragile. Those who come to the floor, as \nmany have, and argue for austerity and budget deficit concentration \naren't wrong, but their timing is wrong. This is the moment when we \nneed to strengthen this economy and move it forward. I was on the \nBowles-Simpson commission. Understand that their deficit reduction did \nnot begin until the first of 2013. We wanted to create enough time in \nthat commission for the economy to recover and come out of this \nrecession.\n  Those who argue that we should abandon that now would sink us even \nmore deeply into a recession instead of on the road to recovery. We \nneed to continue to act, to find that which will strengthen our \neconomy--investment in education and training for our workers, \ninvestment in research, whether it is at the National Institutes of \nHealth or other agencies of government, so that we can move forward \nwith innovation and create jobs in areas such as green and clean \nenergy.\n  Third is the development of our infrastructure. It is indefensible \nthat Congress has been unable to pass a highway bill, an infrastructure \nbill to rebuild America. The trip I took to China last year was a stark \nreminder that China is determined to lead the world in the 21st \ncentury. They are building in China an infrastructure to do it, while \nwe nurse one that has been falling apart for decades.\n  Can't Republicans and Democrats agree even in a Presidential election \nyear that we need a solid infrastructure bill that will rebuild America \nand create good-paying jobs right here in America? It is time for us to \nhave a balanced plan and to work together to achieve it.\n  The President is not trying to avoid the topic. He addressed it in \nhis State of the Union Address. It is up to the Congress to follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S178-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S178-S179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KEVIN HAGAN WHITE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last Friday Kevin Hagan White, a four-term \nmayor of Boston, passed away.\n  In the city of Boston, in the shadows of Faneuil Hall, there is a \nstatue of Mayor White that stands 10 feet tall, larger than life. There \ncould not be a more fitting tribute to a mayor and a man who was \nhimself a huge figure in the history of Boston and a mayor who helped \nto give our city the extraordinary skyline and the extraordinary spirit \nit has today.\n  He was a mayor who, more importantly, through four terms led the city \nof Boston through a remarkable transition, from times of division to a \ntime of new international and singular identity for the city. He led \nthe transition of a great city. But this good man and ground-breaking \nmayor was, frankly, much more than a transitional leader himself. He \nwas a transformative figure in a city that, when it comes to history-\nmaking mayors, does not use the word ``transformative'' lightly.\n  Mayor White's passing gives Boston and its people a chance to reflect \non how one leader, one politician could help to reshape a major city in \nAmerica--to some degree reflecting his own persona, bright and \nenergetic. Kevin White was elected to city hall in 1967, a time when \nbig city mayors in America were political forces even as the days of \nthe all-powerful political machines were beginning to dwindle. In \nChicago, there was Richard Daley; in New York, John Lindsay; in Los \nAngeles, Sam Yorty, among some of the big city mayors of our Nation. \nBut in Boston, Kevin represented a new generation of urban leaders. He \nwas only 38 years old and was filled with optimism and energy and clear \nideas of what he wanted Boston to be--summarized, perhaps, in the \nnotion of being a world-class city.\n  He attracted brilliant, idealistic young people to help him achieve \nhis goal, brilliant young people such as Barney Frank, Micho Spring, \nAnn Lewis, Paul Grogan, Fred Salvucci, George Regan, Robert Kiley, Bo \nHolland, Cecily Nuzzo Foster, Dennis Austin, and Clarence ``Jeep'' \nJones, all of whom saw in him a reason to dedicate themselves to public \nservice.\n  When Kevin White moved into city hall, some people assumed they were \ngetting a business-as-usual mayor--Irish and Catholic, typical and \ntraditional. But the times were changing. The political and social \nclimate of Boston in the late 1960s was hardly traditional, and Kevin \nWhite was anything but your typical politician.\n  He glided effortlessly between the old world and the new. No one had \never seen a Boston politician go to Rhode Island to get the Rolling \nStones released into their personal custody after they were arrested, \nand then the next night, when they appeared at a concert in Boston, \nstand up and announce to a cheering crowd, ``The Stones have been \nbusted, but I sprung them.'' Kevin did just that in 1972, which \nhappened to be right after 18-year-olds got the right to vote.\n  Kevin White opened Boston's political system to African Americans, \nwomen, Jews, and gay Americans alike. He spearheaded rent control. He \ndecentralized the city government by forming little city halls in the \nneighborhoods. He made jobs for young people a priority. He organized \noutdoor summer activities known as ``Summerthing.'' He refused to let \nInterstate 95 run right through the city in order to protect low-income \nhomes and boost public transportation. But perhaps most importantly, he \nsparked a downtown renaissance that began with Quincy Market, now one \nof the city's top tourist attractions, and it became the heartbeat of \nthe new Boston that is his legacy.\n  Mr. President, Kevin White came to city hall with an ambitious plan \nto build a new Boston brick by brick if he had to, and that is pretty \nmuch what he did. When Kevin White took office, Boston was in many ways \nstill stuck in the 1920s--virtually no new buildings in decades, a \nsteady decline in population and jobs, flophouses in the Back Bay, \nQuincy Market, a ramshackle warehouse of butchers and cheese dealers. \nBut Kevin and his new team at city hall hit Boston like a bolt of \nlightning,\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\neventually reversing the city's economic slide and laying the \ngroundwork for the vibrant Boston of today. He had a vision.\n  Boston was in Kevin's blood and so was politics. His father and \nmaternal grandfather had been Boston city council presidents, and he \nmarried Kathryn Galvin in 1956, the daughter of another city council \npresident. He was elected Massachusetts secretary of state three times \nbefore being elected mayor for the first time in 1967.\n  Kevin White was the right man for the job at the right time, as he \nproved so importantly and so poignantly within months of taking office \non April 5, 1968--to be precise, the day after Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. was assassinated. James Brown was scheduled to do a concert at \nBoston Garden that night. Rather than allow it to be cancelled, as many \nsuggested, Kevin arranged for the concert to be televised live in hopes \nof minimizing unrest. He even appeared on stage himself to plead for \ncalm. He stood on the stage and said:\n\n       All of us are here tonight to listen to a great talent. But \n     we are also here to pay tribute to one of the greatest of \n     Americans, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Twenty-four hours ago, \n     Dr. King died for all of us, black and white, so that we may \n     live together in harmony, without violence, and in peace. I'm \n     here to ask for your help. Let's make Dr. King's dream a \n     reality in Boston. No matter what any other community might \n     do, we in Boston will honor Dr. King in peace.\n\n  That was leadership, and it helped. Cities across the country \nexploded in violence, but Boston summoned relative restraint. James \nBrown called Kevin ``a swinging cat.'' Of course, difficult times lay \nahead, a turbulent period of racial strife. But Kevin White sought to \nshepherd Boston through those difficult times, and in the process he \nushered in the remarkable city we know today. He did his best to hold \nthe city together by walking the streets, reaching out and fighting \nwith every ounce to get Boston where it is today. At one point, he led \na march of 30,000 people to protest racial violence.\n  Kevin White was, according to his most famous campaign slogan, a \nloner, in love with the city. But this self-proclaimed loner did love \nBoston, and Boston loved him back. His wide circle of friends and \nformer staff remained loyal and close throughout his life. Above all he \nwas a family man, devoted to his wife Kathryn of 55 years, to his five \nchildren, and to his seven grandchildren. To all of them and to the \nrest of his family, we extend our deepest sympathy and a thank-you for \nsharing Kevin with us.\n  The devotion of Kevin's family was boundless throughout his long and \nvaliant fight against Alzheimer's disease. From his diagnosis nearly a \ndecade ago to the very end last Friday, they gave him all the love and \ncare he needed to face his debilitating challenge with the same dignity \nand courage with which he served the city of Boston for so long.\n  Mr. President, Boston is that shining city on a hill that John \nWinthrop, one of the founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, spoke \nabout in 1630 as he sailed to America. It is a city teeming with people \nof all kinds, a city of commerce and creativity, a city of grit and \ngreatness. And Kevin White helped to make it that way.\n  I consider it a privilege to have watched his journey, to have \nenjoyed his friendship, support, and counsel. I join with so many in \nthanking him and his family for his service.\n  May he rest in peace.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S179-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S179-S180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today in defense of the Constitution. \nI rise today to condemn the President for making appointments that are \nunconstitutional and illegal. Recently the President appointed members \nto the National Labor Relations Board and to the Consumer Financial \nProtection Agency. He did so by saying we were in recess.\n  This is news to us because those of us in the Senate maintain that we \nwere never in recess. The President has usurped a power never \npreviously taken by a President and has decided unilaterally that he \ngets to decide when we are in recess. These appointments are illegal \nand unconstitutional, and I am surprised--I am surprised--that no \nmember of the majority party has stood to tell the President so.\n  I am not surprised that the President has engaged in unconstitutional \nbehavior. His health care law is brazenly unconstitutional. His war \nwith Libya was unconstitutional. He got no congressional authority. So, \nfor a man who once gave lip service to the Constitution, the President \nnow has become a President who is prone to lawlessness and prone to \nunconstitutional behavior.\n  Our Founders clearly intended that the President have the ability and \nthe power to appoint advisers, but they also separated that power and \ngave power to the Senate to advise and consent on these high-ranking \nofficers in government. The President has gone an end-around on this \nand has done something that breaks with historical precedent. It goes \nagainst the notion of checks and balances.\n  In fact, the notion that underlies the whole idea of recess \nappointments is mostly a historic relic. Alexander Hamilton explained \nin Federalist 67 that the power was included so the Senate did not have \nto remain in session year round to deal with nominations. This was also \ndone at a time when Congress would go out of session for months at a \ntime for members to return to their farms and their businesses. Now \nCongress meets nearly year round.\n  So, in other words, recess appointments should only happen rarely, in \nextreme occurrences, if at all. There also should be agreement that we \nare in recess, and there is no disagreement that we were in recess.\n  There is a lot of talk about bipartisan cooperation on the other side \nof the aisle, but I am disappointed that not one Senator has stood to \ntell the President this sets a terrible precedent; that this is a \nusurpation of power that is bad for the country and bad for the idea of \nchecks and balances. I am disappointed that not one Senator from the \nother side of the aisle has stood to oppose this President on this \nunconstitutional power grab. This is an opportunity for us to stand \ntogether in defense of the Constitution.\n  I state now, unequivocally, if a Republican President tries to usurp \nhis power, if a Republican President tries to define a recess and \nappoint people illegally, I will stand on the Senate floor and oppose \nhim. This is not about being a Republican or a Democrat, it is about \nhaving respect for the Constitution. These lawless, illegal, and \nunconstitutional appointments fly in the face of the respect for our \nConstitution. This is an issue of separation of powers, of \nconstitutional authority, and of Senate prerogative. It is sad that not \none member of the opposition party will stand for the Constitution, \nwill stand to the President.\n  Make no mistake, this is a huge breach of precedent. If the President \nis allowed to determine when we are in recess, nothing prevents him \nfrom making recess appointments this evening at 8 o'clock or on the \nweekends. If this precedent is allowed to stand, nothing stops the \nPresident from appointing a Supreme Court Justice tonight at 8 o'clock. \nIs that the kind of lawlessness we want in our country? Are we going to \ncompletely abandon the advise-and-consent role of the Constitution and \nof the Senate?\n  I ask today, is there not one Senator from across the aisle who will \nstand against this unconstitutional power grab? Is there not one \nSenator from across the aisle who will say to the President that these \nillegal appointments set a terrible precedent; that these appointments \nwill encourage lawlessness; that these appointments eviscerate the \nadvise-and-consent clause of the Constitution? I ask my colleagues from \nacross the aisle: Where is your concern for the checks and balances? \nWhere is your concern for the Constitution?\n  I am greatly saddened by this action, and I hope the President will \nreverse course. I hope the majority party in\n\n[[Page S180]]\n\nthe Senate will stand for the Constitution. But I am greatly \ndisappointed in where we are in this debate.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S180-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE STOCK ACT\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, later today the debate will center on the \nfundamental question of whether Members of Congress should be \nresponsible for upholding the same laws as the American people. The \nunified answer from this Congress must be an unequivocal yes. It is no \nsecret that Congress has a track record of exempting itself from the \nvery laws it writes.\n  Former Senator John Glenn said such exemptions are ``the rankest form \nof hypocrisy. Laws that are good enough for everyone else ought to be \ngood enough for us.''\n  Former Congressman Henry Hyde once quipped that ``Congress would \nexempt itself from the laws of gravity if it could.''\n  I have long supported efforts to ensure that Congress refuses to give \ninto any temptation to exempt itself. When I was serving in the House \nof Representatives, I was proud to be a leader in the effort to require \nMembers of Congress and their staffs be subject to the same \nrequirements that the Obama health care bill put on all citizens.\n  While the bad old days of Congress exempting itself from major \noccupational safety and health and fair labor standard laws were done \naway with to some extent after passage of the Congressional \nAccountability Act, and other reforms of the mid-1990s, Congress should \nnot miss this opportunity to show the American people that it is \nwilling to live by the very rules that are imposed on the American \npeople. The people of this Nation are tired of business as usual in \nWashington. They are tired of the congressional exemptions or carve-\nouts that create a chasm between the working class and the political \nclass.\n  My home State of Nevada is currently enduring the highest \nunemployment rate in the country. In fact, Nevada has led the Nation in \nunemployment for more than 2 years. As I travel the State, I hear from \nindividuals who are frustrated because the public servants who are \nsupposed to be representing them don't feel their pain. While our \neconomy limps on, the Nation's Capital remains untouched by the \ndifficulties Nevadans experience every day. In light of these facts, is \nit any mystery why Congress is currently experiencing its worst \napproval ratings in history?\n  I am a cosponsor of the STOCK Act because I believe confidential \ninformation acquired as a result of holding public office should not be \nused for private gain. The STOCK Act would prohibit Members or \nemployees of Congress and executive branch employees from profiting \nfrom nonpublic information obtained because of their status and \nrequires greater oversight of the growing political \nintelligence industry. Members and employees should also be required to \nreport the purchases, sales, and exchange of any stock, bond, or \ncommodity transaction greater than $1,000 within 30 days.\n\n  As a strong supporter of transparency in Congress and the Federal \nGovernment, I believe the STOCK Act is an important step for Congress \nto take and start earning back the trust and faith of the American \npeople. Restoring that confidence will surely be a long journey because \npublic servants have in too many cases not taken their job seriously. \nBut through legislation such as the STOCK Act, we send an important \nmessage to the citizens of this Nation that we understand our position \nrequires us to uphold the highest ethical and moral standards, and we \nare willing to undergo the scrutiny required to regain that trust.\n  Members of Congress should follow the same rules as every other \nAmerican. No American can trade on insider information without the risk \nof prosecution, and Congress should be held to the same standard. \nElected officials should take every precaution to ensure that they do \nnot use public information for personal gain.\n  I hope both Chambers will take the time to thoughtfully consider this \nlegislation and send it to the President for his signature. My hope is \nthat the American people will view passage of this legislation as an \nearnest bipartisan effort to change the way Washington does business.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the role.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the state of the \nNation's economy. Upon taking office, President Obama encountered one \nof the worst recessions in this country's history. He faced tremendous \nchallenges under any standard. To be sure, it would have been difficult \nfor any President to make the kinds of reforms that would have had an \nimmediate effect on an economy this bad. But at the end of the day we \nsee that although he was handed something that we can fairly \ncharacterize as an economic emergency, he, through his actions and \nthrough his policies, turned that emergency into a national tragedy.\n  In his first 2 years, instead of focusing on creating jobs and \ncreating a set of circumstances in which the private sector could bring \njobs to fruition, President Obama and his substantial majorities in \nboth Houses of Congress used their tremendous advantage to push for \ngreater government control over America's health care choices, more \nburdensome and debilitating regulations on businesses, and a failed \nstimulus package that led to record-setting annual deficits.\n  Just look at America before President Obama took office and compare \nit to our economic situation now. For example, unemployment is up 9 \npercent from when President Obama took office. The price of gasoline is \nup 83 percent compared to when he took office. Long-term unemployment \nis up 107 percent. The median value of a single-family home in America \nis down 14 percent, and the U.S. national debt is up 43 percent. He has \nadded over $4 trillion to our national debt.\n  Then, last year, President Obama created a standoff with Republicans \nby refusing to accept a reasonable compromise on spending reforms as a \ncondition for raising the Nation's debt ceiling. He presided over the \ndowngrading of America's credit rating, the first in our country's \nhistory, and he has taken every opportunity to block the development of \nAmerica's energy resources, a source of much-needed revenue and jobs.\n  Perhaps most troubling, this President has intentionally divided the \ncountry by waging vicious class warfare campaigns separating average, \nhard-working Americans by income and then pitting them against one \nanother. The President's record on this score has been repugnant and \ndamaging.\n\n  Instead of working with Congress to address our genuine economic \nchallenges, the President has responded by starting his reelection \ncampaign early. In a series of taxpayer-funded campaign stops, the \nPresident sharpened his divisive message and astoundingly blamed \nRepublicans for legislative gridlock--never mind that the President's \nmost recent budget proposal failed to attract even a single vote in the \nU.S. Senate, and it was, in fact, Senate Democrats who refused to bring \nthe President's own jobs plan to the floor for a vote. Even today, \nmembers of the President's own party are lining up against him to \noppose his tone-deaf decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. This project \nwould create 20,000 American jobs, it would inject much needed private \nsector capital into our economy, and it would increase the country's \nenergy security, but the President has chosen to block the project as \nan election-year nod to his friends in the extreme leftwing of the \nenvironmentalist movement.\n  President Obama has put the state of our Union in disarray. Certainly \nhe inherited a poor economy, but the decisions he has made and \nimplemented since taking office are making it worse. He was handed an \neconomic emergency, and instead of taking the\n\n[[Page S181]]\n\nchallenge head-on, he chose to ignore it, and then he turned it into a \nnational tragedy.\n  There is a void of leadership in the White House. He must end the \ndivisiveness and start dealing directly and decisively with the needs \nof the country. The President has very little time left to show the \nAmerican people that he can be the kind of leader who will put the \ncountry before his own personal political interests. For the sake of \nall Americans, I sincerely hope he uses that time wisely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

EARMARK ELIMINATION ACT OF 2012.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Earmark \n     Elimination Act of 2011''.\n       (b) Prohibition on Earmarks.--\n       (1) Bills and joint resolutions, amendments, amendments \n     between the houses, and conference reports.--\n       (A) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider a bill or resolution introduced in the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives, amendment, amendment between the \n     Houses, or conference report that includes an earmark.\n       (B) Procedure.--Upon a point of order being made by any \n     Senator pursuant to subparagraph (A) against an earmark, and \n     such point of order being sustained, such earmark shall be \n     deemed stricken.\n       (2) Conference report and amendment between the houses \n     procedure.--When the Senate is considering a conference \n     report on, or an amendment between the Houses, upon a point \n     of order being made by any Senator pursuant to paragraph (1), \n     and such point of order being sustained, such material \n     contained in such conference report shall be deemed stricken, \n     and the Senate shall proceed to consider the question of \n     whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and concur \n     with a further amendment, or concur in the House amendment \n     with a further amendment, as the case may be, which further \n     amendment shall consist of only that portion of the \n     conference report or House amendment, as the case may be, not \n     so stricken. Any such motion in the Senate shall be debatable \n     under the same conditions as was the conference report. In \n     any case in which such point of order is sustained against a \n     conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such \n     conference report by operation of this subsection), no \n     further amendment shall be in order.\n       (3) Waiver.--Any Senator may move to waive any or all \n     points of order under this section by an affirmative vote of \n     two-thirds of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (4) Definitions.--\n       (A) Earmark.--For the purpose of this section, the term \n     ``earmark'' means a provision or report language included \n     primarily at the request of a Senator or Member of the House \n     of Representatives as certified under paragraph 1(a)(1) of \n     rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate--\n       (i) providing, authorizing, or recommending a specific \n     amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, \n     or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan \n     guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with \n     or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or \n     Congressional district, other than through a statutory or \n     administrative formula-driven or competitive award process;\n       (ii) that--\n\n       (I) provides a Federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or \n     preference to a particular beneficiary or limited group of \n     beneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       (II) contains eligibility criteria that are not uniform in \n     application with respect to potential beneficiaries of such \n     provision; or\n\n       (iii) modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the \n     United States in a manner that benefits 10 or fewer entities.\n       (B) Determination by the senate.--In the event the Chair is \n     unable to ascertain whether or not the offending provision \n     constitutes an earmark as defined in this subsection, the \n     question of whether the provision constitutes an earmark \n     shall be submitted to the Senate and be decided without \n     debate by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members, \n     duly chosen and sworn\n       (5) Application.--This section shall not apply to any \n     authorization of appropriations to a Federal entity if such \n     authorization is not specifically targeted to a State, \n     locality or congressional district.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments about \nthis amendment, but I will do that at a later time when time is more \navailable.\n  I thank my colleague from Maine and my colleague from Ohio for their \nhelpful cooperation in this process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank both the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1478 and 1481\n\n  I will speak in more detail about my amendments later, but now I want \nto say a few words about each of them.\n  First, they are consistent with the spirit of the underlying bill--a \nversion of which I cosponsored. I am particularly appreciative to \nSenator Gillibrand for her good work on this overall issue.\n  The underlying STOCK Act clarifies that insider trading laws apply \nthe same way to Members of Congress as they do to the rest of the \ncountry, pure and simple. It makes sense.\n  My amendments would also extend generally applicable laws to Members \nof Congress.\n  One amendment would apply financial trade disclosure rules to Members \nin the same way they apply to others, such as corporate insiders, \nfinancial advisers, SEC employees. It would narrow the window for \ndisclosure from 30 days down to 10 days. It would make Member \ndisclosure more consistent with rules that require timely disclosure of \ntransactions by corporate directors, officers, and large shareholders. \nWe should do the same more strictly than we have in the past to do the \nsame as they do. Let's hold ourselves to the same standard of openness \nand shine the light of transparency on our financial trades, if we make \nthem.\n  The second amendment would extend to Senators the same conflict of \ninterest rules that currently apply to committee staff and executive \nbranch officials. This amendment, which is No. 1481, is coauthored by \nSenator Merkley of Oregon.\n  Members of the Senate and staff would be prohibited from owning or \nshort-selling individual stock in companies affected by their official \nduties. We would still be permitted to invest in broad-based funds or \nplace our assets in blind trusts, as permitted by the Select Armed \nServices Committee--SASC--rule and Federal regulations.\n  When asked about the fact that the SASC conflict of interest rules \napply to staff and DOD appointees, President George W. Bush's Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, Gordon England, said:\n\n       I think Congress should live by the rules they impose on \n     other people.\n\n  That is why I am offering these two amendments. It is pretty simple. \nWe vote on a whole range of very important issues in this country. We \nshould not only not benefit from our votes on investments we might \nhave, but it is important that the perception be that when we make \ndecisions, we make them for the good of the country, not for our own \nfinancial interests. That is something the public finds pretty \ndistasteful. These two amendments together will help fix that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I know we are starting to \nget the intake of amendments. I want to reiterate what we talked about \nyesterday, about having relevant amendments filed. This is a very \nspecific issue we are addressing, which is to deal with perceived \ninsider trading and/or Members of Congress having an unfair advantage \nand having obviously nonpublic information, confidential information \nthat would ultimately be used for financial gain.\n  As we are reviewing some of the amendments or hearing discussions of \nothers that may be forthcoming, I want to remind the Members that this \nis something that forces outside this building may not want to happen. \nI feel very strongly that this is something we need to do and use to \nreestablish the trust with the American citizens and Members of \nCongress.\n  That being said, as our Members are listening or their staffs are \nproposing amendments that are forthcoming, I hope they would be \nrelevant to the issue at hand and not get sidetracked into a discussion \nthat would take us away from what we are trying to do here.\n  Again, I am looking forward to the amendments. I know Senators \nLieberman, Gillibrand, Collins, and I will be managing the floor today \nto try to make sure that happens and convince our Members to stay \nfocused on this very important issue.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1477 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 1477.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1477 to amendment No. 1470.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to eliminate \n  the prohibition against general solicitation as a requirement for a \n                 certain exemption under Regulation D)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. MODIFICATION OF EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Removal of Restriction.--Section 4(2) of the Securities \n     Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d(2)) is amended by inserting before \n     the period at the end the following: ``, whether or not such \n     transactions involve general solicitation or general \n     advertising''.\n       (b) Modification of Rules.--Not later than 90 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission shall revise its rules issued in section \n     230.506 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, to provide \n     that the prohibition against general solicitation or general \n     advertising contained in section 230.502(c) of such title \n     shall not apply to offers and sales of securities made \n     pursuant to section 230.506, provided that all purchasers of \n     the securities are accredited investors. Such rules shall \n     require the issuer to take reasonable steps to verify that \n     purchasers of the securities are accredited investors, using \n     such methods as determined by the Commission.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this amendment would make it easier for \nsmall business to better access capital in order to expand and create \njobs. On November 3, 2011, the House of Representatives passed a \ncompanion measure, which was introduced by Representative Kevin \nMcCarthy, on a near unanimous vote of 413 to 11; 175 Democrats in the \nHouse supported this legislation. We have an opportunity here to show \nthe American people that we are serious about creating jobs and to pass \nthis amendment here in the Senate.\n  This amendment would remove a regulatory roadblock in order to make \nit easier for small businesses to access needed capital to expand and \ncreate jobs. Current SEC registration exemption rules severely hamper \nthe ability of small businesses to raise capital by allowing them to \nraise capital only from investors with whom they have a preexisting \nrelationship.\n  By modernizing this rule, small businesses and startups would be able \nto more easily raise capital from accredited investors nationwide. \nAccording to the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council:\n\n       This is a long overdue solution that will widen the pool of \n     potential funders for entrepreneurs. Our economy will improve \n     once entrepreneurs are provided the tools, opportunities and \n     incentives that they need to hire and invest.\n\n  Earlier this month, the SEC Small Business Advisory Committee on \nSmall and Emerging Companies recommended that the agency ``relax or \nmodify'' the general solicitation prohibition as a good policy to \nincrease the amount of capital available to small businesses.\n  In his State of the Union Address last week, President Obama called \non Congress to pass legislation that will help startups and small \nbusinesses access capital in order to expand and create jobs. The \nPresident said:\n\n       Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small \n     businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. \n     Tear down regulations that prevent entrepreneurs from getting \n     the financing to grow. Both parties agree on these ideas. So \n     put them in a bill and get it on my desk this year.\n\n  This is exactly what this amendment will do. And it has support from \ninvestors and entrepreneurs alike. When you have unemployment hovering \naround 9 percent, we need to pass legislation that will enable our job \ncreators to expand and create jobs. As I said, this legislation \nreceived overwhelming bipartisan support in the House of \nRepresentatives. I hope we can do the same here in the Senate by \npassing this amendment.\n  We all talk about the importance of making it easier, making it less \ncostly, less difficult for our small businesses and entrepreneurs to \nget access to capital so they can create jobs and get the economy \ngrowing again. So many times these are contentious, they are \ncontroversial differences of opinion about how best to do that. We \nfight over regulations, we fight over taxes. This is something where \nthere is broad bipartisan support, almost unanimous support in the \nHouse of Representatives, a vote of 413 to 11 in support of this \nlegislation when it was voted on in the House of Representatives.\n  We have an opportunity to do something that is very straightforward, \nthat is broadly supported by both Democrats and Republicans--at least \nit was in the House of Representatives--that the President has \nsuggested we ought to be working on, looking for these types of \napproaches to freeing up access to capital for our small businesses.\n  You have the folks out there in the business community overwhelmingly \nsupportive of doing away with the regulatory barrier, the regulatory \nobstacle this particular regulation represents in terms of access to \ncapital for our small businesses. It seems like one of those issues on \nwhich there should be no disagreement. I hope that will be the case. I \nhope we can get a vote on this amendment, get this put into law and put \ninto effect so our small businesses and our entrepreneurs in this \ncountry can do what they do best; that is, create jobs. They have to \nhave access to capital in order to do that. This makes that process \neasier. It does away with some of these unnecessary regulations and \nroadblocks and barriers that exist today.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier we agreed to alternate side to \nside for the offering of amendments. However, I would say to the \nDemocratic floor manager that there do not appear to be any Democrats \nright now who are seeking recognition. Therefore, I would ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Arizona be permitted to proceed at this \ntime, given the absence of a Democrat on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1471 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank both the Senator from New York and \nthe Senator from Maine for their courtesy.\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup amendment No. 1471.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Johanns, Mr. \n     Barrasso, Mr. Blunt, and Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1471 to amendment No. 1470.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To protect the American taxpayer by prohibiting bonuses for \n   Senior Executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while they are in \n                            conservatorship)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATION ON BONUSES TO EXECUTIVES OF FANNIE MAE \n                   AND FREDDIE MAC.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision in law, senior \n     executives at the Federal National Mortgage Association and \n     the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are prohibited \n     from receiving bonuses during any period of conservatorship \n     for those entities on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this bipartisan amendment is very simple. \nIt would prohibit bonuses for senior executives at Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac while they are in a taxpayer-backed conservatorship. I am \njoined in this effort by Senators Rockefeller, Enzi, McCaskill, \nJohanns, Barrasso, Blunt, Graham, Coburn, and Thune.\n  Since they were placed in conservatorship in 2008, these two \ngovernment-sponsored entities have soaked the American taxpayer for \nnearly $170 billion in bailouts. Recently Freddie Mac requested an \nadditional $6 billion and Fannie Mae requested an additional $7.8 \nbillion. That is $13.8 billion more coming out of the pockets of hard-\nworking Americans, many of whom are underwater on their mortgages.\n  I wish to read an article from Politico from back in October entitled \n``Fannie, Freddie dole out big bonuses.''\n\n       The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the government \n     regulator for Fannie and Freddie, approved $12.79 million in \n     bonus pay after 10 executives from the two government \n     sponsored corporations last year met modest performance \n     targets tied to modifying mortgages in jeopardy of \n     foreclosure.\n       The executives got the bonuses about two years after the \n     federally backed mortgage giants received nearly $170 billion \n     in taxpayer bailouts--and despite pledges by FHFA, the office \n     tasked with keeping them solvent, that it would adjust the \n     level of CEO-level pay after critics slammed huge \n     compensation packages paid out to former Fannie Mae CEO \n     Franklin Raines and others.\n       Securities and Exchange Commission documents show that Ed \n     Haldeman, who announced last week that he is stepping down as \n     Freddie Mac's CEO, received a base salary of $900,000 last \n     year, yet took home an additional $2.3 million in bonus pay. \n     Records show other Fannie and Freddie executives got similar \n     Wall Street-style compensation packages. Fannie Mae CEO \n     Michael Williams, for example, got $2.37 million in \n     performance bonuses.\n       Including Haldeman, the top five officers at Freddie banked \n     a combined $6.46 million in performance pay alone last year, \n     though a second bonus installment for 2010 has yet to be \n     reported to the SEC, according to agency records. Williams \n     and others at Fannie pocketed $6.33 million in incentives for \n     what SEC records described as meeting the primary goal of \n     providing ``liquidity, stability and affordability'' to the \n     national market.\n\n  I think it is important to ask the question, is it necessary for \nthese bonuses to be provided to these executives when we have men and \nwomen who are literally in harm's way, who are compensated far less? Is \nit possible that there aren't some patriotic Americans who would be \nwilling to serve and head up these organizations and try to get them \ncleaned up?\n  The primary causes of the collapse of our economy still plague us to \nthis day.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from Politico be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, Oct. 31, 2011]\n\n                  Fannie, Freddie Dole Out Big Bonuses\n\n                   (By Josh Boak and Joseph Williams)\n\n       The Obama administration's efforts to fix the housing \n     crisis may have fallen well short of helping millions of \n     distressed mortgage holders, but they have led to seven-\n     figure paydays for some top executives at troubled mortgage \n     giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n       The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the government \n     regulator for Fannie and Freddie, approved $12.79 million in \n     bonus pay after 10 executives from the two government-\n     sponsored corporations last year met modest performance \n     targets tied to modifying mortgages in jeopardy of \n     foreclosure.\n       The executives got the bonuses about two years after the \n     federally backed mortgage giants received nearly $170 billion \n     in taxpayer bailouts--and despite pledges by FHFA, the office \n     tasked with keeping them solvent, that it would adjust the \n     level of CEO-level pay after critics slammed huge \n     compensation packages paid out to former Fannie Mae CEO \n     Franklin Raines and others.\n       Securities and Exchange Commission documents show that Ed \n     Haldeman, who announced last week that he is stepping down as \n     Freddie Mac's CEO, received a base salary of $900,000 last \n     year yet took home an additional $2.3 million in bonus pay. \n     Records show other Fannie and Freddie executives got similar \n     Wall Street-style compensation packages; Fannie Mae CEO \n     Michael Williams, for example, got $2.37 million in \n     performance bonuses.\n       Including Haldeman, the top five officers at Freddie banked \n     a combined $6.46 million in performance pay alone last year, \n     though a second bonus installment for 2010 has yet to be \n     reported to the SEC, according to agency records. Williams \n     and others at Fannie pocketed $6.33 million in incentives for \n     what SEC records describe as meeting the primary goal of \n     providing ``liquidity, stability and affordability'' to the \n     national market.\n       ``Freddie Mac has done a considerable amount on behalf of \n     the American taxpayers to support the housing finance market \n     since entering into conservatorship,'' Freddie spokesman \n     Michael Cosgrove, told POLITICO on Monday. ``We're providing \n     mortgage funding and continuous liquidity to the market. \n     Together with Fannie Mae, we've funded the large majority of \n     the nation's residential loans. We're insisting on \n     responsible lending.''\n       A Fannie Mae spokesman said it is currently in a ``quiet \n     period'' in advance of its third-quarter earnings report and \n     declined to comment.\n       Most analysts believe the financial implosion of 2008 was \n     fueled in part by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's zeal in \n     promoting homeownership and their backing of risky loans. And \n     critics say that the mortgage giants' deep backlog of \n     repossessed homes, and their struggle through government \n     conservatorship, is a staggering weight on a weak economy and \n     puts even more downward pressure on home values.\n       ``Fannie and Freddie executives are being paid millions to \n     manage losses,'' Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a longtime \n     critic of the administration's programs to rescue the housing \n     market, told POLITICO. ``By these same standards, I should be \n     the starting forward for the Lakers. It's completely \n     absurd.''\n       ``It is outrageous that senior executives at Fannie and \n     Freddie are receiving multimillion-dollar compensation \n     packages when they now rely on funding from U.S. taxpayers, \n     many of whom face foreclosure or whose homes are \n     underwater,'' Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who has led \n     House Democrats in efforts to ease Fannie and Freddie's \n     restrictions on restructuring loans or lowering payments for \n     mortgage holders who owe more than their homes are worth, \n     wrote in an email.\n       Compensation at Fannie and Freddie is, in fact, 40 percent \n     below pre-government takeover levels, according to the FHFA, \n     though those pay packages before conservatorship involved \n     stock awards, while the current payments are exclusively \n     cash. But compensation at both corporations, in particular \n     Fannie Mae, has been a contentious issue since long before \n     the 2008 financial meltdown, thanks to executives like Daniel \n     Mudd, who earned $12.2 million in base pay and bonuses while \n     heading Fannie, and Richard Syron, Freddie's CEO, who \n     pocketed $19.8 million in total compensation the year before \n     the organization went into conservatorship.\n       Both Fannie and Freddie have long argued that they have to \n     offer Wall Street-size paychecks to compete for the best \n     private-sector talent. House Financial Services Committee \n     Chairman Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) introduced a bill in April \n     to place the executives on a government pay scale, but it has \n     yet to move out of committee.\n       A March report by FHFA's inspector general, however, found \n     the agency ``lacks key controls necessary to monitor'' \n     executive compensation, nor has it developed written \n     procedures for evaluating those packages.\n       FHFA's acting director, Edward J. DeMarco, told Congress \n     last year that the managers who were at the helms of the \n     mortgage companies during the market collapse were dismissed \n     but also argued that generous pay helps lure ``experienced, \n     qualified'' executives able to manage upward of $5 trillion \n     in mortgage holdings amid market turmoil.\n       DeMarco told lawmakers he's concerned that suggestions to \n     apply ``a federal pay system to nonfederal employees'' could \n     put the companies in jeopardy of mismanagement and result in \n     another taxpayer bailout. He said the compensation packages \n     at Fannie and Freddie are part of the plan to return them to \n     solvency while reducing costs to taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\n       An FHFA representative said the agency is installing pay \n     package recommendations outlined in the report. Currently, \n     she wrote, the agency ``carefully reviews all executive \n     officer pay requests and considers suitability and \n     comparability with market practice, after consulting with the \n     Treasury Department in certain circumstances.''\n       Since both companies' stock is worthless, bonuses are paid \n     in cash, deferred bonuses and incentive pay rather than stock \n     options. A key factor in determining those bonuses is how \n     Fannie and Freddie performed in the loan modification program \n     created by the administration, in addition to measures tied \n     to financial and accounting objectives.\n       For example, Freddie Mac helped a mere 160,000 homeowners \n     change their mortgages ``in support'' of the president's Home \n     Affordable Modification Program and contacted only 45 percent \n     of eligible borrowers, according to SEC filings. The company \n     itself has modified 134,282 of its own loans since the start \n     of the program. Those measures determined a significant \n     share--35 percent--of deferred bonus salary and, to a lesser \n     extent, ``target incentives'' for Freddie executives.\n       Fannie, which was involved in modifying 400,000 mortgages \n     last year, also assessed executive payments based in part on \n     how it administered HAMP.\n       President Barack Obama in the past has derided Wall Street \n     ``fat cats'' for raking in seven-figure bonuses even though \n     their banks and finance companies needed billions of dollars \n     in government bailouts just to stay in business. Yet the \n     White House so far has remained largely silent about \n     comparable bonuses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n       The congressional criticism over compensation follows other \n     charges that DeMarco has been unwilling to throw a lifeline \n     to homeowners plunged underwater when the market collapsed.\n       The government-sponsored firms have essentially filled the \n     vacuum caused by an exodus from private lenders. But critics \n     want the FHFA to embrace ``principal write-downs,'' in which \n     lenders and, by extension, Fannie and Freddie, would have to \n     forgive a significant portion of homeowners' outstanding \n     mortgages; the move, they argue, would be a major step toward \n     restoring housing market stability and boosting the economy \n     but would force the two companies to accept red ink on their \n     balance sheets.\n       DeMarco has resisted plans to modify troubled mortgages, \n     insisting it wasn't part of his legal mandate to bring Fannie \n     and Freddie to fiscal stability.\n       Both HAMP and a similar program, Home Affordable Refinance \n     Program, were seen as having the potential to modify at least \n     3 million government-backed mortgages and refinance 4 million \n     others. The results were disappointing, however: Just 1.7 \n     million borrowers have been helped since the programs were \n     launched two years ago.\n       Last week, the White House announced a plan to relax \n     restrictions for the HARP refinance program, which lets \n     homeowners in good standing refinance their mortgages at \n     current rock-bottom interest rates. DeMarco, whom aides say \n     had been studying a similar proposal, gave the plan his \n     blessing--a rare point of agreement between him and the Obama \n     administration.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. For decades, the American taxpayer has been the victim of \noutright corruption and blatant abuse at the hands of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. There have been countless warnings over the mismanagement \nof both Freddie and Fannie over the years. In May 2006, after a 27-\nmonth investigation into the corrupt corporate culture and accounting \npractices at Fannie Mae, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \nOversight, the Federal regulator which oversees Fannie Mae, issued a \nblistering 348-page report which stated in part that ``Fannie Mae \nsenior management promoted an image of the enterprise as one of the \nlowest-risk financial institutions in the world, as ``best in class'' \nin terms of risk management financial reporting, internal control, and \ncorporate governance. The findings in this report show that risks at \nFannie Mae are greatly understated and the image was false.\n  During the period covered by that report, Fannie Mae reported \nextremely smooth profit growth and had announced targets for earnings \nper share precisely each quarter. Those achievements were illusions \ndeliberately and systematically created by the enterprise's senior \nmanagement with the aid of inappropriate accounting and improper \nearnings management.\n  A large number of Fannie Mae's accounting policies and practices did \nnot comply with generally accepted accounting principles. The \nenterprise also had serious problems with internal control and \ncorporate governance. These errors resulted in Fannie Mae overstating \nreported income and capital by a currently estimated $10.6 billion.\n  By deliberately and intentionally manipulating accounting to hit \nearnings targets, senior management maximized the bonuses and other \nexecutive compensation they received at the expense of the \nshareholders. Earnings management made a significant contribution to \nthe compensation of Fannie Mae chairman CEO Franklin Raines, which \ntotaled--Franklin Raines' bonus totaled over $90 million from 1998 \nthrough 2003. Of that total, over $52 million was directly tied to \nachieving earnings per share targets, which turned out to be totally \nfalse.\n  The list goes on and on. Mr. President, I recommend to my colleagues, \nbefore I go too much further, this book. The title is ``Reckless \nEndangerment,'' by Gretchen Morgenson, who happens to be a columnist \nand writer for the New York Times, and Joshua Rosner. ``How Outside \nAmbition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon.''\n  In this book it points the finger directly at Fannie and Freddie. I \nwill quote one part of it:\n\n       Because bonuses at Fannie Mae were largely based on per \n     share earnings growth, it was paramount to keep profits \n     escalating to guarantee bonus payouts. And in 1998, top \n     Fannie officials had begun manipulating the company's results \n     by dipping into various profit cookie jars to produce the \n     level of income necessary to generate bonus payouts to top \n     management.\n       Federal investigators later found that you could predict \n     what Fannie's earnings-per-share would be at year-end, almost \n     to the penny, if you knew the maximum earnings-per-share \n     bonus payout target set by management at the beginning of \n     each year. Between 1998 and 2002, actual earnings and the \n     bonus payout target differed only by a fraction of the cent, \n     the investigators found.\n       Investigators uncovered documents from 1998 detailing the \n     tactics used by Leanne Spencer, a finance official at Fannie, \n     to make the company's $2.48 per-share bonus payout target. \n     That year, Fannie Mae earned $2.4764 per share.\n       In a mid-November memo to her superiors, Spencer forecast \n     that the company was on track to earn $2.4744 per share, just \n     shy of what was needed to generate maximum bonus payments to \n     executives. She described various ways she could juice the \n     company's profits if need be.\n\n  It goes on and on, and then it says this:\n\n       That month, Thomas Nides, Fannie's executive vice president \n     for human resources, warned a swath of top managers that \n     earnings growth was coming in weak as the year-end \n     approached.\n       ``You know that as a management group member, you help \n     drive the performance of the company,'' Nides wrote in a \n     memo. ``That's why your total compensation is tied to how \n     well Fannie Mae does each year.\n\n  In other words, he was jacking them up, telling them that they have \nto cook the books some more.\n  It says:\n\n       The memo achieved the desired result. Fannie Mae executives \n     wound up exceeding their target in 1998 by accounting \n     improperly for low-income housing tax credits the company \n     received. The result: 547 people shared in $27.1 million in \n     bonuses. This was a record--the bonuses represented 0.79 \n     percent of Fannie Mae's after-tax profits, more than ever \n     before in the company's history.\n\n  The list goes on and on. By the way, executive pay at Fannie Mae was \na well-kept secret, and the company successfully blocked some in \nCongress, such as Congressman Richard Baker of Louisiana, from \nreceiving information about salaries and bonuses paid by the company. \nIt was only after Fannie was caught cooking its books that details of \nthe lavish pay came out.\n  The accounting fraud went undiscovered until 2005, when an \ninvestigation by OFHEO unearthed it in a voluminous and detailed 2006 \nreport. OFHEO noted that if Fannie Mae had used the appropriate \naccounting methods in 1998, the company's performance would have \ngenerated no executive bonuses at all. Although a highly kept secret at \nthe time, Johnson's bonus for 1998 was $1.9 million. Investigators \nreturned and it later emerged that the company made inaccurate \ndisclosures when it said Johnson earned a total of almost $7 million in \n1998. In actuality, his total compensation that year was more like $21 \nmillion.\n  None of these people, to my knowledge, have ever been punished--ever. \nIt is one of the great scandals of our time. What steps were taken by \nCongress at that time to punish Fannie Mae? None.\n  According to published reports, including Fannie Mae's own news \nrelease, Daniel Mudd, the President and CEO of Fannie Mae at the time, \nwas awarded over $14.4 million in 2006 and over $12.2 million in 2007 \nin salary, bonuses, and stock, and Fannie Mae continued their risky \nbehavior, successfully posting profits of $4.1 billion in 2006.\n  Well, I fully understand that the corrupt individuals who cooked the \nbooks\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\nin order to meet the targets necessary for maximum executive \ncompensation are no longer in place at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For \nthat, we can be thankful. But let's be clear about one thing: the \nstructure for executive bonuses remains in place. There is \nstill incentives for executives at Fannie and Freddie to meet certain \ngoals in order to be rewarded with millions of dollars in bonuses.\n\n  I am not suggesting that either one of these GSEs is using fraudulent \naccounting methods, but the taxpayer remains at risk if an unscrupulous \nindividual or a group of individuals decides to put their own self-\ninterests above that of the American people. It has happened at Fannie \nand Freddie before, and it can happen again. It is unconscionable.\n  It has been proven time and again that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are \nsynonymous with mismanagement, waste, and outright corruption and \nfraud, and their Federal regulator had the audacity to approve $12.8 \nmillion in executive bonuses to people who make $900,000 a year. This \nbody should be ashamed if we let this happen again, especially in these \ntough economic times.\n  Every day more and more Americans are losing their jobs and their \nhomes, and we are allowing these people to take home annual salaries of \n$900,000 and bonuses of $12.8 million, all while they ask the taxpayers \nfor $6 billion more in bailout money.\n  Many of my colleagues sent a letter to Edward DeMarco, the Acting \nDirector of the FHFA, asking for an explanation for his decision to \naward millions in bonuses to executives at Fannie and Freddie. In his \nresponse, Mr. DeMarco echoed what has become an increasingly popular \ntheme used to defend the big payouts. Essentially, Mr. DeMarco argues \nthat in order to get the best people in place, we need to pay them \noutrageous amounts of taxpayer dollars. Well, I don't buy that \nargument.\n  It is ridiculous to tell the American taxpayer: Look, we lost \nhundreds of billions of your money, so we need to pay these smart guys \nmillions of dollars of your money so that we don't lose the rest of \nyour money. The American people are smart enough to see through that \nsham logic and they are angry.\n  As I have previously stated on the Senate floor, I find it hard to \nbelieve that we cannot find talented people with the skills necessary \nto manage Fannie and Freddie for good money--$900,000--without the \nincentive of multimillion-dollar bonuses. There are many examples of \nintelligent, well-qualified, patriotic individuals working in our \nFederal Government who make significantly less than the top executives \nat Fannie and Freddie, with just as much responsibility.\n  For example, the basic pay for a four-star general is $179,700. \nIncluding the basic allowance for housing, that figure rises to \n$214,980. Chief Justice Roberts makes $223,500 a year. The President's \nCabinet Members make $199,700 a year. Today, to add a little insult to \ninjury--or a lot of insult to injury--here is today's story from NPR.\n\n       Freddie Mac, the taxpayer-owned mortgage giant, has placed \n     multibillion-dollar bets that pay off if homeowners stay \n     trapped in expensive mortgages with interest rates well above \n     current rates.\n\n  This is the same outfit we are paying all this money to in these \nbonuses; so they decided to bet against the homeowners of America.\n\n       Freddie began increasing these bets dramatically in late \n     2010, the same time that the company was making it harder for \n     homeowners to get out of such high-interest mortgages.\n       No evidence has emerged that these decisions were \n     coordinated. The company is a key gatekeeper for home loans \n     but says its traders are ``walled off'' from the officials \n     who have restricted homeowners from taking advantage of \n     historically low interest rates by imposing higher fees and \n     new rules.\n       Freddie's charter calls for the company to make home loans \n     more accessible. Its chief executive, Charles Haldeman, Jr., \n     recently told Congress that his company is ``helping \n     financially strapped families reduce their mortgage costs \n     through refinancing their mortgages.''\n       But the trades, uncovered for the first time in an \n     investigation by ProPublica and NPR, give Freddie a powerful \n     incentive to do the opposite, highlighting a conflict of \n     interest at the heart of the company.\n\n  Do we need this company around? Can't we find something better?\n\n       In addition to being an instrument of government policy \n     dedicated to making home loans more accessible, Freddie also \n     has giant investment portfolios and could lose substantial \n     amounts of money if too many borrowers refinance. . . . \n     Freddie Mac's trades, while perfectly legal, came during a \n     period when the company was supposed to be reducing its \n     investment portfolio, according to the terms of its \n     government takeover agreement. But these trades escalate the \n     risk of its portfolio, because the securities Freddie has \n     purchased are volatile and hard to sell, mortgage securities \n     experts say.\n       The financial crisis in 2008 was made worse when Wall \n     Street traders made bets against their customers and the \n     American people. Now, some see similar behavior, only this \n     time by traders at a government-owned company who are using \n     leverage, which increases the potential profits but also the \n     risk of big losses, and other Wall Street strategums. ``More \n     than three years into the government takeover, we have \n     Freddie Mac pursuing highly levered, complicated transactions \n     seemingly with the purpose of trading against homeowners,'' \n     says Mayer. ``These are the kinds of things that got us into \n     trouble in the first place.''\n\n  You can't make it up. So it seems to me that the first thing we ought \nto do, as I and others have recommended, is get these GSEs on the track \nto going out of business as quickly as possible. Their track record is \noutrageous. The second thing, let's not give millions of dollars in \nbonuses to people who are betting against the homeowners of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will shortly be offering, as an \namendment, an amendment to the substitute. It will be on behalf of \nmyself and Senator John Cornyn. I will ask consent in a moment to \nsuggest the absence of a quorum but, upon the rescission of the absence \nof a quorum, that I be recognized for up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1483 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n     (Purpose: To deter public corruption, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am soon going to offer an amendment to \nthe substitute. I am going to offer it on behalf of myself and Senator \nCornyn.\n  I hear Senators saying that with the public's opinion of Congress at \na low point, we need to take action to restore public confidence. I \nthink our amendment does that by closing loopholes in the laws that \nhave allowed corruption to escape accountability.\n  I believe we have to provide investigators and prosecutors the tools \nthey need to hold officials at all levels of government accountable \nwhen they act corruptly.\n  This amendment, which reflects a bipartisan, bicameral agreement, \nwill strengthen and clarify key aspects of Federal criminal law and \nhelp investigators and prosecutors attack public corruption nationwide.\n  I should note, the Senate Judiciary Committee has reported this bill \nwith bipartisan support in three successive Congresses, and I would \nnote that the House Judiciary Committee, under a Republican chairman, \nrecently reported a companion bill and did so unanimously. Every \nRepublican and every Democrat voted for it. So I believe it is time for \nCongress to pass serious anticorruption legislation. We have \ndemonstrated that this is something that could bring both Republicans \nand Democrats together, and we ought to pass it.\n  Public corruption erodes the trust the American people have in those \nwho are given the privilege--and it is a privilege--of public service. \nToo often, loopholes in existing laws have meant corrupt conduct can go \nunchecked. The stain of corruption has spread to all levels of \ngovernment, and that victimizes every American by chipping away at the \nfoundation of our democracy. The amendment, I believe, will help to \nrestore confidence in government by rooting out criminal corruption. It \nincludes a fix to reverse a major step backward in the fight against \ncrime and corruption.\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\n  In Skilling v. United States, the Supreme Court sided with a former \nexecutive from Enron and greatly narrowed the honest services fraud \nstatute, a law that has actually been used for decades in both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations as a crucial weapon to combat \npublic corruption and self-dealing. Unfortunately, whether intended, \nthe Court's decision leaves corrupt conduct unchecked. Most notably, \nthe Court's decision would leave open the opportunity for State and \nFederal public officials to secretly act in their own financial self-\ninterest rather than in the interest of the public.\n  The amendment Senator Cornyn and I have put together would close this \ngaping hole in our anticorruption laws. It includes several other \nprovisions designed to tighten existing law. It fixes the gratuities \nstatute to make clear that while the vast majority of public officials \nare honest, those who are not cannot be bought. It reaffirms that \npublic officials may not accept anything worth more than $1,000, other \nthan what is permitted by existing rules and regulations, given to them \nbecause of their official positions. It also appropriately clarifies \nthe definition of what it means for a public official to perform an \nofficial act under the bribery statute. It will increase sentences for \nserious corruption offenses. It will provide investigators and \nprosecutors more time to pursue these challenging and complex cases. It \namends several key statutes to clarify their application in corruption \ncases to prevent corrupt public officials and their accomplices from \nevading prosecution based on legal ambiguities.\n  If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct \nwe have seen in some of these high-profile corruption cases, then let's \nenact meaningful legislation. Let's give investigators and prosecutors \nthe tools they need to enforce our laws. It is one thing to have a law \non the books; it is another to have the tools to enforce it. So I hope \nthis bipartisan amendment will be adopted.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, what is the regular order, may I ask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment No. 1483 by \nSenator Leahy to S. 2038.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. So we are on the STOCK Act and \nSenator Leahy has introduced this amendment, which I appreciate that he \nhas done that. This underlying bill, as we said yesterday, responds to \nthe concern about whether Members of Congress and our staffs are \ncovered by insider trading laws; that is, laws that prohibit a person \nfrom using nonpublic information for private profit.\n  I suppose most of us here believed we have always been covered by \ninsider trading laws. There were some questions raised about that at \nthe end of last year. In fact, our committee held a hearing on two \nbills offered, one by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the other \nby Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, on this question, and we had \nsome broadly respected, credible experts on securities law who said in \nfact there might be a question about Members of Congress, whether \nMembers of Congress and our staffs were covered by Securities and \nExchange Commission law and regulation on insider trading for a reason \nthat would only make sense to lawyers and therefore may not be sensible \nbut I will mention it anyway.\n  It is that the law relating to insider trading is actually the result \nnot of a specific statute prohibiting insider trading, it is the result \nof regulations and enforcement actions by the SEC pursuant to antifraud \nprovisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n  In these regulations that have become the law of insider trading, a \nnecessary element for prosecution for violating insider trading laws is \nthe breach of a duty of trust, of a fiduciary duty. The law professors \ntold us at our hearing at the end of last year that in fact one might \nraise the question of whether Members of Congress had a duty of trust \nas defined in insider trading cases, which is more typically the duty \nof trust that a corporate executive, for instance, has to stockholders. \nI presume that most Members of Congress would say of course we have a \nduty of trust, we have a very high duty of trust to our country, to our \nconstituents. But it is, apparently, in the contemplation of securities \nlaw, perhaps not covered by the existing definitions, so this bill \nmakes clear that Members of Congress and our staffs are covered by \ninsider trading laws.\n  We cannot derive personal profit from using nonpublic information \nthat we gain as a result of our public offices. That is made absolutely \nclear by stating that indeed we do have a duty of trust to the \nCongress, to the government of the United States and, most importantly, \nto our constituents, to the people who were good enough to send us \nhere.\n  I do believe that provision gives us an opportunity to take a step \nforward. It is going to take a lot more than one step to rebuild the \ntrust and confidence that the American people have lost at this moment \nin our history in Congress and in our overall Federal Government.\n  There are two other very important provisions. One requires Members \nof Congress and our staffs to file a statement within 30 days of any \ntransaction, purchase, or sale of a stock or other security with the \nSenate--and that would immediately go on line, as will now, as a result \nof this legislation, the annual financial disclosure statements that we \nfile. Incidentally, these statements are now available to the public \nbut you have to go to the office here in the Senate to get them and \ncopy them. That is out of date and not consistent with the general \nprinciples of transparency and disclosure that I think people rightly \nexpect of Congress today.\n  Our bill makes clear that both the annual statements and the 30-day \nstatements have to be filed on line. That should help provide the \ntransparency that the SEC itself has said--in testimony before the \nHouse of Representatives on this bill or one quite similar to it--would \nassist them, the SEC, in guarding against insider trading by Members of \nCongress or our staffs; that is, that the regular reporting, the 30-day \nreporting and the on-line reporting, would assist them in preventing \ninsider trading.\n  I know there are a lot of amendments filed; actually, thankfully, not \ntoo many, but a significant number. Seeing the presence of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, I hope he may be here to take up one of his amendments. \nObviously we would all like to begin to debate the amendments and have \nsome votes.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maine, Senator Collins.\n\n[[Page S188]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Oklahoma offers \nhis amendment--and I will not take a great deal of time in my \ncomments--I want to respond to some questions that many of our \ncolleagues have raised about the reporting requirements in this bill. \nOne of my colleagues, for example, has asked if a change in a Member's \nor staff's allocation in the Thrift Savings Program would be required \nto be reported under this bill. It would not. It is not required to be \nreported under the annual financial disclosure and it is not required \nunder this bill.\n  A second of our colleagues has brought up a question of how would \nmutual funds be treated. Again, I would say that the treatment is not \nchanged by this bill, other than the time period. Under this bill, as \nunder the annual financial disclosure forms, qualified investment \nfunds--those are the widely available mutual funds that are exempt from \ntrades being disclosed--would be exempt under this bill as well.\n  As with our annual financial disclosures, you still list the fund and \nthe amount of assets in categories for those funds, but you indicate \nthat they are a qualified exempt fund and there is no requirement for \ntrying to figure out what the trades are within that fund.\n  I mention these two examples because I fear there is some \nmisinformation about the bill that is circulating. There is a \nlegitimate dispute over whether 30 days is too short a time, whether \nthe 90-day period in the original bill is better, which is my own \npreference. But the fact is that the information that is being reported \nis not being changed. The issue is how often it is reported. The \ninquiries from my colleagues about the implications for the Thrift \nSavings Plan allocations and for qualified exempt investment funds, \nwidely held mutual funds, remain the same. They are reported, the \ncategory of the investment, the amount is reported, but the individual \ntrades within the fund are not reported.\n\n  I apologize for surprising the Senator from Connecticut with this \ninquiry, and hope he will forgive me for that, but I would, through the \nChair, pose a question to the Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of \nthe committee, as to whether his understanding is the same as mine with \nregard to the Thrift Savings Plan and qualified mutual funds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Collins for \nmaking these points because there is concern about this particular part \nof the bill. There is a lot of misinformation around. I totally agree \nwith her interpretation, which is that the reporting on the 30-day \nbasis in the bill will not change what is reported and therefore both \ntransactions within Thrift Savings Plan accounts and in qualified \nmutual funds will not have to be reported. I thank my colleague for \nclarifying that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague and friend from Connecticut, the \nchairman of the committee.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing us to pose a question through \nthe Chair. I hope our colleagues have heard this exchange, this \ncolloquy, which clarifies what appears to be a rather widespread \nmisunderstanding about the reach of this bill. As I said, the 30-day \nissue is a different issue, a legitimate dispute as to whether that is \ntoo aggressive. We have some colleagues who think it should be a 10-day \nreporting period and an amendment has been filed to implement that. I \npersonally prefer the 90 days in the original bill. I think that is \nmore realistic. But the fact is there is a lot of misinformation and \nquestions regarding what is reported. I appreciate the clarification \nfrom the Senator, the chairman of the committee.\n  At this point I yield to Senator Coburn for the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as my colleagues are no doubt aware, I \nstand in opposition to this bill, not because I think we should have \ninsider trading. As a physician I am trained to fix the real problem \nand you are treating the symptoms. Several months ago, CBS did a series \nand showed some questionable, not necessarily insider trading, stock \ntransactions, which, given the low level of confidence by the American \npublic in this institution, have raised the question: What about \ninsider trading?\n  I honestly believe everyone in our body is never going to use insider \ntrading to advantage themselves over the best interests of our country. \nBut the real problem is the confidence in the Congress to do what is in \nthe best long-term interest of the country. The reason the confidence \nis not there doesn't have anything to do with insider trading as we \nwould normally think about it. It has to do with insider trading that \nwe do not normally think about, as to how we sell a vote to get \nsomething else on the next vote, how we trade a position, how we saw \npositions were bought and sold on the health care bill. Whether it be \nthe Cornhusker Kickback or the Florida Gator-aid, whatever it was, the \nfact is the American people saw behavior of Members of Congress doing \nthings that were politically expedient rather than what is in the long-\nterm best interest of our country. That is the real insider trading \nscandal we ought to be addressing.\n  How do we do that? The way we address that is bring to the floor \nbills that actually address the problems our country is having today. \nEvery second of every day this year our Government will spend $121,000. \nWe will borrow $52,000 a second every day. We are not addressing any of \nthat in the Senate. We did not all last year and we are not this year. \nThe real problem in front of our country is America does not see a \nCongress that is willing to address the real issues and make the hard \nchoices.\n  Hard choices are coming. We will make those choices ultimately. Some \nof us will not be here. But the longer we delay in making those very \ndifficult choices--such as saving Medicare, such as saving Social \nSecurity, such as reforming the Tax Code to stimulate economic activity \nand create job opportunities for Americans--that is what they want us \ndoing.\n  The other thing I will mention is I was one of two people who voted \nagainst the last ethics law. I ask my colleagues, did we improve the \nSenate with the last ethics law? Will we improve the quality of \nrepresentation with this law? I do not think so. I think what we are \ndoing is playing a political game to say we are all guilty, now we have \nto prove that we are not. That is not what our system of law is built \non. Our system of law is built on the fact innocent until we are proven \nguilty. The assumption that the Senate is undertaking now is that some \nof our colleagues are doing insider trading on the stock market. \nNothing could be further from the truth. The real insider trading is \nthe horse-trading that goes on in this body that is not always in the \nbest interest of the country. This legislation is not about to earn \nback the trust of the American people.\n\n  The SEC and the Ethics Committee already have the power to \ninvestigate inside trading abuses. Yearly we fill out a report saying: \nLet's deem every trade we have made. If it is true what the chairman of \nthe committee said that what the SEC would like to do is have it more \nrefined so they can have better access, then that ought to be the bill \nwe bring forward. We ought to bring forward a bill that says: No. 1, we \nare under the laws of the SEC, section 10b, and we are. We don't hear \nthat said anywhere, but we are. If our intent is to bring forward a \nbill to fix the potential for insider trading, then that is what we \nought to be doing. But the assumption we are guilty first and have to \nprove we are not by making a notification every 30 days of any trade \nthat somebody makes for us--we may not have even been involved, but we \nhave a fiduciary that we asked to trade for us, and then we are going \nto have to make that representation.\n  Has anybody asked the question: What happens if you do have inside \ninformation, have no involvement whatsoever in a trade because you put \nit in a trust account for yourself, but it is still being traded and \nthey happen to coordinate at the same time? Are you guilty of insider \ntrading or are you going to spend $50,000 to $100,000 proving that you \nare not guilty?\n  This is a fine institution. It can be better, but it is best when it \nfixes the real problems, not the symptoms of the problems.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1473 to amendment No. 1470\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be\n\n[[Page S189]]\n\nset aside and that amendment No. 1473 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma, [Mr. Coburn], for himself, Mr. \n     Udall of Colorado, Mr. McCain, Mr. Burr, Mrs. McCaskill, and \n     Mr. Paul, proposes an amendment numbered 1473.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prevent the creation of duplicative and overlapping \n                           Federal programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

(a) It shall not be in order in the Senate to proceed \n     to any bill or joint resolution unless the committee of \n     jurisdiction has prepared and posted on the committee website \n     an overlapping and duplicative programs analysis and \n     explanation for the bill or joint resolution as described in \n     subparagraph (b) prior to proceeding.\n       ``(b) The analysis and explanation required by this \n     subparagraph shall contain--\n       ``(1) an analysis by the Congressional Research Service to \n     determine if the bill or joint resolution creates any new \n     Federal program, office, or initiative that would duplicate \n     or overlap any existing Federal program, office, or \n     initiative with similar mission, purpose, goals, or \n     activities along with a listing of all of the overlapping or \n     duplicative Federal program or programs, office or offices, \n     or initiative or initiatives; and\n       ``(2) an explanation provided by the committee as to why \n     the creation of each new program, office, or initiative is \n     necessary if a similar program or programs, office or \n     offices, or initiative or initiatives already exist.\n       ``(c) This paragraph may be waived by joint agreement of \n     the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of the Senate \n     upon their certification that such waiver is necessary as a \n     result of--\n       ``(1) a significant disruption to Senate facilities or to \n     the availability of the Internet; or\n       ``(2) an emergency as determined by the leaders.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a bipartisan amendment. This amendment is \nsponsored by Senator McCain, Senator McCaskill, Senator Udall from \nColorado, Senator Burr, and Senator Paul, as well as myself.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. We have asked for this multiple \ntimes but have not gotten it. What this amendment says is, every bill \nthat comes before Congress and to be considered by the Senate should \ndetermine whether it is duplicating something that is already happening \nin the Federal Government. It is common sense, and all we are saying is \nto have an analysis by the CRS, Congressional Research Service, to \ndetermine if the bill creates a new Federal program, office, or \ninitiative that would duplicate or overlap any existing Federal \nprogram, Federal office, or initiative with a similar mission, similar \npurpose, similar goal or activities along with a listing of all the \noverlapping duplicative Federal programs or offices or initiatives or \ninitiative.\n  Now, why is that important? Last February the GAO brought to us the \nfirst third of the Federal Government and outlined to us $200 billion \nworth of spending on duplicate programs. They gave it to us. It was \nheld as a great thing. Now we know we have all of these areas: 82 \nteacher-training programs, 47 job-training programs, 56 financial \nliteracy programs, and on and on. They brought that to us, and we all \nsaid that was good. The problem is we didn't do anything about it. If \nwe want to restore confidence in the Congress, do something about the \nproblems that have been identified already.\n  This is a good government policy that says before we act on a new \nbill that we actually will know what we are doing, and we will have \nchecked with CRS, and they will tell us if we are duplicating again \nsomething that is already happening now.\n  One of the other amendments we should pass is to have every agency \ngive us their list of programs every year. Do you realize there is only \none agency in the Federal Government, one department, that actually \nknows all their programs? There is only one. It is the Department of \nEducation. They are the only ones we can go to and find a list of all \nof their programs. The rest of them don't know it. There is no catalog. \nThey have no idea.\n  So before we pass a new piece of legislation, we ought to at least \nhave the help of the Congressional Research Service, and we ought to \npass good legislation that doesn't duplicate. It may be a well-\nintentioned piece of legislation, but because we, as a Congress, have \nfailed in our oversight responsibility, we don't know that it is \nduplicative when we bring it to the floor and pass it in the Senate.\n  All I am asking is, let's do a doublecheck, especially in the time of \ntrillion-dollar deficits. We ought to do a doublecheck and make sure we \nare not duplicating something that is already happening.\n  That is important for a second reason: If we don't know we are \nduplicating something, that means we are not ``oversighting'' what is \noccurring right now, the program or the office or the initiative that \nis out there now, if we don't have knowledge of it. Rather than create \na new program, it might give us the opportunity to fix one that was \nwell-intentioned but is not working.\n  So this is a good government amendment that is bipartisan that says: \nLet's do this before we pass additional legislation. But let's know \nwhat we are doing. It is complete and it is thorough. It also will \nprovide greater transparency for both us and taxpayers regarding the \nimpact of the legislation we are passing.\n  Some may say: What if we have an emergency? This has a clause in it \nthat says if it is an emergency, that requirement is waived. So if in \nthe case of an emergency we need to do something, we will waive the \nrequirement that we have to look at CRS to see if there are \nduplications. So it is a commonsense amendment. I would hope my \ncolleagues will support it, and that we can, in fact, actually fix the \nreal problems not the symptoms of the disease.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1474 to amendment No. 1470\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the current amendment \nthat is pending be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 1474.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma, [Mr. Coburn], for himself and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 1474.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that all legislation be placed online for 72 hours \n           before it is voted on by the Senate or the House)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. AVAILABILITY OF LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSE AND \n                   SENATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in the Senate or \n     the House of Representatives to proceed to any legislative \n     matter unless the legislative matter has been publically \n     available on the Internet as provided in subsection (b) in \n     searchable form 72 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and \n     holidays except when the Senate or the House of \n     Representatives is in session on such a day) prior to \n     proceeding.\n       (b) Availability.--With respect to the requirements of \n     subsection (a), the legislative matter shall be available on \n     the official website of the committee with jurisdiction\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\n     over the subject matter of the legislative matter.\n       (c) Waiver and Suspension.--\n       (1) In the senate.--The provisions of this section may be \n     waived in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of two-\n     thirds of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) In the house.--The provisions of this section may be \n     waived in the House of Representatives only by a rule or \n     order proposing only to waive such provisions by an \n     affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members, duly chosen \n     and sworn.\n       (3) Point of order protection.--In the House of \n     Representatives, it shall not be in order to consider a rule \n     or order that waives the application of paragraph (2).\n       (4) Motion to suspend.--It shall not be in order for the \n     Speaker to entertain a motion to suspend the application of \n     this section under clause 1 of rule XV of the Rules of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (d) Legislative Matter.--In this section, the term \n     ``legislative matter'' means any bill, joint resolution, \n     concurrent resolution, conference report, or substitute \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is another good government amendment. \nIf we want to restore confidence, this is something we should do. It \nsays before we vote on a bill, we are going to have at least 72 hours \nto read it. It is going to be available online with a CBO score so that \nwhen we cast a vote, we actually know what we are casting a vote on and \nwe actually know how much it costs. It just says it has to be online \nfor 72 hours.\n  In other words, we get the privilege of reading the bills we are \nvoting on, and we also get the privilege of knowing the financial costs \nof the bill or at least an estimate of the financial cost and what that \nwill entail. This transparency is designed to make the Senate better. \nIf we want to build confidence with the American public, then the way \nwe build confidence is to assure them that we knew exactly what we were \ndoing when we cast a vote, not guessing at what the consequences and \nthe details of that legislation are.\n\n  For many pieces of legislation right now, what we have seen in the \nlast 2 or 3 years is there was no time given, no capability to study \nthe legislation to make improvements, and many of the pieces of \nlegislation came without the ability to modify it. If we cannot read \nthe legislation, then we cannot amend it. What does that tell us about \nthe legislative temperament and thoughtfulness of the Senate? We cannot \nread it, we don't have time to contemplate and consider it, and we \ncannot amend it even if we could. That doesn't have anything to do with \nthe Senate as it was designed and has functioned for the last 170 \nyears. It has everything to do with politics today rather than the best \nlong-term interests of the country.\n  Amendments like this have gained a large amount of bipartisan support \nand have had the support in the past when we voted on it, although we \nhave not acquired the 67 votes that have been necessary in the past to \npass it. The cosponsor of this amendment is Senator McCain. He \nunderstands the importance of reading what we pass. All of our \ncolleagues do. Why not put in the self-discipline that we have to \nrather than the political moment that says we have to vote on this \nwhether we know anything about it or not?\n  During the health care debate, eight of my colleagues sent a letter \nto review the health care legislation. They ultimately voted for the \nhealth care legislation. Their request was to give them 72 hours to \nread the legislation. The legislative text and complete budget scores \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office of the health care legislation \nconsidered on the Senate floor should be made available on a Web site \nthe public can access for at least 72 hours prior to the first vote to \nproceed to the legislation.\n  Why shouldn't the public be able to see what we are doing 72 hours \nbefore we do it? Just as important, why shouldn't we be able to know \nwhat we are doing before we vote so it is straightforward, commonsense, \nand transparent to the American public as well as to our colleagues in \nthe Senate that now we have the time available to read a piece of \nlegislation contemplated and hopefully have the opportunity to improve \nit. What is the goal? The best long-term outcome for the country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1476\n\n  Mr. President, I would ask that the pending amendment be set aside, \nand I call up amendment No. 1476.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma, [Mr. Coburn], proposes amendment \n     numbered 1476.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. MEMBER CERTIFICATION.\n\n       Section 102(a) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is \n     amended by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(9)(A) A statement (as provided in subparagraph (B)) \n     certifying that financial transactions included in the report \n     filed pursuant to section 101 (d) and (e) were not made on \n     the basis of non-public information.\n       ``(B) The certification required by this paragraph is as \n     follows: `I hereby certify that the financial transactions \n     reflected in this disclosure form were not made on the basis \n     of material, non-public information.' ''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment would provide a complete \nsubstitute for the STOCK Act. It requires Members and staff to certify \nthat they have not used inside information for private financial \nprofit. In other words, they are going to make an affirmative statement \nunder the law that they have not violated section 10b of the Securities \nand Exchange Act. All Members would be required to sign the following \nstatement on an annual financial disclosure form: I hereby certify that \nthe financial transactions reflected in this disclosure form were not \nmade on the basis of material nonpublic information.\n  The STOCK Act does not create new restrictions for Congress against \ninsider trading. We all know that. Those restrictions are there. There \nare no new restrictions. We don't change the restrictions at all. The \nSEC has stated that the Members of Congress and staff are already \nsubject to insider trading laws. They just need some clarity with that. \nThey also would like to have timeliness with that.\n  In fact, all Americans are subject to these laws, including the \nSenate, found primarily in section 10b. This provision restricts anyone \nwho trades stocks from using material nonpublic information to profit \nfinancially, and Congress is no different from anybody else.\n  The STOCK Act was carefully written to carefully reaffirm that \nCongress is not exempted from these laws, and I believe the chairman \nstated that just a moment ago, which we would include in this. As such, \nthe bill brings no new reforms to the table nor does it create any real \nexpectation that behavior will change. It just requires paperwork \nfiling. All Members and relevant staff should have to certify they are \nnot trading on private information.\n  Each year every Member and certain high-salaried staff are required \nto disclose their financial holdings. Senate rule 37 also already \nprohibits any Senator or staff from conflicts of interest. That would \nbe a conflict of interest. Specifically, rule 37 prohibits the receipt \nof compensation by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his \nposition as a Member or officer or employee.\n  So we are covered doubly. We are already covered under rule 37, and \nwe are covered under section 10b of the Securities and Exchange Act.\n  If, in fact, somebody fails to do this, then they will be liable \nunder the False Statements Act in title 18, section 1001, which makes \nit a crime to lie to Congress. Section 1001 prohibits anyone from \nknowingly and willfully making any material false, fictitious, or \nfraudulent statement to the government. The punishment for violating \nthe False Statements Act is a fine and a prison term up to 5 years. \nThis does not mean that someone who makes a good-faith effort but \nmistakenly forgets something will face punishment. Yet any Member who \nknowingly signs that form in error will be liable for making a false \nstatement on his or her finances, carrying large penalties.\n\n  I think efforts to reestablish trust in the Congress are important. I \ndisagree with my colleagues that this is one that will make a \ndifference. It won't. Nothing materially changes other than a paperwork \nrequirement. Nothing materially changes other than having to report \nevery 30 days instead of annually.\n  What is the real problem? The people of this country do not have \nconfidence in Congress because Congress does not address the real \nissues of the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank my friend from Oklahoma \nfor coming to the floor and introducing these three amendments. It \nbegins the process of considering the legislation.\n  I wish to go back to the first point he made, which I think is an \nimportant point--that we have to do a lot more than deal with the \nconcern that Members of Congress and our staffs are not covered by \ninsider trading laws to restore the confidence of the American people \nin this institution. It has taken a long time to get us as low as we \nare in public esteem today, and it is going to take a long time, I am \nafraid, to get back to it.\n  The first thing we can do is begin to work more across party lines to \nbe less partisan, to be less ideologically rigid. This institution \nrepresents people across the widest array of origins, of ideologies, of \npolitical policy beliefs, et cetera. We can't function without \ncompromise. When I say ``compromise,'' I don't mean a compromise of \nprinciple, I mean compromise in the sense that one can rarely in a \ndemocratic institution of this kind--small ``d''--get everything one \naspires to get on a particular piece of legislation. If a person gets \nhalf of what they are aspiring to or even more, hopefully, that is a \ngood result.\n  It reminds me of what my dad used to say about marriage, which was \nthat in a successful marriage a spouse felt they were giving in 70 \npercent of the time to the other spouse, and maybe that is a good \nguideline for a successful Congress. We are not doing that enough here, \nand we are particularly not doing it enough on the central question of \nthe deficit annually and the debt overall. The public sees this, so \nthey are upset.\n  I wish to, therefore, put what we are doing in the STOCK Act in \ncontext. I think if we pass it, both because of the clarity with which \nwe state that Members of Congress and our staffs are covered by anti-\ninsider trading laws and the disclosure improvements we make in the \nlaw, we will take a step forward in beginning to rebuild some \nconfidence the American people have lost in this institution, but, O \nLord, it is only the beginning. The more we can deal particularly with \nthe imbalances we have created in our Federal books, the more we are \ngoing to restore confidence in this institution.\n  Also, I hope we can prove on this measure and any number of others \nthat we are still capable of working across party lines to get things \ndone. That is, after all, why our constituents sent us here.\n  This is the beginning of my 24th year in the Senate. It has been a \nprivilege. This is my last year in the Senate since I have announced I \nam not seeking reelection. I am forced to say that last year was the \nleast productive of the 23 years I have been here. I hope we can \nperhaps on this bill prove, at least, that we can come together and get \nthis done, and it will be the beginning of getting other much more \nimportant things done, including, as Senator Coburn has stated, doing \nsomething about the debt and the deficit. I have been privileged to \nwork with him on some ideas we have put forward to make that happen. We \ncan't do it and make everybody happy. We can't do it and make all the \ninterest groups happy. But that is not why we came here. We came here \nto support and protect this extraordinary country of ours that we are \nblessed to be citizens of. So I say that by way of a first reaction.\n  The second is that I wish to take some time in that context to take a \nlook at amendments Nos. 1473 and 1474 that the Senator from Oklahoma \nhas introduced, the first to prevent the creation of duplicative and \noverlapping Federal programs, and the second is this requirement that \nall legislation be placed online for 72 hours before voted on in the \nHouse and Senate. Both of these on first response have some merit, in \nmy opinion. Certainly the first one has a lot of merit.\n  I am concerned and I know all of us--meaning Senators Collins, Brown, \nand Gillibrand--who have worked to bring the main parts of the bill out \nare concerned that we not go too far afield in amendments to the bill \nfor fear that it will weight it down and it will ultimately get stopped \nor, at worst, that the majority leader will take the bill off the floor \nbecause we are not coming to a point of completing our business because \namendments keep coming in that are not relevant. But these are two \nserious amendments, and I want to look at them and take a little time \nto respond.\n  The third, amendment No. 1476, I guess is a good news, bad news \nreaction that I have. The good news is that this really is directly \nrelevant to the substance of the bill. The bad news, if you will, is \nthat I am opposed to it because it really does--it is a totally \ndifferent approach to what we are trying to do in the bill. I don't \nthink it accomplishes the intention of most Members on this bill \nbecause it would really replace the entire STOCK Act with the \nrequirement that Members or anyone in the government who has to fill \nout a financial disclosure form certify that they--we--haven't traded \non inside information. I don't think as a result that the amendment \ndoes anything to clarify the current ambiguity in the law; that is, the \nquestion we heard raised before our committee by these experts on \nsecurities law about whether Members of Congress are really covered. If \nwe don't clarify that we have a duty of trust to bring our behavior \ntotally within existing securities law against insider trading, then I \ndon't think the legislation would get us to where we need to go and we \nare still left with the kind of ambiguity that creates the kind of \nmistrust I know none of us want.\n  We have spoken at length on this question with the Securities and \nExchange Commission staff, and I must say they share the concerns I \nhave just expressed and believe that if the legislation doesn't \nexplicitly state that a duty of trust exists and is held by Members of \nCongress, then the legislation will not do what is needed to get at the \nproblem, which is whether an insider trading case brought before a \ncourt could be objected to by a Member of Congress who is the target of \nthat suit.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Through the Chair, would the chairman accept that \nmodification to my amendment, that we would, in fact, establish \npositively that Members of Congress are under rule 10b of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission? Would that give the Senator less \nheartburn?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, it would give me less heartburn, but it would \nprobably still leave me needing at least a Rolaid.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, I have plenty of those. In fact, I will do better--\nI will give you a Zantac.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We should reason together. But, as the Senator from \nOklahoma knows, there are three main parts to the STOCK Act. One is the \ndeclaration we have just talked about, and the second and third are \ndisclosure requirements, one 30 days, and then the other is the online \nrequirement. But I am glad to talk with the Senator about adding the \nrequirement of a certification to the STOCK Act as opposed to \nsubstituting it for the whole STOCK Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 1476 be modified with the change to the instruction line only. I am \njust doing some housekeeping on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. MEMBER CERTIFICATION.\n\n       Section 102(a) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is \n     amended by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(9)(A) A statement (as provided in subparagraph (B)) \n     certifying that financial transactions included in the report \n     filed pursuant to section 101 (d) and (e) were not made on \n     the basis of non-public information.\n       ``(B) The certification required by this paragraph is as \n     follows: `I hereby certify that the financial transactions \n     reflected in this disclosure form were not made on the basis \n     of material, non-public information.' ''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I would make one other point, and I am not trying to put \nmy chairman in the hot seat, but nobody in this Chamber can name \nsomebody right now who is trading on inside information. I believe that \nis a true statement. Yet we are changing the law not because anybody \nhas done something wrong but because we are struggling to try to get \npeople to think we are doing things right. There is\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\nnothing wrong with that as long as we are not going to entrap our \ncolleagues.\n  The question I have is, if we can't name somebody and if there is not \nfactual truth, what we are really putting the Senate on notice for is \nthat, by the way, you are assumed to be trading on inside information \nnow, and therefore we must do this to ensure that you are not. Well, I \ndon't believe anybody in this body is doing that. And when we put our \nMembers in that position by changing the law to, for example, 30 days--\nif I have three stock tradings and I miss it by 1 day, what is the \nconsequence of that filing and of this bill? What is going to be the \npenalty that comes out of the Ethics Committee for missing it 1 day or \nmissing one of the three trades because you didn't know? We have lots \nof questions that are not answered.\n\n  I can tell my colleagues that many Members of this body have spent a \nlot of their personal money defending themselves on accusations that \nwere absolutely untrue before the Ethics Committee, and that should be \naddressed and clarified in the body, the report language, of this bill.\n  I have no doubt this bill is going to pass in one form or another. I \nunderstand I am in the very slim minority of people who think it is \nunnecessary because I think the law already applies to us, and I also \ndon't think we have a bunch of cheats working in the Senate. But would \nthe Senator agree through the Chair that we ought to make clarification \nof everything we can so we know what the ultimate results are or are we \ngoing to leave that up to the lawyers on the Ethics Committee? What are \nwe going to do with that? Are we going to determine what the penalties \nare for late filing or an accidental omission? What is going to be our \ndirection to the Ethics Committee in this regard?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn. Let me go back \nto the first point, but it is not the question he ultimately asked.\n  The Senator is raising a very high standard because I hope nobody is \ninvolved in insider trading as a Member of Congress. I presume they are \nnot. There were some serious allegations made last year by people \noutside Congress against Members of--certain Members of Congress, a \nsmall number. They have been denied and responded to by those Members. \nI presume that if there is any substance to them, the SEC will be \ninvestigating and take action. But obviously, necessarily, for dealing \nwith insider trading, we would not know it is going on because they are \nusing nonpublic information privately to secure private profit. So, as \nthe Senator from Oklahoma well knows, the purpose of the law is to make \nsure that if anybody is doing this--and again, I know the people here, \nthis is an honorable group of people, but if anybody is acting \ndishonorably--human nature being what it is--and a prosecution is \nbrought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, then there won't be \nany defense that the law doesn't cover Members of Congress. It is \nsimple as that.\n  But let me come to the other point. I know there is a lot of unease \namongst some Members about the 30-day requirement in this bill, which \nis that within 30 days one has to file a disclosure of any trade in a \nstock or security that a Member has been involved in that has a value \nof more than $1,000. There is a lot of concern about the requirements \nthat will put on Members. Ultimately, the Ethics Committee will \nadjudicate this. I assume there would be some rule of reasonableness if \nan unintentional error was made, and I certainly am happy to try to \nclarify in report language what our intention is, but the overall \nintention is to create transparency.\n  While I am on this--and I will be very brief with this--I know that \npeople are worried about what it will take to fulfill this requirement \nand that it is in some sense unfair to ask Members of Congress to have \nto disclose stock purchases or sales within 30 days. But it is my \nunderstanding that people defined by law as corporate insiders have to \ndeclare it within 48 hours of trades they make in their company stock. \nThe staff of the SEC have to publicly declare their trades within 5 \ndays. So it is possible to do this. I gather it is possible to do it by \nsimply asking whomever trades for you to copy the office here in the \nSenate when a transaction occurs, and then it automatically goes into a \ndatabase online. We are asking more, and for some it will be an \ninconvenience. But we are different. We hold a public office. We have a \npublic trust and public responsibility. So that is why this provision \nwas in the original STOCK Act introduced in the House, bipartisan, and \nhere in the Senate, both by Senator Gillibrand and Senator Brown. But I \ndo want to state I am happy to work with the Senator from Oklahoma on \nreport language that will encourage the Ethics Committee to apply a \nkind of rule of reason if there is an unintentional violation of that \n30-day reporting requirement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have one more question for the chairman.\n  If, in fact, this is what we should do--and I think the body is going \nto agree this is what we should do--does not the Senator think this \nshould apply to the administration as well, the executive branch, that \nthis should apply the same 30-day rule to every member of the executive \nbranch? You talk about real knowledge of inside information, they have \nit. We do not have it. They have it. Why would this rule not apply to--\nno matter who is President--executive employees in the administration?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma is asking \ngood questions.\n  Let me say first, as a point of clarification, as a result of an \namendment submitted in the committee by Senator Paul, and adopted, the \ninsider trading parts of the bill do relate to executive branch \nemployees. The 30-day disclosure requirement does not. I am happy to \nwork with the Senator on this. I gather the administration itself \napplies certain disclosure requirements to a group of people in the \nadministration at a Cabinet level or somewhat slightly below, but, \nobviously, not to all executive branch employees. But we can talk about \nthis one.\n  I continue to be concerned, overall, that we are going to extend this \nso far and make it so ``good'' that it is going to fall of its own \nweight and not make it through. But the Senator is raising a reasonable \nquestion, and Senator Brown and I just talked about it. We are glad to \ncontinue the conversation.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would make a couple points. One, we \nalready file all our stock trades--correct?--every year.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is right. We file annually.\n  Mr. COBURN. Every change in every investment we have, we file every \nyear. We already do that. We are already under rule 37 of the rules of \nSenate Ethics, which forbids any conflict of interest action that would \nbenefit ourselves. That would include inside information to trade \nstocks. There are 5 to 10 times as many senior executive positions \nwithin the administration than Members of Congress that, in fact, this \nsame thing should apply to.\n  If the important thing is ``within 30 days,'' my hope would be the \nchairman and the sponsor of the bill, Senator Brown, would give very \nclear instructions to the Ethics Committee on how this is to work. \nBecause I will note for you, last year 16 Senators got a 90-day \nextension on their filings with the Ethics Committee. That is 16 \npercent. We have to have some vow to make sure we do not put the \nMembers who are absolutely innocent of anything in a corner because \nthey cannot timely respond to this bill.\n  So my hope is--and I will finish with this; I know Senator Brown \nwants to speak--looking at the timeliness of the filing I think is \nimportant to still accomplish what you want, but not make it so \nrigorous that people are going to fall out of that. We all know how \nthings get busy here, how we come in, we come out. We are traveling, \nand we have all these things we are responding to. It will be difficult \nfor many Members to comply with the 30 days.\n  My hope would be you would look at that, and you would also look at \nrule 37 of Senate Ethics because, in fact, we are already doubly \ncovered. We are covered under 10b. And I do not have any problem with \nmodifying my amendment to say we are covered so you cannot have a \ndefense to say you are not. But we are also covered under rule 37, \nwhich forbids any conflict of interest under which you would benefit \npersonally.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank the chairman of the committee.\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the back \nand forth between the chairman and the Senator from Oklahoma. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has raised some very valid points, points that we \nactually had discussed in committee.\n  I originally asked for a 90-day reporting period, and it was changed \nout of committee to the 30-day period. Obviously, I am happy to work \nwith the Senator from Oklahoma and the chairman and the ranking member \nto determine if, in fact, there is some guidance necessary to Ethics; \nand, sure, I am happy to do it. This needs to not only be done in the \nproper manner but, obviously, to be implemented in a way that everybody \ncan comply and not be caught short in that type of situation.\n  So I am looking forward--in speaking to the chairman--that we will \ncertainly take those valid points into consideration, any guidance we \nneed to put in for the record, or letters of guidance to Ethics as to \nwhat our legislative intent is. I am happy to do that and look forward \nto continuing that dialog.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Seeing no one else seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           The Postal Service\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to say a word about an issue I \nthink has not gotten the kind of attention it deserves here in \nWashington or even among the general public; that is, the situation \nregarding our Postal Service.\n  Right now, for a number of reasons, the Postal Service is facing \nfinancial difficulties.\n  No. 1, it is no secret to any American that first-class mail has \ndeclined significantly because the American people are using e-mail and \nnot first-class mail, and that decline in first-class mail has \nsignificantly impacted the revenue for the Postal Service.\n  Second of all, not widely known is the fact that the Postal Service, \nevery single year now, because of legislation passed in 2006, is forced \nto come up with $5.5 billion--every single year--for future health \nretiree benefits. To the best of my knowledge--and to the best of the \nknowledge of anybody whom I have talked to--there is no agency of \ngovernment forced to come up with anything near this kind of onerous \nrequirement, nor is any corporation in the private sector doing that as \nwell.\n  So the issue we face is whether we are going to save the U.S. Postal \nService, whether we are going to bring about reforms which make the \nPostal Service strong and relevant to the 21st century and the digital \nage or whether we--as the Postmaster General has proposed--cut 40 \npercent of the workforce, shut down 3,700 post offices--most of them \nrural--end Saturday mail service, lay off or cut back on the workforce \nof the Postal Service by 40 percent--over 200,000 American workers, \nmany of them, by the way, veterans who are now serving and working in \nthe Postal Service.\n  Let me start off again with what the Postmaster General has proposed. \nLet me talk a little bit about legislation which has been led by \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Carper, which I think will be coming to \nthe floor, I expect, next week, and then talk about where I think, and \na number of us think, we should be going to strengthen that bill.\n  No. 1, this is what the Postmaster General has suggested that he \nneeds to do in order to solve the financial problems facing the Postal \nService. One, close down about 3,700, mostly rural, post offices. I \nwill tell you, coming from a rural State, a post office is not just a \npost office. In many parts of Vermont, many parts of America, rural \npost offices serve many functions. If you get rid of those post \noffices, you are causing severe distress to the identity, the sense of \nself of small towns in rural America.\n  No. 2, what the Postmaster General has suggested is the shutting down \nof about 252 mail processing facilities--about half of the mail \nprocessing facilities in this country. If you do that, there is no \ndebate that you are significantly slowing down the delivery of mail in \nAmerica. If you used to put a letter in a postal box, and it might get \nthere in 1 day, now the talk is it may get there in 3 days. If today it \ngets there in 3 days, it might in the future, under these cuts, get \nthere in 5 days.\n  Here is the fear I have and many other Members of the Senate and \nHouse have: If the Postal Service is trying to compete against the \ninstantaneous communications of e-mail, what does it mean that you are \nslowing mail service significantly? Many of us believe this is the \nbeginning of a death spiral for the Postal Service in the sense that \nmany consumers, many businesses will say: Hey, what is the sense of me \nworking with the Postal Service if my mail or packages are going to get \nthere in 3 days or 5 days?\n  So we think shutting down 252 mail processing facilities, slowing \ndown mail services, is laying the foundation for the destruction of the \nPostal Service as we know it.\n  To my mind, the issue is not whether we make changes or maintain the \nstatus quo. The status quo is not working. The Postal Service has to \nchange. In my view, and I think the view of many others, the Postal \nService must become much more aggressive, much more entrepreneurial, \nmust be going out to the business community, must be going out to \nconsumers and saying: We have these services we can offer you.\n  I will give you a few examples, and some of them, by the way, are \nincluded in the legislation brought forth by Senators Lieberman and \nCarper and Collins and Scott Brown.\n  For example, in a rural State, if people would like to walk into a \npost office and get a letter notarized, they cannot do it today. If \npeople walk into a post office and want to get 10 copies of their \nletter, they cannot do it today. The United States Congress has said \nthey cannot do that. If somebody walks into a rural post office and \nwants to get a fishing license or a hunting license or fill out a \ndriver's license, they cannot do that right now.\n  So I think what we need is a new business model for the post office, \nmuch more entrepreneurial. I would suggest--and what is happening \naround the world is, clearly, the United States Postal Service is not \nthe only postal service having to deal with the digital world. What we \nare seeing in Europe and throughout the world is countries responding \nby giving their postal services much more flexibility.\n  One example: A lot of people are unemployed. A lot of people get \nunemployment checks. Sometimes in order to cash those checks they have \nto go to a payday lender. Why can't they walk into a postal service and \ncash that check at a minimal fee rather than paying 10, 15, or 20 \npercent to a payday lender?\n  So I think one of the provisions that has to be included in any \nserious postal reform legislation is a blue ribbon commission made up \nof the best entrepreneurs we can find, those people within the Postal \nService who have the most experience who will tell us what we can do \nand how we can raise additional revenue when we have thousands of post \noffices all over this country. Can they be renting out their space? \nWhat other services can they be providing? Right now we have our letter \ncarriers delivering mail to about 150 million doors every single day, 6 \ndays a week, all over the country. What more can they be doing?\n  So the debate we are having is two visions of the future of the post \noffice. No. 1, the Postmaster General is saying: Let's cut 40 percent \nof the workforce over a period of time. Let's slow down mail delivery \nservice. That is the business model he is proposing.\n  Some of us are saying, when we have a rural constituency, when we \nhave senior citizens who live at the end of a dirt road who are \ndependent upon the post office in order to get their prescription drugs \nin the mail, when we have rural areas that very much depend on rural \npost offices, that the goal is to give more flexibility to the post \noffices so they can be more competitive, so they can raise additional \nsums of funding in order to deal with their financial problems.\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\n  A couple of specific points: Almost everybody agrees now that the \n$5.5 billion required from the post office is absolutely onerous. I \nhave talked to the Office of Personnel Management. They think $2.5 or \n$3 billion is quite enough, given the fact we have $45 billion already \nin the account. Talk to other people and they will say given the fact \nthat $45 billion is already earning interest, that, in fact, we do not \nhave to do anything. We do not have to add anything more into that \naccount, and it will deal with all of the future health care retiree \nbenefits the post office requires.\n  So I believe we have to be very firm and say, No. 1, if the post \noffice is going to survive in any significant way, we have to maintain \n1- to 3-day delivery standards for first class mail. Second, we have to \nmaintain 6-day delivery of mail, not end Saturday service. Third, we \nhave to protect our rural post offices. Fourth, we have to \nsignificantly reduce prefunding requirements for future retiree health \nbenefits, not to mention that there is also widespread agreement that \nthe Postal Service has overpaid the FERS account, the Federal \nEmployment Retirement Service, by some $11 billion. Obviously, that has \nto be dealt with.\n  Lastly, in my view, as I said previously, we need to develop a new \nbusiness model for the Postal Service, get them involved in the digital \nage, not run away from it--get them involved. Expand what they can do \nboth with State and local governments as well as what they can do with \nthe private sector.\n  So in the coming days, this is an issue that a number of us will be \nworking on. I look forward to the support of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's \nreference to the post office, and the postal issue is something \nSenators Collins, Lieberman, Carper, and I have been working on \nprobably about 300 or 400 hours at this point. So I look forward to his \ninvolvement as well.\n  At this point, getting back to the business at hand dealing with the \nSTOCK Act, I ask that Senator Paul be recognized. I believe he has \nthree amendments that he would like to offer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n     Amendments Nos. 1484, 1485, 1487 to Amendment No. 1470 en bloc\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendments Nos. 1484, 1485, and 1487 en \nbloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes amendments \n     numbered 1484, 1485, and 1487 to amendment No. 1470.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment NO. 1484\n\n (Purpose: To require Members of Congress to certify that they are not \n            trading using material, non-public information)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

LIMITATION ON EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICERS AND \n                   EMPLOYEES INVOLVEMENT IN MATTERS INVOLVING \n                   FINANCIAL INTEREST.\n\n       The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n   ``TITLE VI--GOVERNMENT-WIDE LIMITATION ON INVOLVEMENT IN MATTERS \n                      INVOLVING FINANCIAL INTEREST\n\n     ``SEC. 601.

These amendments are recognizing what the authors of this \nbill have been discussing: that people should not profit off of their \ninvolvement in government; they should not profit off of special \nrelationships; they should not profit off of special knowledge they \ngain in the function of serving the people.\n  Currently, there are some large donors who have been giving to this \nadministration who have profited enormously and disproportionately. \nThis will allow this bill to apply to the administration, and I do not \nbelieve people who are multimillionaires and billionaires should use \nthe apparatus of government, as was used in the loans that were given \nto Solyndra, by someone who is profiting off of their relationship and \nties to the President, profiting off of people who used to work for \nthese companies who are now employed in the administration and using \nthese connections to get taxpayer money to go to private individuals. \nThis is wrong and this should stop.\n  I think this bill is a great vehicle for discussing how people in \ngovernment are abusing their roles in government to make more money at \nthe expense of the taxpayer. I think it should end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, we obviously just received \nthe amendments. We look forward to digesting them and actually working \non some of the points. They are well taken. So we look forward to doing \nthat.\n  Since there is no Democrat here to offer another amendment, I would \nthen, in the spirit of back and forth, yield the floor to the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1488 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Senate should \npass a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution that \n       limits the number of terms a Member of Congress may serve)\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment. I have amendment No. 1488 at the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1488 to amendment No. 1470: At the \n     appropriate place, insert the following: Section: Sense of \n     the Senate: It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate \n     should pass a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \n     Constitution that limits the number of terms a Member of \n     Congress can serve.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I allowed that to be read because it is so \nshort. I think all of us know that in just about all areas of life \npower corrupts. And despite the good people in the Congress, the good \nintentions here, we have found that the longer folks stay in Washington \nthe more likely their associations with interest groups and other \ntemptations often cause bad behavior.\n  What we are working on here with this STOCK Act is just treating the \nsymptoms again when what we need to do is work on the root causes. If \nwe bring a professional class of politicians to Washington, and we know \nincumbents always have the advantage in reelections, elections are not \nthe only way to limit terms.\n  If we want good government, if we want representation of the people, \nthen we need to have folks represented in the House and the Senate who \nare from the people and not from an elite class of politicians in \nWashington. That is why for years many of us on both sides of the aisle \nhave worked on this idea of term limits.\n  My amendment is not a law. It does not set any specific term limits \nfor the House or the Senate. It is a sense of the Senate that says we \nshould pass a constitutional amendment that allows the States to ratify \nsome limit on the terms of office. We know this would likely attract \npeople who want to make representation a calling and not a career. So I \nwould hope that as we look at this total bill, and certainly we do not \nwant insider trading, Congressmen and Senators benefiting from their \nservice in any personal way, if we want to get at the root cause of \nmany of the problems here, many of the problems between parties across \nthe aisle, many of the false differences, we need to limit the terms of \npeople who come to Washington and bring in some fresh voices from all \nover the country. I think we will get better government, certainly less \ncorruption.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I know there has been some discussion. \nToday we are talking about the STOCK Act. I know there has been some \nback and forth on what is the appropriate time when people should \nnotify the public. I just hope at the end of the day our body is not \nafraid of transparency at every level.\n  The amendment I brought forward in the committee on which I sit dealt \nwith the STOCK Act and made sure that all issues around any \ntransactions that we make are going to be publicly disclosed in a \ntimely manner--30 days--but electronically. So it does not matter where \nyou are around the country, you can access it.\n  So I hope we do not forget what our goal is; that is, creating more \ndisclosure, more transparency so people know what we are doing in \nCongress. The STOCK Act is just one of those steps.\n  I rise today to support the STOCK Act as a sponsor of this act, \nlegislation prohibiting insider trading by Members of Congress and \ntheir staffs. Since day one in the Senate I have made transparency a \ntop priority in my office. Alaskans deserve to know what their Members \nof Congress are up to. That is why I worked hard to make sure they have \naccess to critical information. I believe we must hold ourselves to a \nhigher standard.\n  Since being elected I have posted my personal disclosures, my \npersonal financial disclosures, on my Senate Web site so my \nconstituents have full knowledge of how and what I am engaged in, and \nthey can get it electronically. They can access my personal information \nelectronically anytime they want. This is something Senators are not \nrequired to do but is just common sense. I will talk more about \ntransparency in just a moment.\n  Now, when it comes to the STOCK Act, I know my constituents at home \nin Alaska and other Americans are probably shocked this bill is even \nnecessary. They are asking themselves, and I have heard this: Is it \nreally legal for Members of Congress to participate in insider trading? \nThe fact is, insider trading is illegal for all Americans, including \nMembers of Congress. All along, the SEC, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, has had the authority to enforce insider trading laws.\n  But it is time for a little clarity. Trust and accountability are \ncritical to our roles in Congress. That is why I support and have \ncosponsored this important bill, the STOCK Act. This stands for Stop \nTrading on Congressional Knowledge, again, the STOCK Act. This bill \nreaffirms that it is against the law for Members of Congress to engage \nin insider trading and confirms that anyone who does not follow the \nrules will be prosecuted.\n  Members of Congress are not, and should not be, immune. We have a \nresponsibility to do our jobs in an honest, open, and transparent \nmanner, and to demonstrate that we are here every day fighting for our \nresidents--in my case, the residents of Alaska. All you need do is look \nat Congress's approval rating to figure out that Americans don't think \nwe have lived up to our end of the deal.\n  This bill is an important step in the right direction to regaining \npublic trust. However, reminding our colleagues of laws we should have \nalready known about is not enough. Transparency is a key element of \nmoving forward. As I said, it is common sense.\n  That is why Senator Tester and I introduced a transparency amendment \nduring the markup process. As he said in committee, listening to the \ntestimony and debate, we thought it was necessary to take an additional \nstep. I am pleased to say it was adopted and incorporated into the bill \nby the full committee.\n  The provision is simple. It requires that annual financial disclosure \nforms--the ones I put on my Web site--filed by Members of Congress and \ntheir staffs be posted online and accessible to the American public.\n  When you think about where we are in this world, in the 21st century, \nwith electronics and telecommunications and how we are not doing that \ntoday--I went on the Alaska Public Offices Commission Web site, which \nis the equivalent of what we are talking about today. If you want to \nfile yours in Alaska, your disclosure form, as a State legislator--or \nin my case as former mayor--it is now all electronic.\n  The current system we have here is outdated, not transparent. It is \nnot easily accessible to our folks back home. Under this new provision, \nMembers, candidates, and staffs must file their financial disclosure \nforms electronically. They will use a new system created and maintained \nby the Secretary of the Senate, Sergeant at Arms, and the Clerk of the \nHouse of Representatives. The American public will be able to search, \nsort, and download data contained in the financial disclosure form. \nThis information will be maintained online during their time of service \nand 6 years after the Member leaves office.\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\n  I commend Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, Senators \nGillibrand, Brown of Massachusetts, and Levin for their work on this \nlegislation. The STOCK Act will make Congress more accountable and, I \nhope, will inspire confidence in the American people that we are here \nto represent their interests and not our own.\n  Again, I encourage passage of this legislation. It is another step to \nensure that we have full transparency, and we should never be afraid of \nmaking sure our folks back home know exactly who we are, what we are \ndoing, and what our work is here in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, first, I commend the \nSenator from Alaska for his efforts during the committee process. He \noffered some good amendments that we ultimately took up and accepted. \nWe look forward to his continued involvement in the process.\n  As we have said, we need to make sure that all of the amendments are \nrelevant. We hope he will join with us and get some of his colleagues \nto focus on the very important issues we are trying to work on and not \nget sidetracked.\n  That being said, I congratulate him and look forward to working with \nhim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, let me join in what the Senator from \nMassachusetts said. Senator Begich, with Senator Tester, offered an \namendment in committee that has not gotten as much attention as some \nother parts of the bill--but it will have at least as great a positive \neffect as the other parts of the bill--which is so simple that it makes \nyou wonder why we have not done it before. I have been quoting Dr. \nSeuss lately, and I won't do it here, but there is a saying that \nsometimes the best answers to questions that are complicated are simple \nanswers--something like that; I am losing something in the translation.\n  But Senator Begich and Senator Tester require that the annual \nfinancial reports we file, which are public documents--for the public \nto see them, they or some representative have to go to the office of \nthe Secretary of the Senate to look at them or make copies. We are in \nthe information age, the digital age. So Senator Begich and Senator \nTester took a small step on the bill--which is a large step for the \nAmerican people--which is that these reports will now be online and \nelectronically filed. Everybody, not just the SEC, will have immediate \naccess to those financial disclosure reports.\n  Incidentally, the 30-day provision for disclosure will also be \ncovered by that, and will also be available.\n  The Director of Enforcement, Robert Khuzami, of the SEC, testified \nbefore the House committee on the comparable bill that the 30-day \nrequirement and the annual requirement for electronic filing would \nassist the SEC in carrying out its responsibilities.\n  Once again, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his contribution to \nthe bill.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator.\n  One quick comment. Imagine the folks from Alaska who want to get a \ncopy of a report. They have to find somebody in DC to go to a clerk and \nget a copy and send it over, and now, if this passes, they can go \nonline from anywhere.\n  Again, I thank Senators Lieberman, Brown, and others. We are honored \nto be able to contribute our piece to it. It will be easier for the \npublic to get this information. I thank the Senator for his kind \ncomments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nStop Trading on Congressional Knowledge, better known as the STOCK Act, \nlegislation that is critical to increasing accountability in Federal \noffice and restoring the public's faith in government.\n  I am a cosponsor of the STOCK Act and have been working to address \nconcerns about insider trading in Congress. I appreciate the leadership \nof my colleague from Minnesota, Tim Walz, in the House who spearheaded \nthe bill, as well as the work of my colleagues, including Senator \nGillibrand and Senator Brown, who have shown leadership in moving this \nissue forward.\n  No one is above the law in this country, least of all the lawmakers. \nAt a time when Americans are crying out for leaders who are willing to \nput public interest before political gain, the STOCK Act presents a \nrare opportunity for both parties to come together and pass a bill that \nnot only makes for good policy but that is, very simply, the right \nthing to do.\n  Over the last few years, we have worked to restore accountability and \nintegrity to the major institutions in this country. We have worked to \nrein in recklessness on Wall Street. We have enforced greater \naccountability in Federal budgets. And in 2007, we passed historic \nreforms to strengthen congressional ethics laws.\n  I am standing here today because we can and must do more. Those of us \nwho have the privilege of writing the rules have a responsibility to \nplay by the rules, to not just talk the talk but walk the walk, and the \nSTOCK Act is about making sure we are doing just that. This commonsense \nbill will strengthen our democracy by ensuring that no Federal employee \nor Member of Congress can profit from nonpublic information they have \nobtained through their position.\n  First and foremost, the legislation clarifies and strengthens laws \nfor regulating insider trading by Members of Congress and their staff. \nIt redefines the practice to clearly state that it is illegal to \npurchase assets based on knowledge gained through congressional work or \nservice, ensuring Members of Congress are held to the same standards as \nthe people we represent. That seems only fair.\n  Some people have argued that there are already laws on the books for \nthis, but the fact is that insider trading by Members of Congress and \ntheir staff is currently not prohibited by the Securities Exchange Act \nor congressional rules. Furthermore, the status of trading on \ncongressional information has never been explicitly outlawed. The \nresulting ambiguity has made it incredibly difficult to enforce these \nrules, which is almost certainly part of the reason not a single \nviolation has ever been prosecuted.\n  The STOCK Act would clear up the ambiguity and make these laws \ncrystal clear. It would give both the SEC and the ethics committee in \neach Chamber the authority to investigate and prosecute charges of \ninsider trading, and it would make it a violation of the rules of the \nHouse and the Senate to engage in such activity, meaning that anyone \nwho uses their role as a Member of Congress to enrich themselves would \nhave to answer to the Department of Justice and the Securities and \nExchange Commission.\n  The bill would also enforce better oversight by significantly \nstrengthening reporting requirements. Members of Congress are already \nrequired to disclose the purchase or sale of securities and commodities \non an annual basis, and the STOCK Act would take these requirements \nseveral steps further. Not only would it mandate that Members and \nemployees disclose any and all transactions of over $1,000 within 30 \ndays of the trade, but it would require that information about the \ntransaction be published online.\n  Finally, to close the revolving door between Congress and special \ninterest groups, the STOCK Act would introduce much needed transparency \ninto the industry known as political intelligence consulting--the \npractice of reaching out to people working in the legislative and \nexecutive branches to gain market intelligence regarding proposed \nrules, regulations, and bills. The STOCK Act would require the \nGovernment Accountability Office to study this issue and see what we \ncan do to ensure that these consultants are subject to the same \nreporting requirements and restrictions imposed on lobbyists.\n  Trust is the tie that binds our democracy, but with faith in \ngovernment now at an alltime low, it is clear that some\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\nof those ties did break. Why would we not want to strengthen those \nbonds? Why would we not want to show the people who have sent us to \nWashington that we have nothing to hide by passing this bill? America \nwas built on the principles of hard work, fair play, and personal \nresponsibility. These are the rules middle-class families in States \nsuch as Minnesota and all across America are still playing by today. We \nin Congress need to be willing to stand up and say we are willing to do \nthe same.\n  I want to end my remarks today by sharing two letters that were sent \nto my office on the subject of the STOCK Act. The first is from a \nMinnesotan named Robert, who wrote:\n\n       Elected officials need to get back to the business of \n     representing those who sent them to Washington to serve, not \n     increasing their personal wealth based on information they \n     learn from holding those offices--information that, were it \n     not for their elected office, they would otherwise not be \n     privy to.\n\n  The second letter comes from a Minnesotan named David, who makes this \nissue crystal clear. He says:\n\n       Voters elect politicians to do what is best for the \n     country, not to become rich.\n\n  I could not have put it better myself, and I could not agree more. I \narrived in this town in a Saturn with my college dishes from 1985 and a \nshower curtain in the back seat, so clearly this is not as relevant to \nmy personal situation. But I truly believe, if we are going to restore \ntrust in government, we need to pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from \nMinnesota for coming down. I appreciate her comments, her hard work on \nthis issue, and thank her for her efforts.\n  Once again I reiterate to folks who may be listening, we are \ngathering amendments. I believe they are stacking up. Some are very \nrelevant. Some have pieces of relevancy. What we have been trying to do \nis take the best of each one and try to formulate a plan to move \nforward and try to get some votes, obviously today and tomorrow, and \nget this done as quickly as possible and get it over to the House.\n  I once again reiterate my request to have all amendments be relevant \nto the issue at hand. Like Senator Lieberman--I am not going to quote \nDr. Seuss as he did, but I want to be sure we have a bill that has a \nchance not to get bogged down but to pass expeditiously.\n  To let folks know in the gallery and also those watching on \ntelevision, there have been some very good amendments, good ideas. \nSome, actually, we may end up combining. There are amendments coming up \nin the days ahead that we have not had a chance even to look at because \nthe amendments are coming in fast and furiously. We have not had a \nchance to get out and try to comment as to what we are doing with this \namendment or that amendment. There are good points in virtually every \namendment. We need to be sure we get the best and strongest bill we \npossibly can. I want to add that.\n  I do not see Senator McCaskill here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1472\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nan amendment that I think is relevant to this discussion. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator McCaskill, for her work on this topic. It goes to \nthe issue of the integrity by which this body and Congresses in general \noperates, which certainly is a central issue regarding this particular \nbill. Our amendment goes to a particular aspect of the integrity of \nthis body.\n  My concern is that in the absence of our amendment, many of our \ncolleagues will likely resume a very wasteful, nontransparent process \nwhich is prone to corruption and abuse, and that is the process of \nearmarking. I wish to speak a little bit about earmarks and what they \nare and why I think we ought to have a permanent legislative ban on the \nprocess.\n  Let me be clear about the process. Earmarks exist precisely in order \nto circumvent any real scrutiny, transparency, or any process by which \nthis body, the other body, or the American people can evaluate the \nmerits of a given project. There is no authorization to earmarks. There \nis no proper scrutiny. There is no competitive bidding among competing \ndemands for resources. I think the process itself is indefensible.\n  In part because the process is so badly flawed, we should not be \nsurprised that it leads to extraordinary waste. We have seen it. Some \nof the earmarks have become famous because they are so wasteful and \ninappropriate. We all heard about the ``bridge to nowhere.'' Recent \nearmarks include, above and beyond that, a $1 million alternative \nsalmon products earmark. There was a $1.9 million earmark for the \nCharles Rangel Center for Public Service requested by none other than \nCongressman Charles Rangel. There was $550,000 for a glass museum, $2.5 \nmillion for Arctic winter games. The list goes on and on. I could go on \nall day with indefensible projects that got into law, taxpayer dollars \nthat were spent precisely because these earmarks were permitted. I \nwould argue that it has gotten to the point where it really adds up to \nreal dollars and cents.\n  Those who would like to resume earmarking would like to suggest that \nit is not a real number, doesn't add up to a whole lot of money. Over \nthe course of the last 15 years, the total value of taxpayer dollars \nspent this way has tripled. In the last Congress, it reached $36 \nbillion.\n  One other thing that is particularly pernicious about earmarks is \nthat over time they became a currency used to buy votes. There was this \nunwritten law that if you ask for an earmark in a spending bill and you \nget it, you are obligated to vote for that bill regardless of how \nbloated, inappropriate, wasteful, or otherwise nonsensical that bill \nmight be. That is a really terrible process.\n  Finally, the fact is, it is an opportunity for corruption. I am not \nsuggesting there is corruption involved in most earmarks. I am sure \nthere is not. But we do know of some examples of some of our colleagues \nwho did in fact use earmarks quite inappropriately to enrich \nthemselves. I know of one in jail right now because of that. While that \nis certainly the very unusual exception, the fact is a process such as \nthat is badly flawed and should be remedied.\n  As we all know, there is a current temporary moratorium in place on \nearmarks that has been adopted by both bodies and both parties. But \nthat temporary moratorium expires this year. What our amendment does is \ncreate a permanent legislative ban on earmarks. It does that by \ncreating a point of order. Any Senator can come down to the Senate \nfloor and strike an earmark if one is inserted in a spending bill, and \nit would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to override the effort to \nstrike the earmark.\n  It is important to know that this amendment does not strike the \nentire bill. It would not invalidate the bill or otherwise disrupt the \nbill. It would surgically remove the earmark that would be offending \nthis point of order.\n  As I say, I thank Senator McCaskill for her support. I thank Senator \nCoburn for the many years in which he has battled, as have others, \nespecially Senator McCain and others. But Senator Coburn once described \nearmarks as the gateway drug to spending addiction, and I think he is \nreally onto something with that characterization.\n  I think it is time we change the culture in Washington, that we \nchange the culture of Congress, get away from a culture that says, how \ncan we maximize spending, which really has been the culture of Congress \nfor way too long, and move to a culture that says, how do we maximize \nsavings, because when we are running trillion-dollar annual deficits, \nwe have to find savings anywhere we can. I can't think of a better \nplace to start.\n  If we really want to change Washington, if we really want to reduce \nwasteful spending, if we really want to eliminate opportunities for \ncorruption, if we really want to change the culture of spending and \nbegin the process of doing these things to hopefully restore some of \nthe confidence of the American people in their government, one of the \nways we can do this very constructively is to pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Toomey for joining me. \nHe has been a great leader on this since he arrived in the Senate, in \nterms of\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\nthe fight against earmarks. I thank him for that.\n  I also welcome him to our band of warriors in terms of fighting the \nearmark culture in Washington. It has been a fairly small number of \nSenators since I arrived here in January of 2007. I will be honest, the \nSenator spent some time in the House, so he was more familiar with the \nprocess of earmarking than I was. When I came to the Senate, I did not \nreally understand how it worked. I did not really get it. I do not \nthink, until you have gotten here and watched it from the inside, you \ntruly appreciate how flawed it is in terms of a way of distributing \npublic money. It really is going in the back room and sprinkling fairy \ndust. It is really a process that has more to do with who you are and \nwhom you know than merit.\n  Have there been lots of projects that have been funded that I have \nsupported? Of course. Did I make a decision--a difficult one--to not \ncherry-pick certain earmarks to go after on the floor? Instead, I have \ntried, when I got here and realized the problems, to reform the \nprocess, not just to say, let's find this one earmark in this bill and \ngin up an amendment on it; rather, let's try to stop the process in its \nentirety because it makes no sense. And that is what this amendment \ndoes. It actually will stop the process in its entirety.\n  Why do we need it if we have a moratorium? Why now? Frankly, when I \nfirst started saying I wanted to do away with all earmarking, I was \nlaughed at by Members of this body, directly and indirectly. Sometimes \nI felt as if people were patting me on the head and saying: Go away. \nYou have no chance to do this. I am proud of the fact that we have \ngotten a moratorium now. The truth is, there are a lot of Members of \nthis body who want to go back to the old ways, and I think it is very \nimportant that we do a permanent ban. I certainly thank the Senator for \nhelping, and I think the amendment we are working on together will make \nsure we will not have what happened in the House this year.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I wished to touch on a point the Senator just made that I \nthink is important to underscore. I would agree without hesitation that \nthere are any number of earmarked projects that probably have very good \nmerit. This is not at all to suggest that every earmark that has ever \noccurred had no merit. That is not what this is about.\n  What we are criticizing and what we are trying to change is a very \nbadly flawed process that permits a great deal of projects that have no \nmerit to get funded that otherwise would not be funded. Those that have \nmerit--and goodness knows all kinds of projects, especially \ntransportation projects--ought to be funded, but they ought to be \nfunded in a transparent and honest way, subject to evaluation by an \nauthorizing committee and subject to competition, so those projects \nthat have the greatest merit and the greatest need would be funded \nfirst. That is what I think we are trying to get at and get away from \nthis process where an individual Member of either this body or the \nother body, in the dark of night, can drop in some specific provision \nbecause he or she wanted it without it being subject to the proper \nscrutiny and evaluation and competition that the taxpayer deserves.\n  I just wished to underscore that point. I appreciate the Senator's \nwork and the message she brought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I will tell my colleagues that I think for too long \ntoo many Senators believed the measure of their worth as a Senator had \neverything to do with how much money they were bringing home. I have a \nnew idea. Instead of the measure of our worth being how much we can \nspend, I think the measure of our worth ought to be how much we can \nsave. This place turned on the notion that if one stayed here long \nenough, if they got to be an appropriator, they got more earmarks. If \nthey became a ranking member on a subcommittee on appropriations, they \ngot even more.\n  Then I found out about honey pots. I didn't know about honey pots \nuntil I got here. I don't know if Senator Toomey is familiar with that \nterm, but let me educate him about what that term means. A honey pot is \nwhat the ranking minority member and chairman set aside as their \nspecial pot of money that they get to spend on earmarks that is greater \nthan everyone else's. Some of the appropriations subcommittees have \nhoney pots and some don't. The very notion that we are deciding how to \ndivide the money based on how long we have been here, what our party \naffiliation is, what committees we serve on is not the way we should \nspend public money. We spend public money based on merit or on a \nformula based on how many people are in our State.\n  One of the other things that drives me crazy is this talking point \nagainst doing away with earmarks: We can't let the bureaucrats decide. \nWe can't let the executive branch decide. It is the power of the purse. \nWe have had the power of the purse in Congress for hundreds of years. \nEarmarking is a modern invention. We have the right to oversee the \nexecutive budget, change the executive budget, cut the executive \nbudget, and add money to the executive budget. We can do that as a \nCongress and that has nothing to do with earmarking.\n  Let me also say this about this talking point: This notion that \nearmarked money just grows on trees somehow--where does the money for \nearmarking come from? It comes from other programs. Guess what programs \nit is taken from. It is taken from programs--I will just say from \nprograms such as surface transportation.\n  Let's talk about that. We have a local process in Missouri. We have \nstakeholders all across the State who go to meetings and the public is \ninvited and these agencies work very hard at trying to prioritize their \ntransportation projects based on the economic needs of their community, \nbased on safety considerations. These local folks work very hard to \nprioritize their projects, and what does earmarking do? It cuts in \nline. One individual's judgment supplants all the local planning.\n  This is not about Washington bureaucrats. In a lot of these instances \nit is about saying: I know better than the people back home know. Look \nat the Byrne grants, another perfect example. Money for the Byrne \ngrants--which is a State-administered program done on a competitive \nbasis at the State level--they have been stealing money out of the \nByrne grants for earmarks so one individual Senator can decide this \nsheriff needs new equipment as opposed to the State authorities \ndeciding that there may be a crime problem in one area of the State, \nsuch as a methamphetamine problem that needs special attention.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. This is a very important point. It is a common refrain \nfrom those who would like to go back to earmarking: We can't turn this \nover to the bureaucrats. Who controls the bureaucrats? It is Congress. \nIf we think the bureaucrats are allocating resources in a way that we \ndon't approve of, we can change the rules. We write the law that \ndetermines the criteria, the metrics, the methodology, the process by \nwhich they compete and evaluate competing projects. That is entirely up \nto us. So it is not fair for us to suggest that while the bureaucrats \nwill not spend it wisely, then we should set the rules so they must. \nFrankly, they don't have the kind of incentives that some people who \nare holding elected office think they have to try to show up back home \nwith a big oversized check. The bureaucrat doesn't have that incentive.\n  I would argue I can't imagine any bureaucrat who would award several \nhundred million dollars to build a bridge to nowhere or to build a \ncowgirl hall of fame or an indoor tropical rain forest. These are \nthings that if a bureaucrat did make those decisions, it would be \nbecause they were following ridiculously flawed guidelines given to \nthem by Congress. So this in no way diminishes Congress's control of \nthe purse strings; it insists on a more accountable process by which we \nallocate the resources from the purse.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, it is easy to see why earmarking is \nheld so dear to so many Members. I remember when I first was elected \nand people\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\nbegan showing up in my office that, frankly, had not been big \nsupporters of mine. All of us who are here--and if we are brutally \nhonest for the folks back home--we want to be loved. We put ourselves \nout there for public acceptance or rejection every 2, 4, 6 years. So \npeople started showing up and being very nice to me who had not \nparticularly been supporters of mine, and they were being nice to me \nand I thought, What is up here? Then all of a sudden I figured it out. \nThey were all showing up to get their earmarks. The people in \nMissouri--I don't know about Pennsylvania--but in Missouri they are \nvery worried about not having earmarks because they have been fed this \nline all these years: If we don't have earmarks, we are not going to \nget anything. We are not going to get our share. We are not going to \nget as much as we deserve.\n\n  Let's take water. Pennsylvania--this is a good example because \nPennsylvania didn't get very much in water projects either. I don't \nknow how many rivers there are in Pennsylvania. I should be more \nfamiliar with the geography there. But to say that Missouri is a river \nState is an understatement. I mean, we have the confluence of the two \ngreatest rivers of our country, the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, in \nour State. We have major impact in terms of water projects that need to \nbe done in our State because of how prominent water is in the State of \nMissouri. But yet we have been way down the line in terms of water \nprojects because we don't have an appropriator on that committee. We \nhave appropriators on other committees but not on that committee.\n  I keep telling the folks at home, if we compete with other States for \nwater projects, we are going to do just fine, and that is the way it is \nsupposed to work. States are supposed to get what they need and not get \nthe benevolence of Washington because they happen to have somebody who \nhas been here long enough to be on the right committee to have the \nright chairmanship or the right ranking committee so they can get even \nmore. That is not the way this place should be run. It is not the right \nway to spend public money.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I can tell the Senator how I think a big majority of \nPennsylvanians feel about this because I hear from them every day. \nSure, there are some folks who would love to resume earmarks because \nthey benefited from them in the past. I think the vast majority of \nPennsylvanians--and I would guess Americans--generally understand that, \nespecially at a time when we have reached $15 trillion in debt, when \nour debt now exceeds the entire size of our economy, when we are \nrunning annual deficits of over $1 trillion for the last several \nconsecutive years and, frankly, probably in the years to come. We are \nin an unsustainable mode right now. What my constituents want is for us \nto put ourselves on a viable, sustainable fiscal path. That means \ngetting spending under control. So I don't think our constituents want \nus to see how much money we can spend, as the Senator pointed out. They \nwant to see how much we can save, and I think they would overwhelmingly \nwelcome ending a process that clearly leads to wasteful spending.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I hope we get a vote on this amendment. I am not \noptimistic about that because, typically--let's be honest--the vast \nmajority of the leadership in this body has typically been \nappropriators and many of them want to go back to earmarking, and this \nis on both sides of the aisle.\n  As I started to point out before, it was the Republican Armed \nServices Committee in the House that set aside a slush fund and began \ndoing earmarking on the Defense authorization bill. We were able to \nexpose it and stop it, but clearly people are having a hard time \nbreaking this habit. So I think this amendment is very important. I am \nhappy to go toe-to-toe with anyone over the merits of this amendment. I \nam happy to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with anyone in this Congress, \nRepublican or Democrat, who is willing to stop this process once and \nfor all.\n  I think this amendment would do it. I hope we get a vote on it, and \nif we don't, it will not be the last time I think they will hear from \nboth of us about our bill and how serious we are about getting it \npassed.\n  There will come a time that this bill will pass because the American \npeople are on to us. The American people are on to this bad habit. They \nwant it to end and they will have their way. It may not be today, it \nmay not be this week, but I remind the Members of the Senate that it \nwasn't that long ago people laughed out loud at me when I said there \nwould be an end to earmarking. They thought that was the silliest joke \nthey had ever heard, and we have made a lot of progress thanks to the \nAmerican people.\n  By the way, the credit should not go to me or Senator McCain or \nSenator Coburn--who have been working on this for much longer than I \nhave--it should go to the American people who are figuring this out and \nrising in record numbers to say: We don't like earmarks. Stop it. We \nshould give credit to them for paying attention. I hope they stay on \nit, and I hope we will eventually prevail.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. If the Senator would yield one final time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I appreciate the Senator's kind indulgences. I am newer \nto this body, and maybe that explains my relative optimism. I am \nhopeful that we do get a vote, and I am hopeful, if we do get a vote, \nit will succeed. I point to the voluntary moratorium both Chambers \ninstituted 1 year ago as a sign that this is increasingly becoming the \nconsensus view among Members of both bodies. I don't know if I am \nright. I am hopeful. If we don't succeed today, that means we need to \ncome back on another day when we can succeed because there is no doubt \nin my mind that the people of Pennsylvania--and I suspect across \nAmerica--want us to win this battle and begin to rein in wasteful \nspending. There is no better place to start than to ban these earmarks.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for her leadership and her work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I also yield and thank the Senator for his work. This \nshould be the easiest for us to get done. We have some hard work we \nhave to do around here that is going to mean sacrifice and changes that \nare not going to be easy for anyone. This ought to be simple, so let's \ntry to get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, as you know, people are \ncoming down requesting amendments be brought up. Since I did not see \nany Democrats offering any, I yield to Senator Paul. He has an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1490 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1490.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I have no objection to proposing the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1490 to amendment No. 1470.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require former Members of Congress to forfeit Federal \n retirement benefits if they work as a lobbyist or engage in lobbying \n                              activities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FORFEITURE OF CREDIT FOR SERVICE AS A MEMBER IF \n                   FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BECOME LOBBYISTS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\n       (1) the term ``creditable service'' means service that is \n     creditable under chapter 83 or 84 of title 5, United States \n     Code;\n       (2) the term ``lobbyist'' has the meaning given that term \n     in section 3 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. \n     1602);\n       (3) the term ``Member of Congress'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 2106 of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (4) the term ``remuneration'' includes salary and any \n     payment for services not otherwise identified as salary, such \n     as consulting fees, honoraria, and paid authorship.\n       (b) Forfeiture of Credit for Service.--Any service as a \n     Member of Congress shall not be creditable service if the \n     Member of Congress, after serving as a Member of Congress--\n       (1) becomes a registered lobbyist;\n       (2) accepts any remuneration from a company or other \n     private entity that employs registered lobbyists; or\n       (3) accepts any remuneration from a company or other \n     private entity that does business with the Federal \n     Government.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. This amendment will address some of the situations that are \nconcerning the American people. I think the ability to serve in the \nSenate is a great honor. The ability to serve in the House of \nRepresentatives is a great honor. But I am somewhat sickened and \nsomewhat saddened by people who use their office, who leave office and \nbecome lobbyists, who leave office and call themselves historians but \nbasically leave office and peddle the friendships they have found here \nand the relationships to make money. I think it is hard to prevent \npeople from being lobbyists. But I think if people choose to leave the \nSenate and leave the House of Representatives and become lobbyists, \nthey should give up something. These people are making millions of \ndollars lobbying Congress. I think maybe they should give up their \npension. Maybe they should give up the health benefits that are \nsubsidized by the taxpayer.\n  If someone is going to use their position as an ex-Senator or as an \nex-Congressman to enrich themselves, maybe they should have to give up \nsome of those perks they accumulated while in office. So this amendment \nwould say that if you go out and become a lobbyist, you have to give up \nyour pension and you have to give up your health benefits and you need \nto pay for them yourself. I think this is the least we can ask.\n  I think we have a great deal of coverage now talking about people who \nare either lobbyists or not or whether they are historians. The bottom \nline is we have a lot of people peddling their friendship and their \ninfluence for monetary gain, and I do not think the taxpayers should be \nsubsidizing that.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thought I would bring our colleagues \nup to date on what is going on this evening, as it is getting late. We \nare close, I believe, to working out an agreement for a vote on an \namendment that was offered by Senator Paul earlier. It has to do with \nextending to executive branch officials the same kind of reporting \nrequirement to ban insider trading that would apply to Members of \nCongress and their staffs. It is an amendment that enjoys the support \nof both managers and the principal authors of this bill.\n  We are trying to make sure, however, that we narrow the amendment so \nthat it applies to top-level Federal employees and not to low-level \nFederal employees, who have no policy responsibilities. So we were \nlooking at limiting it to Senate-confirmed positions. The problem with \nthat is it brings in all of the military appointments that are Senate \nconfirmed, so we want to make sure we exclude those individuals who are \nclearly not the target of the amendment.\n  We continue to work--the managers, the sponsors of the bill, and the \nsponsor of the amendment, Senator Paul--in order to refine his \namendment. It is still our hope that we can reach that compromise and \nhave a rollcall vote tonight. We will keep our colleagues informed \nabout whether it will be possible to complete the drafting that would \nbe needed to modify his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1490\n\n  In the meantime, I want to talk very briefly about an amendment \nSenator Paul filed, his amendment No. 1490. This is an amendment that \nwould require former Members of Congress to forfeit their Federal \nretirement benefits if they work as a lobbyist or even engage in any \nlobbying activity--regardless, I might say, of whether they served 40 \nyears in this body.\n  I also note that the language in this amendment is extraordinarily \nbroad. For example, the definition of remuneration includes salaries, \nany payment for services not otherwise identified as salary, such as \nconsulting fees, honoraria, and paid authorship. Think about that. As I \nread the language, a former Member of Congress who writes a book would \nbe in danger of forfeiting his or her pension. In other words, this is \ngoing to apply to authors. It mentions honoraria, so if a former Member \nof Congress gives a speech and receives $1,000 for giving that speech, \nthat former Member is going to forfeit his or her pension--earned \npension?\n  I don't even know that this would pass constitutional muster. But \nthere is certainly a fairness issue, it seems to me. I don't know if \nthe intent of the Senator from Kentucky was to draft this as broadly as \nhe did to include and define as remuneration paid authorship. In other \nwords, if you wrote a book--and it would not even have to be a book; \nwhat if you wrote a newspaper article or an op-ed for the Washington \nPost and received $250 for that? Do you forfeit the Federal pension? \nWhat if you worked in the private sector for a number of years, worked \nin State government for a number of years, and then worked for a few \nyears serving the people of this country in Congress? Would you then \nforfeit your pension if you provided some lobbying activities? If you \nwrote a book? If you gave a speech for money? This is extraordinarily \nbroad.\n  I see the Senate majority leader is on the floor, so I will stop \ndiscussing this amendment. I did want our colleagues to actually read \nthe text of this amendment before we ever vote on it.\n  It defines remuneration not just as salary or payment for services \nnot otherwise identified as salary, but consulting fees, honoraria, and \npaid authorship. In other words, if after being in Congress you wrote a \nbook or you wrote an op-ed for which you were paid, you forfeit your \nFederal pension because you did some lobbying activities? This strikes \nme as a very sweeping amendment that does not belong on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to hear what that amendment does, and I thank \nthe Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S200-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S200-S201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING ALAN S.

Madam President, I want to join in saluting Alan for his \nmany years of work. He is someone all of us know to be an honest \nbroker, who calls them as he sees them, who withstands at times \ntremendous pressures, and who has extraordinary knowledge that all of \nus have come to rely upon.\n  On behalf of the Republican side of the aisle, I am sure I am \nspeaking for our Members as well in saluting Alan and wishing him well, \nand thanking him for his many years of dedicated public service.\n  We wish you well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I would be remiss if I didn't say a \nword of thanks to Alan Frumin for his service to the Senate.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1989 and had the privilege to \noccupy the chair, I had two great mentors. One was the great Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd, and the other was Alan Frumin. Both \nwere steadfastly reliable.\n  I was just one of many who sat in the chair. We are often asked \nquestions whose answers do not immediately spring to mind, and there \nwas a voice that I heard--in this case, it was not from above but from \nslightly below--that clarified exactly what the rules of the Senate \nrequired.\n  Alan has been a true and faithful public servant, has held himself to \nthe highest standards, and helped this inherently unruly body to be \nruly. For that, I thank him and wish him well in his next chapter of \nlife.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the leader and other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle as we congratulate Alan Frumin on \nhis impressive service as our Parliamentarian which was characterized \nby the dutiful and trustworthy performance of his duties.\n  We wish for him much continued success in the years ahead.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S201-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S201-S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     STOP TRADING ON CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE ACT OF 2012--Continued\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Pending before the Senate is the STOCK Act, and the \npurpose is one that I support. It is a bill I cosponsored.\n  The notion behind it is that Members of Congress should not use their \npublic service or information gained in their public service for \nprivate benefit. It basically outlaws the type of insider trading and \nconflict of interest that should be a standard and will be a standard \nafter this is enacted into law.\n  Amendments have been proposed to this measure, and there is one in \nparticular I heard about earlier and asked for a copy of. This is an \namendment proposed by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul. It is an \namendment which talks about Members of Congress forfeiting their \nFederal retirement benefits and the conditions under which they would \nforfeit their Federal retirement benefits. Understand that these are \nMembers of Congress who have completed enough service in the Congress \nto qualify for a pension. It is my understanding that is about 6 years. \nSo at a minimum of 6 years of service, Members of Congress receive some \npension benefit. Certainly those benefits increase the longer they \nserve.\n  This bill would disqualify them from pensions they have been credited \nand earned as Members of Congress under three conditions:\n  First, should they decide after they have served in Congress to serve \nas a registered lobbyist. That in and of itself is breathtaking. To \nthink that if a person should decide after service in Congress to \nbecome a registered lobbyist--with or without compensation I might add, \nfor perhaps a nonprofit organization--they would forfeit their Federal \npension. That in and of itself is unacceptable and inexplicable, but \nthen it gets worse.\n  This amendment goes on to say that a Member of Congress, retired, \nforfeits his Federal pension if he accepts any kind of remuneration, \nwhich could be a salary, a consulting fee, even an honorarium for \ngiving a speech, from any company or other private entity that employs \na registered lobbyist.\n  Think about that for a second. If a retired Member of Congress in \nIllinois should give a speech to a gathering of the management of \nCaterpillar Tractor Company in Peoria about their experience in \nCongress and their views on issues in Washington, give a speech and \nreceive any compensation for giving that speech, they would forfeit \ntheir Federal pension because Caterpillar has a paid lobbyist in \nWashington.\n  Then it gets worse. The third provision says that a retired Member of \nCongress would forfeit their pension if they accept that remuneration \nfrom any company or private entity that does business with the Federal \nGovernment. Is using the mail service doing business with the Federal \nGovernment? Would most businesses in America, therefore, be doing \nbusiness with the Federal Government because they use the mail service? \nIf so, if I take compensation from that company, I forfeited my Federal \npension?\n  What is the purpose of this, other than just to basically harass \nMembers of Congress in their retirement?\n  There are certainly situations where a person could forfeit their \npension based on misconduct, for example, or convictions for crime. \nThat is understandable. But this has gone way too far. I hope Members \nof the Senate will read this amendment--it is very brief, two pages \nlong--and in reading it realize this is something that should not be \noffered and if offered should be defeated. It does nothing to make this \na better place to serve. It raises serious questions about the rights \nof individuals who have served the Nation in Congress and what they are \ngoing to do after they leave the service of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the STOCK \nAct. I wish to start by thanking the leaders on the floor, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins, for their hard work and leadership in \nbringing this bill to the floor. There should not be any question that \nMembers of Congress should be held accountable to the same laws to \nwhich every other American is held.\n  That is why in November Senator Gillibrand, Senator Tester, and I \nintroduced the STOCK Act to prohibit Members of Congress from engaging \nin insider trading. This bill is common sense. The American people \ndeserve to know that their representatives in Congress are doing what \nis right for the country and not trying to strike it rich by trading on \ninsider information.\n  My constituents are certainly wondering why this isn't law already, \nand that is a good question. It certainly is a question I asked myself \nlast year when there were news reports raising this issue, and I was \nvery pleased to join immediately with my colleagues to put forward this \nlegislation to make it absolutely clear that insider trading by Members \nof Congress is in violation of the law.\n  I wish to thank, as I indicated before, the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Maine for moving this\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nbill through their committee and bringing it to the Senate floor. I \nappreciate very much the vote of 93 Senators who voted last night to \nmove the bill forward. I think it is a very important example of \nbipartisan support. I hope we will be able to move this forward to a \nsimple up-or-down vote this week and that we will not see extraneous \nissues or obstruction or delay involving this bill. This is very simple \nand very straightforward. I am hopeful we will be able to move it \nforward and accomplish this goal.\n  We need to make sure it is very clear that the same laws to which \neveryone else adheres are held to be true for Members of Congress. It \nis also important to note that our bill creates new reporting \nrequirements for Members of Congress and their staffs, with the reports \navailable online, with a searchable database. That is very important \nfor transparency. It asks the Government Accounting Office to \ninvestigate the so-called ``political intelligence consultants'' who \ncontact Members and staff to get information on how legislation could \naffect their business clients or stock prices.\n  This bill is very simple and very clearcut. We are all engaged in \nconversations on a daily basis that make information available to us, \nand we need to make it very clear as to our responsibilities for \nhandling that information and operating in the public interest.\n  So I am hopeful we will be able to keep this bill focused on the \nintended goal so we can actually get it passed, get it over to the \nHouse, and have the House do the same. It is important that while there \nmay be a number of different issues we all care about that we would \nlike to offer through amendments, we will be able to keep this focused \non the issue in front of us and that we will be able to get this done \nas quickly as possible.\n  Our constituents are certainly looking to us to be able to do this. \nIt would be an excellent way to start the new year by working together \non a bipartisan basis to close a loophole that has created confusion \nabout the responsibilities, the ethics, and the legal responsibilities \nfor Senators as it relates to insider information and potential insider \ntrading.\n  So I am hopeful we can get this done. I appreciate the work of \neveryone who has been involved in helping to get us to this point. \nHopefully, by the end of the week we will have something passed that we \ncan all feel very good about.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how many amendments are pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 amendments pending.\n  Mr. REID. We started this morning at about 11 o'clock. We had to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill, which was \nsupposedly a bill everyone wanted. It is too bad we had to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed, but we did. We have been working all \nday to set up rollcall votes--all day. We thought we had one a few \nminutes ago, but a couple Senators came over and said: There will not \nbe a vote on that unless I am guaranteed votes on mine--even though \ntheir votes are totally not relevant or germane to the subject matter.\n  I appreciate Senator Lieberman and Senator Susan Collins. They are \nfine legislators. They understand what this body is all about and how \nimportant this legislation is and how important they are as managers of \nthis bill. So they are negotiating on several of the amendments.\n  But at some point, Mr. President, this becomes ridiculous. To have \nSenators come over here and say they are not going to allow a vote on \nan amendment unless they are guaranteed votes on nongermane, \nnonrelevant amendments? Then people criticize me for not having an open \namendment process? It becomes a circus. This is not the Senate that we \nhave had or should have. At some point, we need cooperation from \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to set up votes and dispose of these \namendments and move on to passage of the bill.\n  I do not want to have to file cloture on this bill. I just want to \nalert everyone, if we continue the way we are going, where people are \nsaying: You cannot have a vote on any amendment unless I am guaranteed \na vote on my nongermane, nonrelevant amendment--what am I supposed to \ndo to protect this body?\n  So I would hope the night will bring some common sense to some \nSenators. It is really--I will not say embarrassing, but it is a little \nbit, to these two fine Senators who have worked together for years on a \nbipartisan basis on some of the most sensitive issues this country has, \nprotecting the homeland. We could not have two better people working on \na bill to create some bipartisanship. But this is unfortunate and \nunfair and not right, and I, as the leader, am not going to let this \ncontinue forever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his statement \nand thank him for his patience. I know people are critical of the way \nSenator Reid has been forced to operate to try to get anything done, \nbut if you go through a day like we have gone through, you understand \nwhy he has had no choice.\n  Mr. Paul, the Senator from Kentucky, offered an amendment. We had a \nvery thoughtful negotiation with him about modifying the amendment. We \ncame to a meeting of the minds and were ready to go, and then another \nMember said: I will not consent to you voting on Senator Paul's \nmodified amendment unless you promise me a vote.\n  As Senator Reid well knows, in the early years I was here this kind \nof behavior sometimes happened at just before the final vote on a bill \nor perhaps before a recess was about to be declared. But to conduct \noneself in this way at the very beginning of a debate on a bill about \nwhich there is bipartisan support--yesterday, it was clear on the \ncloture motion, only two Senators voted against it. It is a real good \ngovernment bill, and to hold it up in this way is frustrating.\n  I quote the majority leader, who is a straighter talker: It is \nridiculous.\n  So at the end of a long day, we have nothing to show for our labor. I \napologize to the Members of the Senate. But it requires some \nreasonableness from our colleagues to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S202-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Knox College \nin Galesburg, IL, on the 175th anniversary of its founding.\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\n  On February 15, 1837, the Illinois Legislature granted a charter to \nKnox Manual Labor College. Its founder, the Reverend George Washington \nGale, a social reformer from New York, came to the Illinois prairie to \nfound a college emphasizing manual labor that would be open to students \nregardless of their financial means, gender, or race.\n  This egalitarianism and the strong anti-slavery beliefs of Reverend \nGale and his followers gave Knox and Galesburg a unique place in the \nhistory of the abolitionist movement in America. Knox is a nationally \nrecognized part of the Underground Railroad network. Its Old Main was \nthe site of the fifth debate between U.S. Senate candidates Abraham \nLincoln and Stephen Douglas. It was during the debate at Knox that \nLincoln would argue for the first time against slavery on moral \ngrounds.\n  It seems fitting that President Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, and \nPresident Obama, our nation's first African American president, both \nhold honorary degrees from this institution. Knox was also the alma \nmater of Barnabas Root, who in 1870 became one of the first African \nAmericans to earn a college degree in Illinois. In that same year, \nHiram Revels, who also attended Knox, became the first African American \nto serve in the United States Senate.\n  Today, the Knox campus is a vibrant community of world class scholar-\nteachers, staff, and more than 1,400 students hailing from 48 States \nand 51 countries. Manual labor may have been dropped from its name and \ncurriculum--much to the relief of its current students to be sure--but \nKnox's founding commitment to providing a quality education to all \npersists. Of Knox's students today, more than a quarter are first \ngeneration college students, a quarter are U.S. students of color, and \nnearly one third are low-income students. Approximately two thirds of \nstudents receive some form of financial aid, and Knox has been rated by \nPrinceton Review as a ``Best Bang for Your Buck.''\n  I congratulate President Teresa Amott and the entire Knox community \non this milestone in the proud and storied history of Knox College. \nKnox is truly one of our nation's great liberal arts institutions--its \ncontributions far surpass its relatively small size. So, as we look \nback in celebration of Knox's preceding 175 years, we also look to the \nfuture in anticipation of the continued contributions this small \ncollege on the Illinois prairie will make to our State and our country \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S203-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE BATTLE OF MILL SPRINGS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to submit to my colleagues a \nresolution that is very important to the history of the Commonwealth of \nKentucky and the history of our Nation. This resolution, S. Res. 357, \nsponsored by myself and my friend Senator Paul, commemorates the 150th \nanniversary of the Battle of Mill Springs and recognizes the \nsignificance of the great clash of the Civil War that took place there.\n  On January 19, 1862, the Battle of Mill Springs spilled across \nPulaski and Wayne Counties in southeastern Kentucky. It was the second-\nlargest battle to take place in the State, and involved over 10,000 \nsoldiers. More importantly, it was the first significant Union victory \nto happen in what was then considered the western theater of the Civil \nWar. The Union's victory meant that the main Confederate defense line \nthat had been anchored in eastern Kentucky was broken, freeing Union \nsoldiers to move through Kentucky and into Tennessee.\n  One hundred fifty years later, this battle is still a vital story in \nour Nation's history. That is why our resolution also salutes the Mill \nSprings Battlefield Association, which has worked hard to preserve the \nhistoric site and educate the public about what went on there. The Mill \nSprings Battlefield Association has a visitors' center, provides tours, \ndisplays Civil War artifacts and maintains a Civil War library. More \nthan 50,000 visitors have traveled to see the preserved battlefield.\n  So Mr. President, I am proud to submit this resolution to the United \nStates Senate, and proud of the history we have preserved for posterity \nin Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S203-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GARY D. REESE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, every so often, it is my honor as the \nchairman of the Committee on Appropriations to recognize the \noutstanding contributions of members of the Senate family. As anyone \nwho has spent a few years in Washington will know, public service may \nnot be the career of choice for those who hope to be appreciated in \ntheir own time.\n  Benjamin Franklin recognized this back in 1772, when he wrote:\n\n       We must not in the course of public life expect immediate \n     approbation and immediate grateful acknowledgement of our \n     services. But let us persevere through abuse and even injury. \n     The internal satisfaction of a good conscience is always \n     present, and time will do us justice in the minds of the \n     people . . .\n\n  Mr. President, through his 20 years of service in the U.S. Senate, \nGary Reese is an exception to Mr. Franklin's rule. His charm, his \nexpertise, and his professionalism have earned Gary the respect and \nappreciation of Senators, leaders in the executive branch, and his \ncolleagues.\n  Gary's service in the Senate began in 1987, when he joined the staff \nof Senator Bennett Johnston as a legislative assistant for military \nissues. In 6 years of service, Gary demonstrated a great ability to get \nresults for the State of Louisiana and distinguished himself by \ndeveloping a thorough understanding of the shipbuilding industry. Gary \nthen moved to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1993, \nwhere he developed expertise in some of the most technical and \nimportant aspects of our national security.\n  The Committee on Appropriations was extremely fortunate to lure Gary \naway from that prestigious committee in January 1997. As a professional \nstaff member on the Subcommittee on Defense, Gary excelled in oversight \nof acquisition programs in each of the military services, as well as \nclassified matters. Gary departed the Senate in 2002, at which time his \naccomplishments were recognized by the Department of the Navy with the \nMeritorious Public Service Award and by the National Reconnaissance \nOffice with the Gold Medal for Distinguished Service.\n  After 5 years with General Electric, Gary once again answered the \ncall to public service. He rejoined the Committee on Appropriations in \n2007, where he has applied his skills to the most challenging \nintelligence issues that our country has faced in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nthe Horn of Africa, and the Asia-Pacific. His vision and ingenuity have \nmade substantial contributions to our policies and operations in those \nregions, for which I hope the full story may someday be told.\n  Listing Gary Reese's accomplishments during his two decades of \nservice to the U.S. Senate tells only a small part of his story. In an \nera of partisanship and divisiveness, Gary served both Democrats and \nRepublicans with skill and dedication. I feel just as fortunate to have \nhad Gary's assistance as my friend and former colleague, Ted Stevens, \nsurely did.\n  In a capital city filled with bluster and ego, Gary's charm, humor, \nand integrity built trusted relationships in many corners of the \nCongress, the executive branch, and industry.\n  In a job where long hours and late nights can overwhelm even the most \nindustrious public servant, Gary has never forgotten his dedication and \ncommitment to his wife Ann, their son Bob, and their daughter Trish.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of myself and all the staff of the Committee \non Appropriations, I wish to offer Gary and his family my appreciation \nfor his 20 years of service to the Senate, and I wish him all the best \non his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S203-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S203-S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS 112TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Reported below is the information \ndescribing the committee's activities in 2011 in the categories set \nforth in the act:\n\n       (1) The number of alleged violations of Senate rules \n     received from any source, including the number raised by a \n     Senator or\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\n     staff of the Committee: 77. (In addition, 3 alleged \n     violations from the previous year were carried into 2011.)\n       (2) The number of alleged violations that were dismissed--\n       (A) For lack of subject matter jurisdiction or in which, \n     even if the allegations in the complaint are true, no \n     violation of Senate rules would exist: 58.\n       (B) Because they failed to provide sufficient facts as to \n     any material violation of the Senate rules beyond mere \n     allegation or assertion: 14.\n       (3) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry: 08. (This \n     figure includes 3 matters from the previous year carried into \n     2011.)\n       (4) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry that resulted \n     in an adjudicatory review: 0.\n       (5) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry and the \n     Committee dismissed the matter for lack of substantial merit: \n     05. (This figure includes 2 matters from the previous year \n     carried into 2011.)\n       (6) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry and the \n     Committee issued private or public letters of admonition: 0.\n       (7) The number of matters resulting in a disciplinary \n     sanction: 0.\n       (8) Any other information deemed by the Committee to be \n     appropriate to describe its activities in the previous year:\n       In 2011, the Committee continued its preliminary inquiry \n     into the conduct of Senator John Ensign. An outside Special \n     Counsel was appointed to assist the Ethics Committee staff \n     with its fact finding regarding whether Senator John Ensign \n     violated Senate rules and federal law. As noted in the Report \n     of the Preliminary Inquiry into the Matter of Senator John E. \n     Ensign released by the Committee, the Special Counsel \n     determined that there was substantial credible evidence that \n     Senator Ensign engaged in violations of law and Senate rules. \n     The Special Counsel concluded that the evidence that would \n     have been presented in an adjudicatory hearing would have \n     been substantial and sufficient to warrant the consideration \n     of the sanction of expulsion had Senator Ensign not resigned. \n     The Committee lost jurisdiction over Senator Ensign because \n     he resigned his United States Senate seat. The Committee \n     referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice and \n     Federal Election Commission for further review.\n       In 2011, the Committee staff conducted 6 new Member ethics \n     training sessions; 14 employee code of conduct training \n     sessions; 15 Member and committee office campaign briefings; \n     42 ethics seminars for Member DC offices, state offices and \n     Senate committees; 3 private sector ethics briefings; and 8 \n     international ethics briefings.\n       In 2011, the Committee staff handled approximately 10,918 \n     telephone inquiries and 1,745 inquiries by email for ethics \n     advice and guidance.\n       In 2011, the Committee wrote approximately 800 ethics \n     advisory letters and responses including, but not limited to, \n     594 travel and gifts matters (Senate Rule 35) and 104 \n     conflict of interest matters (Senate Rule 37).\n       In 2011, the Committee issued 4,130 letters concerning \n     financial disclosure filings by Senators, Senate staff and \n     Senate candidates and reviewed 1,869 reports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S204-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WELCOMING ELIZABETH MacDONOUGH\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the retiring \nParliamentarian of the Senate, Alan Frumin, who has for the past two \ndecades faithfully and honorably served this institution and who will, \nbeginning tomorrow, embark upon a new chapter in his professional life. \nFor 20 years, Alan has advised the Senate and the hundreds who have had \nthe privilege of serving here with a deft understanding of its rules, \nsome of which can be quite arcane, and an abiding passion for this \naugust body that will reverberate for generations to come. As Alan \ndeparts this Chamber, I extend my personal gratitude to him, wish him \nthe very best, and hope he knows that this country is deeply indebted \nto him for his longstanding service.\n  At the same time, I want to recognize and applaud a milestone moment \nin the life of this venerable institution as we welcome Alan's \nsuccessor, Elizabeth MacDonough, the first woman in the history of the \nSenate to assume the indispensable responsibilities of the \nParliamentarian. Elizabeth, who has served as Senior Assistant \nParliamentarian since 2002, has proved herself to be not only well-\nversed in the labyrinthine procedures of this body but fully prepared \nfor the demanding and often unheralded work of ensuring that my \ncolleagues and I remain within the bounds of proper parliamentary \nprocedure, allowing us to focus less on the operation of the Senate and \nmore on fulfilling the Senate's constitutional role.\n  Since 1931, the Parliamentarian has diligently sat below the \nPresident's rostrum, independently advising the Presiding Officer on \nthe often obscure rules and precedents that guide the process and work \nof the Senate. Tomorrow Elizabeth becomes the first woman in 80 years \nto answer what can only be deemed a calling, and a noble one at that. \nThere are very few who have amassed the considerable experience, \nknowledge, and disposition required to serve with distinction in this \ncapacity. Elizabeth is well-equipped to take on this formidable task, \nand I wish her the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S204-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING UVM PEACE CORPS ALUMNI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend \nthe University of Vermont for its close relationship with the Peace \nCorps. This year, UVM ranked fifth in the Nation among midsized \ncolleges and universities that are the top producers of Peace Corps \nvolunteers. I am proud of the 42 UVM alumni currently serving in the \nPeace Corps around the world.\n  UVM has highlighted Eric Smith as one of its current alumni \nvolunteers. Eric, who is stationed in Costa Rica, is applying his \nbusiness degree by teaching microfinance and helping young women \ndevelop small businesses. He says that such efforts ``would not have \nbeen possible without my education at UVM.''\n  Like Eric, all of the UVM volunteers have devoted 2 years to \npromoting cultural understanding and improving the lives of people in \ncountries such as Cambodia, El Salvador, Tanzania, and Uganda. Some are \nemploying innovative teaching methods to inspire young people. Some \nwork on small farms, increasing food production in rural villages. \nOthers help provide safe drinking water or combat the HIV/AIDS \npandemic. Yet all of the UVM volunteers display an admirable commitment \nto civic engagement with the dream of building a better world.\n  This dream is emblematic of the Vermont spirit. For the second year \nin a row, in 2011 our State produced the most Peace Corps volunteers \nper capita in the Nation. The Upper Valley region of Vermont ranks \neighth in the Nation among metropolitan areas whose citizens are \nserving in the Peace Corps. In 2010, the Burlington area ranked second \nin the same category.\n  As the Peace Corps continues its 50th year of building understanding \nbetween Americans and the citizens of other countries, I want to \napplaud the contributions of Vermonters and the University of Vermont. \nThese volunteers deserve our appreciation and support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a January 25, 2012, Burlington Free \nPress article entitled ``UVM ranks 5th in producing Peace Corps vols.'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 25, 2012]\n\n            UVM Ranks 5th in Producing Peace Corps Volumes.\n\n                       (By the Associated Press)\n\n       Burlington.--The Peace Corps says the University of Vermont \n     ranks fifth in the country in the number of former students \n     who are serving as volunteers overseas.\n       The rankings of medium sized universities released Tuesday \n     show that 42 UVM alumni are serving overseas. The figure is \n     up eight over last year and it moved the school from 13th to \n     fifth.\n       The Vermont alumni work across the globe in programs that \n     include agriculture, education, environment, health and \n     business and youth development.\n       The top producing medium sized college or university is The \n     George Washington University.\n       The overall top producing school is the University of \n     Colorado at Boulder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S204-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S204-S205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HONORING JOSE BUNDA\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, our veterans protected our \ncountry. They have also helped to spread the ideals for which it stands \nand have made great sacrifices for our Nation throughout its history. \nWe thank these patriots for the selflessness and courage they have \nexhibited under the most daunting circumstances.\n  The heroic tales of survival and commitment to service depicted in \nthe history books are a reality for the men and women who served in our \nNation's\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\nuniform while fighting to protect our interests and spread democracy \nworldwide.\n  While many of these patriots gave their lives on the battlefield, \nsurvivors such as Jose Bunda lived to tell some of the horrific events \nhe endured. His firsthand accounts show the realities of WWII. They are \ngut-wrenching but show the human will to survive.\n  Today I wish to recognize the service and sacrifice of one of our \nveterans from the `Greatest Generation' who stood in the face of \ndanger: Jose Bunda. He is a true American hero who lived through the \nworst days of war and told his heroic story of survival.\n  Mr. Bunda grew up in the Philippines and joined the U.S. Army after \ngraduating from high school when he was 18. When the Japanese attacked \nPearl Harbor, Mr. Bunda was stationed on Corregidor Island.\n  In 1942, Mr. Bunda was defending the island against the Japanese and \nalthough his squad was able to hold its ground, he and his comrades \nwere forced to surrender.\n  The realities of war Mr. Bunda experienced is something he always \nremembered. Almost 60 years after he was taken prisoner he recalled it \nas one of the worst times of his life in a story published in the Times \nRecord.\n  Mr. Bunda detailed how he was piled into a boxcar for a ride that \nlasted 18 hours. Once the train stopped at Camp Duo he was forced on \nthe infamous Bataan Death March where he walked day and night with no \nfood.\n  ``Once you fall down, they shoot you or chop off your head,'' Mr. \nBunda said in a 1999 interview saying it was a miracle that he \nsurvived.\n  He was a prisoner of war for 2 years, working in a Japanese labor \ncamp but escaped and joined a guerrilla unit until the end of the war.\n  Mr. Bunda's will to survive triumphed over the atrocities he was put \nthrough in WWII. Despite all the hardships, violence and massacres he \nwitnessed, he remained committed to the military and continued his \nservice in the Korean War.\n  Mr. Bunda and his wife Rosario came to the United States in 1957 when \nhe was stationed at Fort Chaffee. Although his career required him to \nmove to other military bases, the couple moved back to Arkansas in 1962 \nonce he retired from the military after 30 years of service.\n  In 2000, Mr. Bunda received many of the medals, awards and \nrecognitions he deserved for his heroics and service. Of his 16 medals, \nhe said he was proudest of his Silver Star and the Prisoner of War \nmedals.\n  A veteran, a POW and a member of Disabled American Veterans, Mr. \nBunda lived his life as a loving husband, devoted father and an \ninspirational grandfather. Today we honor the life and legacy Mr. Bunda \nleaves behind. His heroic tales of survival and commitment to service \nhave ensured he will be remembered with the highest regard as a great \nAmerican hero. His sacrifices made to secure victory and peace for all \nfreedom loving people of the world will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S205-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE UNI-CAPITOL WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Uni-\nCapitol Washington Internship Programme, UCWIP. Our Nation has \nbenefited from the service of outstanding Australian college students \nwho participate in internships throughout the U.S. Congress through \nthis program.\n  The program is providing students with the opportunity to obtain \nconsiderable experience through their congressional internships, while \nalso making available other educational experiences throughout their \ntime in the United States. Uni-Capitol Washington Programme interns \nhave helped me serve Idaho constituents, and I am grateful for their \nefforts and dedication.\n  Chris Colalillo, a UCWIP participant, has joined my staff as an \nintern this semester. Chris is studying bachelor's of law and arts at \nthe University of Western Australia, where he is double majoring in \npolitical science and international relations and ancient history. When \nhe graduates, Chris plans to work in a law firm and eventually go into \nFederal or State politics. Chris has been great to work with, and he \nwas very quick to learn his role and responsibilities in the office. He \nis very intelligent, eager, and always puts forward his best work. He \nhas shared with us some of the political and cultural differences \nbetween the United States and Australia, and it has been a great \nlearning experience for both Chris and the staff.\n  Chris shared his impressions regarding the program and his \ninternship. He said:\n\n       The UCWIP has been a unique opportunity to further my \n     knowledge in the legislative process of the United States, \n     enabling me to develop an appreciation for democratic systems \n     of government as well as providing me with practical \n     experience that will facilitate my theoretical studies in \n     Political Science and International Relations. The welcoming \n     nature of the staff within Senator Crapo's office has made \n     this internship an enjoyable experience thus far.\n\n  Eric Federing, UCWIP's director and founder, has successfully focused \nhis Capitol Hill and Australia experiences to provide this valuable \neducational exchange opportunity that benefits Australian students and \ncongressional offices. His dedication to advancing this learning \nexperience is remarkable.\n  I have been honored to have worked with the Uni-Capitol Washington \nInternship Programme for 5 years. The program is shaping young leaders \nwho are helping to deepen understanding between our two nations while \nproviding outstanding constituent support. I commend Chris Colalillo, \nEric Federing, and the other Uni-Capitol Washington Internship \nProgramme participants and interns for their achievements and wish them \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S205-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S205-S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING BIG BROTHERS BIG SISTERS OF NEW YORK\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National \nMentoring Month. This month we recognize the millions of Americans who \nhave joined together to better the lives of others, especially our \nyouth, through the gift of mentorship. The generosity and willingness \nof individuals to work together for the common good has been a hallmark \nof the American character since our Nation's founding.\n  Every day volunteer organizations across the country make substantial \ncontributions to our Nation by fostering a place and sense of \nmentorship. One such extraordinary organization is the Big Brothers Big \nSisters of New York City. Founded in 1906, Big Brothers Big Sisters of \nNew York City is the oldest and largest youth mentoring organization in \nthe United States, serving more than 3,000 young people annually. The \nmission of Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City is to provide \nmentors to all children who need caring adult role models. These \nmentors change the lives of New York City's youth by expanding their \nhorizons and helping them to realize their potential.\n  Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City is unique in that it offers \na variety of individualized mentoring programs that match dedicated \nmentors, or Bigs, to special populations of youth, or Littles. These \ninclude a New American Mentoring Program for immigrant youth, a Young \nMothers Mentoring Program for pregnant teens or teenage mothers, an \nIncredible Kids Mentoring Program for children with a learning or \nphysical disability or chronic disease, a Building Futures Mentoring \nProgram for youth who are in the foster care system, and a Children of \nPromise Mentoring Program for children who have an incarcerated parent, \nsibling, or family member. Two additional special mentoring programs \noffered at Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City that have a \nnational significance are their 9/11 Together We Stand and FDNY \nPartnership Programs. These are unique mentoring programs for children \nwho lost a parent or close relative in the World Trade Center attacks \nand those who lost a parent in the FDNY in the line of duty, including \nbut not limited to September 11. So as you can see, Big Brothers Big \nSisters of New York City is doing their part to ensure that all \nchildren have positive role models in their life no matter what their \ncircumstances may be.\n  National Mentoring Month highlights the need and significance of \nmentors and mentoring for individuals of all ages. From organizations \nto individuals, mentoring enriches children's education and overall \nsuccess in life.\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\nThe small investment a mentor makes in the life of a child \nexponentially increases the success of a child's future and the success \nof the community. National Mentoring Month is particularly significant \nfor Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City because it offers a \nspecial opportunity for the organization to raise awareness of the \npower of mentoring and recruit volunteer mentors, which are critical to \nits mission of providing children with caring adult role models. By \nupholding the principles of volunteerism and academics, we continue \ncreating positive opportunities for the next generation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nmonth of January as National Mentoring Month so we may continue to \nhonor the important work that organizations such as Big Brothers Big \nSisters of New York City play in making our Nation a better and more \nprosperous place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S206-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S206-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S206-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2041.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 2044. A bill to require the Under Secretary for Science and \nTechnology in the Department of Homeland Security to contract with an \nindependent laboratory to study the health effects of backscatter x-ray \nmachines used at airline checkpoints operated by the Transportation \nSecurity Administration and provide improved notice to airline \npassengers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naimed at ensuring that the health of American travelers is not placed \nat possible risk as our airport security technology evolves. I am very \npleased to be joined by Senators Akaka, Coburn, Scott Brown, and Levin, \nwho are cosponsoring this bill.\n  Our bill has two major components. First, it would require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, \nin consultation with the National Science Foundation, to commission an \nindependent study on the possible health effects of the x-ray radiation \nemitted by some of the scanning machines we see and pass through in our \nairports. Second, it would give airline passengers, especially those \npassengers in sensitive groups such as pregnant women, clear notice of \ntheir ability to choose another screening option in lieu of exposure to \nionizing radiation.\n  Some advanced-imaging technology--or AIT--machines rely on x-ray \nbackscatter technology. Time and time again, I have expressed my \nconcern over their use, particularly since there is an alternative \nscreening technology available. While the TSA has repeatedly told the \npublic that the amount of radiation emitted from these machines is \nextremely small, passengers and some scientific experts have raised \nlegitimate questions about the impact of repeated exposure to this \nradiation.\n  Last November, during a hearing on aviation security before our \nHomeland Security Committee, the TSA Administrator, John Pistole, \nagreed to my\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\ncall for an independent study to address the lingering health concerns \nand questions about this additional and repeated exposure to radiation. \nShortly thereafter, however, he appeared to back away from this \ncommitment, suggesting that a forthcoming report by the Department of \nHomeland Security's inspector general might be a sufficient substitute \nfor a new, completely independent, thorough study.\n  Chairman Joe Lieberman and I wrote to the Administrator to press for \nmore details about TSA's plans for an independent study. Two weeks \nlater, having received no reply, I sent another letter to Administrator \nPistole asking why he believed the IG report on TSA's use of \nbackscatter machines was a sufficient substitute for an independent \nstudy of the health impacts. TSA's response lacked any detail as to why \nthe agency no longer believes an independent study on the health \neffects of x-ray backscatter machines is warranted, nor did it explain \nhow the IG's review would be a sufficient substitute for an independent \nstudy. That is why I have introduced this bill today.\n  Late last year, the European Commission announced that ``in order not \nto risk jeopardizing citizens' health and safety,'' it would only \nauthorize the use of passenger scanners in the European Union that do \nnot use x-ray technology. This prohibition gives even more need and \njustification for an independent study of the safety of the AIT \nmachines.\n  Some respected experts have warned Congress and the administration of \nthe potential negative public health risks posed by the x-ray \nbackscatter machines. They note that while the risk that someone might \ndevelop cancer because of his or her exposure to radiation during one \nscreening by such an AIT machine is very small, we simply do not truly \nknow the risk of this radiation exposure over multiple screenings for \nfrequent flyers, those in vulnerable groups, or TSA employees \nthemselves who are operating these machines.\n  When a person is scanned by these machines, they receive a dose of \nradiation--what experts in the field call a direct dose. During the \nscan, some of the radiation is not absorbed but is scattered in random \ndirections from the person being scanned. Experts call this the scatter \ndose. Some experts point to anomalies between the scatter dose \nreportedly associated with these scanners and the scatter dose \nassociated with comparable medical technology. Specifically, the \nscatter doses for these AIT machines are higher in relative terms than \nscatter doses for comparable medical devices. What is troubling is that \nthe experts are not sure why the AIT scatter doses are higher. They \npoint to possible deficiencies with the testing equipment or the poor \nplacement of the testing equipment as possible explanations. Overall, \nthey say this anomaly could point to higher direct dose rates and \nshould be yet another impetus for an independent study.\n  Additionally, some experts note that the safety mechanisms in these \nmachines that would prevent them from malfunctioning have never been \nindependently tested. This means that if a machine malfunctions and the \nsafety features designed to shut the machine down in such an instance \ndo not work, a traveler could receive a higher dose of radiation. \nPregnant women, children, the elderly, and as much as 5 percent of the \nadult population are more sensitive to radiation exposure. At a \nminimum, this suggests the need for further independent study.\n  Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues a tragic episode \ninvolving the daughter of two of my constituents. She underwent \nscreening at the airport with a backscatter x-ray AIT. She was pregnant \nand directed by TSA to a line for a backscatter x-ray AIT machine. She \nwas completely unaware that she was entering into an x-ray emitting \nmachine before she stepped into it. She thought it was the more \ntraditional magnetometer. Afterward, she was distressed to know she had \nexposed her unborn child to x-ray radiation. Had she realized ahead of \ntime, she clearly would have opted for the alternative screening \nmethods. Only 2 weeks later, she suffered a miscarriage which she \nattributes to the radiation she received from this scan. We will never \nknow for certain the cause of this family's loss, but they believe in \ntheir hearts that the backscatter radiation is to blame.\n  Clearly, at a minimum, this young woman should have been informed by \na prominent sign that an alternative means of screening was available. \nThat is why my bill also requires TSA to have larger, understandable \nsigns at the beginning of the screening process, not later when it is \nonly noticed, if at all, after a lengthy wait in line. Signs should \nalert passengers that pregnant women, children, and the elderly can be \nmore sensitive to radiation exposure. These signs should also make \nclear that passengers can opt out of this type of scanning.\n  I have urged TSA to move forward using only radiation screening \ntechnology, but in the meantime, an independent study is needed to \nprotect the public and to determine which technology is worthy of \ntaxpayer dollars. Surely passengers should be well informed of their \nscreening options.\n  We Americans have demonstrated our willingness to endure enhanced \nsecurity measures at our airports if those measures appear to be \nreasonable and related to real risks. But travelers become frustrated \nwhen security measures inconvenience them without cause, cause privacy \nor health concerns, or when they appear to be focused on those who pose \nlittle or no threat.\n  On this particular issue, Senators Akaka, Coburn, Scott Brown, Levin, \nand I agree that we are past the time when an independent review of the \nscanning technology that emits radiation must be undertaken. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in quickly passing this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Brown of \n        Massachusetts):\n  S. 2050. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \ncertain provisions of the Creating Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce along with Senator \nLandrieu the Small Business Tax Extenders Act of 2012, that will \nprovide targeted tax relief legislation to small businesses and extend \nthe essential tax relief provisions that were included in the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act of 2010, P.L. 111-240.\n  When the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 was crafted, Senator \nLandrieu and I worked closely with Finance Committee Chair Baucus, \nthen-Ranking Member Grassley, and now Ranking Member Hatch to ensure \nthe critical small business tax provisions that reflected our shared \npriorities were included in that legislation. We sincerely appreciate \nall of their hard work on that legislation.\n  As the former Chair and now Ranking Member of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, and along with current Chair Landrieu, \nwe are well aware of the urgent imperative of job creation in our \ncountry. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average \nannual unemployment rate for 2011 was 9 percent. For the past 3 years, \nunemployment has been no lower than 8.3 percent, so we are far from \nwhere we need to be in a recovery. About 45 percent of the unemployed \nhave been out of work for at least 6 months--a level previously unseen \nin the 6 decades since World War II.\n  At a time when 14 million Americans are still unemployed, and have \nbeen so for the longest period since record keeping began in 1948, our \ngovernment should be taking every possible step to ease the burden on \njob creators. We must help create an environment that is conducive to \nsmall businesses' job creation. Our Nation's small businesses are the \nengine of job creation, being responsible for at least 60 percent and \nperhaps as many as \\2/3\\ of all new jobs created, and they should be \nthe focus of our support. One critical way to do so is through targeted \nsmall business tax incentives.\n  The bill Senator Landrieu and I are introducing today provides those \ntargeted tax incentives that in the past have received bipartisan \nsupport both in the Senate and in the House. These tax provisions \nprovide relief to small businesses in their capital investments and to \nthose willing to risk their own savings by investing in the small \nbusiness. The provisions provide relief to the self-employed as well as \nto S corporations and partnerships. The success of these provisions \nover the past\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\nseveral years is evident in the fact we noted above, about small \nbusinesses being the one bright spot of job creation even in these \ntroubled times, and this bill will help them continue to grow and \ncontinue to help provide jobs.\n  The lifeblood of a small business is its cash flow and this bill \ncontains several provisions to improve it. One of these provisions will \naddress a fundamental injustice of the tax code by extending the \ndeduction for health insurance premiums against not only income taxes \nbut also against payroll taxes. At a rate of 15.3 percent, the self-\nemployment, or SECA, tax is imposed on the health benefits of business \nowners. This is a costly injustice that makes health insurance just \nthat much more expensive at a time when insurance costs are already \nprohibitively expensive.\n  In the coming years we will certainly see health premiums rise, \nmaking it all the more onerous on small businesses to provide critical \nbenefits to their employees. Allowing the full deduction for health \ninsurance is critical for its affordability. I was thrilled that we \nwere able to address this injustice in the Small Business Jobs Act of \n2010, and I sincerely hope that this provision can be extended again \nuntil we can find a permanent solution.\n  This legislation will also extend a provision permitting general \nbusiness credits to be carried back 5 years and taken against the \nAlternative Minimum Tax, AMT. Before the enactment of the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act, a business's unused general business credit could be \ncarried back to offset taxes paid in the previous year, and the \nremaining amount could be carried forward for 20 years to offset future \ntax liabilities.\n  The 5-year carryback of credits will allow business owners to reach \nback to prior years when they had taxable income to offset prior tax \nliability with these credits and get immediate cash infusion. Business \nowners can use this cash as they choose, but as we have seen with net \noperating loss relief, they use these funds for anything from meeting \npayroll to investing in new equipment. The same principle applies with \nrespect to the provision that allows credits to be used against the \nAMT.\n  When Congress implements policies through the tax code, it is with \nintent that businesses will utilize such incentives to do what they do \nbest, and that is to grow their operations, which in turn leads to \nhiring additional employees. Unfortunately, during a struggling \neconomic cycle that we have been experiencing for more than 3 years, \nbusinesses do not have income tax liability that can be offset with a \ncredit. It is rather simple: if you do not have enough revenue to claim \na credit, that credit is of little use to you.\n  An incredible benefit of the carryback and the use of general \nbusiness credits against the AMT is to make health insurance more \naffordable for business owners to offer to their employees.\n  This bill would also extend the availability of the so-called Section \n179 expensing to give businesses the option of writing off the cost of \nqualifying capital expenses in the year of acquisition instead of \nrecovering these costs over time through depreciation, and allow \nbusinesses to take advantage of higher limits for the so-called Section \n179 expensing. Under this provision, up to $250,000 can be expensed for \nreal property and up to $250,000 for equipment, or up to the full \n$500,000 for just equipment.\n  Expanding Section 179 expensing has been a significant Small Business \nCommittee bipartisan priority of mine and Chair Landrieu's, as well as \nof former Small Business Committee Chair Kerry, as reflected in no \nfewer than three separate bills in the previous Congress.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that this provision is expected to \nconfer a major economic boost because it certainly speeds up the \nrecovery time on these investments. Extending this provision will help \nthe businesses modernize while aiding construction firms and their \nemployees.\n  Additionally, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided for a \ntemporary reduction in the recognition period for S corporation built-\nin gains tax. When businesses convert from a C corporation to an S \ncorporation, they have been required to hold their appreciated assets \nfor a full decade or face a punitive level of double taxation. In such \ninstances, first the built-in gain corporate tax rate of 35 percent is \napplied and then all other applicable federal, state and local \nshareholder tax rates are applied, often totaling near 60 percent in \nmost states, including Maine. In effect, the built-in gain tax locks-up \nbusinesses' own capital and forces them to look elsewhere--a particular \nchallenge for S corporations since closely-held businesses have limited \naccess to the public markets and therefore fewer options for raising \nneeded capital.\n  Recent law changes temporarily shortened this holding period to 7 \nyears, but that is still too long. By infusing capital--that is, \nreleasing their own capital--this provision in the Small Business Jobs \nAct, reducing the holding period from 7 years to 5 years, enabled \ncompanies that have long been S corporations to redeploy this capital \nto invest in and grow their businesses. Extending this provision also \nunderscores how vital access to capital is for small businesses, while \npreserving the original policy intent of the holding period and making \nit more reflective of the shorter business planning cycles of the 21st \ncentury.\n  A final provision would extend a complete exclusion on capital gains \nattributable to small business stock held for five years. Extending \nthis measure will help further critical investment in our nation's \nsmall businesses. This is a longstanding priority of mine and of \nSenator John Kerry--former Chair of the Small Business Committee and my \nfellow colleague on the Finance Committee. The Kerry-Snowe Invest in \nSmall Business Act of 2009 included this exclusion, which we fought to \nincorporate into the Small Business Jobs Act. Chair Landrieu and I are \nvery pleased to take-up that mantle together and we are committed to \nits extension.\n\n  But targeted small business tax provisions, for all their importance \nand critical need, are not enough. That is why as a senior member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, I have been urging this administration to \nchampion tax reform, and, in fact, I led a panel on the issue as part \nof the Economic Summit at the White House more than three years ago.\n  The individual income tax form has more than tripled in length from \n52 pages for 1980 to 174 pages for 2009. American taxpayers spend 7.6 \nbillion hours and shell out $140 billion--or one percent of GDP--just \nstruggling to comply with tax filing requirements. This is not \nsurprising as there have been 15,000 changes to the tax code since the \nlast overhaul in 1986.\n  Alarmingly, the tax code is also needlessly restricting our ability \nto compete in today's integrated global economy, as we strain under the \nsecond highest corporate tax burden in the industrialized world. And \nwhile this Administration and the Senate majority are pondering whether \nwe should reform our tax code, small businesses continued to struggle \nwith the current tax regime at the expense of creating more jobs and \ngrowing operations.\n  While I continue to advocate for comprehensive tax reform, there are \ncertain measures that, although not a silver bullet, should be passed \nright away to help improve the economic environment for small \nbusinesses. The Small Business Tax Extenders Act is a critical example: \nthis legislation contains provisions that Senator Landrieu and I have \nchampioned for years to provide small businesses greater cash flow, \nincentivizing their investments, and increasing tax fairness.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that we pass these small business tax \nextensions. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so we can \nensure that our Nation's small businesses and their employees are \nprovided with much needed tax relief.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2050\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend \nthe reduced interest rate for Federal Direct Stafford Loans; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleagues \nSenators Whitehouse, Sanders, Stabenow, and Franken legislation to stop \nthe student loan interest rate from doubling on July 1 of this year.\n  This is an issue that weighs heavily on many of Rhode Island's \nstudents and families who rely on student loans to finance college. \nRhode Island's college graduates have the ninth highest student debt \ntotal in the Nation, according to a recent study by the Project on \nStudent Debt. In Rhode Island, 67 percent of students graduating from \nfour-year colleges and universities in the 2010 school year had debt \naveraging over $26,300.\n  Nationwide, the Department of Education estimates that more than 10 \nmillion students will borrow subsidized Stafford Loans in fiscal year \n2012. Unless we act soon, they will see their interest rates double for \nthe upcoming academic year.\n  In 2007, Congress made a historic investment in higher education by \npassing the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. Included in this law \nwas a provision that reduced the fixed interest rate on Stafford Loans \nfor undergraduate students from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over a 4 \nyear period, easing the financial burden on millions of students and \ntheir families.\n  This was the right investment to make for our future. Today, \neducation, particularly higher education, is even more essential than \never. In 1980, the gap between the lifetime earnings of a college \ngraduate and a high school graduate was 40 percent. In 2010, it was 74 \npercent. By 2025, it is projected to be 96 percent. Since at least the \n1980s, we have not been producing a sufficient number of college-\neducated workers to meet the demand of a more sophisticated and \nchallenging economy driven by global competition. Indeed, our country \nlags behind in college education, ranking 14 in international \ncomparisons of college graduates. For young adults, ages 25 to 34, we \nrank 16.\n  This is no time to make financing a college education more expensive \nfor middle class families. Yet, absent enacting this legislation, that \nis what will happen. According to an analysis by U.S. PIRG, allowing \nthe interest rate to double could cost borrowers who take out the \nmaximum $23,000 in subsidized student loans approximately $5,000 more \nover a 10-year repayment period.\n  The subsidized student loan program for undergraduates is highly \ntargeted to low- and middle-income families. Approximately 37 percent \nof the dependent borrowers in this program come from families with \nannual incomes of less than $40,000. An additional 21.6 percent of \nstudents receiving subsidized students loans come from families with \nincomes between $40,000 and 60,000 per year. These students receive \nvery little, if any, benefit from the Pell grant program but still have \nsignificant financial need. The subsidized student loan program is our \nmain vehicle for addressing that need.\n  Tax loopholes and giveaways that let the biggest companies ship jobs \noverseas cost roughly $37 billion over ten years. Loopholes like this \none should be ended, with those savings used to prevent an increase in \ncollege costs, which are already a crushing burden on families. Indeed, \nthose savings are more than enough to extend the student loan interest \nrate at least through the next reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct, expected in 2014. I would that my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will support helping millions of middle class families finance a \ncollege education over continuing to provide incentives for companies \nto take jobs and their investments overseas. In his State of the Union \nAddress, President Obama called on Congress to prevent this doubling of \nstudent loan rates. As families continue to struggle with the rising \ncost of college and newly minted graduates face one of the toughest job \nmarkets since the Great Depression, it is vital that we protect middle \nclass families and their children from higher student loan rates.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S212, January 31, 2012, the Record reads: . . . \ngraduates face the toughest job market since the Great Depression \n. . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . graduates \nface one of the toughest job markets since the Great Depression . \n. .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and pressing for \npassage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2051\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 360\n\n       Whereas 1 in 6, or 19,200,000, women in the United States \n     have at some point during their lifetime experienced stalking \n     victimization, during which they felt very fearful or \n     believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed \n     or killed;\n       Whereas, during a 1-year period, an estimated 3,400,000 \n     persons in the United States reported that they had been \n     victims of stalking, and 75 percent of those victims reported \n     that they had been stalked by someone they knew;\n       Whereas 11 percent of victims reported having been stalked \n     for more than 5 years, and 23 percent of victims reported \n     having been stalked almost every day;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 victims reported that stalkers had used \n     email, instant messaging, blogs, bulletin boards, Internet \n     sites, chat rooms, or other forms of electronic monitoring \n     against them, and 1 in 13 victims reported that stalkers had \n     used electronic devices to monitor them;\n       Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic \n     measures to protect themselves, including changing identity, \n     relocating, changing jobs, and obtaining protection orders;\n       Whereas 1 in 7 victims reported having relocated in an \n     effort to escape a stalker;\n       Whereas approximately 1 in 8 employed victims of stalking \n     missed work because they feared for their safety or were \n     taking steps to protect themselves, such as by seeking a \n     restraining order;\n       Whereas less than 50 percent of victims reported stalking \n     to police, and only 7 percent of victims contacted a victim \n     service provider, shelter, or hotline;\n       Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the \n     laws of all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     territories of the United States;\n       Whereas stalking affects victims of every race, age, \n     culture, gender, sexual orientation, physical and mental \n     ability, and economic status;\n       Whereas national organizations, local victim service \n     organizations, campuses, prosecutor's offices, and police \n     departments stand ready to assist stalking victims and are \n     working diligently to develop effective and innovative \n     responses to stalking;\n       Whereas there is a need to improve the response of the \n     criminal justice system to stalking through more aggressive \n     investigation and prosecution;\n       Whereas there is a need for increased availability of \n     victim services across the United States, and such services \n     must include programs tailored to meet the needs of stalking \n     victims;\n       Whereas persons aged 18 to 24 experience the highest rates \n     of stalking victimization, and rates of stalking among \n     college students exceed the prevalence rates found in the \n     general population;\n       Whereas as many as 75 percent of women in college who \n     experience stalking-related behavior experience other forms \n     of victimization, including sexual or physical victimization, \n     or both;\n       Whereas there is a need for effective responses to stalking \n     on campuses;

Res. 362\n\n       Whereas, although dating violence, domestic violence, \n     sexual violence, and stalking affect women regardless of age, \n     teenage girls and young women are especially vulnerable;\n       Whereas, according to the National Intimate Partner and \n     Sexual Violence survey recently conducted by the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (referred to in this preamble \n     as the ``CDC''), the majority of victimization starts early \n     in life, as most victims of rape and intimate partner \n     violence first experience such violence before age 24;\n       Whereas, according to the Liz Claiborne Inc. 2009 Parent/\n     Teen Dating Violence Poll, approximately 1 in 3 adolescent \n     girls in the United States is a victim of physical, \n     emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner, a rate that \n     far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence \n     affecting young people;\n       Whereas, according to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance \n     System (referred to in this preamble as the ``YRBSS'') of the \n     CDC, nearly 10 percent of high school students have been hit, \n     slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or \n     girlfriend during the past year;\n       Whereas, according to the American Journal of Public \n     Health, more than 1 in 4 teenagers have been in a \n     relationship where a partner is verbally abusive;\n       Whereas, according to a survey conducted by the YRBSS, \n     almost 20 percent of teenage girls who were exposed to \n     physical dating violence did not attend school on 1 or more \n     occasions during the 30 days preceding the survey because the \n     girls felt unsafe at school or on the way to or from school;\n       Whereas a violent relationship in adolescence can have \n     serious ramifications for the victim, putting the victim at \n     higher risk for substance abuse, eating disorders, risky \n     sexual behavior, suicide, and adult revictimization;\n       Whereas being physically or sexually abused makes teenage \n     girls--\n       (1) up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant; and\n       (2) more than twice as likely to contract a sexually \n     transmitted disease;\n       Whereas, according to a recent study published in the \n     Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, more than \n     half of teenagers and young adults treated at an inner-city \n     emergency room reported having been a victim or perpetrator \n     of dating violence;\n       Whereas nearly 3 in 4 ``tweens'', individuals who are \n     between the ages of 11 and 14, report that dating \n     relationships usually begin at age 14 or younger, and \n     approximately 72 percent of students in eighth or ninth grade \n     report dating;\n       Whereas 1 in 5 tweens report having a friend who is a \n     victim of dating violence, and nearly half of tweens who are \n     in relationships know a friend who is verbally abused;\n       Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as \n     parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know little \n     or nothing about the dating relationships of tweens;\n       Whereas, according to the Liz Claiborne Inc. 2009 Parent/\n     Teen Dating Violence Poll, although 82 percent of parents are \n     confident that they could recognize the signs that their \n     child was experiencing dating abuse, a majority of parents, \n     or 58 percent, could not correctly identify all the warning \n     signs of dating abuse;\n       Whereas 74 percent of teenage boys and 66 percent of \n     teenage girls say they have not had a conversation with a \n     parent about dating abuse in the past year;\n       Whereas, according to a National Crime Prevention Council \n     survey, 43 percent of middle and high school students \n     reported experiencing cyberbullying during the past year;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship report having been \n     called names, harassed, or put down by a partner through the \n     use of a cell phone, including through texting;\n       Whereas 3 in 10 young people have sexted, and 61 percent of \n     young people who have sexted report being pressured to do so \n     at least once;\n       Whereas, according to the Liz Claiborne Inc. 2010 College \n     Dating Violence and Abuse Poll, 43 percent of college women \n     who date report experiencing violent and abusive dating \n     behavior;\n       Whereas 70 percent of college students who experienced \n     relationship abuse failed to realize that they were in an \n     abusive relationship at the time, and 60 percent of college \n     students who were in an abusive relationship said that no one \n     stepped in to help them;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to be greater in cases where a pattern of \n     violence was established during adolescence;\n       Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of \n     addressing teen dating violence, and successful examples of \n     such programs include education, community outreach, and \n     social marketing campaigns that are culturally appropriate;\n       Whereas educating middle school students and the parents of \n     those students about the importance of building healthy \n     relationships and preventing teen dating violence is key to \n     deterring dating abuse before it begins;\n       Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are \n     also necessary for young victims and abusers; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Teen Dating Violence \n     Awareness and Prevention Month will benefit schools, \n     communities, and families regardless of socioeconomic status, \n     race, or sex: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of February 2012 as ``National \n     Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month'';\n       (2) supports communities that are empowering teenagers to \n     develop healthier relationships throughout their lives; and\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States, including \n     young people, parents, schools, law enforcement officials, \n     State and local officials, and interested groups to observe \n     National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month \n     with appropriate programs and activities that promote \n     awareness and prevention of teen dating violence in their \n     communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S214-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 363--CONGRATULATING THE PITTSBURG STATE UNIVERSITY \n GORILLAS FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2011 NCAA DIVISION II FOOTBALL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. MORAN (for himself and Mr. Roberts) submitted the following \nresolution;

Res. 286\n\n       Whereas Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a rare and \n     potentially life-threatening genetic disease, affecting \n     between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 people, leading to \n     patients being undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for many years;\n       Whereas HAE is characterized by symptoms including episodes \n     of edema or swelling in various body parts including the \n     hands, feet, gastrointestinal tract, face, and airway;\n       Whereas patients often experience swelling in the \n     intestinal wall, causing bouts of excruciating abdominal \n     pain, nausea, and vomiting, and swelling of the airway, which \n     can lead to death by asphyxiation;\n       Whereas a defect in the gene that controls the C1-inhibitor \n     blood protein causes production of either inadequate or non-\n     functioning C1-inhibitor protein, leading to an inability to \n     regulate complex biochemical interactions of blood-based \n     systems involved in disease fighting, inflammatory response, \n     and coagulation;\n       Whereas HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, and 50 \n     percent of patients with the disease inherited the defective \n     gene from a parent, while the other 50 percent developed a \n     spontaneous mutation of the C1-inhibitor gene at conception;\n       Whereas HAE patients often experience their first HAE \n     attack during childhood or adolescence, and continue to \n     suffer from subsequent attacks for the duration of their \n     lives;\n       Whereas HAE attacks can be triggered by infections, minor \n     injuries or dental procedures, emotional or mental stress, \n     and certain hormonal or blood medications;\n       Whereas the onset or duration of an HAE attack can \n     negatively affect a person's physical, emotional, economic, \n     educational, and social well-being due to activity \n     limitations;\n       Whereas the annual cost for treatment per patient can \n     exceed $500,000, causing a substantial economic burden;\n       Whereas there is a significant need for increased and \n     normalized medical professional education regarding HAE; and\n       Whereas there is also a significant need for further \n     research on HAE to improve diagnosis and treatment options \n     for patients; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes and celebrates May 16, 2012, as Hereditary \n     Angioedema Awareness Day; and\n       (B) supports increased awareness of Hereditary Angioedema \n     (HAE) by physicians and the public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/31/senate-section/article/S222-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S222-S224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Res. 362\n\n   (Designating the month of February 2012 as ``National Teen Dating \n               Violence Awareness and Prevention Month'')\n\n       Whereas, although dating violence, domestic violence, \n     sexual violence, and stalking affect women regardless of age, \n     teenage girls and young women are especially vulnerable;\n       Whereas, according to the National Intimate Partner and \n     Sexual Violence survey recently conducted by the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (referred to in this preamble \n     as the ``CDC''), the majority of victimization starts early \n     in life, as most victims of rape and intimate partner \n     violence first experience such violence before age 24;\n       Whereas, according to the Liz Claiborne Inc. 2009 Parent/\n     Teen Dating Violence Poll, approximately 1 in 3 adolescent \n     girls in the United States is a victim of physical, \n     emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner, a rate that \n     far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence \n     affecting young people;\n       Whereas, according to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance \n     System (referred to in this preamble as the ``YRBSS'') of the \n     CDC, nearly 10 percent of high school students have been hit, \n     slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or \n     girlfriend during the past year;\n       Whereas, according to the American Journal of Public \n     Health, more than 1 in 4 teenagers have been in a \n     relationship where a partner is verbally abusive;\n       Whereas, according to a survey conducted by the YRBSS, \n     almost 20 percent of teenage girls who were exposed to \n     physical dating violence did not attend school on 1 or more \n     occasions during the 30 days preceding the survey because the \n     girls felt unsafe at school or on the way to or from school;\n       Whereas a violent relationship in adolescence can have \n     serious ramifications for the victim, putting the victim at \n     higher risk for substance abuse, eating disorders, risky \n     sexual behavior, suicide, and adult revictimization;\n       Whereas being physically or sexually abused makes teenage \n     girls--\n       (1) up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant; and\n       (2) more than twice as likely to contract a sexually \n     transmitted disease;\n\n       Whereas, according to a recent study published in the \n     Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, more than \n     half of teenagers and young adults treated at an inner-city \n     emergency room reported having been a victim or perpetrator \n     of dating violence;\n       Whereas nearly 3 in 4 ``tweens'', individuals who are \n     between the ages of 11 and 14, report that dating \n     relationships usually begin at age 14 or younger, and \n     approximately 72 percent of students in eighth or ninth grade \n     report dating;\n       Whereas 1 in 5 tweens report having a friend who is a \n     victim of dating violence, and nearly half of tweens who are \n     in relationships know a friend who is verbally abused;\n       Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as \n     parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know little \n     or nothing about the dating relationships of tweens;\n       Whereas, according to the Liz Claiborne Inc. 2009 Parent/\n     Teen Dating Violence Poll, although 82 percent of parents are \n     confident that they could recognize the signs that their \n     child was experiencing dating abuse, a majority of parents, \n     or 58 percent, could not correctly identify all the warning \n     signs of dating abuse;\n       Whereas 74 percent of teenage boys and 66 percent of \n     teenage girls say they have not had a conversation with a \n     parent about dating abuse in the past year;\n       Whereas, according to a National Crime Prevention Council \n     survey, 43 percent of middle and high school students \n     reported experiencing cyberbullying during the past year;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship report having been \n     called names, harassed, or put down by a partner through the \n     use of a cell phone, including through texting;\n       Whereas 3 in 10 young people have sexted, and 61 percent of \n     young people who have sexted report being pressured to do so \n     at least once;\n       Whereas, according to the Liz Claiborne Inc. 2010 College \n     Dating Violence and Abuse Poll, 43 percent of college women \n     who date report experiencing violent and abusive dating \n     behavior;\n       Whereas 70 percent of college students who experienced \n     relationship abuse failed to realize that they were in an \n     abusive relationship at the time, and 60 percent of college \n     students who were in an abusive relationship said that no one \n     stepped in to help them;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to be greater in cases where a pattern of \n     violence was established during adolescence;\n       Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of \n     addressing teen dating violence, and successful examples of \n     such programs include education, community outreach, and \n     social marketing campaigns that are culturally appropriate;\n       Whereas educating middle school students and the parents of \n     those students about the importance of building healthy \n     relationships and preventing teen dating violence is key to \n     deterring dating abuse before it begins;\n       Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are \n     also necessary for young victims and abusers; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Teen Dating Violence \n     Awareness and Prevention Month will benefit schools, \n     communities, and families regardless of socioeconomic status, \n     race, or sex: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of February 2012 as ``National \n     Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month'';\n       (2) supports communities that are empowering teenagers to \n     develop healthier relationships throughout their lives; and\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States, including \n     young people, parents, schools, law enforcement officials, \n     State and local officials, and interested groups to observe \n     National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month \n     with appropriate programs and activities that promote \n     awareness and prevention of teen dating violence in their \n     communities.\n\n                              S. Res. 363\n\n (Congratulating the Pittsburg State University Gorillas football team \n      for winning the 2011 NCAA Division II Football Championship)\n\n       Whereas the Pittsburg State University Gorillas football \n     team defeated the Wayne State University Warriors by a score \n     of 35 to 21 to win the 2011 NCAA Division II Football \n     Championship in Florence, Alabama on December 17, 2011;\n       Whereas Pittsburg State University has more all-time wins \n     than any other NCAA Division II football program and this \n     championship victory, the 4th in the history of the \n     university, continues a long tradition of success;\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\n       Whereas the Pittsburg State University coaching staff, led \n     by second-year Head Coach Tim Beck, the 2011 Liberty Mutual \n     Coach of the Year Award winner for Division II, guided the \n     Gorillas to a final regular season record of 13 wins and 1 \n     loss;\n       Whereas the Gorillas benefitted from strong leadership in \n     the championship game, including senior quarterback and \n     Pittsburg, Kansas native Zac Dickey, who passed for 190 yards \n     and rushed for 68 yards; and\n       Whereas the students, staff, alumni, and friends of \n     Pittsburg State University, along with the city of Pittsburg, \n     Kansas, deserve much credit for supporting the Gorillas \n     football team: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Pittsburg State University Gorillas \n     football team for winning the 2011 NCAA Division II Football \n     Championship; and\n       (2) recognizes the achievements of all the players, \n     coaches, and support staff of the Pittsburg State University \n     Gorillas football team.\n\n                              S. Res. 364\n\n (Recognizing the goals of National Catholic Schools Week and honoring \n  the valuable contributions of Catholic schools in the United States)\n\n       Whereas Catholic schools in the United States have received \n     international acclaim for academic excellence while providing \n     students with lessons that extend far beyond the classroom;\n       Whereas Catholic schools present a broad curriculum that \n     emphasizes the lifelong development of moral, intellectual, \n     physical, and social values in the young people of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Catholic schools in the United States today educate \n     more than 2,000,000 students and maintain a student-to-\n     teacher ratio of 14 to 1;\n       Whereas the faculty members of Catholic schools teach a \n     highly diverse body of students;\n       Whereas the graduation rate for all Catholic school \n     students is 99 percent;\n       Whereas 97 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on \n     to college;\n       Whereas Catholic schools produce students strongly \n     dedicated to their faith, values, families, and communities \n     by providing an intellectually stimulating environment rich \n     in spiritual character and moral development; and\n       Whereas, in the 1972 pastoral message concerning Catholic \n     education, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops \n     stated, ``Education is one of the most important ways by \n     which the Church fulfills its commitment to the dignity of \n     the person and building of community.
