Mr. President, we rarely acknowledge the Chaplain here in \nthe Senate, and we should more often. We are so fortunate as a body to \nhave this good man leading prayer virtually every day. He gives \ntremendous thought to his prayers and what he should say. His prayers \nare always very challenging and encompass the issues we are dealing \nwith.\n  For those of you who are watching him and who don't know anything \nabout this man, he is a role model for what America is all about. He \nwas raised by a single mother, and she would give him a few pennies \neach day that he would memorize a verse of Scripture. I have seen the \nman and his ability to speak volumes. The way he pulls up things he has \nin his brain reminds me of Senator Byrd, who for many years sat right \nhere behind where I am, and who had a remarkable ability to remember \nwhat he read or studied. Admiral Black is the same.\n  So I speak for the whole Senate--not Democrats or Republicans but for \nthis body--in expressing our appreciation for the good work he does, \nnot only the prayers he offers here but the counseling he does on a \ndaily basis here in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1559-9", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1559-S1560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, each day the Senate begins its workday with \na solemn ritual, and we just did. We pledge allegiance to our flag. \nEach day we rededicate our loyalty to this flag and to the fundamental \npillar for which it stands--the right to justice for all. \nUnfortunately, for tens of millions of Americans, that right to equal \njustice under law is at risk, and I am sorry to say it is at risk \nbecause of Republican ideology.\n  More than half the Nation's population--160 million Americans--live \nin parts of this country that have been declared a judicial emergency. \nWhat does that mean? It means that more than half the people in our \ncountry who seek justice in the courts and the judges find that the \ncourts are strained to the breaking point under a backlog so intense an \nemergency has been declared.\n  The Presiding Officer is an expert on bankruptcy and knows how \nimportant filling those bankruptcy slots are. One\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nreason we are slow in filling those bankruptcy spots is, of course, we \nneed more bankruptcy judges, but the bankruptcy judges are chosen by \nour Federal judiciary, trial court judges. They have other work to do. \nThey are so overwhelmed with work to do.\n  People who have businesses that they have problems dealing with \nbecause of Federal laws need to go to court and have those issues \nredressed. There could be injuries suffered that only the Federal \nsystem can relieve them of their responsibilities, such as \ndiscrimination because of age, gender, antitrust cases, business \nrearranging.\n  Mr. President, you have heard the expression ``What are you trying to \ndo, make a Federal case out of it?'' The reason people say that is the \nFederal court system is the place you go to be treated fairly. When I \npracticed law, I had great respect for the State court system, but it \nwas in the minor leagues compared to when I had to go across the street \nto the Federal court--a much different setting.\n  One out of every 10 Federal judgeships is now standing vacant. \nAmericans can no longer rely on fair and speedy trials. The courts \nwhere Social Security cases are heard, appeals are heard, and \ndiscrimination suits are tried--I went through the whole list--simply \ndo not have enough judges to handle the cases brought before them. In \nthese courts, our Federal judges are being forced to limit their time \non the cases they have. We don't want these Federal courts to be like \ntraffic court judges. They have different responsibilities. We want \npeople to say: What are you trying to do, make a Federal case out of \nthis? We want that to mean something. And families and businesses \ntypically wait for years before their civil cases are heard.\n  There are some problems Congress can't solve, but this is not one of \nthose problems. I repeat: This is not one of those problems.\n  The Senate could act tomorrow to put highly qualified judges on the \nFederal bench, judges who are supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  The Senate could act tomorrow to ease the backlog of cases, lighten \nthe load of overworked judges, and shorten the time it takes to see \njustice done in our great country.\n  The Senate could act tomorrow to confirm 22 judges currently ready to \nserve but awaiting Senate action. These are 22 qualified, consensus \nnominees. The overwhelming majority of them received unanimous support \nfrom the Judiciary Committee. They have the support of the Republican \nSenators from their home States. Eleven of these nominees would fill \nvacancies designated as judicial emergencies. I will soon announce \ncloture on all of these to bring to a stop the filibuster being \nconducted on these good men and women who want to serve. We are going \nto file on the 17th. Eleven of these people whom we are trying to get \nconfirmed are nominees from judicial emergency States. Yet the \nRepublicans refuse to allow us to vote on these qualified judicial \nnominees. Republicans have prevented the Senate from doing its \nconstitutional duty, and that is what it is. The House doesn't have to \ndeal with this because our Constitution says it is the obligation of \nthe Senate to confirm or reject the nominations the President sends to \nus. We should have up-or-down votes on these.\n  The kinds of qualified consensus nominees that in years past would \nhave been confirmed in days or weeks now languish for months and months \nwith no action. There are judges on this list who go back to November \nof last year, not because we couldn't have done it--these could be \nconfirmed in a matter of minutes. The vote should be routine.\n  There should not be a fight that delays action on important jobs \nmeasures. Creating jobs is the Senate's No. 1 priority. Republican \nobstructionism is the only thing standing in the way of moving forward \nwith additional work to get our economy back on track. Unfortunately, \nRepublicans have forced our hand. What else can we do? Their endless \nobstructionism has created a judicial emergency in this country time \nand time again. At the end of last year, the Senate Republicans refused \nto allow votes on even one of the 14 judicial nominees awaiting \nconfirmation last year, breaking with the Senate's longstanding \ntradition of clearing the calendar of consensus nominees at the end of \na session. Each of these nominees was well qualified and had bipartisan \nsupport.\n  President Obama's judicial nominations have waited an average of five \ntimes longer to be confirmed than those of President Bush. Look at this \nchart. These are days. President Clinton's were confirmed in a matter \nof about 5 or 6 days; President Bush's, 21 or 22 days. President \nObama's are still skyrocketing. It is really unfair. It is unfair. It \nis not only unfair to the system, but it is unfair to these nominees. \nThey are all well qualified. They received nearly unanimous support. \nThey are all lawyers having to hold their practice back, waiting to see \nwhat is going to happen here. These are lifetime appointments. That is \nwhat the Founding Fathers established.\n  The long waits have nothing to do with the qualifications of these \nnominations. As I have indicated, after waiting months for the Senate \nto act on these judges, they are often confirmed almost unanimously. \nWhat does that say? It says that the wait is dilatory. It is delay for \ndelay's sake. As we know, my friend the Republican leader said his No. \n1 goal in this Congress is to defeat President Obama, and this is part \nof it.\n  President Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       When one undertakes to administer justice, it must be with \n     an even hand, and by rule; what is done for one must be done \n     for everyone in equal degree.\n\n  When we have judicial emergencies all over this country affecting 160 \nmillion people, what President Jefferson said doesn't work. President \nJefferson's principle is as true in America's court system as it is \nanyplace in America, and it should be true in the Senate. One qualified \nconsensus judicial nominee ought to be treated like another regardless \nof political party and regardless of who is President, quite frankly.\n  With the courts already in crisis, the Republicans could not have \nchosen a worse time to play politics with the confirmation process. So \ntoday I regret that I have to file cloture on a package of 17 district \ncourt judges. I hope we can move through these. I hope people are not \ngoing to be doing more dilatory tactics. If cloture is invoked, people \nhave a right under our rules to hold up the next judge in line for 30 \nhours. That will show what this is all about. It will show that it is \nan effort to embarrass the President and not take into consideration \n160 million people who don't have the ability to have their cases tried \nin an orderly manner.\n  The motion to end a filibuster only applies to district court judges \nand trial judges. So I hope Republicans won't continue to filibuster \nappellate judges, our circuit court judges. That would be wrong. We \nwould have no alternative but to take action with that. There is a \nlesser number of those, but they are very important positions.\n  We have so much work to do in this body. We must complete action on \nthat extremely important Transportation bill which will either save or \ncreate 2.8 million jobs. I will work with our Republican leader and \nfinalize a path forward on a bipartisan small business jobs bill the \nHouse passed by a very large margin last week. We must consider postal \nreform legislation, cybersecurity legislation. We have gas prices we \nhave to deal with, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct, and other issues that are important to our country.\n  It is unfortunate that we had to move forward on something that is so \nglaringly wrong. Look at this. These are stats. These are not going to \nchange. President Clinton's are not going to change. Whatever happened, \nhappened. This is not going to change. Whatever happened, happened. \nHere, this number keeps going up. You can go back to a couple of judges \nin November, December, January, February, March. We are up to 5 months \nwith some of these judges.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nleadership on an amendment to the Transportation bill, the Menendez-\nReid-Burr amendment. For short title purposes, it is called the NAT GAS \nbill. This is not a new bill. It is not a difficult bill to understand. \nIt is a game changer as it relates to our energy policy in this country \nand, more importantly, the economic security of our country.\n  I wish to take these 40 minutes to walk through the bill. But before \nI do that, it is essential to say to my colleagues and to their staffs \nand to the American people: If for some reason you believe that in the \nnext 18 months in America we are going to have massive tax reform--\nlower rates, no deductions, no credits, no subsidies--then I want you \nto do me a favor. Turn off your TV. Leave the gallery. I will never \nconvince you this is the right move. In fact, if I believed we were \ngoing to do comprehensive tax reform, I would not be on this floor. I \nwould not be offering this amendment. But the truth is, there is nobody \nin America who believes that is going to happen.\n  Let me say this to all of my colleagues, their staffs, and to the \nAmerican people: If you believe some miraculous thing is going to \nhappen and there is going to be peace in the Middle East--no civil \nwars, no nuclear advancements, no threats--then turn off your TV. Leave \nthe gallery. I will never convince you nor would I be here today if I \nthought that was going to happen.\n  The truth is that as policymakers we are charged with doing things \nbased upon the landscape and the framework we have in front of us. \nToday, in the absence of this body acting--the Congress of the United \nStates--the American people will get exactly what they have gotten: \nescalation of energy costs; that is, to fill their cars, to fill their \ntrucks, to heat their houses. It is felt through the increased costs of \nthe businesses for which they work. This is about personal security. \nThis is about the livelihood of every American.\n  Let me just say now, if you are still with me--if you haven't turned \noff the tube or left the gallery--the single most important reason we \nshould do this is our national security. Our national security is vital \nto this country.\n  Let me just stop and pose a question to my colleagues: Who controls \ntoday our access to and our cost of energy? It is not us. In many cases \nit is people around the world who don't even like us who control \nwhether we are going to have access to oil or what the cost is going to \nbe. Today 70 percent of our oil is imported. So we have 30 percent that \nwe have some ability to control and to access, but for 70 percent of it \nwe are at the whims of other people. We are at the whims of the market. \nThey don't like us, and they don't care what we pay. And, I might say, \nmany of those countries use the dollars we send them to fund \nterrorism--to fund the very people we run into on the battlefield in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and around the world. They aren't concerned with our \neconomy. They aren't concerned with the future of our country or the \nfuture of our children. It is not a very comforting situation to rely \non for our energy, especially with 70 percent reliance on what they \nhave.\n  Let me suggest this requires U.S. dollars to be spent and U.S. lives \nto be put on the line to make sure that day in and day out this country \nhas access to that 70 percent reliance on black gold. Look at the gulf: \nships, sailors, marines, aircraft, all in the gulf to make sure \nsomebody doesn't shut down the Strait of Hormuz; to make sure we have \naccess to that oil. It certainly doesn't cap what we pay at the pump or \nthe taxes we pay to assure that when we need it, it is going to be \nthere.\n  Some claim speculators are the whole problem with the oil industry. I \nwill admit I think around the edges--a couple of cents a gallon--it is \nspeculation; futures traders probably do have a little bit of impact. \nBut it is not significant, and speculators don't control our access to \nit. Our reliance on foreign oil is what judges whether we have access \nto it or not. We must admit our access today is a national security \nthreat.\n  No. 2: Economic security. The Presiding Officer and I know a word \nthat is called LIHEAP, which is the low-income heating program for \nseniors across this country and for individuals who can't afford home \nheating oil. We will spend $5.1 billion this year to subsidize home \nheating fuel. This entire NAT GAS bill--which is a game changer \nrelative to the cost of not just home heating fuel but diesel and \ngasoline--costs a little over $3 billion, and the taxpayers aren't on \nthe hook for one penny of it. I will get to that a little bit later.\n  The U.S. economy is starting to recover. We have seen signs not in \nevery community and not in every sector of our economy, but we see \nsigns that it is moving in the right direction. But there is one common \nthread that all economists agree on: If energy costs go up, we stand \nthe chance of cutting off that recovery. We stand the chance of \nfreezing or increasing unemployment at above the rates they are today. \nHow quickly we recover, how quickly Americans are hired, how quickly \nunemployment goes down, how this affects our balance of trade--we \nhaven't even talked about the individual family budget.\n  Think of what a typical family is faced with today--the cost on a \nweekly basis to fill up that vehicle. Many families have accepted jobs \nnot close to where they live but where jobs are available. They drive \nfrom one community to another. Some drive from one State to another \nbecause that is where the job is. We have had no increase in wages, we \nall know that, but we have seen food prices and gas prices and energy \nprices go up. Here is an opportunity for us to have a real impact on \nthe family budget in America without charging the American people one \npenny to have us do it.\n\n  In my opinion, we should have started new exploration decades ago. \nHad we explored for oil and natural gas--onshore, offshore--had we \nbuilt pipelines, we might not have this problem right now. For those \nwho say we shouldn't do it now because it will be 10 years down the \nroad before we feel the effects, we had this same debate 10 years ago, \nand we had it 18 years ago when I got to the House of Representatives. \nToday we are still talking about the same thing. The only thing that \nhas changed is the price of energy in America.\n  I believe we ought to focus on America and North America, and we \nought to tap those resources in a safe and environmentally friendly \nway, which is, in fact, where technology allows us to go today.\n  My third goal of this bill is energy security. This year we voted \nagainst pipelines. They would have provided some security. We have \nreduced some foreign demand, not much. Today we are reducing \nexploration; we are not increasing exploration at home. Who pays the \nbill? The American people. It is real simple. It is just passing \nthrough and pretty soon we get used to $3.76, which is the national \naverage. In some places in the country it is over $4. But 3 years ago \nthe price of gas was $1.86.\n  I was rated as the seventh most conservative Member of the Senate. \nThis year I bought a hybrid. I bought a hybrid because I was tired of \npaying people money who hate us. I was tired of paying an exorbitant \namount for gasoline. I would personally do anything I could to make \nsure I reduced my consumption and my cost. But the only way I can \naffect every American family is to come to this floor and to change the \npolicies we have in this country in a way that nobody is slighted, \nnobody is cheated, nobody loses.\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n  Somebody said this bill picks winners and losers. Well, I have to \nadmit it does. The winners are the American people and the losers are \neverybody internationally who produces oil. I think that is a pretty \ngood pick. Let me suggest to my colleagues this must stop. It must \nstop, and my suggestion is it should stop tomorrow when we vote on this \namendment.\n  We need an energy plan. We should explore. We should build pipelines. \nIf we did, down the road we would benefit. One might think, well, all \nof this is an accurate depiction of where we are. What would a natural \ngas bill do to change our situation?\n  Well, let me suggest it is about our most abundant, clean, flexible \nfuel. And guess what. It is American. It is found right here at home. \nWhy wouldn't we use as much as possible? Oh, by the way, did I say it \nis cheap? If we look at natural gas as an equivalent to a gallon of \ngasoline, natural gas ranges somewhere between $1.60 and $2.10 at \ntoday's rates. Imagine where diesel is. Imagine where home heating oil \nis. Why? Because technology has allowed us to reach reserves that we \ncould never reach before. It has allowed us to do it in an \nenvironmentally friendly way. It has allowed us to do it at a pretty \nattractive production cost.\n  As a matter of fact, the word in the world is the United States is \nthe Saudi Arabia of natural gas. But nobody looks at us and says: You \nare controlling our access because we can't even figure out what our \npolicy is going to be. Let me suggest--and I think the Presiding \nOfficer knows this--if we produce more than we consume, then we will \naggressively build an infrastructure to ship it all around the world. \nBut if we consume what we produce, there will be an effort to produce \nmore and to produce more and to produce more. When that happens \ntypically the price goes down.\n  So I guess the question in front of this body is, are we going to use \nit for the benefit of the American people or are we going to ship it to \nthe rest of the world? Some in Congress will say that shifting natural \ngas usage through Federal legislation shouldn't be done. Let me be \nclear. I agree 100 percent.\n  The Federal Government is not the one that should be legislating how \nmarkets go. But when I consider the Federal Government, we are speaking \nfor the American taxpayer because usually they are the ones who are the \nbackup funder of everything we pass. This bill does not do it. This \nbill is a 5-year bill, and it sunsets. It goes away. It funds the \nroughly $3.4 billion with a user fee on the exact people who are \nbenefited by it--those natural gas users. You see, the American \ntaxpayer has no skin in this game.\n  They also say the American taxpayers should not fund new credits or \nsubsidies. I agree. These are the two criticisms this bill has \nreceived. I agree with them totally. Read the bill. That is not what we \ndo. We fund it from the people who benefit from the credits and from \nthe subsidies.\n  Now, you might ask, where do we disagree? Policy can, and I think it \nshould, accelerate the usage of natural gas. Some have said there is no \nneed to do this; it is happening all by itself. I agree; another point \nof agreement. It is happening every day in communities across this \ncountry. Ten years from now we might look back on it, and we might have \nmade a little bit of progress. We have an opportunity right now, \nwithout taxpayer funding, to accelerate this move in 18-wheel vehicles, \nin fleet vehicles, in municipal trucks and automobiles. So I think we \ncan, and I think we should, accelerate it.\n  Again, natural gas is the only flexible mobile fuel we have. It is \nnot like there are other options out there we can accomplish this with. \nI believe if credits or subsidies are paid by the users--those who \nbenefit--this a good result, and it is good policy.\n  Think about it for a moment. If you took all of our 18-wheel vehicles \nin America and put them on natural gas, you would reduce consumption of \nforeign oil by one-third. Do you want to know how to bring down the \nprice of gasoline and diesel? There it is. Take one-third of the demand \nand shift it over to natural gas.\n  Fleet vehicle companies--FedEx, UPS; I can sort of name all of them, \nthe in-and-out-every-day companies--they go out in the morning, come \nback in the afternoon, they have one fueling station, and they are \nrunning to go to natural gas. They do not need the incentive. But look \nhow fast they could change their entire fleet if it was there--again, \nwithout one penny of taxpayer money.\n  Municipalities. There is not a municipality in America today that is \nnot challenged from the standpoint of their annual budget. They have \ncut parks and recreation. They are trying to figure out how to do \neducation. Every community is faced with the same thing, decreasing \nproperty values; therefore, the flow of revenues is less than they were \nlast year and the year before.\n  Where is the game changer for municipalities in a natural gas bill? \nIt is very simple. There are 500,000 buses in America, and there are 26 \nmillion kids who get on a bus every day. If we can reduce by one-third \nor more the cost by switching to natural gas, we should be doing \neverything we can to get every school system in America to have a \nnatural gas engine in their schoolbus so the one-third they save goes \nback into the classroom to educate our children; where nobody is faced \nwith trying to decide whether they are going to buy textbooks or have a \nteacher's aide; where every classroom is designed not based upon how \nmuch money we have available but what the educational requirements are \nfor that next generation.\n  For those who suggest this bill does not do anything, I will tell you \none point alone is enough to get up and vote yes when it comes up. It \nis a game changer. It is a game changer to local budgets. More \nimportantly, municipalities get to devote the money to the right \nplaces.\n  Why is a credit needed? It is very simple. It costs money to switch \nan engine. A typical natural gas engine is going to cost somewhere \nbetween $25,000 and $40,000 more than the equivalent diesel engine in \nan 18-wheel vehicle today. But as more and more and more get built, \nwhat we are going to find is that the diesel engine is more expensive, \nand the natural gas engine is cheaper. Wouldn't we accelerate this as \nfast as we could so we could get the benefits of that production shift?\n  Everybody is geared to do it today. As a matter of fact, it is so \ncompelling a reason that Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors have all \nannounced in their light-duty pickups they are going to come from the \nfactory with natural gas. But for a consumer to fuel their vehicle with \nnatural gas, they are going to have a little compressor at home, for \ncompressed natural gas, hooked right up to their natural gas line. For \nan 18-wheel vehicle going from North Carolina to California, it is not \nthat easy. It means we have to have the infrastructure across the \ncountry that enables that to be a feasible business decision for a \ncompany.\n  What does part of the NAT GAS bill do? It creates a credit, a \nsubsidy, so the infrastructure that is needed is out there. Oh, by the \nway, we still have the credit in place for individual consumers who \nwant to have fueling stations.\n  We are not recreating the solar or wind subsidies or credits. We are \nnot recreating an ethanol subsidy for gasoline that Americans have just \nhad a huge distaste for. We are taking not a technology of the future \nand investing in it, we are taking a technology that is here today and \nsaying let's create the incentive for this to explode, for this to be a \ngame changer in the global balance of trade.\n  Why don't some want this? Some do not want this because they use \nnatural gas and they do not want the price to go up. We are sitting on \na 100-year supply of natural gas right now if we do not drill another \nwell. We have companies that are in the business today that--because of \nwhere the price point is and because of where the demand is--are \nthinking about plugging, shutting in natural gas wells because they \ncannot move it out of the country and they cannot sell it here. Yet we \nare on the cusp of being able to create an incentive that is paid for \nby the users that not only keeps those wells open but gives the reason \nfor those companies to actually produce more.\n  America has always proven: If we will buy it, they will build it. \nLook at the automobile industry. We would buy them, and today we are \ngoing everywhere in the world to find the gasoline it takes to put in \nthem. Well, my belief\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nis, if we accelerate the use of natural gas in trucks, fleets, and \nmunicipalities, what we are going to have is another explosion of \nnatural gas finds. We are going to increase supply. If anything, we may \nsee prices drop even further. But without the demand, I can assure you, \nthe future is very predictable.\n  We have this fuel at home. It is on land. There is some offshore, but \nthe majority of the finds are on land. More importantly, this has \nhappened exactly where we need it: Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Dakota, \nOklahoma--and, yes, probably North Carolina and Virginia. The fact is, \nnone of us know today because some areas geologically have never been \nexplored.\n\n  What are the realities? Well, if we can outproduce what we consume, \none of two things will happen. One, we will build an infrastructure to \nsell it all around the world or, two, we will slow the exploration. In \nboth cases the price will go up. Isn't that why people are against this \nbill, because they are scared the price will go up? In fact, this bill \nis the only thing that will keep natural gas prices at a historically \nlow cost. Anything less than this would cause devastation throughout \nthe marketplace.\n  Many say let the markets drive what happens. That is what I am doing. \nIt is exactly what I am doing. This legislation says: Produce as much \nas possible. Shift as much from petroleum as technology will allow us. \nIt is sort of like saying: Let's give the Federal Government a 5-hour \nenergy drink. Let's put this policy on steroids to shift as much as we \ntechnologically can from gasoline and diesel and home heating oil over \nto natural gas.\n  What is the impact on the American people if we do not do this? It \nwould be higher gas and diesel prices. It would be higher costs for all \nthe goods we buy. Sometimes we do not think about the fact that when \nthat trucker pays $4.20 a gallon for diesel--and they have seen their \nprice double in the last 12 months--it is not too long before we feel \nit in the cost of groceries or in other consumer goods or in everything \nwe purchase in the United States. If the energy costs go up for the \nwarehouse that product is stored in, we get it there. If the cost to \nproduce it goes up because the manufacturing process costs a little bit \nmore, it goes up there. This is how inflation happens.\n  Here is a great opportunity for us to get our teeth into inflation \nand cut the primary driver of inflation. I think the byproduct of it \nwould be that we would have almost a magnet in America of capital \nattraction to fuel job creation and to put Americans back to work. See, \nthere is a lot more to an energy policy bill than whether there are \nwinners and losers.\n  What else would the American people be impacted by if we do not do \nthis? Higher property taxes. There is no way around it. There is \nabsolutely no way around it if, in fact, we want the next generation to \nbe educated. We have an opportunity to take one-third of that \ntransportation cost to a municipality and to pump it back into the \nbudget.\n  Well, let me suggest there is another loser. I think the Acting \nPresident pro tempore knows this. If we fail to use this as a flexible \nmobile fuel, most of it is going to be used to generate electricity. \nThey are going to take the easy way out--$50 million to build a natural \ngas generation facility. It is cleaner burning. That makes it very \nattractive to them. The only problem is, we are going to get 30 years \ndown the road, when most of us are going to be looking back--if we are \nstill here--at our children, saying: I cannot believe we made this \nmistake. I cannot believe we locked you in to one fuel for the \ngeneration of all of America's electricity.\n  One of the beauties of America is that we have a mix, and we are \nconstantly changing that mix between coal and natural gas and nuclear. \nWell, we would make a huge mistake if we just left it to today's \neconomics to say: Let's do it all in natural gas. If we did that, we \nwould not have a bridge fuel, we would not have the flexible mobile \nfuel that natural gas provides us. We would be locked in to betting \nthat technology would allow us to run it on solar or something else in \nthe future. I am not sure I can bet on that for my children and my \ngrandchildren. I am not sure we are there. I am not sure we are smart \nenough.\n  I am going to pose a question to the Senate. What if I am wrong? I \nhave been wrong before. What if I am wrong? What if this does not \nhappen? What if there is not an explosion of transition from gas and \ndiesel over to natural gas? It is real simple: The user fee goes away. \nBut we tried something. There is no downside. It is not as if we are \nlocked into something that cost the American people money. If we do not \nneed as much, then we do not need the user fee. It has not impacted, up \nor down, fuel costs if, in fact, we have not pushed things over from \nwhere we are today. No damages; no downside.\n  What if I am right? What if I am right and this is a game changer? \nWell, we continue to grow our production of gas. That creates tens of \nthousands of jobs all across the country. We reduce our need for \nforeign petroleum--game changer in the security of this country. We \nstabilize or reduce the current price of gas, diesel, home heating \nfuel.\n  The more natural gas we leverage, the more dollars we have in our \npockets as Americans. The environmental impact is significantly better \nthan diesel or gasoline. Our economy grows because fuel costs are \npredictable and more investments are made hiring more Americans. \nCommunities and companies can budget. They can budget better because \nwe, not somebody who hates us, have control of our future costs.\n  Prices come down because fuel costs are less and do not go up. The \nless of the family budget goes to fuel, less community budgets go to \nbuses, more goes to our children. I realize this is bold. And, boy, has \nAmerica become risk averse. This is not something I stumbled on \nyesterday. I have been promoting this for 3 years. This is the first \nchance to come to the Senate floor and have a vote. You know what. It \nprobably is not going to pass. That is the disappointing part of it. It \nwill probably fail tomorrow unless my colleagues or their staff, who \nstayed after my first two comments and listened to this, understand \nthat there is not a downside to doing this.\n  Why in the world would we not take this bill and implement it in \nhopes that for the first time we have a piece of energy policy in \nAmerica? I said at the beginning that if this was done by pulling the \nmoney from taxpayers in America, I would never be up here offering this \nbill. But this is the time. It is now. Look at the global landscape. \nLook at the cost of energy. There has never been a more important time \nfor a piece of legislation that drastically changes the future of this \ncountry.\n  I too have been disgusted with government investing our dollars and \npicking winners and losers--mostly losers--in technologies that have \nnot proven to be effective. This is not that. This is using dollars we \ncollect from user fees to accelerate technology that is there today. It \nis just accelerating its use. It is making sure that the future is \nradically different. It is using existing technology to be a game \nchanger. It affects the lives and the livelihood of every American, the \ncommunities we live in, and, more importantly, our children.\n  Maybe this is too simple. Maybe Members of Congress can only get \ndifficult things now. This is easy. It is easy to understand. It is \neasy to see the picture of what it affects. It is easy to understand \nthe impact on the American people. And it is all positive. If you \nimplement it, it has no downside. Why would we not try it and see what \nhappens?\n  If passing this amendment might accomplish what I have described, why \nwould we not do it? We represent the American people. It may be that \ntheir voice needs to be heard before tomorrow when votes happen. This \nrequires vision. I have to admit, it is something that Congress has \nshown very little of of late. This legislation benefits only one \nthing--only one thing--the future of this country, the United States of \nAmerica, the opportunities of our children, the prosperity of the \ngreatest country in the world.\n  If that is important to you, then you ought to support this bill. It \nis important to me, and that is why I am here on a day when the Senate \nhas no business, has no votes, because it was the one time I could come \nhere uninterrupted, without the distractions of all the visitors and \nall the claims, to set\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\nthe record straight about this legislation. It is simple. It is easy to \nunderstand. It impacts everybody in America. It does pick winners and \nlosers. It says: America is going to win, and the people who are not \nour friends are going to lose.\n  I am not sure you can say it any clearer than that. It does not cost \nthe taxpayers a dime. The beneficiaries are the ones who pay the tab. \nIf it does not work, there is no downside. If it does work, it is a \ngame changer from the standpoint of our energy policy and, more \nimportantly, our future.\n  The bill sunsets after 5 years. We have a 100-year supply of natural \ngas today if we did not drill another well. We import 70 percent of our \npetroleum, and that costs $25 billion a month that we send there. \nImagine what that $25 billion could create in jobs here if, in fact, we \nmade this simple policy change.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for your attention and your patience and \nthe patience of my colleagues since I ran over a little bit. But I will \nconclude with this. A bill that roughly costs $3.4 to $3.8 billion and \nis funded by user fees is not a big bill in Washington. But the \npotential impact of this legislation will not only be big in America, \nit will change the landscape of the world. It will put us back in \ncontrol of our national security, of our economic security, and, more \nimportantly, of our energy security. This will be a day that Congress \nwill either be proud or disgusted at the outcome of a policy such as \nthis.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it has not been that long since the \nPresident's health care proposal has been passed. If we recall, it was \npassed on Christmas Eve, after a long battle. We were told: Don't worry \nwhat is in it; we will have to pass it first to find out what is in it. \nI remember Senator Brown was running in the State of Massachusetts, a \nliberal State. He said, If you elect me--and he was running in the \nspecial election--I will vote against it and provide the vote that \nkills it. But the matter was delayed--his appointment and confirmation, \nafter he won his election. It was put off and the interim Senator cast \na vote for the bill and it passed by a single vote and the result was \n60 to 40. I think it was a dangerous step for America.\n  I am the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee and the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin is a member of that committee. We have serious concerns \nabout what is in this bill now that we are beginning to read it and \nbeginning to apply it and see what might happen. Senator Johnson is a \nsuccessful businessman who ran for the Senate and joined us just a \nlittle over 1 year ago. He came here to do something. I have been \nexceedingly impressed with his approach to business. He had looked at \nthese numbers and challenged the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, Secretary Sebelius, on some numbers last week. The situation \nwas quite troubling.\n  Maybe Senator Johnson can tell us about his concern and what he \nraised last week--the economic impact of what happened with jobs, the \nAmerican economy, and the debt of our country. Maybe we can begin our \ndiscussion with where he is coming from and what he observed from his \nexchange last week.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. First of all, I thank the Senator for his \nkind comments. He mentioned that Speaker Pelosi famously stated we \nneeded to pass this bill in order to figure out what is in it. I know \nthe Senator from Alabama and I are dedicated to making sure the Obama \nadministration doesn't make sure this law is fully implemented before \nwe understand the true cost of the bill. We simply cannot afford to \nhave the American people and Members of Congress not understand the \ntrue cost of the health care law.\n  I remind everybody that, back in 1965, when they passed the Medicare \nbill, first of all, the entire bill was less than 300 pages. That is \ninteresting. The provision that applied to Medicare alone was about 124 \npages. That compares, of course, with the 2,600- or 2,700-page bill \nthat the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was. There are \n10,000 pages of regulations just to try to implement this bill.\n  When they passed Medicare, they estimated it out 25 years and said \nthat in 1990, Medicare would cost $12 billion. In fact, in 1990, \nMedicare cost $110 billion, which is more than nine times the original \ncost estimate.\n  I am new here, but I have been watching this town pretty carefully \nover the last few decades. I don't believe Washington has gotten any \nbetter at projecting and estimating figures--particularly on new \nentitlements that people want around here. They always tend to \nunderestimate spending in order to pass legislation, particularly a \nbill such as the health care bill, which was done in partisan fashion, \nwithout any kind of support and input from our side.\n  The point of my question to Secretary Sebelius last week was to try \nto lay out the broken promises that are occurring, when we have only \nbegun to implement the law. The first broken promise I asked her about \nwas the very famous guarantee of President Obama, who said: If you pass \nthis health care law, every single family in America will see their \nannual insurance premium go down by $2,500 by the end of his first \nterm. The Kaiser Family Foundation has already conducted a study and \nhas said that, on average, premiums have gone up about $2,200 per year. \nThat is a $4,700 difference in the first 3 years of his administration \nor only 2 years after it was originally passed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator has been in the real world, having to make \na payroll and manage a company. If he, as a CEO, made a representation \nthat this was going to reduce the cost of insurance for your employees \nby $2,500, and it increases by 2,200, that would be a stunning event, \nwould it not? Does it bother the Senator, as a person from the real \nworld--and this is the first time he has been in elected office--to \nhave people walking around with numbers that are so divergent, \npromising to reduce health care costs, and they actually are driving \ncosts up?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Had I made that guarantee to my \nshareholders and management--and that is basically what the President \ndid; he made that guarantee to the shareholders of America--I would not \nwant to face the appropriations committee meeting, where I would have \nto explain that away. Secretary Sebelius was in a very unenviable \nposition to have to explain how the President promised a $2,500 \nreduction and there was an increase.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is right. I was here. There was a promise \nmade to achieve passage of the bill. A lot of Americans didn't believe \nthese promises and thought they were inflated to begin with, and this \npromise--a fundamental promise--has already been proven to be wildly \ninaccurate. And thank you for raising that.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Of course, that is only the first promise. \nI have a couple more.\n  The administration also famously said this health care law would not \nadd one dime to the deficit. In fact, the original projections were \nthat it would save $143 billion in the first 10 years. Well, \nthankfully, the administration has recognized that the CLASS Act was, \nas Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad said, a Ponzi scheme. It was \nsimply not financially workable. So they are not implementing it. \nBecause they are not implementing it, they are not going to get $86 \nbillion worth of revenue, so that will eat away at that $143 billion of \ndeficit reduction.\n  Of course, a couple of weeks ago when President Obama presented his \nfiscal year 2013 budget, included in that budget was a $111 billion \nrequest--or I\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\nguess cost estimate--on the mandatory spending of the health care \nexchanges. If you add the $111 billion to the $86 billion, that gives \nyou $197 billion of reduced deficit reduction, if that makes sense.\n  So bottom line here is I think that is broken promise No. 2. I do not \nbelieve that in the first 10 years, this thing will actually reduce the \ndeficit. And it is far worse than that. These are the small numbers. \nThis is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the revisions that will \nbe occurring when we actually start finding out what the true cost of \nthe health care law is.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, the promise was that--and it was repeated here, \nand the President went on national TV, and I believe he said it at the \nState of the Union--this bill would not add one dime to the deficit. If \nyou drop out the $80 or so billion--and he estimated that his plan, if \npassed, would actually create $143 billion in surplus, in extra revenue \nfor the Treasury; it wouldn't cost anything, it would create more \nmoney. So you lose $80 or so billion because the CLASS Act has proven \nto be the Ponzi scheme Senator Conrad said it would be, and we just saw \nin the President's budget a request for $111 billion more for the \nexchanges. Well, that already wipes out entirely, does it not, the \npromise that it wouldn't add to the deficit? Even before the bill is \nimplemented, the projections are that it would cost money rather than \nmake money for the Treasury. Is that the Senator's analysis so far?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Exactly. That is broken promise No. 2.\n  Of course, broken promise No. 3 is also--very famously this President \nsaid: If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your \nhealth care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\n  There are a couple of pieces of evidence that prove that is a broken \npromise. First of all, the CBO, in its initial cost estimate of the \nhealth care law, estimated that 1 million people would lose their \nemployer-sponsored care and be put in the exchanges. By the way, that \nis a gross underestimate, and we will talk about that a little later. \nBut also the Department of HHS has granted 1,200 to 1,700 waivers from \nbasically some of the requirements of the health care law. That \nindicates that were it not for those waivers--basically employers \nsaying: Listen, we need some relief here--my concern would be, and I \nthink this is probably pretty true, those employers would be forced to \ndrop coverage. And those waivers cover about 4 million Americans.\n  But let me describe a little bit why I believe the 1 million-person \nestimate is so understated. There have been surveys of employers \nconducted in the last year that indicate that employers, when they take \na look at the whole cost equation of the health care law, 30 to 50 \npercent, in one survey conducted by McKinsey & Company, of employers, \nwhen asked, plan on dropping their health care coverage shortly after \nimplementation.\n  If that were to happen--180 million Americans get their care through \nan employer-sponsored plan. If 50 percent drop coverage, that could \nmean 90 million Americans--not 1 million but 90 million Americans--\ncould lose their employer-sponsored care and then get put in the \nexchanges. We are trying to work with the CBO to find out exactly what \nthat would cost, but in their initial estimate, they estimated that it \nwould be about a $7,000 average subsidy per person in the exchange.\n  If you deduct for the $2,000 penalty and the deductibility of the \nhealth care cost, that subsidy could range anywhere from a $4,000 to \n$5,000 cost to the government times 90 million. Instead of $95 billion \na year, the health care law could cost us close to $\\1/2\\ trillion if \n50 percent of the employers drop their coverage.\n  This is incredibly scary. And my colleague is fully aware, because he \nhas been a real leader in terms of our debt and deficit, as Admiral \nMullen has said, the greatest threat to our national security is our \ndebt and deficit. We can't afford to increase our deficit on an annual \nbasis by close to $\\1/2\\ trillion. If everybody were to lose their \ncoverage--which, by the way, is exactly what I think this plan was \ndesigned to do: lead to a single-payer system, which is what I believe \nPresident Obama really wanted--that would cost us close to $1 trillion \na year. That represents a deficit risk that will absolutely ensure the \nfinal bankruptcy of this Nation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, Senator Johnson has been talking about this issue \nfor some time, and it looks as though reports are coming along to \nvalidate his concerns. But the administration estimated that only 1 \nmillion would go into the exchanges, and these are the areas where, if \nyou don't have employer-based health care, the government will \nsubsidize your health care program for you, and it costs the Treasury \nmoney. This is how we get in financial trouble, when we make bad \nestimates.\n  The Senator thinks the numbers that go into the exchanges could dwarf \n1 million. How many could it be, based on the reports the Senator has \nseen?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Well, I worked with former CBO Director \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin in trying to look at the numbers that are \npresented, and we don't have enough. We don't have enough information, \nwhich is why I am grateful for the fact that Director Elmendorf \nrecognized that there is some credible evidence to cause the CBO to \nreassess that estimate of 1 million people. So they are working through \nthose numbers right now. Hopefully, they will give us a very full \naccounting of that in the next couple of weeks. But the work I did with \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin showed that if 90 million get put in those \nexchanges, it could cost over $400 billion a year.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is astounding.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. That is astounding.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Now, for example, $400 billion a year over a 10-year \nwindow would be $4 trillion. If the Budget Control Act that we worked \non so hard last summer, which the President is already undermining, \nwere to take place, it would only reduce spending over 10 years by $2 \ntrillion. And this would be an unexpected $5 trillion, $4 \ntrillion added on top of that, would it not?\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Exactly.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And it is not baked into the numbers now. We are not \nassuming it is going to be $4 trillion or $5 trillion more under \nObamacare, we are assuming only 1, I guess.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. And, unfortunately, we are not even owning \nup to the current deficit projections. We are not seriously addressing \nthat. So nobody really wants to take a look at the danger inherent in \nthis. Of course, the administration doesn't want to talk about it or \nadmit to it because they want to go full speed ahead to implement it so \nwe will not be able to reverse it. That is the main point.\n  It is time to put the brakes on the implementation of the health care \nlaw before it bankrupts this Nation. We simply can't afford to fully \nimplement it to find out what the true cost is. It will be disastrous \nfor our deficit and debt.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, is it too late? Is this a fait accompli, this \nhealth care law that was passed? Can we not reverse it or is it, in the \nSenator's opinion, practical at this point for us to pull back from \nthis path?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. It is essential that we pull back, and it \nis essential that we put the brakes on this. I guess we can all keep \nour fingers crossed and hope the Supreme Court rules the individual \nmandate unconstitutional, and there is no severability clause, so the \nentire law would be repealed, so we can then actually fix the problems \nin the health care system with patient-centered, free market-based \nreforms. That is the way to really address this.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, the Senator raised these issues with Secretary \nSebelius last week in the committee, and the exchange has been on the \nTV and on the Web and has become a bit of a sensation, really. People \nhave been looking at it, and it has been very troubling.\n  Would the Senator tell us what troubles him about Secretary \nSebelius's answers--or her lack of them--and what you think we should \ndo next?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Again, I am an accountant. I have been in \nhundreds of budget meetings, and when you are presenting your budget to \na budget committee, you are armed with the information and you are \nready to answer questions.\n  I was surprised that the Secretary was unable to answer the \nquestions, and particularly when I mentioned the\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nwaivers, she seemed to have no idea what I was talking about. It is her \nagency, her department that is actually granting those waivers. So that \ntroubles me.\n  So I appreciate the fact that the Senator has and we have sent a \nletter to Budget Chairman Conrad requesting, to be fair to Secretary \nSebelius, to give her a chance to be fully prepared to come before us \nand to explain what is this $111 billion in additional requested funds \nfor the exchanges. And I would like to really dig down and talk about \nthis 1 million-person estimate and what is going to be the effect if \nthe administration is wrong, if CBO has been wrong in the previous \nestimate and the McKenzie study is right and half the people very \nquickly after implementation get dropped from their employer coverage \nand put in the exchanges. What effect is that going to have on our \nbudget?\n  I would love to give and I think it is appropriate to give Secretary \nSebelius the opportunity to come before our Budget Committee and have a \nfair exchange in terms of her explanation for those parts of her \nbudget.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, a $111 billion error is a big deal. You think \nabout it. We brought in $2,200 billion, and this is $100 billion--about \n5 percent of the entire estimated revenue we had in the government last \nyear. To miss that on one part of one bill is very troubling to me. We \nare fighting every day, wrestling with a highway bill, and we came up \n$2 billion short over 2 years. And the whole bill is held up, votes on \nit, points of order raised on it, and here, blithely, into the \nPresident's budget comes another $111 billion. I am sure there can be \nsome explanation for it, but I really do think the American people, \ndon't you, are owed a prepared Secretary before the Budget Committee \nwho can lay out explanations for what this is so we will know how much \nover cost we already are on this plan.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. It is $100 billion here, $100 billion \nthere, and it starts adding up to real money, doesn't it.\n  And so people don't think these 90 million people getting dropped \nfrom their employer coverage is a fantasy, it is not. It is realistic. \nI bought health care for the last 31 years, and the decision an \nemployer is going to make is going to be easy. It is not going to be a \ncomplex management decision. Because of the health care law, an \nemployer is going to be faced with saying: OK, I can pay $15,000 for \nfamily coverage or I can pay the $2,000 penalty. And because of the \nhealth care subsidies, they are not exposing their employees to \nfinancial risk, they are making them eligible for huge subsidies. If a \nhousehold earns $64,000, they will be eligible for a $10,000 subsidy \nthrough those exchanges.\n  Now, I know that probably sounds pretty good, but the problem is, \nwhen we are already running $1.3 trillion a year deficits, we can't \nafford to add another $\\1/2\\ trillion per year to those deficits, if \nthat were to happen. We simply can't afford it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So you are an employer. You have employees, and you \nhave been helping them, you have been providing health coverage, and \nyou realize, well, I can cancel my employer contributions, let the \nemployee go to the exchanges, and they will be subsidized by the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. That is essentially it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Where is the money coming from that will provide the \nextra money they will need to get full coverage?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. And if you don't drop coverage, you are \ndenying the people who work with you the chance of taking advantage of \na $10,000 subsidy.\n  We have created an incentive in this health care law for employers to \ndrop coverage and a high-level subsidy to get coverage for the people \nwho work with them. We have created that incentive, and when government \ncreates incentives, when government dangles a huge subsidy in front of \npeople, we know the history of how that works--people take advantage of \nthose subsidies. And that is my concern.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What about a new business--some small business starts \nup, and they are thinking about whether they are going to provide \nhealth care for their employees, and they have the option of the \nexchanges. Do you think a new business would be even more likely to not \nprovide coverage and let the employee go to the subsidized exchange?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Sure. Because they know their cost is going \nto be $2,000 per employee.\n  The Senator was telling me a story earlier about some employers in \nAlabama that because it is a low-margin business, they simply can't \nafford to offer health care. The result of the health care law--why \ndoesn't the Senator tell the story.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had a number of people in a meeting I was at explain \nthe realities of it.\n  They told us the whole fear of regulation and the health care bill \nand the revenue that is going to be extracted from them to pay for it \nwould result in lesser employees, making it impossible for them to \nprovide the coverage. One told me they could lose as many as 70 \nemployees. I remember that figure.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Again, this law will cost jobs. It is going \nto blow a hole in our deficit, and we haven't even talked about the \nquality aspect; how it is going to harm the health care system, how it \nwill lead to rationing, and the type of medical motivation.\n  The Senator heard the story about my daughter and these marvelous \nsurgeons. When my daughter was first born with a serious congenital \nheart defect, one of these wonderful human beings came in at 1:30 in \nthe morning and saved her life. Then, 8 months later, when her heart \nwas the size of a plum, they reconstructed the upper chamber of her \nheart so that now her heart operates backward.\n  We are going to limit those types of innovations that saved my \ndaughter's life. We are not going to have that type of advancement in \nmedicine if the government takes over control of our health care \nsystem.\n  So the effect on our budget--the uncertainty in terms of how it is \ngoing to destroy and explode our deficits versus the harm it is going \nto cause the quality of care--leads to rationing, lower innovation. \nWhen it is all put together, I think the greatest single priority we \nhave to have moving forward is we have to make sure the brakes are put \non this health care law, that it is repealed, and, again, replaced with \npatient-centered, free market-based reforms.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is not fully implemented yet. There are a lot of \nopportunities for us to get off this train before a disaster occurs. I \ntruly believe it is not too late for us to alter the course.\n  I think the American people have never been happy with it. They have \nbeen told they wouldn't have to give up their health care. They were \ntold it was going to bring down the cost curve and reduce the costs, \nand they were told it was going to pay for itself; there would be more \nmoney coming in than the bill would cost.\n  Would the Senator say all three of those promises have now already \nbeen proven false?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Absolutely. Look at the name of it, the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It is not going to protect \npatients.\n  If we are going to lower the quality of care, if it is going to \nresult in rationing, if it limits innovation, how does that protect \npatients?\n  The affordable care act, the Senator just ticked off the three \nreasons it is not going to be affordable: It is going to drive up \ncosts. It is not bending the cost curve down. It is a fiction. The \nhealth care law is a fiction. I am so appreciative of the Senator's \nefforts at again making sure that, before this bill is fully \nimplemented--we both are dedicated to making sure the American people \nfully understand the full, true cost of this health care law both on \nquality and the effect on our budget.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will add one more thought to the costs, and I have \nlooked at this very carefully.\n  On December 23, the night before the bill passed, I got a letter back \nfrom the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, who also had \nstated it would create a surplus in the bill of $143 billion based on \nconventional accounting procedures. I asked him: Were they not double \ncounting the money, about $400 billion? Were they not double counting \nit, counting it as income to Medicare and counting it as money \navailable to fund the bill here, President Obama's ObamaCare? Weren't \nthey using the money twice?\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\n  Think about that. Here we are on the eve of a vote, December 23, the \nvote is tomorrow morning, December 24, and we are not agreed on whether \nthe money is being double counted. He wrote back and said it is being \ndouble counted, ``although the conventions of accounting might suggest \notherwise.''\n  The way they scored this bill was carefully done by experts to get \nthe score they got, that it would make a surplus of $140 billion. But \nthe money was Medicare money. They raised taxes for Medicare. They cut \ncosts for Medicare. It created some money in Medicare, but the money \nwas borrowed by the U.S. Treasury and spent on this new program. The \nmoney is owed to the Medicare trustees, who are trustees by law. They \nare holding debt instruments from the United States. But because it is \nan internal debt, it doesn't score. That may seem complicated, but it \nis not. Trust me, they borrowed this money. Sooner or later, when \nMedicare is going into deep financial distress, they will call their \nbonds from the Treasury and the Treasury is going to have to pay it, \nand they are going to borrow the money on the open market is what they \nare going to do so they can pay the Medicare trustees the money they \nborrowed from them. This is not a good way to do business. That is just \none of the additional problems we have with this.\n  But, I thank Senator Johnson for focusing on all these issues but \nparticularly for raising the cost of the exchanges. Because that, by \nany estimate--wouldn't the Senator agree--is a dangerous number. It \ncould surge above the number we are at. Does the Senator think most any \nperson, even if they thought it would be 1 million people, would have \nto admit it could be 5, 10 or 20 million people? Nobody knows for sure.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Exactly. That is why I am so thankful that \nCBO Director Elmendorf understands there is some pretty credible \nevidence to have the CBO revisit that estimate.\n  I spoke with him last week. It looks like they are working hard to \nprovide us that information. I am looking forward to seeing that and \nseeing what their revised estimate is for the number of people losing \ntheir coverage, but even more important, to figure out what that per \nperson cost is.\n  Maybe we will not agree. He might do a very economic analysis. \nCertainly, somebody such as myself who actually bought health care \nunderstands the mindset and the decision of an employer. But even if we \ndisagree on the number of people, if we have that total dollar amount \nof cost per person in that exchange, we will be able to show that to \nthe American people. So if he comes up with X and I say, no, it is X \nplus 30, 40, 50 million people, then at least the American people have \nthat information, and they can judge for themselves what they think the \nrealistic estimate is for people losing their coverage and getting \ntheir insurance through the subsidized exchanges. That information is \nwhat the American people deserve, and that is why I am so appreciative \nof the Senator's efforts. I know he is going to be, just with me, \nmaking sure that, again, we know what the true cost of this health care \nlaw is before we implement it.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have to know that. We have a responsibility, as \nrepresentatives of the people, to understand are we talking about \nanother $100 billion in cost over just 1 year's time that we weren't \nexpecting.\n  I believe the Budget Committee is a good forum to have that. The \nSenator and I serve on that committee, and I hope Senator Conrad can \nagree and would agree to give Secretary Sebelius an opportunity to \nstate her view of the situation.\n  I have to say, I am more and more convinced that we cannot afford \nthis health care bill. We cannot afford it. We don't have the money. We \ndon't have the money. I think it will damage health care, and we have \nhad a lot of debate and experts tell us that, and it will reduce the \nquality of care in America. But what I am saying to the Senator is, we \ncan't afford it, and it threatens the financial viability of our \nfuture. We need to save Medicare and Social Security, the programs we \nhave. It would be a terrible tragedy if we start off on another \nprogram. As the Senator talked about Medicare 30 years ago, 40 years \nago, it surged way beyond any estimate they would ever have expected in \nterms of costs.\n  If we start on another program, I don't see how this country can \nsustain it. The entitlements we have today are now taking up about 60 \npercent of the entire budget of America: Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid. Over 50 percent, almost 60 percent of our entire spending \ngoes for those three programs. To start another massive new program, \nwhen those are all unsound financially and in crisis and need to be \nfixed, is the height of foolishness, in my opinion.\n  I hope we can have a good hearing. I thank the Senator for his \nleadership; he is a great addition to the Budget Committee. I thank him \nfor spending hours digging into these numbers, bringing his business \nand accounting skills to bear, and letting our lawyer bunch benefit \nfrom somebody who can actually add and subtract.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to respond to some \narguments made in a recent opinion article by the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate and House Budget Committees, respectively. It is \nentitled ``GOP Budget Attacks Misguided.'' The crux of the piece is \nthat President Obama has made great progress in improving the economic \noutlook, and it would improve even more if only Republicans would \nembrace his policies.\n  The first set of claims I want to respond to relates to the strength \nof the economic recovery. The authors write that ``we've come a long \nway'' since the peak of the recession thanks to ``actions taken by the \nObama administration'' and have had ``23 consecutive months of private-\nsector job growth.''\n  To start, I don't think the 12.8 million unemployed Americans would \nagree we have come a long way. Indeed, it has been 2\\1/2\\ years since \nthe recession technically ended, and we are still experiencing the \nweakest recovery since the Great Depression. Growth is anemic, and \nthere are 700,000 fewer employed Americans today than when President \nObama took office.\n  Although it has been 3 years since passage of the stimulus bill, \nunemployment has been above 8 percent for the last 35 months. Remember, \nthis legislation was sold as a way to keep unemployment below 8 \npercent. These are some of the signs that ``actions taken by the \nadministration'' are not working to get Americans back to work or \nimproving the economy.\n  Regarding the claim that America has had 23 consecutive months of \nprivate sector job growth, the President has been citing this number on \nthe campaign trail, averring that 3.7 million jobs were created during \nthat time. But the claim doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Those who cite \nit don't account for the role new workforce entrants play in employment \nstatistics.\n  Economists generally agree that for employment to hold even, about \n150,000 jobs must be created each month to employ new entrants into the \nworkforce. These people include those who recently concluded military \nservice or family obligations and recent graduates. If we multiply \n150,000 by 23 months, we get about 3.45 million jobs. That means even \nby the administration's own figures, only about 250,000 new jobs have \nbeen created in roughly 2 years.\n  Moreover, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the net \npositive increase in payrolls was above 150,000 during just 9 of the 23 \nmonths to which the set referred. So, yes, it would have been nice to \nhave 23 consecutive months of private sector job growth, but that is \nnot what happened. Again, we need 150,000 just to stay even with the \nnew people entering the workforce, and in only 9 of these 23 months did \nthe economy produce that many jobs.\n  The second set of claims I want to discuss relates to supposed blame \non\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\nRepublicans for the debt and the hampering of a stronger recovery. The \nauthors of this op-ed claim that ``while the deficit has remained high \nover the past 3 years, that is largely a result of the policies of the \nprevious Republican administration.''\n  Let's take a look at the actual deficit numbers. Labeling the last \nthree deficits as ``high'' is quite an understatement. According to \nPresident Obama's own budget numbers, in 2009 the deficit was $1.4 \ntrillion. In 2010 the deficit was $1.3 trillion. In 2011 it was, again, \n$1.3 trillion. The deficit this year is expected to top $1.3 trillion.\n  At the end of the budget window, in 2022, the deficit is projected to \nbe $704 billion. The highest deficit under President Bush was $458 \nbillion, in 2008. Every deficit under President Obama has been almost \nthree times that figure--more than double. But President Obama should \nnot be accountable for the debt problem? How does that work?\n  The President and his supporters like to point out that the budget \ncontains $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years. But \nmost of this reduction is based on new taxes and gimmicks, such as \nalleged ``savings'' from actions that Congress has already taken or \nfrom ending operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  As a USA Today editorial quoted today:\n\n       [The budget] relies on gimmicks and avoids some problems \n     instead of tackling them. . . . Most glaringly, Obama takes \n     credit for about $850 billion in savings from winding down \n     the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were paid for with \n     borrowed money in the first place.\n\n  These were not actual savings. The Committee for a Responsible Budget \nput it this way:\n\n       When you finish college, you don't suddenly have thousands \n     of dollars a year to spend elsewhere. In fact, you have to \n     find a way to pay back your loans.\n\n  Regarding the supposed problem of Republican resistance to demand-\nbased policies, there is a major misconception that consumption fueled \nby government spending actually creates jobs. This is the stimulus \nmyth. It does not. It just inefficiently moves money around from one \npocket to another or one taxpayer to another. That helps explain why \nthe stimulus failed.\n  If Americans cannot spend enough money to stimulate more demand, how \ncan the Government accomplish that for us? It is our money that is \nbeing spent. Simply put, demand policies do not work. There have been \nample opportunities to prove otherwise in recent years. Let's remember \nthe President got everything he wanted from Congress during his first 2 \nyears in office. He has been in office a little over 3 years. The first \n2 years there was a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate. The 111th \nCongress passed all of the demand-based policies he asked for: \nspending, temporary tax credits, tax holidays, the stimulus. Yet here \nwe are.\n  A better idea is to encourage economic activity and greater \nopportunity through the supply side of the economy. That means reducing \ngovernment consumption of taxpayer dollars and not raising taxes on \nanyone, especially job creators.\n  That brings me to the third set of claims involving the notion of \n``balance.'' The authors claim the budget ``calls for a balanced \napproach . . . with everyone sharing responsibility for deficit \nreduction.'' They also note that balance is ``missing from the GOP \napproach.''\n  Balance in the Obama budget, of course, means higher taxes. I ask how \nis it balanced to tax job-creating small businesses even more than they \nare being taxed today?\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, nearly 750,000 flow-\nthrough businesses--these are the small businesses, the businesses that \npay their taxes as individuals--nearly 750,000 would be subject to the \nPresident's proposed tax rate hikes that would take effect on January 1 \nof next year. One-quarter of our Nation's workforce depends on these \nemployers for a paycheck.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, up to \n25 percent of the workforce is employed by businesses that will be \naffected by the President's proposed tax hikes. Perhaps job growth is \nso slow because these job creators are skittish because they do not \nhave certainty, and they certainly have not for a long time. In fact, \nthe only thing they can see is the President's attempts to impose more \ntaxes on them.\n  The specter of tax hikes has loomed for years and has inhibited job \ngrowth. If the tax increases actually occur, we can be sure any \neconomic growth we might be perceiving will be killed.\n  Finally, the authors claim the President ``has demonstrated that he \nwas willing to go the extra mile to reach a bipartisan deficit \nreduction agreement.'' I will note that the debt talks fell apart last \nsummer because the President dug in his heels and insisted on harmful \ntax increases that Republicans, of course, opposed, for the reasons I \njust noted. When we had another opportunity to do something about the \ndebt this fall, the President was not particularly helpful or \nencouraging. Often missing in action, he never participated in the \nprocess. The plan put forward by the Republican Senator from \nPennsylvania at the time was the only balanced approach that put \nsignificant revenue on the table in the context of progrowth tax \nreform.\n  The majority whip called it a ``breakthrough,'' but it was never \nenough for the other side. So here we are, still debating this subject. \nSo much for the President going the extra mile.\n  In conclusion, I would like to say the President's budget is more of \nthe same spending, taxes, and debt we have seen for the last 3 years. \nLast year the budget was so unpopular with the American people that the \nSenate voted it down 97 to 0. Not a single member of the President's \nparty voted for his budget. The massive amounts of spending, taxing, \nand borrowing in his budget will hinder an economic recovery. In times \nlike these we have to focus on growing our economy, not our Government \nand debt.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Republican leader, I ask \nunanimous consent, notwithstanding any other rule of the Senate, that \nimmediately following the disposition of the pending Transportation \nbill, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3606, a bill \nreceived from the House, which would increase American job creation and \neconomic growth by improving access to the public capital markets for \nemerging growth companies; I further ask that the bill remain the \npending business to the exclusion of all other business until it is \ndisposed of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, last week the \nHouse passed their jobs bill. The purpose of that bill was to loosen \nsecurities regulations for small businesses. It is what they call a \njobs act. It is not going to create a lot of jobs, but it is important \nlegislation. The House passed a bill 390 to 23 last Thursday. The White \nHouse issued a statement supporting the legislation.\n  This piece of legislation clearly needs to be brought before the \nSenate as soon as we can. We will work to get a consent agreement and \nprovide for the consideration of a handful of amendments to the \nlegislation. I would be more than happy to work with the Senator to get \na short time agreement for its consideration.\n  One of the issues I alert my friends to is that we have been working \ndiligently for a way to get the Import/Export Bank reauthorized. It is \nso important to do that. I met recently with the head of Boeing. It is \nso important for their business and many other businesses. It is a job-\ncreating measure.\n  I am not going to have that hold up this legislation, but at least I \nam going to have a substitute we can dispose of\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\nquickly if I can't get my friends to agree to do this, to have a vote \non that. There are a few things we need to do.\n  I suggest to everyone I know how important this is to get finished. I \ndon't need anybody to suggest we are not going to do that. We are. I \nwish to get it done this work period. In Senate time, that is pretty \nfast because we don't have the bill yet from the House. That is why I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate what the majority leader said. \nHe is right about the importance of the legislation approved by \nmajorities of both parties of the House of Representatives. I join him \nin hoping we can bring this to the floor as soon as possible with an \nagreement so we can consider it and try to provide some economic growth \nso people can go back to work in America.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise to speak about the issue of \njudicial nominations. Our Nation faces a serious problem: 1 out of \nevery 10 Federal judgeships is vacant. Yet we continue to see--\nunfortunately and sadly--unprecedented obstruction from the other side \nof the aisle when it comes to these nominations. Right now on the \nExecutive Calendar of the Senate there are 22 judicial nominations \npending. Twelve of these 22 were successfully voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee last year, 2 of them as far back as October, and 17 \nof the nominees currently on the calendar were voted out with strong \nbipartisan support. Additionally, 13 of the 22 nominees who are being \nheld have the approval of the Republican Senator from the State where \nthe nomination has been made.\n  Despite the fact these nominations are not controversial, that they \npassed by a bipartisan vote in the Judiciary Committee and out of the \ncommittee, they still languish on the calendar because of Republican \nobjections.\n  I know people get tired and say: I wish you all weren't so partisan \naround here. Well, I hate to give a speech where most will say that is \njust a partisan speech, but we are talking about nominees who have \nbipartisan support, with a strong vote coming out of committee being \nheld on the calendar. Despite the fact they are noncontroversial, there \nhave been objections to up-and-down votes. All we ask for is to just \ngive them a vote. It is not right. Unfortunately, it is a new \ndevelopment in the Senate.\n  It used to be when a noncontroversial district or circuit court \nnominee was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with \nbipartisan support, that nominee would literally be approved on the \nSenate floor usually by voice vote within a matter of days. Even when \nthere were battles over the controversial Supreme Court or appellate \ncourt nominees, the Senate never obstructed a noncontroversial nominee \nat the same time, especially at the district court level.\n  When President Obama took office, Senate Republicans adopted a new \nand disturbing strategy. They began refusing to give their consent to \nschedule votes on almost all judicial nominees. You say to yourself: \nWell, what is their strategy? It is very apparent. They are praying, of \ncourse, that a Republican will be elected President and they can fill \nthe vacancies. They want them to continue to have empty seats on our \njudicial courts for the remainder of this year until the election. \nPresident Obama's nominees have been subjected to an unprecedented \nlevel of obstruction by the Republicans, more than any other President \nhas received.\n  Listen to this: President Obama's district court nominees have waited \nan average of 93 days on the Senate Executive Calendar between a \ncommittee vote and a floor vote. How about George W. Bush? How long did \nhis nominees sit on the calendar before Democrats would let them have a \nvote?\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\nOnly 24 days. So 93 days under the Republicans, 24 days under the \nDemocrats.\n  President Obama's confirmed circuit court nominees have been forced \nto wait an average of 136 days for a floor vote. President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees waited an average of 29 days. So 136 days, way \nover 4 months for the Obama nominees, and less than 1 month for the \nBush nominees.\n  Overall, at this point in their terms, President Obama had 131 \nnominees confirmed at the Federal, circuit, and district court level \ncompared to 172 for President Bush and 183 for President Clinton. It is \nso obvious the Republicans are stopping worthy bipartisan nominees for \nstrictly political reasons.\n  Current judicial vacancies at this point in President Obama's term \nare 83, nearly double the 46 vacancies of President Bush's term. I know \nmy Republican colleagues sometimes argue that President Obama is too \nslow to make nominations, but that argument doesn't explain what \nhappens after the nominations have been made, cleared investigations, \ncleared the committee, and reached the Senate calendar.\n  Right now there are 39 judicial nominees pending either before the \nJudiciary Committee or on the floor of the Senate. Promptly confirming \nthese numbers would bring President Obama's confirmation numbers close \nto President Bush's. But still the obstruction continues.\n\n  Some might argue that blocking judicial nominees is just another one \nof those silly partisan games in Washington. But, unfortunately, this \nobstruction has real impact across America. There are 35 judicial \nvacancies that have been designated judicial emergencies by the \nnonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. That means the \nFederal courts are so flooded with heavy workloads that the failure to \nfill the vacancies makes it even worse. It means justice will be \ndelayed. And when justice is delayed, many times it is denied. When \ncourt systems suffer from lack of judges on the bench, the \nadministration of justice suffers at every level, criminal and civil.\n  All Americans rely on the Federal courts to protect their \nconstitutional rights, keep dangerous criminals off the streets, and \nresolve their disputes. When judgeships are vacant and judges remain \noverburdened, the American people may be denied their day in court.\n  Right now, the Northern District of Illinois--that would be Chicago, \nnorthern Illinois--is one of the districts where a judicial emergency \nhas been declared. The chief judge of the district, Judge Jim \nHolderman, an appointee under a Republican President, recently sent a \nletter to me and my colleague Senator Kirk urging the Senate to move \nquickly on two nominees sitting on the calendar--John Lee, my nominee \napproved by Senator Kirk, and Jay Tharp, Senator Kirk's nominee \napproved by me. A bipartisan judicial selection committee chose these \nnominees, and both of us signed off on them. Isn't that what America \nwants, that we work together? So why are they sitting on a calendar? \nThere is an emergency in the Northern District, the judge has asked for \nhelp, we have agreed on a bipartisan basis how to fill the vacancies, \nyet they languish on the calendar.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to briefly talk about these \nnominees caught up in this backlog on the Senate floor. Both of them \nare extraordinarily well-gifted and talented.\n  John Lee is currently a partner in a major law firm in Chicago, where \nhe practices complex commercial litigation. He is the son of a coal \nminer and a nurse. He immigrated to this country from Korea at a young \nage. From humble beginnings, he went on to college and law school at \nHarvard. He then worked as a trial attorney in the Justice Department, \nand he had a great record in community service in Chicago. When he is \nconfirmed, he will be the first Korean-American article III judge ever \nto serve in my State.\n  Jay Tharp, Senator Kirk's nominee, of whom I approve, is a partner in \nanother major law firm in Chicago, where he leads their securities \nlitigation practice. He is a former captain in the Marine Corps with a \ndistinguished military career. He attended Duke University and \nNorthwestern Law School and clerked for a Federal judge on the Seventh \nCircuit. For 6 years he was an assistant U.S. attorney, a prosecutor, \nand he has received numerous recognitions for his work in private \npractice.\n  As part of our bipartisan selection process, Senator Kirk has chosen \nJay Tharp and I have chosen Mr. Lee. We have done this in the most \ncooperative way possible. I think it is time for the Senate to move \nahead with the floor votes on these two nominees and all of the \nnominees. If a Senator has an objection to one of these nominees, let's \ncall it for a vote. They can vote no. And if they don't get a majority \nvote, they won't be approved. That is the way this Chamber is supposed \nto work.\n  Good, decent Americans such as John Lee and Jay Tharp shouldn't have \nto put their lives on hold when they have volunteered to be nominees to \nthe Federal court. In most instances, those who step up and ask for \nthis opportunity of public service are actually taking a cut in pay \nfrom what they could be paid in private practice. They are willing to \nmake a sacrifice. Their families are willing to make it. But now we \nleave them in this limbo. They are caught in this political limbo \ncreated by the Republicans in an effort to stack up judges like \ncordwood on the calendar in the hopes that come November, they will get \na Republican President who will fill these vacancies with true \nbelievers.\n  That isn't fair. It doesn't reflect the reality when President Obama \nwas elected to serve and to fill these vacancies in a meaningful way. \nThe process is bipartisan. Certainly, the Senate's consideration of \nnominees should be bipartisan as well.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan on the floor. I wish to make one \nadditional statement, if I might, relative to an issue in my home State \nof Illinois. I will be very brief, but it is something that means a lot \nto me and to my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1571-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1571-S1572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ILLINOIS TORNADOES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it was just about 10 days ago that a \ntornado struck Harrisburg, IL. This is a picture of some of the \ndevastation. It doesn't tell the story.\n  I have been a child of Illinois and grew up in what we consider to be \nTornado Alley. Being dragged out of bed in the middle of the night with \nthe air raid siren blaring and my dad heading down into the basement \nwas just one of the rites of passage. Luckily, our home was never hit, \nbut we saw a lot of homes that were. They might have some shingles torn \noff and siding ripped away, windows broken, and maybe in the worst case \na roof actually lifted off a house.\n  This case here was an extraordinary one. The picture can't even \ndepict the story. It was a level 4 tornado--and level 5 is the \nhighest--with 175 mile-an-hour winds, or winds more powerful than \nHurricane Katrina, and it hit this little town of Harrisburg, IL, and \nabout 20 miles away the town of Ridgway, IL.\n  I went down and took a look. I saw homes that had been torn off their \nslab foundations and tossed around like toys. Seven people died as a \nresult of this tornado. There might have been more, but it was a \ntornado that struck at about 5 a.m., and many people were home. Had \nthey been outside or shopping at one of the malls that were \nobliterated, many more people would have died. Fortunately, more \ndidn't.\n  The heroic efforts by the local people at every single level really \nmade me proud to represent that State and my family having roots in \nthat part of the State. It was a great outpouring of caring, affection, \nand even bravery as people rescued those who were lost and covered by \nthe debris. The Red Cross was on the scene right away. The Illinois \nEmergency Management Agency was there as well. Everybody pitched in, \nboth in Harrisburg and in Ridgway.\n  We finished our job, and we heard, as I was leaving on Saturday--this \nwas 10 days ago--that the Federal agencies were on their way this last \nMonday, a week ago today. I felt confident, Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois \nfelt confident, and our State emergency management director, Jonathan \nMonken, also felt confident that we would get the Federal designation. \nThat is why it was absolutely stunning when we learned yesterday that \nFEMA turned down these communities.\n  Take a look at this shopping center that literally collapsed. \nFortunately,\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\nno one was in it at 5 a.m. The devastation from 175 mile-an-hour winds \ncould be seen all over Harrisburg and the town of Ridgway, where the \nlocal Catholic church was devastated.\n  This decision by FEMA is out of touch with reality--the reality of \nthe damage and the suffering and the reality of this notion that \nsomehow the State and local governments can take care of this.\n\n  Historically we have said that when a storm reaches a certain \nthreshold of damage, the Federal Government steps in. In my time in the \nHouse and Senate, I have never, ever questioned that decision. I have \nstepped up to help every State in the Union with disaster assistance, \nknowing that this could happen to my State.\n  Now, when FEMA says we don't qualify for Federal assistance, it means \nthat the Small Business Administration is not likely to help businesses \nin the area with disaster recovery small business loans, for example. \nAs we can see from the photos I have shown, disaster loans are going to \nbe desperately needed by businesses in the area. Harrisburg is going to \nhave a difficult if not impossible time coming back from this disaster \nwithout help.\n  Our State of Illinois can't do it on its own. Governor Quinn and \nJonathan Monken have determined that the damage is just too severe for \nthe State. I spoke with the Governor this morning. He is going to \nappeal the FEMA decision. We are joining him, on a bipartisan basis--\nSenator Kirk's office is joining our office--to appeal this FEMA \ndecision. Come Wednesday, in my office here in the U.S. Capitol, we are \ninviting the Administrator of FEMA to come in and make the case as to \nwhy this devastation doesn't warrant Federal disaster designation. \nSixteen thousand people in these small communities have been displaced \nfrom their homes. Local leaders and volunteers have turned up from \neverywhere, but they can't do it alone. We need to have the Federal \nGovernment providing its level of assistance to make sure these \ncommunities are made whole, put back together so life can go on. We can \nnever, ever replace the seven lives that were lost, but let's replace \nthe spirit of those communities with Federal, State, and local \ncooperation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, before I speak about an amendment I \nhave on the Transportation bill, I wish to commend my friend, the \nSenator from Illinois, for fighting for his people. I understand what \nit is like to have devastation happen in a State, and I want to thank \nhim and let him know the people of Michigan certainly stand with the \npeople of Illinois and want to be supportive at a time like this \nbecause this could happen to any one of us. So I thank him for being \nsuch a champion for the people he represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1572-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1572-S1573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENERGY TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport an amendment that will be coming up tomorrow for a vote--a very \nimportant amendment for the economy. It is my amendment No. 1812 that \nwould stop a tax increase on American businesses that are creating \nclean energy jobs by extending the energy tax cuts. These energy tax \ncredits have been so important to stimulating the diversity of \nopportunity for us in terms of energy sources, and things are beginning \nto move. It would be such an error to stop or slow this down at this \npoint.\n  We have right now over 26 different national organizations that have \nendorsed this, and more are coming, but let me just mention a few. The \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe American Wind Energy Association, the Solar Energy Association, the \nAlliance for Clean Energy, Biotech Industry Association, Renewable \nFuels--it goes on and on. A number of folks understand that this means \njobs, including the United Steel Workers, as well as the Propane Gas \nAssociation, the National Electric Manufacturers, the National Wildlife \nAssociation, the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters. The \nlist goes on and on. This has broad bipartisan support, including \nindustry workers and those who care very much from an environmental \nstandpoint about what is happening to our country. All have come \ntogether to support this amendment to stop a tax increase on our \nbusinesses that are creating jobs through clean energy technologies.\n  All across the country businesses big and small are creating jobs and \nbringing manufacturing jobs back to America, building the technology \nthat is powering our future. We all understand that part of the next \nround in terms of growing a strong economy really is around energy--all \nsources of energy. I am a let's-do-it-all person, but we have to make \nsure we have energy choices and opportunities for those businesses to \ngrow.\n  We have entrepreneurs inventing new technology, building plants, \nhiring workers, producing cutting-edge new products that save consumers \nmoney and, importantly, reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nEspecially now, when gas prices are going through the roof--and believe \nme, as I drive around Michigan looking at the gas pumps, it is \noutrageous what is happening right now--when families are struggling \nmore than ever to fill their tanks, we shouldn't be raising taxes on \nthe innovators and the job creators who are helping to lower American \nfamilies' energy bills, and that is what the vote tomorrow is about.\n  My amendment does a number of things. It extends current policy that \nputs in place this new ability to create jobs, energy, get us off the \nfloor and going. It extends this extremely successful advanced energy \nmanufacturing tax credit that has been called 48C. This is something I \nwas proud to author, working with our chairman of the Energy Committee, \nSenator Bingaman. We have 43 States where businesses have been able to \nget a 30-percent tax cut for companies that expand, reequip, and build \nnew plants in the United States to produce clean energy technology.\n  I want to see ``Made in America'' again, and I know the Presiding \nOfficer does too. This tax cut is what is helping to make that happen.\n  In Michigan, a number of innovative companies were able to use this \ntax cut to create jobs, building amazing new products. Here are just a \nfew examples. I was just with the Dow CEO today, someone who is so \nfocused on sustainability and creating energy alternatives. Dow is \nbuilding solar shingles, among other things, along with new advanced \nbattery technologies.\n  But the solar shingles are really something to see. They are called \nthe ``Power Shingle.'' You put them on your roof just like regular \nshingles. You roll it out and install it just like regular shingles, \nand they generate electricity for your home or business.\n  These are new technologies that are creating opportunities for \nsuppliers and small businesses all around the Midland, Saginaw, and Bay \nCity area in Michigan.\n  Ventower Industries builds huge towers for wind turbines. They just \nopened their plant down in the southeastern part of Michigan, in \nMonroe, MI. They expect to build as many as 250 wind turbine towers--\nthe big towers--every year.\n  On the west side of the State, Energetx Composites used to \nmanufacture luxury yachts. They have turned their facility and their \nbig bays that made those yachts--thanks to the 48C manufacturing tax \ncut--into a facility that is now producing wind turbine blades and \nother advanced materials.\n  My amendment also extends the tax cut for companies that produce \nenergy-efficient appliances; grants in lieu of tax credits; tax cuts \nfor companies that install charging stations for our new, great \nelectric vehicles; tax cuts for companies producing the next generation \nof cellulosic biofuels, and much more.\n  It also extends the extremely important production tax credit, this \ntax cut for wind energy, which supports businesses and utilities that \nproduce electricity from wind.\n  There are more than 8 million households in the United States that \nrely on wind energy for their electricity. In South Dakota and Iowa \nmore than 20 percent of their electricity is generated by wind. \nNationwide more than a half million jobs are related to wind energy \nproduction so far. In my State of Michigan alone there are 31 \nfacilities manufacturing components for wind energy and 6 more in the \nworks. I might just add, one of those great big wind turbines has 8,000 \nparts, and we\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\ncan manufacture every single one of those in Michigan.\n  When I look at the opportunities around new clean energy \nmanufacturing, I see jobs in every single part for wind, for solar, for \nelectric vehicles. Any of the areas around clean energy creates \nthousands of jobs.\n  It is about the future. Now is not the time to raise taxes on these \ncompanies. If we do not extend these tax cuts, that is exactly what is \ngoing to happen.\n  Our economy is slowly coming back, as we know, and manufacturing and \nclean energy business owners have been leading the way. There are \nnearly 2.7 million people whose jobs depend on this new part of our \neconomy--the clean energy economy. These are good jobs. This is part of \nmoving our country forward so we can compete successfully in the global \neconomy and keep jobs here.\n  Right now we are in a race with China and Germany and other countries \nthat want to lead the world in clean energy production. They have made \nclean energy manufacturing a top priority in their tax policy, in their \ninvestment strategy. We know, in fact, in China alone they are spending \nhundreds of millions of dollars every single day trying to beat us in \nthe clean energy production business.\n  We should not turn our back on the American businesses that are \nfighting to compete with countries such as China. We should not turn \nour back on the millions of people whose jobs depend on the strength of \nthese businesses. We should not turn our back on the opportunity to \ntruly diversify our energy sources so we can get off foreign oil and \nnot have to worry about what that price sign is at the pump.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join together on this amendment, to \nsupport it tomorrow, to provide certainty for our businesses and our \njob creators. This has wide backing from business, from labor \norganizations, from the environmental and clean energy community. It is \na chance to come together and create some certainty for a very \nimportant and exciting new part of our economy that is critical for us \nas we climb out of this recession and create jobs for our American \ncitizens.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This amendment also did \nnot reflect the positive changes that the EPA has already made to the \nproposed rules. It is my intent to continue working with the EPA as \nthey write their final rules to address the concerns that have been \nraised by Michigan employers--large and small--and to give our \nbusinesses the time necessary to comply with these new emissions rules.\n  It is critical that the EPA draft rules that protect our environment \nwhile also protecting our jobs and our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1573-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I come to the floor again today to \nresume a conversation with my colleagues about the incredible wave of \ndestructive storms and tornadoes that ripped through my home State of \nKentucky, along with several other States in the Midwest, on Friday \nMarch 2.\n  As I have already stated on this floor, these were very severe \ntornadoes, with at least 11 funnel clouds confirmed to have touched \ndown in the Bluegrass State by the National Weather Service, blowing at \nwind speeds up to 125 miles per hour.\n  We now know that these deadly storms claimed 23 lives in Kentucky, \nand more than 300 were injured. We have heard stories like that of \nStephanie Decker, currently in stable condition at the University \nHospital of Louisville, who raced home during the storm just in time to \nhurry her 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter into the basement of \ntheir three-story, brick-and-stone house.\n  She covered their tiny bodies with her own as the tornado crashed the \nhouse down on top of them. Stephanie has lost one leg above the knee \nand the other above the ankle, but her children survived without a \nscratch.\n  The weekend immediately after the storms I visited the part of \nKentucky that was arguably hardest hit by them, the town of West \nLiberty. The town is home to just 3,400 people--and all 3,400 lives \nhave been thrown into chaos, as virtually the entire population had to \nbe evacuated.\n  Churches, homes, schools, and businesses are reduced to rubble. The \ntown courthouse and city hall are both in ruins. Basically, this once-\nthriving,\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\nhappy little community is now barely there.\n  Scenes from West Liberty are replicated across the State in places \nlike Magoffin, Menifee, Kenton, Morgan, Laurel, Lawrence, Martin, \nPulaski, Johnson, and Trimble counties, which are among the hardest \nhit.\n  And too many Kentucky families are mourning what was taken from them \nby the storms that can never be replaced.\n  In Lawrence County, Joyce Chaffins, 65, and her granddaughter, 14-\nyear-old Samantha Wood, died when a tornado struck their home. Samantha \nwas a ninth-grader at Lawrence County High School, where she played in \nthe band and was a member of the National Junior Honor Society.\n  The storm has also claimed James Gregory Brooks, 48, Donald L. \nBeemon, 78, and Linda Beemon, 73, of Kenton County.\n  In Johnson County, in Middle Fork, a tornado ripped the home of \nGregory Perry, 20, right off its foundation and carried it over a 25-\nfoot embankment into rushing creek rapids, where, according to the \ncounty coroner, the house ``just disintegrated.''\n  Gregory was killed, along with Sean Shepherd, a 16-year-old boy from \nPrestonsburg who had the misfortune of visiting Gregory at the time.\n  More lives taken by this destructive force of nature include Sherman \nDeWayne Allen, 49, Debbie Allen, 49; Wilburn Pitman, 81, Virginia \nPitman, 73, and Ethel Pruitt, 64, all of Laurel County.\n  In Morgan County, husband and wife Charles and Betty Sue Endicott, \nboth in their early 50s, were caring for Charles's mother, Elizabeth \nEndicott, 72, after her recovery from a stroke.\n  A tornado struck their trailer home, killing all three of them. \nCharles's sister, Marita Moore, surveyed the scene of destruction and \nsaid this: ``There's not even a memory left down there.''\n  More Kentucky families who do not deserve such a painful loss include \nthe families of Beverly Bowman, 47, Anita Smith, 53, and Vershal Brown, \n79, all of Menifee County; and Alex Clayton Dulin, 86, Emma Dean Cecil, \n87, and Wilmer Cecil, 90, all of Morgan County.\n  In Pulaski County, 74-year-old Helen Placke was found dead in her \nhome. She had sought shelter from the storms inside a closet--but to no \navail.\n  In Kenton County, in the town of Falmouth, Courtney Stephenson died \nwhen her car was suddenly lifted and catapulted across six lanes of \ntraffic on I 75. She was 42 years old.\n  It is sobering and humbling, to think about the many wondrous \ntechnologies and abilities we have in this great country--from the \nmedical advances that can place tiny tools into the smallest human \ncapillaries, to our scientific discoveries that enable us to send \ncameras to the outermost edges of the solar system and actually take \npictures of other planets and send them back to Earth.\n  And yet human life is still so fragile when confronted with the \npowerful forces of the natural world.\n  I would be remiss, if I did not conclude my remarks with a note of \ngratitude--and that is gratitude for the many brave and heroic first \nresponders and other Kentuckians who have rushed to the aid of those \nhardest hit by these storms.\n  Over the last week, my office has been contacted by people throughout \nthe country asking how they can help. We have pointed them to various \nplaces in the Commonwealth where the people on the ground have \ncoordinated incredible assistance to those in need.\n  Volunteers from the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Goodwill, the \nKentucky Cattlemen's Association, the United Way, and the business \ncommunity have come together to provide food, blood, resources, and \nshelter to those in need. Many churches and civic organizations have \ntaken up collection drives.\n  And many Kentuckians of good heart, without any prodding, have on \ntheir own simply loaded up their cars with bottled water, food, and \nwhatever else they can spare and driven to scenes of tornado wreckage \nto ask, ``How can I help?''\n  Government has a key role to play as well.

Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to a man \nwho spent his life working to strengthen his local community and \nhelping the citizens who reside there along the way. Mr. Jimmy Lee \nVance of Corbin, KY, encompassed every aspect of a tried and true \nentrepreneur, and he had the special quality of a generous heart.\n  Mr. Vance was a religious man who cherished the words of the ``red \nletters'' in the Bible, words spoken by Jesus Christ. Those who knew \nhim believe he exemplified the attributes that those letters described, \nand that it was a creed of love, forgiveness, and grace by which he \nlived. Sadly, Jimmy Lee Vance left this world on December 20, 2011, due \nto complications from cancer. He was 70 years old.\n  Originally from Hart County, KY, Mr. Vance held an array of jobs \nbefore settling down in Corbin permanently. He served his country in \nthe U.S. Navy, and later received a degree in accounting from Western \nKentucky University on the GI bill. Jimmy took a job with the Internal \nRevenue Service's office in Louisville, KY, and then purchased a Corbin \nCPA firm, which he spent the next few years building up before \neventually selling it to Ms. Mary Lynn Long. Next, Jimmy set his sights \non the areas of real estate and business management, and in these \nfields he would make his greatest contribution to the Commonwealth.\n  Jimmy honed in on the area surrounding Interstate 75 near Corbin. He \nand his friends put a major effort into breaking new ground and \nbuilding from the ground up. After years of planning and construction \nlead by Mr. Vance, Corbin's Exit 25 has become one of the most popular \nstops on I 75. The restaurants, movie theaters, shopping centers, and \nhotels just off of the exit bring in thousands of travelers each year, \ncourtesy of Jimmy and his innovation and hard work.\n  Next came the billboards. Mr. Vance knew that in order to entice \ntravelers to enter the city of Corbin, he had to let them know what was \nwaiting for them. Jimmy was really the first man in the area to get \ninto the billboard business. The billboards undeniably led to massive \ntourism in the area, and Jimmy knew this. It is amazing that \nadvertising in its simplest form, along with Jimmy's innovative \nimagination and hard work could combine for such a home-run success for \nthe area's economy.\n  Mr. Vance was instrumental in virtually every field of business in \nCorbin. He had help in large part from his wife Donna Barton, who was \none of his best business assets. Together they owned and operated the \nLandmark Inn, and Donna was notorious for catering to the needs of all \nthe Landmark Inn's guests. The couple's customer service was unmatched, \nand the family atmosphere they provided was an experience unlike any \nother to the people who would stay the night while traveling on I 75.\n  Along with hotels, Jimmy was responsible for bringing many different \nbusinesses to the area, which resulted in hundreds of new jobs for the \nresidents of Corbin. But what truly stood out about Jimmy to the locals \nwas his remarkable character. One Corbin-area leader said, ``Sometimes \nwhen Jimmy and I had lunch, someone would come up needing money for a \nmeal or pay bills, and Jimmy without any fanfare gave them help. Those \nwere things about Jimmy you didn't read in the papers.''\n  Jimmy Lee Vance was a humble servant of God, a beloved family man, \nand\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\na dear friend to many. All of us could learn a thing or two from Jimmy. \nHis moral code and business skills were an inspiration to young \nentrepreneurs of all types. He lit a fire inside them, and that is what \ntrue leadership is all about. Jimmy's life may have come to an end, but \nhis legacy will continue to live on; he inspired others to do great \nthings.\n  At this time I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to join \nme in commemorating the life and times of Mr. Jimmy Lee Vance, a true \nAmerican entrepreneur and philanthropist.\n  A news article was recently published in Corbin, Kentucky's own \nTimes-Tribune newspaper, recognizing the achievements Mr. Vance made \nthroughout his lifetime. I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Times-Tribune, Feb. 13, 2012]\n\n            Jimmy Lee Vance--Remembrances of Jimmy Lee Vance\n\n\n            Born September 29, 1941--Died December 20, 2011\n\n       Jimmy Lee Vance was born in Hart County September 29, 1941, \n     and raised on a small farm by his parents, the late Lee \n     Walter and Eva Vance. He was preceded in death by his sister, \n     Norma Reed. He graduated from Canmer High School and served \n     in the U.S. Navy. He received an honorable discharge and used \n     a military G.I. Bill scholarship and graduated with a BS \n     degree in accounting from Western Kentucky University. Jimmy \n     and his first wife, Mildred, had two children: Jason Vance \n     (wife Kim) of Corbin, and daughter Kim (husband Shannon Rahn) \n     of Richmond Hill, Georgia. Jimmy later married Donna Barton \n     in 1990, and they were together until his death December 20. \n     He left two step-children, Amber Noell and Kari Moore, and \n     eight grandchildren, Erika Vance, Hunter Rahn, Wes Rahn, Lee \n     Vance, Jaci Beth Noell, Lauren Moore, Jaken Noell, and Ryan \n     Moore, and a sister, Virginia Patenaude and husband Pat of \n     Canmer, Kentucky.\n       Jimmy worked for the Internal Revenue Service's Louisville \n     office and later purchased Henry Martin's respected Corbin \n     CPA firm. Jimmy continued the growth of the business and \n     later sold it to Mary Lynn Long. Jimmy then focused his \n     attention on real estate and business development. He and his \n     partners transformed the land near Corbin's I 75 Exit 25 on \n     Cumberland Falls Highway. This is one of the most formidable \n     business areas off the I 75 Expressway, with the opportunity \n     for continued growth. He was a business leader willing to \n     take risks, with a vision of not just seeing how things are \n     now, but how they could become with initiative and \n     creativity.\n       A major Technology Center now managed by Corbin High School \n     was one of Corbin's first major operations built on land \n     Jimmy and his partners developed. Many meetings and training \n     sessions have been conducted in this facility, including \n     Chamber of Commerce luncheons, wedding receptions, and \n     political events which have brought many people to our area. \n     The Technology Center is impressive and will be a key asset \n     to our area for many years.\n       The Corbin Arena rests on top of a mountain facing across \n     Cumberland Falls Highway toward the Baptist Regional Medical \n     Center and west to I 75 Exit 25. This majestic entertainment \n     center would never have happened if Jimmy and his partners \n     and government leaders had not worked together to make it \n     possible. The location of the arena on top of the mountain, \n     right or wrong, can't be blamed on Jimmy. His group helped \n     make this location for the arena possible. The challenge in \n     making it a success rests on the shoulders of our local \n     leaders and all of us.\n       Many of us enjoy visiting Applebee's or Dino's or Fiesta \n     Mexicana for an enjoyable meal. Exit 25 has 40,000 cars and \n     trucks pass by each day on I 75, and many stop off to eat, \n     shop, buy gasoline, or stay in our motels. PT Pro's \n     attractive Therapy Center adorns this property developed by \n     Jimmy and his group. Several young business leaders such as \n     Darryl and Mark Lawson told me, ``Jimmy wasn't too busy to \n     give us good suggestions on real estate, or tax issues, or \n     good business ideas. He helped us so much.'' Sometimes when \n     Jimmy and I had lunch, someone would come up needing money \n     for a meal or pay bills, and Jimmy without any fanfare gave \n     them help. Those were things about Jimmy you didn't read in \n     the papers.\n       For years he and Donna owned and operated the Landmark Inn, \n     which has been a key place for many travelers to stop for \n     rest on tiring trips. A good Redhound buddy, Bob Coleman, who \n     passed away last year, often came to Corbin from Bristol to \n     see Redhound games and friends. Employees at Landmark took \n     good care of Bobby. Jimmy and his family also owned at one \n     time the Best Western Motel. Jimmy told me about Donna's \n     knowledge in handling business decisions. Donna has been a \n     valuable person in Jimmy's businesses program.\n       When Jimmy purchased the Holiday Inn in Williamsburg, he \n     had a billboard on the property. It wasn't long until Jimmy \n     was in the billboard business, and soon there were many \n     billboards in our area. We take for granted that people will \n     stop off the interstate and do business in our area. Jimmy's \n     billboards brought many travelers off the interstate to \n     businesses.\n       Jimmy purchased the Eagle Falls property, which could have \n     been a great addition for Cumberland Falls State Park. Jimmy \n     drove me on a tour of the Cumberland Falls State Park Camping \n     and Recreation Vehicle area, and it was running out of space. \n     Jimmy's property near the Falls area could have provided \n     additional space to enhance the ability of Cumberland Falls \n     to grow and offer more services. This dream of Jimmy's wasn't \n     completed. Jimmy focused attention on the fact that \n     Cumberland Falls State Park for years has not been promoted \n     and expanded into the type of great attraction it could be. \n     This beautiful and scenic place could become a major \n     attraction for a large segment of the eastern part of our \n     nation. It needs a golf course and some remodeling. Eighteen \n     Kentucky State Parks have golf courses, but the big one \n     closest to a highly travelled interstate highway, Cumberland \n     Falls State Park, has no golf course. Some of Jimmy's close \n     business partners have been Dr. Don Barton, David Myers, \n     Harold Huddleston, David Rossi, Boyce Worley, Darrell \n     Sanders, Becky Myers, and John Warren. Also included was the \n     late Dave Hudson, who was a special friend with Jimmy.\n       Today many of us enjoy seeing movies at the Tri-County \n     Cineplex, and Nelda Collings Barton, her daughter Suzie, and \n     son-in-law Greg Razmus built this impressive complex on a \n     site developed by Jimmy and his partners. Nelda and the \n     Razmus family are a valuable entrepreneur team that has been \n     so helpful in many ways to our community. It hurts when you \n     lose entrepreneurs in local communities and areas. They \n     create jobs in your own hometown. They help create other \n     small business leaders who learn from them and take on that \n     same spirit. Jimmy, Donnie Witt and I had lunch each month \n     and sometimes talked about the Bible. Jimmy said, ``I love \n     the `Red' Letters in the New Testament because they are a \n     simple message from Christ. They are words built on love, \n     forgiveness, and grace.''\n       Jimmy suffered a very damaging stroke in 2008, but with the \n     help of his family was soon back working on his projects. \n     Sometimes it was a struggle, but Jimmy kept going. A short \n     time prior to his death, tests determined he had an advance \n     problem with lung and bone cancer.\n       During Jimmy's last days in Baptist Regional Medical \n     Center, he was well cared for by the medical staff and his \n     family. Rev. Bobby Joe Eaton, Chaplain of the Medical Center, \n     ``ministered unto Jimmy with love and prayer.'' Bobby Joe is \n     a wonderful blessing in our community.\n       Each time I visited Jimmy in the hospital in his last days, \n     son Jason was by his side and Jimmy's daughter, Kim, came \n     from Savannah to be with him. Frequently Jimmy's handsome \n     red-headed grandson Lee was there giving support to his \n     grandpa. Soon after Jimmy's death, Donna had a liver \n     transplant and is recovering very well. The Barton family has \n     shown great courage these last years as they have dealt with \n     those difficult experiences in life we will all face at some \n     time. Joan Barton has been an inspiration to all of us as she \n     has recovered from a serious accident and has stood strong \n     with her husband Don and their family.\n       In closing, there is an old song that sometimes comes to \n     mind during times of sorrow and sadness. It is titled, \n     ``Jesus Walked this Lonesome Valley.'' The words of one verse \n     remind us of a journey we will face at the end of our lives \n     when we say goodbye to family and friends and cross over to a \n     new life with God.\n\n       ``We must walk that lonesome Valley,\n       We have to walk it by ourselves.\n       Oh, nobody else can walk it for us,\n       We have to walk it by ourselves.''\n\n       Our God walks that lonesome valley by our side and loved \n     ones and friends give us comfort and love as we depart. God \n     is with us as we begin our new life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1575-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1575-S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF 3 11\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, yesterday the world marked the \nanniversary of the triple tragedy--the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear \ncrisis--that struck Japan on March 11 of last year. I rise today to \ncommemorate that heartbreaking day for our good friend and ally and to \npay tribute to the remarkable resilience of the Japanese people in the \nface of this unprecedented series of catastrophic events. Even as Japan \nlabors to rebuild devastated regions in the northeast, it continues to \nmake enormous contributions to the international community, so let's \ntake this moment to acknowledge the ambitious reconstruction effort \nunderway in Japan and its indispensable role in world affairs.\n  Any one of these three events--a magnitude 9.0 earthquake that \ndestroyed entire towns and villages, a tsunami that swept away \nthousands, and the ensuing nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Dai-ichi \nplant--would have been enough to overwhelm and paralyze any country, \nany government. To\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\nhave all three occur at the same time simply strains the imagination. \nYet the Japanese Government and the Japanese people responded to these \nevents with their characteristic resilience, both in the immediate \naftermath when local first responders and Japan's Self-Defense Forces \nresponded so heroically in the face of almost unimaginable destruction \nand today in rebuilding shattered lives and communities by seeking new \nopportunities for economic growth and innovation, including through new \ngreen energy initiatives.\n  And if there is a silver lining to the tragic events of 3/11, it is \nthat the U.S.-Japan alliance once more proved its own strength and \nvitality, demonstrating the deep bonds of friendship and affection that \ntie our two nations together. Together, we launched the largest joint \nmilitary operation in our history, with more than 20,000 Americans \nsupporting the Japan Self-Defense Forces in Operation Tomodachi. The \nDepartment of Defense alone provided 24,000 personnel, 190 aircraft, \nand 24 Navy ships to assist with humanitarian and disaster relief \noperations. To this day, our country's joint efforts continue through \npublic-private partnerships for reconstruction and through the \nTOMODACHI initiative. This program, spearheaded by our Ambassador to \nJapan--and my good friend--John Roos, is focused on partnerships and \nprograms to empower Japan's next generation and to strengthen ties \nbetween Americans and Japanese.\n  Madam President, nations and relationships between nations often \ndisplay their truest colors during times of stress, challenge, and \ntragedy. As we look back at the events of a year ago and pause in \nremembrance of those who lost their lives, let's also give thanks for \nthe strength, health, and vitality of the partnership between the \nUnited States and Japan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1576-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DOUG NELSON\n\n Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I wish today to recognize and \ncongratulate Mr. Doug Nelson on his retirement as President and CEO of \nthe AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin, ARCW. I am honored to have the \nopportunity to congratulate him on his extraordinary career and all \nthat he has done to fight against AIDS. Under his leadership, Doug has \nhelped ARCW provide support and care to countless individuals affected \nby HIV or AIDS. He has also brought awareness and advocacy to the \nforefront of the public sector and private philanthropy.\n  The AIDS epidemic remains one of the leading public health threats \nfacing our Nation and the world today. When I was first elected to the \nU.S. Senate, Doug took the helm as president and CEO of ARCW. Since \nthen, I have looked to Doug for his suggestions, insight and wisdom on \nhow we can work together to fight this disease, while providing \nassistance to those who have been diagnosed with AIDS or infected with \nHIV. I am proud to have been a cosponsor of the Ryan White Care Act in \n1990, as well as its reauthorization, which has provided millions of \ndollars for the State of Wisconsin's AIDS drug reimbursement program. \nIt is also why I fought hard in the Senate to ensure that the Ryan \nWhite Extension Act of 2009 would continue to provide these services to \nthose in need.\n  Doug is a true agent of change. When he assumed his position as the \nsecond executive director, ARCW was among one of only a few small \nsocial service organizations committed to providing health care and \nsupport to individuals infected with HIV. Doug has played an integral \nrole growing ARCW to become Wisconsin's largest provider of a broad \nrange of medical, dental and mental health services for people living \nwith HIV. Under his leadership, the ARCW Medical Center and pharmacy \nhave provided thousands of individuals living with HIV and AIDS with \nthe high quality medical care and support they need.\n  Over the last 24 years, Doug Nelson and I have worked in our \nrespective roles and together to fight an historic epidemic. It is \nthrough his years of leadership that I am proud to say our State has \nprovided high-quality care and support to those who are affected by \nthis disease. In his retirement, Doug will not only leave a legacy of \nremarkable achievement at ARCW, but an unyielding hope for a brighter \nfuture. I want to take this opportunity to formally recognize Doug's \nmany years of remarkable service and, on behalf of the people of \nWisconsin, offer him the sincere thanks and appreciation he so deeply \ndeserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1576-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1576-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/12/senate-section/article/S1576-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 3606.

A bill to provide funding for the Fugitive Extradition and \nApprehension Trust Fund; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nwill help address the serious problem of fugitives who commit violent \ncrimes in the United States and then flee to foreign countries.\n  This problem was highlighted by a recent investigative series in the \nChicago Tribune newspaper. The Tribune reported on a number of horrible \ncrimes that were allegedly committed in Illinois by suspects who now \nlive openly in foreign countries. The Tribune identified at least 129 \ncriminal suspects who have fled from northern Illinois over the last \ndecade who remain at-large abroad. This problem appears to be growing \nsteadily as our world becomes increasingly interconnected. The stories \nin the Tribune series are heartbreaking.\n  Here is one example. In 2000, 19-year-old Alma Chavez was living in \nPilsen with her family and studying to become a nurse. After she broke \nup with her boyfriend, Raul Andrade Tolentino, he came looking for her \none early morning at her house. As he later confessed, Tolentino \nstabbed Alma several times with a knife. As she lay dying in her living \nroom, Alma called 911, and the police responded and found Tolentino. \nAfter he was arrested, Tolentino was then released on a $20,000 bond. \nJust over a month later, Tolentino fled Illinois and eventually went to \nMexico.\n  Intent on bringing his daughter's killer back to the U.S. justice \nsystem, Alma's father Bonifacio Chavez repeatedly went to Mexico, \nspending his money to track down leads on Tolentino and interview \ninformants to learn his whereabouts. Even though Alma's father \neventually found Tolentino's new town in Mexico, and U.S. authorities \nissued an arrest warrant in 2007, Bonifacio Chavez died without seeing \nTolentino face the murder charge in Illinois. To this day, Tolentino \nremains free, and the rest of the Chavez family is still waiting for \nhim to be prosecuted.\n  This is just one of the many cases brought to light by the Tribune \nseries. What has struck me most about these international fugitive \ncases is the deep\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nsense of injustice, prolonged grief, and sometimes fear that victims \nlike the Chavez family experience. They suffer not just from the \noriginal crime, but also from the years they spend waiting, sometimes \nfruitlessly, for those responsible to face justice.\n  Illinois is not alone in experiencing a problem with international \nfugitives. This affects states across our country. In 2003, the Justice \nDepartment estimated that there were several thousand U.S. fugitives \nlocated abroad but only 1,413 were being sought for extradition. These \nnumbers are unacceptable, and we must do more to ensure that these \nfugitives are captured and brought back.\n  When a criminal suspect flees across our country's border, it often \nrequires the involvement of the local police or sheriffs, the local \nprosecutor, the U.S. Marshals, FBI, the Justice Department, INTERPOL, \nand usually some combination of these agencies, to track down and \nextradite the suspect. These proceedings can be complicated, lengthy, \nand expensive. And when the agencies involved do not cooperate \neffectively, information can get lost between them or the process can \nbecome stalled for years.\n  In January, I hosted a summit in Chicago to discuss ways to improve \nthe apprehension and extradition of international fugitives. In \nattendance were Deputy Attorney General James Cole, U.S. Attorney \nPatrick Fitzgerald, U.S. Marshal Darryl McPherson, Cook County State's \nAttorney Anita Alvarez, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, and \nrepresentatives from numerous other Federal, State and local agencies. \nWith all of the stakeholders together in one room, we identified \nseveral key steps that would improve the situation, including more \ntraining for local agencies on handling fugitive cases; improved \ntracking of these cases; increased coordination between federal, state \nand local agencies; more resources dedicated to fugitive cases; and \nremoving barriers to extradition with other countries.\n  It was a very constructive meeting. I am pleased to report that \nprogress is being made on all of these fronts. This week the Justice \nDepartment will hold two International Fugitive Apprehension Trainings \nfor Chicago-area law enforcement and prosecutors. The trainings, led by \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office, will give guidance to local agencies on how \nto locate international fugitives and bring them to justice.\n  To track fugitive cases better, many of the Illinois law enforcement \nagencies and prosecutor offices have committed to reviewing their \nfugitive cases to ensure that their investigations and files are up-to-\ndate. This will ensure that cases do not fall off the radar screen.\n  At the summit, I learned that local agencies were not sure which \nfederal agency they should turn to first for assistance in a fugitive \ncase. That question has now been answered by the Justice Department. \nThe U.S. Marshals have been designated the first point of contact for \nIllinois agencies with fugitive cases.\n  Also, the summit highlighted how information-sharing and coordination \nbetween Federal, State and local agencies has been a problem in the \npast. But that is being improved. The Great Lakes Regional Fugitive \nTask Force, based in Chicago, is led by the U.S. Marshals and provides \na major source of information, resources and support to local law \nenforcement agencies in Illinois. The Task Force also helps provide \nmuch-needed funding to our local law enforcement agencies to buy \nequipment such as cars and radios and to pay for overtime. This type of \nfunding is critical to ensuring that agencies can devote the resources \nneeded to investigate and prosecute complicated and expensive fugitive \ncases.\n  Right now, our Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies are \ndoing the best they can with limited budgets during these difficult \ntimes. Giving them a little extra help will go a long way towards \nimproving their collaboration and their enforcement. We can provide \nthis help at the federal level by increasing the funding for the \nprimary agencies that take part or assist local agencies in the capture \nand extradition of international fugitives--the U.S. Marshals, U.S. \nAttorneys, and the Office of International Affairs.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Bringing Justice to Fugitives \nAct, would allow the Attorney General to use the money from forfeited \nbonds in federal criminal cases for these agencies' fugitive \napprehension efforts.\n  Under the bill, this money can be used by the U.S. Marshals to \nenhance their fugitive task forces and investigations. It can be used \nby U.S. Attorney's Offices to conduct trainings and pursue \nprosecutions. And it can be used by the Justice Department's Office of \nInternational Affairs to enhance extradition efforts.\n  The amount of money involved is not huge--around $1 3 million per \nyear is collected in federal bond forfeiture money. But a little money \ncan go a long way in fugitive cases. Right now, the money from \nforfeited bonds is deposited into the Crime Victims Fund. It makes up \njust a tiny fraction of the total Fund. Dedicating these forfeited bond \nfunds for fugitive apprehensions will help victims by bringing more \nperpetrators to justice without unduly sacrificing any of the programs \nwhich receive money from the Crime Victims Fund.\n  My legislation does not touch any of the other sources of funding for \nthe Crime Victims Fund, and I will work closely with crime victim \nsupport groups to ensure that their efforts are not hindered by this \nlegislation.\n  The bill also establishes an important principle that when criminal \nsuspects flee, we will use their forfeited bond money to arrest them \nand bring them back. The victims of fugitive crimes deserve that \njustice. Because most fugitives are prosecuted by states, this \nlegislation also plays a critical role by serving as a model for states \nto follow.\n  I hope that the state and local jurisdictions will take similar \naction by pursuing steps to make bond forfeiture funds available for \nfugitive capture and extradition. The bottom line is that when people \nare hurt by violent crime, often one of their first wishes is to see \ntheir perpetrator go through the criminal justice process. The Bringing \nFugitives to Justice Act will help these victims by guaranteeing that \nour law enforcement agencies will step up their efforts to capture more \nfugitives and bring them to justice.\n  Finally, I want to mention that I am working to remove barriers to \nextradition that the Tribune series highlighted. For example, the \nTribune pointed out that our extradition treaty with Mexico should be \nrevisited so that U.S. crimes like reckless homicide can be treated as \nextraditable offenses. We also need to address differences in the two \ncountries' statute of limitations periods, which can limit extradition \nin some cases.\n  I met at the end of February with the Mexican Ambassador, Arturo \nSarukhan, to discuss the need to work on these aspects of our \nextradition treaty. The Ambassador, and Mexico in general, have been \nconstructive partners in our extradition efforts, and I am grateful for \nthis positive relationship. I also urged the Ambassador to make sure \nthat the cases highlighted by the Tribune were being pursued to the \nbest of Mexico's ability. While I cannot share any details about \nspecific cases, I am reassured that that message has been received.\n  In short, while international fugitive cases still pose many \nchallenges, we are continuing to work to improve the system at the \nstate, local, Federal and international level. We are making progress, \nand the legislation I am introducing today will help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide exclusive funding to support fisheries and \nthe communities that rely upon them, to clear unnecessary regulatory \nburdens and streamline Federal fisheries management, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Snowe, Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Scott Brown and Commerce Committee Chairman \nRockefeller, I am introducing the Fisheries Investment and Regulatory \nRelief Act of 2012. In the House, I am very pleased that Congressmen \nBarney Frank and Frank Guinta will be introducing similar legislation.\n  In Massachusetts, commercial fishing supports more than 77,000 jobs. \nRecreational fishing is also an important part of our maritime economy \nand our local research institutions are world-renowned.\n  However, today our fishermen continue to face economic peril and they \nare deeply frustrated by science and research they do not trust. We \nhave to put the broken pieces back together and restore both trust in \nWashington and economic security for this industry and the brave \nfishermen who get up every day and go out on those boats to make a \nliving for their families.\n  In short, we need a new path. It starts by remaking the scientific \nresearch process and transforming it into something that does a much \nbetter job of including our fishermen in the data collection that forms \nthe foundation of the rules and regulations that can determine their \nfuture.\n  We can take an important first step in improving the relationship \nbetween our fishermen and Federal regulators by passing the Fisheries \nInvestment and Regulatory Relief Act.\n  The cornerstone of this bill is returning the use of Saltonstall-\nKennedy funds to our fishermen, as was the original intent of its \ncreators. In 1954, Leverett Saltonstall and John F. Kennedy, Democratic \nand Republican Senators from Massachusetts, created the Saltonstall-\nKennedy fund for fisheries research and development. Under their law, \n30 percent of the duties on imported fish products was required to be \ntransferred to a grant program to benefit the U.S. fishing industry. It \nwas meant to be a permanent appropriation to promote science, research, \nand the development of American fisheries. But over years of tight \nbudgets the use of these funds has gotten off track: to fund other \npriorities, the money has been going to places other than it was \noriginally intended.\n  In 2010, the funds collected from the import of fishery products is \nestimated to be $376.6 million. Thirty percent of that total is \napproximately $113 million that should be used to improve science and \nhelp our fisheries. Unfortunately last year, only $8.4 million of that \n$113 million was used by National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration--NOAA--for grants for fisheries research and development \nprojects. The remaining funds were used by NOAA for their operations. \nThis simply can not continue, especially given the current situation \nfacing our fisheries. Our bill will restore the investment to help the \nfishermen and communities for whom Senators Saltonstall and Kennedy \noriginally intended it to protect.\n  The New England fishing industry has been facing a serious crisis due \nto declining fish stocks and increasing Federal regulations. The \ntransition to a new management plan has increased mistrust between \nfishermen and the Federal Government to the highest it has ever been \nduring my 27 years in the Senate.\n  The Gulf of Maine cod crisis we are currently facing is emblematic of \nthis distrust. Within 3 years of each other, two radically different \nstock assessments were released--the first assessment showed a species \non the rise while the most recent survey shows a dramatic decline. Many \nof our fishermen do not believe in the new numbers because they have \nnot been included in the process. This bill would provide local \nstakeholders with funding to help develop the accurate and credible \nscience and stakeholder participation that we need.\n  By giving stakeholders the ability to determine how Saltonstall-\nKennedy funds get spent, this bill would let New England decide what \nthe unmet priorities in our fisheries research are and give them the \nfunds necessary to do something about them. It could pay for things \nlike side-by-side trawl surveys, done in cooperation with NOAA and our \nfishermen, so that we can find out if there are fish that are being \nmissed by NOAA vessels and make sure that data gets into the \nassessments. It would allow for money to go into figuring out if there \nare more advanced tools, like long-range sonar and other fish imaging \ncapabilities, which could do a better job at determining how many fish \nare in the sea. And by giving preference to public-private \npartnerships, it can help rebuild trust between fishermen and Federal \nregulators.\n  Most importantly, it helps give our local fishing communities a \nbigger role in making these decisions.\n  We know that every region has specific priorities that they would \nlike to see funded. Under this bill, money from the Saltonstall-Kennedy \nAct would be used to implement regional fishery investment plans, which \nwould be developed by the Regional Fishery Management Councils, \nreleased in the Federal Register for public comment, and approved by \nthe Secretary of Commerce. The priorities would include everything from \nmore frequent stock assessments, better recreational data, to crucial \nhabitat restoration.\n  This legislation will help give our fishermen a better chance to \ndevelop a clear, open dialogue with Federal regulators to determine we \nare up against and what we can do to fix it.
