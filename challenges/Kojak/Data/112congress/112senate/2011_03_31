Mr. President, we are continuing to work very hard to avoid \nthe terrible consequences that would come with a government shutdown. \nAs Vice President Biden announced last night after a 1\\1/2\\-hour \nmeeting we had in his office just a few feet from where I speak, the \nDemocrats and Republicans have agreed upon a number on which to base \nour budget cuts. That number is $73 billion below the President's \nbudget proposal. Now we have to get to that $73 billion number.\n  As I said all along, this is not just about dollars and deficits; it \nis about principles and priorities. What we cut is much more important \nthan how much we cut. The media is very concerned with which party will \nwin this fight politically. I am much more concerned with making sure \nthe American people do not lose out on this program we are doing. We \nhave to make sure the cuts do not damage the basic fiber of our \ncountry.\n  Let me once again remind the Senate that children, students, \nteachers, nurses, and seniors would be significantly hurt by the cuts \nin the Republican-passed H.R. 1. The tea party is here today. They are \nhere demonstrating that H.R. 1 should be followed--$100 billion--\ndamaging children, students, teachers, nurses, seniors, and many other \npeople in this country. H.R. 1 is not a piece of legislation of which \nanyone should be proud. Not a single child, not a single student, not a \nsingle teacher, not a single nurse, not a single police officer, not a \nsingle senior led us into this recession--not one. Punishing innocent \nbystanders will not lead us to a recovery.\n  We will continue talking and continue working to find a middle \nground. Again, we have agreed on a number. We have not agreed on how to \nget to that number. I hope an agreement can be reached as to how we get \nto that number, but it will not come on the backs of middle-class \nfamilies and the jobs they need, and it will not come if the other side \ncontinues to insist on unreasonable and unrealistic tea party cuts.\n  I appreciate Speaker Boehner and the rest of his Republican \nleadership in the House. What a tremendously difficult job they have. I \nam sure it is not easy trying to negotiate with the tea party screaming \nin their ears.\n  We have a lot more work to do. This country is at a crossroads in a \nlot of different ways. The economy is recovering--not as much and not \nas rapidly as we would like, but we cannot have what is going on here \nwith the tea party demonstrating all these very harsh cuts, unrealistic \nriders, punishing innocent folks just for political ideology.\n  We have a lot more to do. I hope this latest development is the \nbeginning of the end of this crisis because, remember, this is not the \nonly crisis we as a country are dealing with. We have about a score of \nships from our Navy trying to help the good people of Japan. We have a \nbig situation going on in the Middle East, not only in Libya but all \nover the Middle East. We have a war going on in Afghanistan. As I \nspeak, we have men and women whose lives are on the line in \nAfghanistan. We are trying to draw down in Iraq. We have a lot of \nissues we need to deal with.\n  We know there have to be budget cuts, and we are willing to do that. \nBut\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\nlet's also understand we cannot balance our budget with what the tea \nparty is wanting us to do. We have a huge problem in this country with \ndeficits. We have been a pretty good example of how we can balance the \nbudget. We did it in the Clinton years. We spent far less money than we \nwere taking in. We were reducing the debt. We were not having annual \ndeficits. We know it can be done, but we have to do it in the right \nway, as we did.\n  We want to work with our Republican colleagues. We have proven we can \ndo that with the two short-term CRs we have had. But I hope everyone \nunderstands that there is only so much the middle class of this country \ncan take. There is only so much we can do to damage the basic fiber of \nour children, students, teachers, our nurses, and our seniors.\n  Head Start is a program that has been around for decades, and it \nhelps a lot. It helps little boys and girls learn to read and do their \nmath that they would not ordinarily have the opportunity to do. These \nare really poor children. H.R. 1 cuts hundreds of thousands of little \nboys and girls from that program. That does not help our country.\n  We know cuts must be made, but they must be smart cuts, and we want \nto do the best we can to work together to do whatever is reasonable to \nreduce this debt we have. We know it can be done. It has been done in \nrecent history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2006-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, anyone who follows national politics \nknows that when it comes to a lot of the issues Americans care about \nmost, Democratic leaders in Washington are pretty far outside the \nmainstream. That is why we have one Democratic leader coaching his \ncolleagues to describe any Republican idea as extreme, and that is why \nother Democrats are attempting to marginalize an entire group of people \nin this country whose concerns about the growth of the Nation's debt, \nthe overreach of the Federal Government, and last year's health care \nbill are about as mainstream as it gets.\n  I am referring, of course, to the tea party--a loosely knit movement \nof everyday Americans from across the country who got so fed up in the \ndirection they saw lawmakers from both parties taking our country a \ncouple years ago that they decided to stand up and make their voices \nheard. Despite the Democratic leadership's talking points, these folks \nare not radicals. They are our next-door neighbors and our friends. By \nand large, they are housewives, professionals, students, parents, and \ngrandparents. After last fall's election, a number of them are now \nMembers of Congress.\n  Later on today, we will hear from many of them outside the Capitol. \nThese are everyday men and women who love their country and who do not \nwant to see it collapse as a result of irresponsible attitudes and \npolicies that somehow persist around here despite the warning signs we \nsee all around us about the consequences of fiscal recklessness. They \nare being vilified because, in an effort to preserve what is good about \nour country, they are politely asking lawmakers in Washington to change \nthe way things are done around here. So this morning I thought we could \nstep back and take a look at some of the things they are proposing and \nthen let people decide for themselves who they think is extreme.\n  At a time when the national debt has reached crisis levels, members \nof the tea party are asking that we stop spending more than we take in. \nIn other words, they are asking that Washington do what any household \nin America already does. They want us to balance our budget, and they \ndo this because they know their history and that the road to decline is \npaved with debt. Is that extreme?\n  They want us to be able to explain how any law we pass is consistent \nwith the Constitution. This means that as we write new laws, they want \nus to be guided by the document that every single Senator in this \nChamber has sworn to uphold. Is that extreme?\n  They want us to cut down on the amount of money the government \nspends. This year, the Federal Government in Washington is projected to \nspend about $1.6 trillion more than it has. That means we will have to \nborrow it from somewhere else, driving the national debt even higher \nthan it already is. What is more, the Obama administration plans to \ncontinue spending like this for years, so that within 5 years, the debt \nwill exceed $20 trillion. Given these facts, you tell me: Is it extreme \nto propose that we cut spending?\n\n  What else? Well, a lot of people in the tea party think the health \ncare bill the Democrats passed last year should be repealed and \nreplaced with real reforms that actually lower costs. Is that extreme?\n  Here is a bill that is expected to lead to about 80,000 fewer jobs, \nwhich will cause Federal health care spending to go up, compel millions \nto change the health care plans they have and like, and which is \nalready driving individual and family insurance premiums up \ndramatically. Businesses are being hammered by its regulations and its \nmandates. A majority of States are working to overturn it. Two Federal \njudges have ruled one of its central provisions violates the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  None of this sounds extreme to me. In fact, if you ask me, the goals \nof the tea party sound pretty reasonable. These folks recognize the \ngravity of the problems we face as a nation and they are doing \nsomething about it for the sake of our future. They are engaged in the \ndebate about spending and debt, which is a lot more than we can say \nabout the President and many Democrats here in Congress. They are \nmaking their voices heard and they have succeeded in changing the \nconversation here in Washington from how to grow government to how to \nshrink it.\n  In my view, the tea party has had an overwhelmingly positive impact \non the most important issues of the day. It has helped focus the \ndebate. It has provided a forum for Americans who felt left out of the \nprocess to have a voice and make a difference. It is already leading to \ngood results.\n  It may take some time, but thanks to everyday Americans like these \ngetting involved, speaking their minds, and advocating for commonsense \nreforms, I am increasingly confident we will get our fiscal house in \norder. Republicans are determined to do our part to advance the goals I \nhave mentioned. That is why we have been fighting to cut spending in \nthe near term, and that is why we will soon be proposing a balanced \nbudget amendment. American families have to balance their budgets; so \nshould their elected representatives in Washington. It is not too much \nto expect that lawmakers spend no more than they take in, unless you \nthink it is extreme to balance the books.\n  That brings us to the heart of the matter. The last time the Senate \nvoted on a balanced budget amendment, in 1997, the Federal deficit was \na little over $100 billion. Today, it is about $1.6 trillion. Back \nthen, the national debt was about $5.5 trillion. Today, it is closer to \n$14 trillion. Back then, the amendment failed by just one vote--just \none. Today, Democrats are already lining up against it.\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\n  What is extreme is the thought that government can continue on this \nreckless path without consequence. What is extreme is thinking we can \nblithely watch the Nation's debt get bigger and bigger and pretend it \ndoesn't matter. What is extreme is spending more than $1.5 trillion \nthan we have in a single year. This is the Democrats' approach. That is \nwhat is extreme.\n  The sad truth is, as our fiscal problems have become deeper, \nDemocrats in Washington and many others in statehouses across the \ncountry have become increasingly less concerned about the consequences. \nLook no farther than the ongoing spending debate in which Democrats \nhave fought tooth and nail over a proposal to cut a few billion dollars \nat a time when we are borrowing about $4 billion a day and our national \ndebt stands at $14 trillion; the President has set the debate out \nentirely; and Democrats have the nerve to call anyone who expresses \nconcern an extremist. If you are wondering where the tea party came \nfrom, look no further than that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2007-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to mark \nthe 1-year anniversary of a terrible tragedy in my home State of \nWashington, and to once again honor the memories of those who were \nkilled.\n  On April 2, 2010, a fire broke out at the Tesoro refinery in \nAnacortes, WA, and claimed the lives of seven workers: Daniel J. \nAldridge, Matthew C. Bowen, Donna Van Dreumel, Matt Gumbel, Darrin J. \nHoines, Lew Janz, and Kathryn Powell.\n  These were men and women who were taken too young, with so much life \nto live and with so many people to live it with. They were workers who \ntook on tough jobs, worked long hours during difficult economic times \nto provide for their families. They were people who made tremendous \nsacrifices and who embodied so much of what is good about the community \nthey lived in.\n  They have been dearly missed. Even now, 1 year later, there is \nnothing we can say to make the pain go away for the mothers and \nfathers, sons and daughters, coworkers, and family members who still \nbear those deep scars of loss. But the Anacortes community is strong, \nand while they have endured more than their fair share of pain over the \nyears, their resiliency and compassion have carried them forward. Over \nthe past year, we have seen homes and hearts and pocketbooks open to \nthe families who lost so much because this community understands the \npain of a loss such as this can't be overcome or forgotten. They know \nthese families should never have to bear that pain alone.\n  We owe it to the Anacortes community to honor those they have lost. \nWe owe it to them to do everything we can to make sure that such \ntragedies never happen again.\n  State investigators have determined that tragedy could have been and \nshould have been prevented. The problems that led to what happened were \nknown beforehand and they should have been fixed. That is \nheartbreaking.\n  Every worker in every industry deserves to be confident that while \nthey are working hard and doing their jobs, their employers are doing \neverything they can to protect them. I want you to know I will keep \nworking to make sure the oil and gas industry improves their safety \npractices, because we owe that to our workers and to their families and \nto communities such as Anacortes all across our country.\n  One year after that tragedy, my thoughts and prayers and condolences \nremain with the families who have endured so much pain, and my profound \nthanks goes out to the Anacortes community that has been with those \nfamilies every step of the way.\n  I am proud to submit a Senate resolution with my colleague, Senator \nCantwell--which we will do later today--to recognize the anniversary of \nthis tragedy on April 2, 2011, and I urge my colleagues to join in \nremembering those workers in Anacortes who were taken from us far too \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2007-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2007-S2009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PUBLIC EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today to \ntalk a little about the state of public education in this country, \nespecially when it comes to the condition of poor children in the \nUnited States, in part because I think it is urgent that we fix No \nChild Left Behind--a law that is not working well for kids and for \nteachers, and for moms and dads all across the United States, and \ncertainly in my home State of Colorado.\n  Sometimes people who aren't engaged in the work of teaching our \nkids--which I think is the hardest work anybody can do, short of going \nto war--don't realize how horrific the outcomes are for children in \nthis great country of ours, especially children living in poverty. When \nI am on this floor, where there are 100 desks--there are 100 Senators--\nI sometimes think a little about what the condition of the people here \nwould be if they were not Senators, but if these 100 people were poor \nchildren living in the United States in the 21st century.\n  First of all, it is important to recognize that of the 100 Senators--\nor the 100 kids in this great country--42 of the 100 would be living in \npoverty. Forty-two out of the 100 would be poor. Of those Senators--now \npoor children living in this country--as this chart shows, by the age \nof 4 they would have heard only one-third of the words heard by their \nmore affluent peers. They are living in poverty, and they have heard 13 \nmillion words. A child in a professional family has heard 45 million \nwords. There isn't a kindergarten teacher in this country who wouldn't \ntell you that makes an enormous difference right out of the chute.\n  Also by age 4, only 39 of the 100 children can recognize the letters \nof the alphabet--just 39 of 100 by age 4. In contrast, 85 percent of \nthe children coming from middle-class families can recognize the \nletters of the alphabet. Again, there is not a kindergarten teacher or \na high school teacher who wouldn't tell you that makes an enormous \ndifference to kids when they come to school in terms of their readiness \nto learn.\n  But what happens when they are actually in our schools? By the fourth \ngrade, only 17 out of 100 children in poverty can read at grade level--\n17. That is fewer kids than there are desks in this section of the \nSenate floor. The entire rest of the floor would be kids who cannot \nread at grade level by the fourth grade. These kids are reading at \ngrade level. Everyone else all across this beautiful Chamber would not \nbe able to read at grade level in America in the 21st century. Only \nthis section can read proficiently by the fourth grade.\n\n  What happens as they stay in school? It gets worse. By the eighth \ngrade, only 16 of our kids can read at grade level. I could wander \naround the entire rest of this Chamber looking for somebody who can \nread proficiently, and I would not be able to find them. I have been in \nclassrooms all across my State, all across the great city of Denver, \nand all across this country. In my view, there is nothing more at war \nwith who we are as Americans or who we are as Coloradoans than a fifth \ngrade child reading at the first grade level. There is a lot of \ndiscussion on this floor about your moral right to this and your moral \nright to that. I cannot think of anything less American than a child in \nthe fifth grade doing first grade math.\n  Speaking of math, in a world where technology and engineering and \ninvention are going to dominate the 21st\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\ncentury economy, how are we doing in math? Seventeen of our kids in the \neighth grade are proficient mathematicians.\n  When I took the job as superintendent of schools in Denver, a \ndistrict of 75,000 children, one of the greatest cities in the greatest \ncountry in the world, on the 10th grade math test that the State \nadministers, in that district of 75,000 children, there were 33 \nAfrican-American students proficient on that test and 61 Latino \nstudents proficient on the test; fewer than four classrooms of kids \nproficient on a test which measures--if we are honest with ourselves, \nwhich we are not--a junior high school standard of mathematical \nproficiency in Europe. That is what we are doing to our kids.\n  By the end of high school, if this Senate were a classroom of poor \nchildren in this country, only 57 of us would be around to graduate and \nonly 25 are actually ready for college or ready for a career. That is \none-quarter of this room; 75, we can just write them off, 75 of these \ndesks.\n  It gets even worse after that because, of our 100 children, only 9 \nwill graduate from college. These two rows of desks represent children \ncoming from ZIP Codes where they are living in poverty and who \nultimately make it through to graduate from college. That is it--two \nrows in one section of the Senate. No one in these rows will graduate \nfrom college, and no one in any of these desks from here to the other \nside of this floor will graduate from college. That has been true for a \ngeneration.\n  If we do not do things differently, it is going to be true for this \ngeneration of kindergartners, if we do not change what we do.\n  Sometimes people think this is someone else's problem, that it is not \na question of national interest. I cannot imagine why anybody would \nthink that, but some people do. McKinsey, the consulting group, has \ndone a study which shows the effect of this dropout rate we have \ncreates a permanent recession in our economy as great as the one we \nhave been through. In other words, if we were graduating these kids \nfrom college, our economic growth would be far greater than it is right \nnow. We can see the effect in this recession we just came out of. For \npeople with less than a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was \n15.3 percent. We can see the numbers here. But if you had a bachelor's \ndegree or higher, your unemployment rate was 4 percent; 15 percent \nversus 4 percent in this recession we just went through.\n  But the point is also that it creates a chronic recession, a drag on \nour economy, not to mention the fact that if we go to the prisons of \nthis country and we ask people did you graduate from high school, the \nanswer is that somewhere in the neighborhood of 85 percent of the \npeople in our prisons are high school dropouts. It doesn't take a lot \nof imagination to see how we might start solving that problem by \nactually graduating kids from high school and getting them ready for \ncollege.\n  Again, this is not about we are kind of sort of doing OK. Nine kids \nfrom poverty, on average, are making it through to a college degree; 91 \nare not. It is not as though those odds are somehow fairly distributed \nacross the population in the United States of America.\n  There are huge international implications for all this as well. We \ncan see, these are our students compared to our international peers on \nthe eighth grade math test. We can see our Anglo kids are scoring up \nhere--Korea, Singapore, Japan, Anglo kids in the United States of \nAmerica. The U.S. average is here, so we have to go Hungary, England, \nRussian Federation, U.S. average. I don't know why we would not want to \nbe first, but we are not first.\n  But look at how our Latino kids are doing and our African Americans \nkids are doing. Armenia, Australia, Sweden, Malta, Scotland, Serbia, \nItaly--our Latino kids, way down here. Keep going, Malaysia, Norway, \nCyprus, Bulgaria, Israel, Ukraine, Romania, our U.S. African-American \nstudents--right above Bosnia, two steps above Lebanon. Think of it \nthrough the eyes of one of our African-American students living in a \nneighborhood in poverty in Chicago or Denver or Los Angeles or Boston. \nWhat are the odds that they are actually going to be able to graduate, \nthat they are going to be able to contribute to the democracy, \ncontribute meaningfully to our economy, compete in this global economy? \nThey are long. They are long and they know they are long.\n  We cannot fix this problem from Washington. But we can call attention \nto the question. We can create policies and suggestions about how \npeople ought to do the work differently. Having served as a \nsuperintendent in an urban school district for almost 4 years and \nhaving spent time with our kids, spent time with our teachers, I know \nwe can succeed. The kids have the intellectual capacity to do the work. \nThere is no doubt they do. But they are in a system that was designed \ndeep in the last century. In fact, if we are honest about it, a lot of \nthe way the system was designed was in colonial America.\n  In my judgment, it is time for the burden to shift from the people \nwho want to change the system to the people who want to keep it the \nsame. There were nights sometimes in the school board meetings when \npeople would come and they would say: Michael, how do you sleep at \nnight doing this and doing that and trying to change this and worrying \nabout that?\n  I would say to them: The reason I can sleep at night is that I do not \nthink we could do any worse than we are doing. We ought to think about \nstopping what we are doing and figure out how to change the way we \nthink about recruiting, retaining, and inspiring teachers in the 21 \ncentury. We ought to elevate standards so we are not kidding ourselves \nacross the country about whether we are competing with our \ninternational rivals and stop cheating our kids by telling them they \nare succeeding, when they are not, compared to the kids across the \nglobe. We have to get out of the business of measuring things that do \nnot make any sense to anybody right now who is working in the schools. \nWho cares how this year's fourth graders did compared to last year's \nfourth graders? What we need to know is how this group of fifth graders \ndid compared to how they did as fourth graders, compared to how they \ndid as third graders. That is common sense, but it is not the way the \nlaw works today.\n  I see my colleague from Georgia, but I wish to say this first. We \ncannot keep No Child Left Behind the way it is. It is contributing to \nthe problem that is out there. It is making the work harder to do, not \neasier to do, for our teachers, for our principals, and for our kids. \nOur moms and dads are right to point out it is measuring the wrong \nthing and thinking about data in the wrong way. We ought to take this \nopportunity in a bipartisan way to fix No Child Left Behind, to lift \nsome of that burden from our kids and from our teachers and our \nprincipals.\n  What we have to do as we are doing that is, we have to point to the \nplaces where it is actually working to demonstrate that the fact that \nyou are born into a ZIP Code defined by poverty doesn't mean your life \nis going to be defined by poverty. We need to point to examples of \npeople who have managed to struggle through, our schools that have \nmanaged to struggle through and beat the odds and are sending 95 and 98 \npercent of their poor children on to get a college degree. We need to \nbe asking ourselves why we are not achieving that at scale.\n  I am the proud father of three little girls. I can tell you that if \nanyone in this body faced the same odds for their children or for their \ngrandchildren that poor children in America face, there is no way we \nwould not be talking about this issue night and day. In fact, people \nmight give up. I might give up and rush home and say: I am going to \ntake my kids out of that place they are in and I am going to put them \nin a place with the finest teachers and I am going to give up this \nSenate floor to make sure, as a parent, that I am involved in their \neducation.\n  There is no way we would accept these odds for our own children. What \nI would argue is, the children I am talking about are our children. \nRemember, 42 out of 100 are living in poverty in this country. What is \nour answer for them?\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of this \naisle to not make excuses, to not find a reason why we cannot lead, to \nnot find a reason why we cannot fix No Child Left Behind but, instead, \nto create some hope for children all across our country\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\nliving in urban and rural areas who are suffering this horrible plight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

First, I wish to commend the Senator from Colorado and \ntry to ratify what I heard him say. I came in after the first part of \nhis speech, but I know his focus was on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and No Child Left Behind. He is exactly right. There are \nreforms that do need to take place. We have gone 3 years without a \nreauthorization, and reauthorization, hopefully, can happen this year. \nWhen it does, we can improve the plight of our children, and we can \nreform the way we do some of the things we do in SEA to open new \nopportunities for our kids. But accepting the status quo, he is right, \nis not good enough. We need to make those reforms, and we need to make \nthem now. I look forward to working with the Senator from Colorado in \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee when that issue \ncomes up, to reform ESEA, get it reauthorized, to reempower our \nteachers, our students, our parents, and raise the level of education \nfor all Americans.\n  I congratulate him for his great contribution to the State of \nColorado and, further, to the Senate.\n  I wish to steal a line he just gave us 1 minute ago. When I walked \nin, he was saying there are some things Congress cannot do. He is \nright. Education does take place at the local level. There are some \nthings we can fix in Washington, but it is primarily done at the local \nlevel.\n  But there is one thing Congress can fix; that is, our spending, our \ndebt, and our deficit. For just 1 second, I wish to speak not in the \ntone of a politician, not as somebody who is a part of the institution, \ntrying to talk about what he thinks, I wish to talk about what I think \nthe people of Georgia think. The people of Georgia do not understand \nwhy we cannot do in Washington what they have had to do during the last \n3 years. During the economic travails of the last 3 years, every \nAmerican family has had to sit around their kitchen table, \nreprioritizing how they spend their money to deal with lower returns on \ntheir investments, the consequences of unemployment or underemployment. \nThey have had to adapt to difficult economic times. Yet when they turn \non the television and they look at C-SPAN, they do not see us adapting \nto the economic times we find ourselves in as a country. I was in the \nreal estate business for 33 years and I do not understand a lot of \nthings, but I understand leverage.\n  Leverage is a marvelous thing in capitalism. If you have proper \nleverage in real estate or proper leverage in business, it can make a \nlot of things happen. Leverage is good, but too much leverage is a \ndeath sentence and we are at a precipice in this country. We are at a \nprecipice where we are about to fall off. If we all fall off, there is \nno recovery because continued deficit spending and continued increasing \ndebts results in two things: inflating the dollar in future years to \npay that debt off with cheaper dollars, which devalues every asset of \nevery American family, and increasing the interest rates to \nunsustainable and unpayable amounts.\n  I lived through that one in the post-Carter years in 1980, 1981, and \n1983 when we dealt with the Misery Index in America--double-digit \ninflation, double-digit unemployment, and double-digit interest rates. \nIn my home State of Georgia today we have double-digit unemployment, \n10.4 percent. Interest rates are low, but it is arbitrary, and they are \ngetting ready to go up. The yield spread curve between 2-year Federal \ndebt and 10-year U.S. debt is triple, which indicates the markets that \nare buying our debt are already looking out in the future and saying \ninterest rates are going higher, three times what they are now, maybe \nmore.\n  If you look at inflation, inflation is arbitrarily low right now. But \nwith what is happening to food and prices, contributed by gasoline and \npetroleum, what we see happening in the world marketplaces, it is an \ninevitable factor, unless we get our arms around our debt and our \ndeficit.\n  We owe about $14 trillion in debt. The deficit this year is over $1.5 \ntrillion. Those are unsustainable numbers. We do not have to pay the \ndebt off today. We do not have to reduce the deficit to zero. But we \nhave to get ourselves on a glidepath to reducing our deficit and, in \nturn, reducing our debt over time. It means we have to sit down at our \nkitchen tables, the floor of the Senate and the floor of the House, \nprioritize what we are doing, and get to the business the American \npeople expect us to get to.\n  We are playing some political games right now with short-term CRs, \nwhen the big votes, the big debates, and the big decisions loom ahead--\nfirst, the debt ceiling, later the fiscal year 2012 appropriations.\n  There are three things I hope we will do: No. 1 is recognize our \nsystem is broken and is not working. I did a little research. Most of \nmy years in Congress, more dollars have been appropriated through \nomnibus appropriations than through legitimate debate and budget units \non the Senate floor. We did not do any last year. The reason we are \ndoing a CR this year on last year is because it was an omnibus \nappropriation.\n  We are not spending our money like the American people have to spend \ntheirs. We are not prioritizing. We are not looking at cost-benefit \nanalysis. We have to change our system. I am pleased to have joined \nwith former Governor Shaheen of New Hampshire, a Democratic colleague, \nto introduce the Biennial Budget and Appropriations Act for the \nCongress, an act which mimics what 20 of our States, 40 percent of the \ncountry, already does: appropriate on a 2-year cycle rather than on a \n1-year cycle; appropriate in odd-numbered years so that in even-\nnumbered years, which also happen to be election years, we do not do \nappropriating, we do oversight. We spend a year not making political \npromises of what bacon we are going to bring home, but we spend a year \nlooking for savings and redundancy and duplication and waste in Federal \nspending.\n  If we do not spend a minute looking back, we can never spend a minute \nlooking forward. Right now we do not spend any time looking back and \nseeing where money is being spent and where it might be saved. We do \nnot reprioritize what was introduced and established years ago. The \nBiennial Budget and Appropriations Act requires the President of the \nUnited States to submit a biennial budget, requires Congress to act on \nthe independent budget units in a 2-year fashion, in the odd-numbered \nyears, and requires the oversight in even-numbered years of every \nfunction of the Federal Government.\n  We do not do oversight anymore, and we are paying a terrible price \nfor it. That is the first thing we need to do. Second, we need to \nunderstand that we need to appropriate our money the way the American \npeople appropriate their money. They measure the benefit compared to \nthe cost, and if the benefit to their family is not equal to or greater \nthan the cost, they do not spend the money. But in the Congress, we do \nnot measure cost-benefit analysis. We measure how much more we can \nspend in continuation than what we appropriated in a previous year. \nThat is a broken system, and it is a broken cycle.\n  I commend Senator Corker on his introduction of the CAP Act, which is \nthe second part of what we need to do; that is, put ourselves on some \ntype of fiscal constraint through a balanced budget amendment and \nthrough a spending cap.\n  A little known secret is 2 years ago the Nation of Israel confronted \nproblems such as the ones we have today--burgeoning debt, a bigger \ndeficit, and spending problems. Prime Minister Netanyahu and their \nFinance Minister sat down at their kitchen table in Tel Aviv and \nestablished a biennial budget process, 2-year appropriations rather \nthan 1, of even-numbered year election oversight and odd-numbered \nappropriating.\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\n  Then they did a second thing. They put a cap on their debt, and they \nput a cap on spending. Do you know what happened in 2 years' time? \nIsrael's GDP has grown by 7.9 percent. The International Monetary Fund \nand the World Bank have told the EU and some of the struggling \ncountries in the EU such as Portugal and Spain that they should adopt a \nbiennial spending process and the oversight process of a biennial \nbudget and an appropriations act.\n  Well, I would say this: If 20 of our States are doing it, and they \nare 20 of our most fiscally sound States, beginning with New Hampshire \nand Nebraska and Oregon and States like that, and if Israel has done it \nand demonstrated, in difficult world economic times, they can grow \ntheir GDP by 7.9 percent and reduce their debt and cap their spending, \nand if the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are telling the \nEuropean Union, which is in most difficult straits today, that it is \npart of the answer as to how they spend their money and getting an arm \naround their spending, then I think we should take a look at it, and it \nshould be on the floor of the Senate being debated.\n  We have a window of opportunity. We have the chance to reform our \nspending process, to set ourselves on a glidepath to reducing our debt \nand reducing our deficit over time and sending a signal to the world \nmarket that the strong America they have known and invested in is going \nto be even stronger in the future.\n  But if we continue to dilly-dally around, trying to make political \nheadway out of economic events, and push ourselves out in time on debt \nand deficit, we are going to have higher inflation, higher interest \nrates. We are going to devalue the assets of the American people and, \nworst of all, we are going to lose our place in the world.\n  I do not want to be a part of that. The President does not want to be \na part of that. I do not think any Member of the Senate wants to be a \npart of that. So my encouragement to the leadership, Democratic and \nRepublican alike, is, let's let the best ideas flow. Let's let them \ncome to the floor of the Senate. Let's debate them. Let's invite the \nPresident to come and sit down with us and do the same thing.\n  Instead of taking entitlements off the table, they ought to be part \nof the discussion. Instead of saying there are some things we are not \ngoing to do and some things we will, we ought to be open and say we \nwill look at everything, and then we will prioritize based on cost \nversus benefits. If we do that, we will do what the people of Georgia \nexpect me to do, and I think what the people of the United States \nexpect all of us to do.\n  We have a great country made great by a great people who made \ndifficult decisions in difficult times. This is the difficult decision \nfacing our time. I want to be one of the people who is a part of the \nsolution, not a footnote in history at the beginning of the decline of \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have a couple of things to say this \nmorning. First, and briefly, I want to, and probably will, support the \nmilitary action in Libya. I have been inclined to think that careful, \nsurgical use of our forces can make a positive difference to the degree \nit would be worth the risk of that involvement. But I am not really \nsure of that.\n  As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, these are matters \nwith which I am not totally unfamiliar. I was very confident from the \nbeginning that we could execute a no-fly zone very effectively, and \nthat--there is risk but not great risk because of our military \ncapabilities. However, I do believe that over a number of years the \nCongress and the American people have expressed grave concerns over the \nexecutive branch committing the United States to military actions \nwithout full participation of the legislative branch. We have not used \nthe declaration of war mechanism, truthfully, as the defining act for \nmost of our military actions in recent years. We have used \nauthorization of military force resolutions that authorized the \nPresident to utilize the military force.\n  We spent weeks doing that before the Iraq invasion--not weeks, \nmonths. In fact, as I recall, the authorization for utilization of \nmilitary force in Iraq was passed in the fall, I believe October, and \nthe actual invasion did not occur until the next spring, in March.\n  During that time, we had many hearings. We had full debate. There was \nresolution after resolution in the U.N, but Congress was fully on top \nof all of it. They knew what was at stake, and we voted. Some voted no \nand complained and continued to complain. But for the most part, those \nwho voted no supported the action because we had been involved in a \ndiscussion that was real about the risk and so forth.\n  Then we had other actions, such as Grenada and Panama, that had less \ndebate by Congress. People have not been happy about that. They \nbelieved there should have been more. In my opinion, the consultative \nprocess for this military engagement was unacceptable. It did not have \nto occur in this fashion. There was ample opportunity to discuss it.\n  Senator Susan Collins, on the Armed Services Committee, a few days \nago, we had top Defense Department officials there. Admiral Stavridis, \nwho is the commander of NATO forces, was testifying. She said: Well, we \nhad time, it appears, to consult and get a vote in the U.N. We had time \nto consult and get a vote in NATO. The Arab League apparently found \ntime to reach some sort of consensus, but we did not have time to \ninvolve the Congress.\n  Well, that struck me as a very legitimate and serious statement. I \nthink Senator Collins was correct. There was ample opportunity to \nconsult Congress. This was a war, to use a phrase in recent years, of \nchoice. It was not a military action that was demanded because we had \nbeen attacked on our soil or in our legitimate bases somewhere around \nthe world and we had to defend ourselves immediately.\n  So I am not happy about it. I think it is a big mess. I think \nDemocrats and Republicans have the same unease about it, and I believe \nit is time for Congress to assert itself more effectively.\n  We had a briefing last night, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock. It went 50 \nminutes. Frankly, I did not get a lot out of it. I heard little that I \nhad not picked up from the cable news networks. We turned on the \ntelevision this morning, and we saw news about the CIA involvement \nthere, for good or ill. I did not hear that discussed at our briefing. \nIt would have been nice to have heard it straight from the \nadministration's leaders, rather than seeing it on television the next \nmorning. So this is the kind of situation we are in. It is not \nacceptable. Congress must assert itself.\n  Based on what President Obama said back during the campaign about our \nreluctance to initiate military force, it is sort of surprising that we \nhave not had more consultation.\n  Maybe it is an institutional tendency. Once you become President, you \ndon't want to fool with Congress. They ask troublesome questions. They \nslow things down, maybe, although in this instance I think we had a lot \nquicker response from Congress than we got from the administration. \nRegardless, I think we are in front of that issue. It is time for \nCongress in a bipartisan way to ask itself, first, what do we expect, \nwhat is a minimum amount of congressional involvement? Then we need to \nmake sure that every President hence forward complies with at least \nthat.\n  I am also not happy at the way some resolution was passed here that \nseemed to have authorized force in some way that nobody I know of in \nthe Senate was aware that it was in the resolution when it passed. I am \nvery concerned about that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2010-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2010-S2012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             OMB NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we will have this afternoon a vote in \nthe Budget Committee, of which I am ranking Republican, on the \nnomination of Heather Higginbottom to be President Obama's deputy \nbudget director\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nat the Office of Management and Budget. OMB is a very critical part of \nthe administration of any American government. OMB is the agency that \ncontrols, on behalf of the President, the lust of all agencies and \ndepartments to get more money for their budgets. They send up their \nrequests. OMB is the control point for the President. He cannot sit \ndown and negotiate every single dispute over funding. OMB handles that, \ncontrols it. If there is a real loggerhead debate between Cabinet \nofficials and OMB, they can go directly to the President, and the \nPresident will decide it. But most times overwhelmingly decisions are \nmade in OMB. It is that institution that is critical to contain the \ngrowing spending we have. It is a very important position.\n  I supported the appointment of Jack Lew for Director. He had been OMB \nDirector under President Clinton. He was said to be the one to get \ncredit for balancing the budget. I do remember that the House \nRepublicans under Newt Gingrich fought over spending for months and \nyears. Actually for a short period of time the government shut down. It \nlooks as though it didn't destroy America. We are still operating. But \nthey fought, and they balanced the budget. So Mr. Lew was there during \nthat period of time. Certainly he deserves some credit. I was pleased \nto support him. But I was stunningly disappointed when Mr. Lew went on \ntelevision and said the President's 10-year budget calls on America to \nlive within its means, to not spend more than we take in, when over the \n10-year budget, there is not a single year by the President's own \nbudget, submitted by Mr. Lew, in which the deficit fell below $600 \nbillion. And in the outyears the numbers were going up to about $800 \nbillion.\n  Since Mr. Lew submitted the President's budget, the Congressional \nBudget Office, nonpartisan group, analyzed President Obama's budget and \nsaid it is far worse than that. The lowest single deficit we will have \nin 10 years is $748 billion. The highest deficit President Bush ever \nhad was $450 billion.\n  This is unbelievable. This year the budget deficit is going to be \nover $1.4 billion. In the tenth year, CBO said Mr. Lew and President \nObama's budget would call for a $1.2 trillion deficit, a clearly \nunsustainable path of surging debt in the outyears going up. That is \nwhy Mr. Bernanke, Federal Reserve Chairman, and Erskine Bowles, \nPresident Obama's chairman of the deficit commission, both said this is \nan unsustainable path.\n  Interest last year on the budget was about $200 billion. We paid out \n$200 billion to people in China and governments of China, Japan, all \nover the world and to American citizens who loaned us money so we can \nspend $3.6 trillion this year while we are only taking in 2.2. We have \nto borrow that money. We don't have that money. Forty cents of every \ndollar that is spent is borrowed. We get a budget for next year, \nblithely calling for education funding to be increased 10 percent, 11 \npercent, calling for the Energy Department to get a 9.5-percent \nincrease, calling for the State Department to get a 10.5-percent \nincrease, calling for huge increases in the Transportation Department, \nwhile inflation is 2 percent or less, and deficits are surging out of \ncontrol. And what do they say? They say these are investments, but \nsometimes we don't have money to invest. How can I buy stock if I don't \nhave any money? We don't have money. Reality has to break through.\n  The fact that the President continues to assert his budget calls on \nus to live within our means when it sets forth the most irresponsible \nsurge of debt the Nation has ever seen is breathtaking. I am \ndisappointed that Mr. Lew has mouthed the same phrases. He has said the \nsame things.\n  Mr. Erskine Bowles, who cochaired the commission President Obama \nappointed, he and Alan Simpson a few days ago issued a statement when \nthey testified before the Budget Committee. They said this country is \nfacing the most predictable economic crisis in its history. When asked \nby Senator Conrad, our chairman, about that, he said it could be 2 \nyears, Mr. Bowles, maybe a little less, maybe a little more, we will \nhave a crisis. Alan Simpson, cochairman of the commission, popped in \nand said he thinks 1 year; by the end of this year we could have a debt \ncrisis. It is time to act and get on the right path and not be in \ndenial as we are at this time.\n  I asked Ms. Higginbottom about some of these issues when she was \nbefore the committee to try to determine whether she understood the \ngravity of the situation which we are now in. I was not satisfied.\n  First, Ms. Higginbottom's experience level is stunningly lacking. She \nwas a former campaign adviser to President Obama, has had no formal \nbudget training or experience, not even a college class in economics. \nShe said: I am not an accountant. No, she is not. She has never served \non the Budget Committee. She never studied business, never ran a \nbusiness, never was a mayor of a town, a county commissioner who had to \nbalance a budget or served in a Governor's office in any way, shape, or \nform. She has campaigned for Senator Kerry. The highest job she has had \nwas legislative director, not the Chief of Staff who manages the staff, \nbut the legislative director for Senator Kerry who testified for her.\n  She is a fine person. I think she seems in every way to be a decent \nperson and would be a good legislative director in the Senate. But to \nbe the person who looks a Cabinet official in the eye and says: \nSecretary Smith, you are asking for X billion dollars and we don't have \nit. OMB says you don't get it. Who can talk to the American people and \ntell them we are in a fiscal crisis that could lead to a debt crisis to \nput us in another recession, a double dip? I don't think she has any \ncomprehension of that. How could she? This is not her experience. She \nhas been a political operative, a legislative operative. When pressed \nabout it, she basically said: The President's budget is a policy \ndocument.\n  At this point in history, OMB needs to be thinking about dollars and \ncents, needs to be thinking about debt. This idea that we can spend and \ninvest regardless of the financial consequences that will inevitably \naccrue is false. We need to be listening to someone like Erskine \nBowles. We need someone like Erskine Bowles in charge of the OMB. When \nthe President announced his budget, that very day, Mr. Bowles said it \ncame nowhere close to doing what is necessary to get this country on \nthe right track, nowhere close. We need somebody of seriousness who \nunderstands the threat this country is facing.\n  They say you have objected to her because she is young. I have never \nmentioned the word ``young.'' But she is young. But the most important \nthing is, she does not have the kind of experience in business or \naccounting or budgeting or responsibility for management that one would \nlook for in the second in command of the OMB, the most central unit in \nour entire governmental structure committed to containing wasteful \nspending. We need somebody who will go after waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Being a former Federal prosecutor, a little experience in going after \ncriminals who are trying to steal from us wouldn't hurt. It would be of \nsome value. But she doesn't have that.\n  Despite the fact that she is a person of character and a good \npersonality and is liked, she is not the right nominee, and, in my \nview, the nomination should not go forward, and I object to it.\n  I know in the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, \nwhere she also had a hearing, Senator Scott Brown asked her a number of \nquestions.\n  He asked:\n\n       You'll be No. 2. And if Director Lew is not there, you will \n     be No. 1, potentially. In that respect, I would presume you \n     would be dealing with accounting and budgeting, obviously, \n     problems within OMB. Is that a fair statement?\n       Higginbottom: Sure, uh-huh.\n       Brown: So I guess my original question is, what type of \n     budgeting and accounting experience do you have?\n       Higginbottom: I have done a lot of policymaking.\n       Senator Brown: All right. I understand that. But I guess \n     I'm asking, do you have any accounting or budgetary \n     experience aside from dealing in policy matters?\n       Higginbottom: I am not an accountant, but the President's \n     budget is an articulation of his policy agenda.\n\n  I think that fails to evidence an understanding of the difficult role \nthe OMB has.\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\n  My staff director for the minority in the Senate Budget Committee \nserved in OMB for a while--such a wonderful person. One reason he came \nto my attention was because a member of President Bush's \nadministration, whom I know well, said he had to go to him and try to \nask him to approve additional funding for a department or agency, and \nhe said he could say no, and he would do it in a way that he showed he \nunderstood what we were talking about but he would not give in, and he \nmade you respect him for it.\n  Well, that is kind of the nature of the OMB. All these agencies and \ndepartments want to ask for more money for their departments--they can \ndo all these good things--and somebody has to say: This is putting us \nover the limit. This is putting us over our budget. We do not have this \nkind of money.\n  I hope we can get the kind of serious leadership in that office that \ndoes not seem to be present today by virtue of the language that \nindicates that our OMB believes we have a good budget that lives within \nour means. Both Director Lew and President Obama have repeatedly said \nthe President's budget allows us to live within our means, ``spend \nmoney that we have each year'' and ``begin paying down our debt.''\n  Five or six fact check organizations that analyze statements to see \nif they are accurate have found these statements to be false. And they \nare plainly, utterly false. The lowest deficit we are going to have, \nunder the President's Budget, according to the CBO, is $748 billion in \nthe next 10 years. The lowest annual deficit. And our interest payment \nwill increase from $200 billion this year to over $900 billion in 2012.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what time is left on this side. There is \nno time left? I will wrap up and say it is for those concerns I have \nexpressed that I will not support Heather Higginbottom as OMB Deputy \nDirector, even though she has many fine qualities, as Senator John \nKerry set forth in his testimony on her behalf, although he was not \nable and did not contend that she has experience in budget, accounting, \nor finance.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2012-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLEAN AIR ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, sometime today we are going to get back to \nthe SBIR bill, the bill that deals with helping our small businesses \nwith innovation and growth so we can create more jobs and continue to \nlead the world in innovation, so we can win that international \ncompetition the President talks about. We need to do that by \nouteducating and outinnovating and outbuilding our competitors. Part of \nthat is helping our small business community with innovation. The bill \nthat is on the floor--the authorization of the SBIR program--helps \nsmall, innovative companies in order to create jobs and help America \ngrow.\n  I take this time, though, to urge my colleagues to reject all of the \namendments that may be offered that would take away from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency their ability to enforce our Clean Air \nAct. I say that because I truly believe--I think most people believe; \nand it has been proven over history--we can have a clean environment \nand we can grow our economy. In fact, I think if we do not have a clean \nenvironment, it is going to be more difficult for us to grow our \neconomy.\n  We need to do what is right for the people of this Nation as it \nrelates to their public health. The Clean Air Act has been one of the \nmost important bills to protect the public health of the people of this \nNation.\n  Carbon emissions are pollution. They are polluting our environment. \nThey are causing respiratory ailments. They are making it more \ndifficult for people who have respiratory illness to be able to \nbreathe. We have children with asthma who are directly affected by the \nquality of the air they breathe.\n  It is our responsibility to take care of our children. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure they have clean air. The Clean Air Act has \nhelped us deal with those needs. We want the enforcement of the Clean \nAir Act to be based upon science, not the political whims here in \nWashington. We want the scientists to tell us what we can do to protect \nour public health. That is what the Clean Air Act and its enforcement \nis about, and it is being done in a way that allows our economy to \ngrow.\n  There are some here who say: Well, some of these amendments are a \ntemporary holdback from what EPA can do to enforce our laws by putting \na moratorium on enforcement. Well, we all know what happens with \nmoratoriums. We do not know whether we will ever get beyond those \nshort-term delays. We do not want to go down that path.\n  What do you do if you are a business and you are trying to do what is \nright with the investments of your company to comply with the Clean Air \nAct and now you are being told, well, maybe those rules will change? \nHow do you make the necessary investments in your company without \nknowing the ground rules are the ground rules? Let's not go down that \npath. That would be the wrong way to go.\n  Let me give an example in my own State of Maryland where we have seen \nthat a clean environment is good for our economy.\n  In 2007, the Maryland legislature passed the Healthy Air Act. Let me \ntell you something, Mr. President. Since the creation of that bill, it \ncreated thousands of jobs. It created more opportunity for the people \nof Maryland. Constellation Energy invested $1 billion in compliance \nwith the 2007 Healthy Air Act, reducing its SO2, \nSOX emissions by 85 percent and mercury by 80 percent. We \nhave seen in our State of Maryland that the Healthy Air Act created \njobs and has provided healthier air for the people of Maryland.\n  Let me tell you something, air knows no boundary. We have helped our \nsurrounding States. The problem is, the people of Maryland are downwind \nfrom other States we wish were making the same type of commitments we \nare making in Maryland.\n  Let's at least maintain the standards of the Clean Air Act. This is \nthe wrong bill to consider this issue anyway. Remember, I started by \nsaying we will be taking up the small business bill to help our small \nbusiness communities with innovation--SBIR: innovation and research. \nThat is the bill we are on. Yet my colleagues want to attach to this \nbill amendments that would restrict the Environmental Protection Agency \nfrom doing its responsibility on behalf of the public to protect our \nclean air.\n  Let me give you by way of example--we tried this. The EPA is the cop \non the beat to make sure the polluters do not pollute our air. We at \none time had a cop on the beat for the financial markets, and we sort \nof eased that up because we said we needed to do that for business. \nWhat happened is, we had a financial meltdown.\n  We do not want to go down the same path on protecting the public \nhealth of the people of this Nation by removing the cop on the beat. \nThat would be the wrong thing to do. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthose types of amendments.\n  Let me tell you something: The public gets this. Seven out of ten \nAmericans want us to enforce our Clean Air Act against the polluters. \nSeven out of ten Americans do not want us to weaken the laws of this \ncountry that protect the public health of the people of America.\n  We cannot afford to turn the clock back on our clean air policies and \nwe cannot turn the clock back on the health of our citizens. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject each and every one of these amendments that may be \noffered that would restrict the enforcement of the Clean Air Act \nagainst the polluters of America.\n  Let's speak out for our children, let's speak out for clean air, \nlet's speak out for our future, and let's speak out for our economic \ngrowth which very much depends upon a clean environment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio).

Mr. President, I am honored to chair a subcommittee \nof\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that focuses \non contracting oversight. I can stand here with certainty and tell my \ncolleagues and America and Missourians that contract problems in the \nFederal Government are substantial, they are expensive, and they have \nto be fixed.\n  While we are all focused right now on trying to make the Federal \nGovernment spend less money and be more efficient, there are times that \ncontracting problems have significant consequences beyond that of money \nbeing misspent or wasted. Sometimes contracting problems have human \nconsequences. One example would be some of our soldiers who were \nelectrocuted because of substandard contracting work as it relates to \nshowers in Iraq when they were standing up for us in a military \nconflict.\n  Last summer, a problem surfaced relating to Arlington National \nCemetery, and this was a contracting problem. So last summer, my \nsubcommittee held a hearing on the contracting incompetence at \nArlington and what the consequences of that incompetence were. As \nheartbreaking as it is, we learned that because of mismanagement of \ncontracts at Arlington, graves had been misidentified and remains had \nbeen buried someplace other than where families had been told they had \nbeen buried. Obviously, this is a breathtaking revelation when we think \nabout what Arlington National Cemetery means to the veterans of this \ncountry and to our Nation. It is sacred ground. It is the kind of place \nthat America needs to know is being run well and that the remains of \nour heroes are being handled with the utmost deference, respect, and \ndignity, and certainly Americans have the right to know we are burying \nour heroes exactly where their families are told they are being buried.\n  In the committee hearing last summer, I estimated, based on what we \nknew at that time, that as many as 6,600 graves had been misidentified. \nThe Army responded quickly and forcefully. I wish to recognize that \nKathryn Condon, the Executive Director of the Army National Cemeteries \nProgram, and Pat Hallinan, the Superintendent of Arlington National \nCemetery, have been responsive and I think have been working hard to \nclean up this mess. However, we now have recent reports which indicate \nthat maybe I underestimated the significance of this problem and maybe \nthis problem is much larger than I even anticipated. At the time, when \nI used those numbers, people seemed to think I was exaggerating.\n  So we introduced a bill to make sure there is accountability as it \nrelates to Arlington, with a number of cosponsors, including Senator \nBrown, who was the ranking member of the committee at the time, along \nwith Senator Collins and Senator Burr and Senator Lieberman.\n  We introduced a bill that would aim at accountability at Arlington, \nrequiring some reporting to us in 9 months, requiring that the \nSecretary of the Army continue to be held accountable on this huge \nproblem at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  I think now is the time to get some interim information because \ninformation has now surfaced that potentially many more graves have \nbeen mishandled. There is now a criminal investigation because we had \neight urns discovered in one grave site last fall as we were working on \nthis legislation.\n  While I am glad the legislation has become law, that doesn't change \nthe urgency of the situation. I have today written to the Secretary of \nthe Army, Secretary McHugh, and I have asked for immediate information \non an interim basis about what has happened to clean up this mess at \nArlington, where they are in the process, and what is the truth about \ngraves that have been identified, have not been identified, and \npotentially never will be identified.\n  I have asked the following information of Secretary McHugh:\n  First, I want to know the number of grave sites that have been \nphysically examined to identify the remains there. I want to know how \nmany grave sites have been determined to be incorrectly identified, \nlabeled, or occupied, and the methodology used to make that \ndetermination. I want to know immediately how many families have been \ncontacted regarding problems with the grave sites and the number of \nfamilies who have requested that those grave sites be physically \nexamined. I want to know what the procedure is for contacting families \nregarding actual or potential problems with the grave sites and how \nthese procedures have been implemented since our hearing last July. I \nwant to know from the Army how they will be able to correctly identify \nall grave sites by the end of the year and the estimated costs and time \nrequired to complete an examination of that nature.\n  I have asked the Secretary of the Army to respond to this letter in a \nweek. I have asked what progress they have made. This is not something \nwe can sweep under the rug and say we have done the best we can. This \nis not that kind of problem. I have veterans all over Missouri who walk \nup to me when I am in the grocery store, when I am at the mall, \nwherever I am, and say: Don't give up on fixing Arlington; it is too \nimportant to all of us.\n  I do not want this cloud hanging over Arlington National Cemetery. I \nhave been honored to attend funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. I \ncompliment the Army for the job they do in terms of the Honor Guard and \nthe dignity those services embrace. But management has a challenge. I \nwant to make sure this does not go off the radar screen in terms of a \nproblem that has to be fixed. It has to be fixed because of the values \nwe embrace in this country.\n  I look forward to the response from the Secretary of the Army. I look \nforward to continuing to work with Kathryn Condon and Patrick Hallinan, \nwho I do know are trying, but this is something we have to continually \nbe transparent about in terms of reporting to the public the progress \nwe are making so every family member and every American, when they go \nto Arlington National Cemetery, doesn't ever have to wonder if they are \nshowing respect to the hero at the grave site that is identified on the \nmarker.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I also wish to take some time to talk \nabout a real crisis looming in front of us, which is the possibility of \na Federal Government shutdown.\n  I have lived through a Federal Government shutdown, and I can tell \nyou, whether you are someone who is trying to get on Social Security or \nMedicare, whether you are living near a toxic waste dump that suddenly \ndoesn't get cleaned up, whether you are concerned about enforcement at \nthe border--I could go on and on--there will be a lot of suffering.\n  If you are a Federal employee who works for a living, you will not \nget paid. Mr. President, for me, the issue is, if Federal employees do \nnot get paid, then why on Earth should Members of Congress get paid? We \nare Federal employees. We work for the government at the pleasure of \nthe people. Sometimes they are not so happy about it and they don't get \nmuch pleasure, but the fact is that we are elected and we work as U.S. \nSenators, and our paychecks come from the Federal Treasury. Why should \nwe get paid if we\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\nfail to reach an agreement to do the basic work of keeping this \ngovernment open?\n  Years ago, when we faced this, it was with Speaker Gingrich, who \nbrought it on. I hate to say that, but I am very concerned that we are \ngoing to see a repeat from the Republican House. Let me tell you the \nreason. We had an election--and, boy, I noticed that one in 2010 \nbecause I was in it. My Republican friends in the House are fond of \nsaying ``we won.'' They did take back the House. They did. They won the \nHouse. Guess what. They did not take back the Senate. The Democrats \nhave a clear majority here. The President is still the President, and \nhe is a Democrat. People will have their say, and we will get to that \nin 2012.\n  Here is the point. There are three parts of the government that are \ninvolved in the budget showdown, the budget dialog. Those three parts \nare the House--and we know where they are. They came up with $60 \nbillion worth of cuts. And then you have a bill that they wrote, H.R. \n1, that not only had $60 billion worth of cuts but all of these \nextraneous legislative riders that proclaimed the EPA has to stop the \ncleanup of the Chesapeake Bay; that EPA can no longer enforce the Clean \nAir Act relating to certain types of pollution; that there will be no \nmore money going to Planned Parenthood--no matter that they serve 5 \nmillion people and do all the necessary things to stop women's health \nproblems, such as STDs--no, they are zeroed out. So there is a vendetta \nagainst them and against National Public Radio. That is what is in H.R. \n1.\n  H.R. 1 was voted on here, and it did not pass. Now we are sitting \ndown with our colleagues to try to work on the budget, not these \nextraneous riders. If you want to repeal the Clean Air Act, have the \nguts to come here, put it on the floor, send it through the committees, \nand let's see where you get. You won't get very far. That is why they \nare trying to do it through the back door. Let's have a budget bill.\n  I believe that the Democrats, although we control two-thirds of the \ngovernment--a third is the House, a third is the Senate, and a third is \nthe White House--we are willing to meet them about halfway. Well, that \nis fair. That is more than fair. But we have rallies by the extreme \nrightwing. They have every right to do it, and I welcome them with open \narms, but they do not speak for the majority of the people.\n  I want to get back to why I think it is important that these Members \nof Congress who are talking very openly about a shutdown have some skin \nin the game. Let them have to suffer no paychecks. Why should others \nsuffer no paychecks, whether you are someone who works the parks or \nsomeone who works at Social Security or Medicare or someone who cleans \nup toxic waste sites or someone who works on the border. There isn't \ngoing to be any penalty for them.\n  I can only say that it has been 30 days--here it is on the chart--\nsince the Senate passed a bill that said: No budget, no pay. No raising \nthe debt ceiling, no pay. That is what it said. We sent it over to the \nHouse, and what has Mr. Boehner done with that bill? Nothing. Now, that \nis plenty of time to talk about doing away with Planned Parenthood and \nabout all these things they want to do to harm women's health. They \nwant to repeal the entire health care bill. I guess now they want to \nrefund the money or get back the money the seniors got to help them pay \nfor prescription drugs. I guess they don't think it is good to be able \nto keep your kid on your policy until they are 26. I guess they think \nit is fine for the insurance companies to kick you out when you get \nsick. When it comes to saying we will not get paid if there is a \nshutdown, he has not taken up this bill. Thirty days.\n  I intend to be on this floor every day--31, 32, 33, whatever the days \nare. That is plenty of time.\n  By the way, there is a bill by Congressman Moran. Eric Cantor said we \nshould not get paid. I don't know if you know what they did, Mr. \nPresident. They wrote a bill that said we won't get paid, but in that \nbill, it says H.R. 1 will be deemed having passed if the Senate doesn't \npass it by April 6. So they have taken the most extreme bill in \nAmerican history, with cuts that experts say--including Mark Zandi, a \nRepublican economist--will lose us 700,000 jobs, a bill that is so \nextreme that it tells the EPA it can't enforce the law, and then they \nattach to it the ``no budget, no pay.'' Not good enough. H.R. 1 is not \npassing. They can say they deem it passed. That is like my saying I \ndeem every bill that I write passed.\n  I have written a lot of bills, including the Violence Against \nChildren Act. Bills that I have passed give tax breaks to people who \nwork at home. I have had bill upon bill. I would love to say that if we \ndon't act on it, I deem it passed. What are they talking about over \nthere? It is odd behavior. It is odd. I don't know what else to say.\n\n  By the way, we have 15 people on our bill. They are: Senators Casey, \nManchin, Tester, Nelson of Nebraska, Bennet, Warner, Wyden, Coons, \nHarkin, Hagan, Menendez, Stabenow, Merkley, Rockefeller, and you, Mr. \nPresident, Sherrod Brown of Ohio. We are willing to say, if there is no \nbudget deal, we should not get paid.\n  I do not know whether the American people understand this, but if \nthey did, I think they would be very upset because we have a special \nstatute that protects our pay. Our staff is not protected. To my \nknowledge, the people who work here are not protected. Members of \nCongress and the President are protected in the case of a shutdown. \nThere is a special statute. They get paid.\n  All we are saying is that is wrong. If this government shuts down, \nthat is wrong or, if we fail to raise the debt ceiling and we start not \nmaking our payments and defaulting and America goes into a cycle we \nhave never seen before, we do not deserve a penny of pay.\n  By the way, our bill says no retroactivity either. The American \npeople have a right to expect us to work. Social Security checks must \ncontinue to arrive. Veterans must receive their benefits. Passports \nhave to be issued. Superfund sites have to be cleaned. Oil wells have \nto be inspected. Export licenses must be granted. Our troops must be \npaid. If we fail to keep the government open because of politics, \nbecause some group is rallying--I do not care what end of the spectrum \nthey are from--if we cave to that kind of pressure, we do not deserve \nto be paid. It is as simple as that. We should be treated like any \nother Federal employee--no better, no worse.\n  This is so deja vu because, in 1995, similar legislation passed the \nSenate. But guess what. It never passed the House.\n  We have a Member of Congress complaining that he does not make enough \nmoney. Let's talk about that, I say to everybody. In a video, tea \nparty-described Republican Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin said he \ncould not pay his bills on his $174,000 salary.\n  Now listen, he has a lot of compassion for himself, but he does not \nseem to have that compassion for people who earn $50,000 or $60,000 or \n$40,000 or $20,000--a lot less than he makes. But he says it is real \ntough to live on $174,000. I know he has a big family. God bless each \nand every one of them. But let us not be so selfish. If you have \ncompassion for yourself, have it for your fellow human beings. No \nbudget, no pay, Mr. Duffy. I am sorry.\n  If our colleagues over there who are very extreme--and I know there \nwas a big article that Democrats are calling the budget proposals over \nthere extreme. They are. If they are going to stand on that far right \nline and hurt the women of this country and hurt the families of this \ncountry and hurt the children of this country and hurt the seniors of \nthis country and they are not willing to meet us halfway when they only \ncontrol one-third of the government and they do not agree and this \ngovernment shuts down, yes, Mr. Duffy, you should not get your pay. We \nneed to have the same pain inflicted on us as is inflicted on others.\n  The Speaker and Eric Cantor can say anything they want over there. \nThey can say whatever they want. Free speech, absolutely. But their \nactions speak louder than their words. When they say, oh, they don't \nthink they should get paid, but they fail to pass a freestanding bill \nas we did, they are not serious at all. They put it in a bill that is \nridiculous on its face. I never heard of passing a bill that says \nanother bill is deemed law. Yes, it is hard for me to explain that.\n  Anyone who studies how the Federal Government works knows we pass\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nthese bills and then we send them to the President and then they are \nthe law. What he says is, even though we already voted down H.R. 1, if \nwe do not pass something else, H.R. 1 is deemed to have passed and then \nit goes to the President. This makes no sense. It is a new way of \npassing bills that is made up by the Republicans in the House.\n  It is interesting that the Members whose paychecks the Speaker is \nprotecting are the same ones who are saying we should have a government \nshutdown. Today we know the tea party is holding a rally demanding a \ngovernment shutdown if H.R. 1, with all its political vendettas against \nwomen and children and families--that, in fact, there ought to be a \nshutdown if H.R. 1 does not pass, even though a leading Republican \neconomist, Mark Zandi, said it would cost us 700,000 jobs.\n  The Senate voted down H.R. 1. It only got 44 votes. Wake up and smell \nthe roses. It is gone. H.R. 1 will never rear its head again. So if you \nare rallying for a bill that only got 44 votes, that makes no sense. \nWhy not rally to call on us to come together, to meet in the middle, to \ncompromise? That is what the American people want. Do you think I want \nto meet the Republicans in the middle and slash the type of programs we \nhave to slash? No; I am very unhappy about it, but I am willing to do \nit for the good of the country. Then let the American people decide in \nthe next election if these are the priorities they share.\n  H.R. 1 would kick hundreds of thousands of kids out of Head Start. It \nwould stop tens of thousands from getting grants to go to college. How \ndoes that make us stronger? It does not.\n  Representative Tom Rooney, a Republican from Florida, said: I don't \nsee how we can avoid a shutdown. I have news for him. We can by working \ntogether, by crafting a budget where the numbers are right in the \nmiddle, and then any of these political vendettas should come back in \nthe form of other legislation.\n  Congresswoman Martha Roby said yesterday the tea party ``would not \nsettle for a split-the-baby strategy,'' which I guess means she is not \nfor compromising. It is my way or the highway. I want to ask the \nAmerican people rhetorically: Is that fair? The people who run one-\nthird of the government want 100 percent of it their way. I do not \nthink so. I do not think it would work that way in a family. That is \nnot right. They control one-third of the government and they want 100 \npercent of what they want. It is not right on its face.\n  Seventy-three percent of the American people say a government \nshutdown would be a bad thing for our country. So when the tea party \nsays: Shut down the government if we don't get 100 percent of what we \nwant, they are out of touch.\n  We will do our part. I am glad Speaker Boehner is back at the \nnegotiating table, but I have to say, we are not going to get anywhere \nif anyone says at that table: My way or the highway. That is over.\n  H.R. 1 is gone--because you pass a bill that says if the Senate does \nnot act and pass the bill it is deemed law sounds like an April fool's \njoke. Today is the 31st. Maybe that is what it is, an April fool's \njoke. Again, I do not know how they came up with this idea.\n  Where we are is very clear. We are in a situation where we hope the \ngovernment will not shut down, but yet there are Members in the House \nwho are threatening a shutdown. We have a situation where 30 days ago \nwe passed no budget, no pay for Members of Congress and the President, \nand they still have not taken it up.\n  We sent a letter to Speaker Boehner. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the letter to Speaker Boehner.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 2011.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Office of the Speaker,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner: Nearly one month has passed since \n     Democrats and Republicans in the Senate came together and \n     unanimously passed S. 388, legislation to prohibit Members of \n     Congress and the President from receiving any pay during a \n     government shutdown.\n       Despite the Senate's bipartisan effort, and requests from \n     members for immediate action, you have taken no steps to hold \n     a vote on this important legislation.\n       As you know, in the event of a government shutdown, Members \n     of Congress and the President would be treated differently \n     from millions of other Federal employees. While Federal \n     employees would not get paid, Members of Congress and the \n     President would still receive a paycheck because we are paid \n     through mandatory spending, rather than through annual \n     appropriations.\n       Recently, a number of House Republicans have publicly \n     stated that a government shutdown is unavoidable, and have \n     gone so far as to significantly downplay the negative impact \n     it would have on our economy.\n       Since members of your caucus are openly predicting a \n     government shutdown, the time to pass this bill is now. \n     Members who want to shutdown the government should not \n     continue to receive a paycheck while the rest of the nation \n     suffers the consequences. Members of Congress and the \n     President should be treated no differently than every other \n     federal employee; we too should have to face the consequences \n     of our actions.\n       While appearing on the CNN program ``Crossfire'' in 1995, \n     you offered your support for a bill that is identical to S. \n     388, so it is unclear why you have not scheduled a vote. The \n     closer we get to the expiration of the Continuing Resolution \n     without passage of this legislation, the more it becomes \n     apparent that your primary interest is in protecting the \n     paychecks of your colleagues.\n       It is essential that we work together to avoid a government \n     shutdown, but if we cannot do our jobs and keep the \n     government functioning, we should not get paid.\n       We again request that the House immediately take up and \n     pass this legislation in the same bipartisan spirit \n     demonstrated by the Senate. We ask for your immediate \n     response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Barbara Boxer; Debbie Stabenow; Jon Tester; Ron Wyden; \n           Michael F. Bennet; Sheldon Whitehouse; Robert P. Casey, \n           Jr.; Robert Menendez; Joe Manchin, III; Jeff Merkley; \n           Claire McCaskill; Daniel K. Inouye; Barbara A. \n           Mikulski; Mark Begich; Jeanne Shaheen; Richard \n           Blumenthal.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we call on him and say: It has been 30 \ndays, let's get our act together. We need to feel the pain ourselves \njust as all the others will feel the pain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2015-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2015-S2017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLEAN AIR ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I am staying close to the floor \ntoday, more than any other reason, is the fact that, for the first time \nin history, Congress is going to play scientist, Congress is going to \nplay doctor, Congress is going to decide what to do in terms of \nenforcing the Clean Air Act. This runs counter to the American people.\n  Leading public health groups are saying: Please do not stop the EPA \nfrom enforcing the Clean Air Act. They are the American Lung \nAssociation. I ask: When we think of the American Lung Association, \nwhat do we think about? We think about doctors who want to help \npatients, who do not want to see little boys, such as this boy, gasping \nfor air. It is our job to stand for the health of the people.\n  If I ever had any other reason for being here--and I have been here a \nwhile, thanks to the good people of California--it is to make sure our \npeople are protected to the best of our ability. We look at Japan, at \nwhat is happening there, and we know how it felt when we had the BP \noilspill and how we all did everything in our power to make things \nbetter.\n  One way we have made things better over these years, since the Clean \nAir Act passed--and I will show a graph of Los Angeles--one way we have \nmade things better for the people is the Clean Air Act. We all know we \ndo not always do things perfectly around here. We are only human, and \nwe make mistakes. But I have to say, I was not here when the Clean Air \nAct was signed. It was signed by Richard Nixon. I have a lot of issues \nwith Richard Nixon on a lot of other issues, but Richard Nixon set up \nthe EPA. That was a Republican effort, and now our Republican friends \nare literally taking a dagger to the Clean Air Act.\n  The Clean Air Act is supposed to be based on science, not politics. \nIf the scientists tell us and the health experts tell us carbon \npollution is a danger to our families and they pass an endangerment \nfinding and the Supreme Court says, once an endangerment finding is \npassed, you must act to clean up the air, if that is what happens, \nCongress should keep its nose out of it for two reasons: One, it will \nlead to little boys, such as this little boy, having to\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\ngasp for air if we interfere with the Clean Air Act; two it works. The \nClean Air Act works.\n  On this graph, in 1976, there were 166 days in Los Angeles where \npeople were urged to stay indoors. There was a health advisory. When \nyou can see the air, that is bad, and you could see the air on those \ndays. That is what happened in the 1970s. Through the years, because of \nthe work of the Environmental Protection Agency and local people and \nState people who worked with them, we wound up with no health \nadvisories in Los Angeles in 2010. What an unbelievable record.\n\n  Now Members of Congress want to mess with that. It is ridiculous. If \nit isn't broke, why are we fixing it? It works. They say they are doing \nit because of jobs--it is going to cost jobs. Well, we know for a fact \nthat was the same thing that was said in the 1970s and we have had the \ngreatest track record of job creation. If we took the job creation from \nthe 1970s into 2010, and we looked at how many jobs there were created, \nit is huge. We have had, of course, some of the greatest expansions in \nour history, notwithstanding the fact that we had a very fine Clean Air \nAct in place.\n  And guess what. When you clean up the air, you create jobs. You \nactually create jobs. There is no doubt about it. Clean energy \nbusinesses are created. We became the world leader in many \nenvironmental technology categories, and we are the world's largest \nproducer and consumer of environmental technology, goods, and services. \nHow proud are we of that? We should be proud of it. Instead, we may be \nfacing a series of votes today or Monday--I don't know exactly when--\nthat would, in fact, interfere with EPA's functioning.\n  Some of the amendments are worse than others. The McConnell amendment \nis the worst of the worst of the worst. Guess what it does. It says \nforevermore the EPA cannot ever enforce the Clean Air Act as it \npertains to carbon. That is the worst of all. But all of them would \nstop the EPA in its tracks right now from enforcing the law.\n  Look at the environmental technology industry. It is pretty \nimpressive. We have 119,000 firms that generate $300 billion in \nrevenues, $43 billion in exports, and support 1.7 million jobs. We have \nsmall- and medium-sized companies that make up 99 percent of these \nprivate-sector firms. That is the issue, because we have small- and \nmedium-sized firms that want to see us keep on cleaning up the air, \nversus the very large, old energy, big polluters--huge polluters--the \nchemicals, the oil, the coal, et cetera.\n  I want to work with all companies, small and large, because we are \ngoing to need a mix of energy sources, but it has to be cleaner, and \nthat is what the EPA has done over the years with its work. It has made \nsure the industries get cleaner and cleaner. And every time they say: \nDon't do it, we will lose jobs. We will lose business. We will go into \nrecession. But the opposite has proven to be true.\n  In a letter dated March 29, numerous clean energy and conservation \norganizations said:\n\n       Stopping the EPA from doing its job now means more \n     Americans will suffer ill health; not fewer; more clean \n     energy jobs will be outsourced overseas, and fewer American \n     jobs will be created at home.\n\n  Health experts oppose amendments that weaken the Clean Air Act. They \nare against all of these amendments. They say these amendments would \ninterfere with EPA's ability to implement the Clean Air Act--a law that \nprotects public health and reduces health care costs for all.\n  It is an obvious point: If someone never gets asthma, their health is \nbetter and costs are lower. Simple as that. So everyone who is a leader \non health care ought to understand when people get sick because you \nvoted to weaken the EPA's enforcement of the Clean Air Act, that has a \ncost. It has a cost to these kids.\n  I will show another picture of a little girl, a beautiful little \ngirl, who is suffering and struggling and gasping for air. That, to me, \nis the picture of what this debate is all about. Whose side are we on, \nher side or the biggest, most powerful polluting industries in the \ncountry? It is a choice we have to make.\n  The Republicans in the House have taken the worst of these \nenvironmental bills and they have put them on H.R. 1, and they want \nH.R. 1, H.R. 1, H.R. 1--pay back all the big polluters in the country \nwho supported them. But it doesn't make sense on any level. It doesn't \nmake sense on jobs, doesn't make sense in terms of the health of our \npeople, and it is politically unpopular.\n  Let us take a look at a recent poll that was done. This was done all \nacross the country by a Republican polling firm and a Democratic \npolling firm, and let me show what came out of it: 69 percent say the \nEPA Clean Air Act standards should be updated with stricter air \npollution limits. People want cleaner air. They see their kids gasping.\n  I said the other day, if you go into any school in your State and ask \nthe children how many of you have asthma, probably about a quarter of \nthem will raise their hands. And if you say, how many of you know a \nchild with asthma, it is about 50 percent of the crowd.\n  Asthma is a very difficult condition. I listen to Senator Lautenberg \nall the time talk about how it is with his grandson, who has bad \nasthma. His mother, every time she takes him to play a baseball game or \nshe is away from home, has to make a search to see where is the nearest \nemergency room. This isn't a benign situation. It is a serious \nsituation for children and adults. So that is why the American people \nare saying, well, wait a minute; we want the EPA to clean up the air. \nWe don't want Congress involved. The American people are smart.\n  Look at what this poll says. Remember, this was taken February 16 of \nthis year. This is the height of politics in this country, fighting \nthis side and that side. The poll says that 68 percent believe Congress \nshould not stop EPA from enforcing Clean Air Act standards, and 69 \npercent believe EPA scientists, not Congress, should set pollution \nstandards.\n  People are smart. If they have a problem with a tooth, they go to a \ndentist, they don't go to a Member of Congress--unless they are a \ndentist. People know scientists and doctors are the ones who should \nguide us on the Clean Air Act, not politicians. Look, I am proud of my \nwork. I love what I do, and I think I have learned quite a bit about a \nlot of things, but I don't decide what level of ozone is healthy, what \nlevel of small particulate matter in the air is healthy, what amount of \nradiation in the milk is okay. That would be ridiculous. The experts \nhave to determine that. But this Senate is about to vote on a series of \namendments which will stop the EPA in its tracks and say we, Members of \nCongress, know better.\n  EPA Administrators under Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and George Bush \nopposed attempts to weaken the EPA. Listen to this. This is signed by \nWilliam Ruckelshaus and Christine Todd Whitman. This is a quote from \ntheir op-ed piece--two Republicans. So I say to my Republican friends \nhere, listen to the people whom you respected when they were head of \nthe EPA. What did they say?\n\n       It is easy to forget how far we have come in the past 40 \n     years. We should take heart from all this progress and not, \n     as some in Congress have suggested, seek to tear down the \n     agency that the President and Congress created to protect \n     America's health and environment.\n\n  That is powerful. And they went on to say:\n\n       Today the agency President Richard Nixon created in \n     response to the public outcry over visible air pollution and \n     flammable rivers is under siege.\n\n  They are right. These two former Republican Administrators of the EPA \nare right, the EPA is under siege and not because it hasn't done its \njob. It has done its job magnificently. I have shown that.\n  I will show the stats on how many premature deaths were averted as a \nresult of the EPA's action. I think it will stun you. The Clean Air \nAct, in 2010 alone, prevented 160,000 cases of premature deaths. By \n2020, that number is projected to rise to 230,000.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here, if you saw a \nchild--maybe your child, maybe your grandchild--about to be run down by \na car, and you knew you could save them, you would do it. You would \nsave them. My colleagues, we can save 230,000 people from facing \npremature death. That is a fact. That is what the science shows. Yet we \nare going to weaken the very agency that can do this.\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\n  There were 1.7 million fewer asthma attacks in 2010 because of the \nClean Air Act. If we keep going, and we don't interfere with the EPA, \nby 2020 there will be 2.4 million fewer asthma attacks.\n  Let us take a look at that child again. I am saying to America and to \nmy colleagues, this is a baby who is struggling for breath. If you knew \nyou could save him, if you knew you could save another child from this, \nyou would do it. By leaving the Clean Air Act alone, by letting the EPA \ndo its work, it is a fact--it is not fiction, it is a fact--that more \nthan a million kids won't have to do this.\n  I don't know any colleague, I don't know one, who doesn't love \nchildren--love their own, love everybody's, love their constituents' \nkids, love their grandkids. I hardly know anyone who doesn't talk about \nour kids, whether it is in the context of our debt or their health or \nany context. I am saying right here and now if you love our kids, don't \nsupport weakening the EPA, because our kids are the most vulnerable to \ndirty air. Why? Because they are little, because the breath they take \nin takes up so much of their body. What they breathe in is more potent \nbecause they are so little and they are developing.\n  So again, whether it is business groups, whether it is former EPA \nAdministrators, whether it is these incredible groups that have come \ntogether with nothing on their agenda except the health of the people--\ngroups such as the American Lung Association or the Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility--I have given a lot of facts to back up what I \nhave said. And, believe me, they are irrefutable facts. They are facts.\n  The reason given for stopping the EPA from enforcing the law is: Oh, \nit hurts the economy. I have shown that argument has been made by big \nbusiness forever and it never was accurate. I guess they have stopped \nsaying the EPA doesn't have a successful track record, because I have \nshown specifically how many early deaths were averted, how many asthma \nattacks were averted. Let's go back to that again--how many missed days \nof work were averted. We have the facts, so they can't argue that.\n  So what do they argue? Oh, it is a recession. Well, let me say, if \nyou want people to work, I have got news for you: If they can't \nbreathe, they can't work. That is a fact. That is irrefutable. The \nClean Air Act in 2010 alone prevented 130,000 acute heart attacks. By \n2020 it will avert 200,000 acute heart attacks.\n  Again, put yourself in the position of somebody who sees somebody \nabout to be hurt, and you know you could pull that person back from the \ncliff, or you could pull that person back and make sure they are safe, \nand don't vote for these amendments because we know it is our \nconstituents who will suffer.\n  In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 3.2 million lost days at school. \nWhy is that? Because when a kid is gasping for air, they are not going \nto go to school. That number is projected to rise to 5.4 million lost \ndays at school. Do you know why we have these facts? Those who are \nskeptical demanded that the EPA do this study. So EPA did the study and \nwe found out.\n\n  I would challenge anybody in the Senate to show me an agency that can \nboast of this kind of result. It explains why almost 70 percent of the \nAmerican people say to us: Keep your hands off the EPA. Don't mess with \nsuccess. Let them do their job. Let them protect our health. Let them \nprotect our kids' health. EPA has a great record.\n  They are up against the biggest, most powerful interests in this \ncountry--they are. They took a full-page ad yesterday, those big \ninterests: Stop the EPA.\n  OK, I ask rhetorically, why stop an agency that is preventing the \ndeaths of the American people? Why stop an agency that has this kind of \ntrack record?\n  I will close with this: There is a series of these amendments, the \nworst of which is the McConnell amendment because the McConnell \namendment says forevermore the EPA can never, ever do anything to \nprotect our people from carbon pollution. It says never, ever can the \nEPA set standards for tailpipe emissions from automobiles. That is what \nit does.\n  The American Lung Association, the American Public Health \nAssociation, the American Thoracic Society, the Asthma and Allergy \nFoundation of America, the Physicians for Social Responsibility, the \nTrust for America's Health--this is what they say about the McConnell \namendment:\n\n       The McConnell amendment would strip away sensible Clean Air \n     Act protections that safeguard Americans and their families \n     from air pollution.\n\n  With whom do we stand? This is the question we all ask in our \ncampaigns. Whose side are you on? With whom do you stand?\n  I made a decision, a strong one. I am going to stand with the kids. I \nam going to stand with their families. I am going to stand with these \nleaders who are working day and night just to protect our health. I am \nnot going to stand with a rightwing ideological amendment. I am not \ngoing to stand with amendments that are ``McConnell lite'' because if \nit is not broken, don't fix it.\n  No agency is perfect, we know that. The EPA is not perfect, but the \nrecord is clear. Actions by the EPA along with local and State \nofficials have saved countless lives. If we leave our hands off of it \nthey will continue to have a stellar record.\n  I will be back on the Senate floor when these amendments come up for \na vote. I hope and pray people will think about this very hard before \nthey cast their votes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2017-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2017-S2019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIBYA\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, this morning our former National Security \nAdviser, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State \nColin Powell will visit the White House, and I expect they will discuss \nthe current mission against the Qadhafi dictatorship in Libya.\n  When we look at this mission, I think it is important to review the \nwise words of General Powell in his recommendation in considering any \nmilitary mission for the United States in her coming years. When we \nthink about his advice--many times, it has been called the Powell \ndoctrine, and it was memorialized in a 1992 article in Foreign Affairs \nmagazine called ``U.S. Forces: Challenges Ahead.'' This article became \nknown very much as the Powell doctrine, with two additions that the \npublic and press often put on his thoughts about military missions for \nthe United States.\n  In short, the Powell doctrine includes answers to a number of \nquestions that any President, Secretary of State, or Secretary of \nDefense should answer prior to or at the very least during a military \nmission involving the United States. Those questions are as follows:\n  Is the political objective we seek important, clearly defined, and \nunderstood?\n  Next, have all other nonviolent policy means failed?\n  Third, will military force achieve the objective?\n  Fourth, at what cost?\n  Next, have the gains and risks been analyzed?\n  Finally, how might the situation that we seek to alter, once it is \naltered by force, develop further and what might be the consequences?\n  Added to this, the press and public have offered two more additions \noften called part of the Powell doctrine: Can we hit the enemy with \noverwhelming force, and can we demonstrate the support of the American \npeople for the mission as shown by a vote of the U.S. Congress?\n  When we look at the current Libyan mission and apply the Powell \ndoctrine, we see a mixed picture, one that should be fixed by a rigid \napplication of its questions and answers to them reported back to the \nAmerican people.\n  I support our mission in Libya, and I think the President's address \nto the Nation was a good start. But I think we\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nwould serve our troops well if we proceeded to answer the Powell \ndoctrine questions rigidly.\n  First, is the political objective we seek to achieve important, \nclearly defined, and understood?\n  I think the end of the Qadhafi regime is important. I think the \nprotection of civilians from an impeding massacre is also important. \nAnd I think it would be clearly understood by the American people. But \nin practical terms, we cannot protect, for example, the people of \nBenghazi unless we stop the killer, and the only way to stop him is to \ndisarm him and remove him from power. I think that objective would be \nclearly understood, would be welcomed by our European and Arab allies, \nand would bring about the long-term protection of the civilian \ncommunities by which the administration first justified this action.\n  Secondly, have all nonviolent policies means failed?\n  There is a 30-year record of diplomacy with regard to the Libyan \ndictatorship. Muammar Qadhafi has shown himself to be one of the most \nviolent, corrupt, and at times even crazy leaders from the continent of \nAfrica. While the United States has had difficulties with him for three \ndecades, while Secretary Gates has referred to the imposition of Jersey \nbarriers here in Washington, DC, as early as 1983 when there were \nreports of potential Qadhafi threats to our President--at the time, \nPresident Reagan--it took several decades for the rest of the world to \nlose patience with Muammar Qadhafi.\n  The decision by the United Nations and Arab League and surrounding \nnations not just to support resolutions in internal forums but then for \nsome of those nations, numbering over a dozen, to take military action, \nshows that finally the international community has broken with Muammar \nQadhafi and feels that diplomacy and nonviolent means no longer can \nwork with regard to managing him and the threat he poses.\n  Will military force achieve the objective?\n  I think it can. But here is a situation that is somewhat mixed. If \nair power is only applied to a combat air patrol to enforce a no-fly \nzone, there is the potential for Libyan armor and artillery to \noverwhelm what is a very disorganized and rag-tag civilian army that \ninitially made gains against Qadhafi, then lost them and stood at the \ngates of Benghazi, then retook key communities, such as al-Bayda, \nBrega, and came to the outskirts of Sirte, then relost nearly all of \nthose gains this week.\n  When we look at how we should support the end of this dictatorship \nand the final protection of civilians in Libya, we should understand \nthat the provision of close air support to take out Libyan armor and \nartillery is essential to this mission and that we should develop the \nmeans to command, control, and direct this effort.\n  I am concerned that today, I am unsure--maybe uninformed but unsure--\nas to how the close air support mission is handled. Originally when \nthis mission was undertaken, it was falling under the command and \ncontrol of standard U.S. military doctrine. Since Libya is part of the \nAFRICOM combatant command area of operations, this operation, as I \nunderstood it, fell under the command of the President of the United \nStates, to the Secretary of Defense, to GEN Carter Ham, commander of \nAFRICOM. As the United States then moved to more internationalize \ninternalize the military effort, it sought to transfer command to the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, and its commander, who also \nhappens to be an American, Admiral Stavridis, who stands not only as \nthe commander of U.S. forces in Europe but as Supreme Allied Commander \nof NATO.\n  I understand the administration has put forward a task force to be \ncommanded potentially by a senior Canadian general who would command \nthis operation. I understand that diplomacy went well with regard to \nthe command of the anti-air operation in this endeavor, but the \nnegotiations with regard to the provision of close air support were \nmuch more difficult.\n  Today, I am not exactly sure who is in command of those operations. \nIs it General Ham at AFRICOM? Is it the Canadian general at the joint \ntask force? Is it Admiral Stavridis, as the Supreme Allied Commander of \nEurope? My hope is that we identify one key allied commander who is not \njust in charge of combat air patrol enforcing a no-fly zone but also \nclose air support to ensure that the rebels are not defeated, to \nattrite armor and artillery from Muammar Qadhafi's army, and to \neventually achieve a lasting victory, which, in my mind, could only \nmean the end of the Qadhafi dictatorship.\n  I am particularly concerned today about key weapons systems that are \navailable to the United States and not to other countries, particularly \nthe A-10 Warthog and the AC-130 gunship. These are unique assets, \ncritical in the ability to take out Libyan tanks and artillery.\n  If we internationalize this conflict and as I have heard potential \ntalk of removing combat platforms of the United States from executing \nclose air support missions, my question is, Would AC-130 gunships and \nA-10s be available for these missions? They are uniquely effective and \nwould make this conflict shorter and more likely to end victoriously. \nAnd my hope is that they would continue to be provided to the allied \ncommander so that the progress could move forward on eventually ending \nthis conflict.\n  General Powell also asked that we estimate the cost of this \noperation. My understanding this morning is that this operation has \ncost roughly about $500 million and would likely entail greater cost if \nit lasts for a long time.\n  We should estimate this cost, and we should also tell the Congress \nhow we are going to pay for it. My understanding right now is that the \nadministration will not seek a supplemental and will take this out of \nthe core budget of the Department of Defense. What implications does \nthis have for procurement, for military construction, for pay and \nbenefits, and for other critical operations of the United States, led, \nin order of importance, the Afghan mission, the Iraq mission, and the \ndozen-plus ships that are now providing the critical humanitarian \nrelief and nuclear recovery of our allies in Japan?\n  General Powell also asked us to ask the question, have the gains and \nrisks been thoroughly analyzed?\n  While they may not have been thoroughly analyzed, I am comfortable \nwith the administration's answers to those questions. Had Qadhafi taken \nBenghazi, had he defeated the rebel government, I think he would have \nthen moved, over time, to destabilize the new government in Egypt.\n  An end to the Camp David peace accords would be a strategic reversal \nfor the United States. It would put at jeopardy the operations of the \nSuez Canal. It would have increased the dangers to our allies in the \nState of Israel. And I think the administration was wise to see a \ntremendous additional risk had Qadhafi won this war. Now, at least we \nknow the rebels are likely not to be defeated, but a stalemate is also \nnot in our interest. And I would hope we would recall the advice of \nGeneral Sherman, who said that we should make this as rough and as \ndifficult as possible to the enemy so that, ironically, in most \nhumanitarian terms, it ends, and it ends on the terms of the United \nStates, our allies, and the new rebel government.\n  Powell also asked us how we might see the situation, once it is \naltered by force, further develop and what consequences there are \nthere.\n  My hope is that we would quickly follow the direction of the French \nGovernment and recognize the Jalil government, to see that government \nas a growing potential partner for the United States and the allies so \nthat the people of Libya would see who their potential transitional \nleaders are and so that we would have clear political authority for \nthem. My hope is that a U.S. envoy would deal directly with the Jalil \ngovernment and that we would follow the suit of our allies and we would \nmake sure there are clear lines of authority, not just on the military \nside for combat air patrol and close air support but also political \ndirection for the potential new leaders of Libya.\n  Added to the Powell doctrine are the two other points often included. \nOne is, can we hit the enemy with overwhelming force?\n  I strongly support the administration's limitation on no combat boots \non the ground. I think that is a wise decision by the United States, \nand I think we can still direct terrific, tremendous, overwhelming, and \ndecisive\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\nforce to end this conflict as quickly as possible. My understanding is \nthat other allied governments may not be so completely constricted on \ntheir ability to provide especially the critical role of forward air \ncontrollers, who will direct allied air power to the most effective \ntargets to attrite and eventually eliminate the Libyan military. My \nhope is, though, that we bring all combat assets to bear of the United \nStates and our allies so that we quickly eliminate especially Qadhafi's \narmor and artillery force and so that this comes to a quick end on the \nmilitary battlefield.\n  Finally, the Powell doctrine often has included a final point, which \nis, Can the support of the American people be demonstrated?\n  I think in this case we have fallen short. While the Congress and the \nSenate have adopted a resolution calling for a no-fly zone in Libya, \ncosponsored by myself and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, I \nthink this is inadequate in fully demonstrating the American people's \nsupport for what our troops are doing over in Libya.\n  I think it is clear that our mission is sustained, and the critical \npolitical will of the United States is enhanced if we can formally \nexpress support for what our men and women are doing overseas. This has \nbeen done in some pretty tough conflicts in the past, particularly \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  For this conflict, the administration should call for a resolution of \napproval, and the elected representatives of the American people should \nvote. In general, I support the President's policy and would vote for \nthis resolution. But I think it is essential for those who are on the \nfield to understand that the Congress is formally with them in a vote \ncast up or down for this mission and for all of its unintended \nconsequences, potential upsides or downsides.\n  As Colin Powell leaves the White House today, I hope he carries this \nadvice. I hope all of us recall the key points he laid out. He has \nwisely put forward for past Presidents and this President a key \nchecklist that all of us as citizens, or those of us who are Senators, \nas policymakers, can have in reviewing the Powell doctrine.\n  In the end, the Powell doctrine is a key checklist to use to make \nsure we resist the call for military action until absolutely necessary; \nbut once necessary, that we hit the enemy with everything we have; that \nwe make the conflict as short and, therefore, as humanitarian as \npossible; that we demonstrate the full support of the American people \nfor the men and women of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; and that we \ngive them a clear mission with one allied commander. I hope the \nPresident gets this advice directly from the general today. I hope the \nPresident and the Senate follow it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I urge the Senate to free up \ncapital for small businesses to allow them to grow, expand, and begin \nhiring again. Unfortunately, there is a burdensome Federal regulation \nthat currently limits the number of small business loans credit unions \ncan make to family entrepreneurs. Credit unions have money to lend, and \nthey know small businesses in their communities. They know these \nbusinesses desperately wanted to jump-start the economy by taking out \nnew loans to grow their companies and hire more workers.\n  Two weeks ago I came to the floor to ask consideration of a \nbipartisan amendment, No. 242, which I offered to the underlying bill \nto raise this cap I have alluded to on small business loans. The \namendment would simply get government out of the way and allow credit \nunions to increase small business lending in their communities without \ncosting American taxpayers a dime.\n  I wish to repeat that. It would not cost American taxpayers a single \ndime.\n  When I spoke previously in support of this amendment and asked for \nthe amendment to be considered, the chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Landrieu, objected to my request and indicated that \nSenator Johnson, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, opposed the \namendment. I wish to clear up some misinformation the American people \nmay have heard at that time and thank Senator Landrieu for removing \nfrom the Congressional Record her assertion that Chairman Johnson \nopposed my amendment.\n  I understand that as new chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator \nJohnson has an interest in revisiting this legislation which I \nnegotiated with the Treasury Department, the National Credit Union \nAdministration, and the previous chairman of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Chris Dodd. But I wish to make it clear in the Congressional \nRecord that Chairman Johnson does not in fact oppose the amendment.\n  I also wish to clear up some confusion related to the $30 billion \nsmall business lending fund established as a part of the Small Business \nJobs Act which arose when I tried to call up my amendment 2 weeks ago. \nAs I pointed out in my original remarks, banks were given access to the \nsmall business lending fund, but credit unions have not been allowed to \nexpand their small business lending because of the very cap on loans my \namendment addresses.\n  In our discussion on the Senate floor, it was pointed out to me that \ncredit unions had been asked if they wanted to participate in the small \nbusiness lending fund, but the credit union industry had turned down \nthe invitation. I was unaware of such an offer; I appreciate being told \nof it. But unlike many banks, most credit unions do not need extra \ncapital in order to make loans, which is what the small business \nlending fund intended to provide. Rather, as I have said, most credit \nunions currently have capital to lend to small businesses, but, \nunfortunately, they are being prevented from making those loans due to \nthe arbitrary cap limiting their small business lending to no more than \n12.25 percent of their assets.\n  It is no wonder credit unions didn't have an interest in the $30 \nbillion bank fund because they don't need the money and couldn't use it \nanyway because of this burdensome cap that is put on small business \nloans.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the confusion about amendment \nNo. 242. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their great work \non the underlying bill which is important to my home State of Colorado.\n  I wish my amendment would get a vote today, but regardless of what \nhappens I will continue to work with Chairman Landrieu, Ranking Member \nSnowe, and the rest of my colleagues to find innovative means to free \nup credit for small businesses in a responsible way.\n  On a final note, the Presiding Officer hails from a great State that \nhas significant banking and credit union sectors. We know they don't \nalways see eye to eye, which is the root of the objection to my \namendment. Yet they still manage to operate side by side to serve the \ncommunity's credit needs. They both make up the fabric of America and \ncontinue to grow our economy. It is simply the way we do business in \nthe United States.\n  I wish to highlight that spirit, which is in stark contrast to the \nkind of divisive politics that have been brewing in America; one that \nfurthers disagreements and draws ideological lines in the sand and, \nfrankly, sows disrespect at the expense of shared interests and \ncollective prosperity. The American people are seeing a disappointing \nexample of that today. There is a vocal minority outside this very \nCapitol demanding acrimony and a combative approach for Members of \nCongress which I believe--and many of us believe--in the end will \nfurther disable our capacity to get the economy back on its feet.\n  While this is happening outside, many of us are inside doing the \npeople's business. We treat each other with respect, and we are working \non a bill to help small businesses invest in R We are also \nnegotiating a compromise to keep our government running.\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\n  That is the American way I have always known.

Madam President, I rise to speak about the issue of swipe \nfees. Most people do not know what a swipe fee is, but it is almost \npart of your daily life. The next time you reach into your wallet or \npurse and pull out a piece of plastic to pay for something--such as my \ndebit card--and present it at a retailer or a restaurant or a hotel or \na gas station, understand what is happening in that transaction. There \nare several things that are not even visible.\n  What is happening in that transaction is, you are paying that \nmerchant and your bank is going to honor that payment from your account \non your debit card, but then the bank and credit card company are going \nto charge the merchant for the transaction.\n  In days gone by, if we paid in cash, obviously, there was no fee \ninvolved. If we paid with a check--which was done for a long time and \nis done less and less now--there were pennies charged to process the \ncheck. Whether the face amount of the check was $1 or $100--pennies to \nprocess the piece of paper through the system.\n  A much more efficient system is being used with debit cards, where we \nactually are withdrawing money from our own account to the credit of \nthe restaurant or the retailer. Unfortunately, there is a fee involved \ncharged to the merchant or retailer called the swipe fee--accurately \ncalled the swipe fee because what has happened is, these major \ncompanies--Visa and MasterCard and the banks that issue their cards--\nhave established how much each transaction will pay in this swipe fee \nor interchange fee.\n  The Federal Reserve recently did an analysis and found something \ninteresting: They found that the average swipe fee across America is 44 \ncents for each transaction. Then they said: Well, what does it actually \ncost to process this debit account movement of money from one place to \nanother? The answer was: 10 cents or less.\n  So there is a substantial charge involved in the hundreds, thousands, \ntens of thousands, millions of transactions that go on every single \nday, and it has a direct impact on the places where we do business. It \nmeans there is an added cost to the retailer or merchant that we are \ndoing business with for the use of the debit card that goes beyond the \nactual cost to the bank involved.\n  You say to yourself: Well, that is business, isn't it? If you are \ngoing to take these cards, and you want the convenience of using these \ncards, you have obviously negotiated 44 cents and that is the way it \ngoes. Wrong. There is no negotiation involved. The retailers and \nmerchants literally have no bargaining power in what that fee will be, \nand over the years, that swipe fee, or interchange fee, has been \ncreeping higher and higher. For many businesses across America, it is \nthe second or third most expensive item in doing business. That is \nright. Beyond the cost of personnel and workers and beyond the rental \nand utilities paid or health insurance comes the swipe fee--the fees \ncharged by credit card companies for the use of debit cards and credit \ncards.\n  What we said last year, while we were debating financial reform, was, \nthis price fixing by the credit card companies--and there are two \ngiants, Visa and MasterCard, that control 80 percent of the card \ntransactions in America--this swipe fee that is being charged by them \nshould be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of the \ntransaction. They should not be able to force feed and price fix an \nexcessive swipe fee, or interchange fee, on retailers and merchants \nacross America.\n  We said to the Federal Reserve: Take a look at this and try to figure \nout a way to establish a reasonable, proportional fee since the credit \ncard companies and the big banks are not going to negotiate. The Fed is \nin the process of doing it.\n  We also said any bank or credit union with less than $10 billion in \nassets will not be affected by this. Our object was to make sure the \nhometown banks, the local banks, the local credit unions, could \ncontinue to receive interchange fees without any type of oversight by \nthe Federal Government. Some people said: Why didn't you include them? \nWell, we tried to give them an opportunity to continue to do business \nbecause, frankly, those who are closest in the communities are the ones \nwe ought to be mindful of and protective of.\n  Perhaps I have a little prejudice involved too. The biggest banks in \nAmerica--the top 1 percent of banks in America--are the ones that do \nalmost 60 percent of this card business. I am talking about the same \nWall Street banks that ended up getting a bailout from the Federal \nGovernment, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. I do not \nhave a lot of sympathy for them. They made some stupid mistakes and the \ntaxpayers came to their rescue. From my point of view, we should not be \nsubsidizing them or creating an opportunity for them to fix prices when \nit comes to merchants and retailers across America.\n  This passed last year with a strong bipartisan vote of 64 Senators, \nand the biggest banks in America and the biggest credit card companies \nin America have been working nonstop ever since to stop this from going \ninto effect. They have poured more resources into this effort than I \nhave ever seen, and I have been around this place for a while. They \nwant to stop this because they hate swipe fee reform like the devil \nhates holy water. For them, it is a dramatic loss of money. How much? \nEach month--each month in America--these debit swipe fees generate $1.3 \nbillion--$1.3 billion--for the banks at the expense of merchants and \nsmall businesses and large businesses, too, for that matter, across \nAmerica. But not just at their expense. These swipe fees are being paid \nevery time a person uses a debit card or a credit card to pay the \ngovernment, to pay a university, to make a charitable contribution. \nThat is a reality, and $1.3 billion a month--most of it going to the \nbiggest banks in America--they believe is worth fighting for.\n  So the fight has been joined, and Senators have come to the floor and \nsubmitted an amendment to postpone this swipe fee reform for 2 years--2 \nyears--to study it. Let me see, 24 months times $1.3 billion--over $30 \nbillion they want in a handout to the biggest banks and credit card \ncompanies in America. I do not think that is fair. It is sure not fair \nto the small businesses that had asked me to introduce this and ask me \nto continue to fight for it. It is not fair to these businesses or \ntheir customers.\n  You see, our reform efforts are not just supported by the businesses. \nThey are supported by the Consumer Federation of America, the largest \nconsumer advocacy group in the United States. They understand that if \nyou are dealing with a competitive business--let's assume you have gas \nstations across the street from one another and you make more \nprofitability at one gas station, they can lower prices and be more \ncompetitive with the gas station across the street. The same is not \ntrue when it comes to big banks and credit cards. When it comes to \ncredit cards, we have not a monopoly but a duopoly--two monopolistic \ncompanies, very little competition between them. There is a lot of \ncompetition in small town America and Main Street America.\n  Some people ask me why I tackle some of these issues that involve the \nbig banks and credit card companies and others. They say: Don't you \nunderstand these operations you are fighting are pretty large in terms \nof their resources and their political might? There is truth in that. \nThe banks are a $13 trillion industry in America, according to the \nAmerican Bankers Association--$13 trillion--and last year the banking \nindustry in America made over $87 billion in profits.\n  Visa and MasterCard were spun off from big banks a few years ago and \nnow are multibillion-dollar companies that control nearly 80 percent of \nthe payment card market.\n  People tell me these financial industry giants have unlimited \nresources,\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\nand they are going to fight when there is $1 billion a month on the \ntable.\n  Well I do not think the people of Illinois sent me--or sent from \ntheir own States other Senators--to hand the keys of this country over \nto big banks and credit card companies. They sent me to make sure Wall \nStreet banks follow the same rules of the road that Main Street \nbusinesses follow every single day.\n  There is nothing wrong with fees charged for services provided, as \nlong as those fees are transparent and are set in a competitive market \nenvironment. Don't tell me you are for a free market and then say but \nVisa and MasterCard can fix prices. Don't tell me you are for a free \nmarket and then say those prices they fix have to be concealed and \nhidden from the public.\n  When markets are characterized by transparency, competition, and \nchoice, consumers benefit. But consumers do not benefit when fees are \nhidden, changed without warning or set by agreement between \ncompetitors. Sadly, that describes many of the fees banks and card \ncompanies have charged in recent years.\n  We passed the Credit CARD Act of 2009 and then the Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet Reform Act last year and the Consumer Financial Protection Act \nwas also included. We targeted many of the hidden fees consumers pay in \nAmerica. If we do not do it, ladies and gentlemen, if the Senate does \nnot do it, I would say to my colleagues: It will not be done.\n  These powerful economic business entities in America need to be \nwatched closely. Do not take my word for it. Take the word of those who \nanalyze the recession which we are dealing with. Left to their own \ndevices, these entities will go to extremes when it comes to profit \ntaking, and that is what is happening when it comes to these big banks \nand credit card companies today. If we do not stand for consumers and \nsmall businesses on the floor of the Senate, shame on us. Who else is \ngoing to do it?\n  By making fees transparent and helping to inform consumers, our laws \nwill help the financial services market work better for all Americans.\n  This swipe fee, or interchange fee, reform amendment I added to the \nDodd-Frank bill also addressed an anticompetitive market failure in the \ndebit card system. For years, the banking industry has engaged in a \ncollusive practice. The banks that issue the cards have let Visa and \nMasterCard fix the interchange fee rates banks receive from merchants \nevery time a debit card is swiped. The banks get the fees, but they do \nnot set the fees. Their friends at Visa and MasterCard set the fees \nthat will be charged. This is price fixing, purely and simply, by Visa \nand MasterCard on behalf of thousands of banks, and this price fixing \nis currently unregulated.\n  Of course, every bank in the country is going to tell us the \ninterchange system is working just fine, Senator. That is because with \ncentrally fixed interchange rates, banks do not have to worry about \ncompetition. Each bank knows the bank down the street is getting the \nsame fee they are. But there are two fundamental problems with Visa's \nand MasterCard's fixing of these interchange rates and swipe fees.\n  First, centralized rate fixing gives the card-issuing banks no \nincentive to manage their operational and fraud costs efficiently. All \nbanks in the Visa network are guaranteed the same Visa price-fixed \ninterchange rate whether they are efficient or not. There is no \ncompetition and the fees literally subsidize inefficiency.\n  Second, because Visa and MasterCard, the credit card giants, control \nnearly 80 percent of the debit card market and merchants can't \nrealistically refuse to accept them, Visa and MasterCard have the \nincentive to constantly raise interchange rates to encourage banks to \nissue more of their cards. So fee rates keep going up and the merchants \nare helpless to do anything about it.\n  I have heard so many speeches on the floor of the Senate about how we \nlove our small business, and we should. It is the backbone of the \neconomy of America. This interchange fee goes to the basic survival of \nsmall businesses across America. If this Senate is going to decide that \nit is more important to protect the big banks and credit card companies \nthan small businesses, shame on us. We should accept the reality that \nit means these small businesses will struggle, will not be as \nprofitable, will not hire as many people. Can that make us a better \ncountry? Can that help us out of the recession?\n  Merchants can't say no to Visa and MasterCard because of the market \npower of these two credit card giants and because swipe fee rates are \nfixed by the networks. A merchant doesn't even have the option of \nnegotiating a better deal, so merchants are stuck with whatever the \nincrease is in swipe fees, which is then passed along to consumers in \nthe form of higher prices for gasoline and groceries. Consumers, and \nparticularly low-income and unbanked consumers, pay for the debit \ninterchange system to the tune of $16 billion a year.\n  Incidentally, do my colleagues know what the interchange fee is in \nCanada charged by Visa and MasterCard--the same fee I have been talking \nabout here--through the banks in Canada? Zero. There is no interchange \nfee. Do my colleagues know what it is in Europe? A fraction of what it \nis in the United States. Why is that the case? Why would these credit \ncard giants say they can't survive oversight of their interchange fees \nin the United States and charge zero in Canada and pennies in Europe? \nBecause the Canadian Government came to them and said, We are not going \nto let you rip off our small businesses. We will regulate you. They \nsaid, Never mind, we won't charge an interchange fee in Canada. In \nEurope, the same thing happened. If we are silent, exactly the opposite \nwill occur. The credit card companies will continue to increase these \nfees at the expense of American consumers and small businesses and \nlarge businesses alike.\n  Some people out there apparently trust Visa and MasterCard to price \nfix in a fair and benevolent way. They don't see the need for reform. \nIf you believe the giant credit card networks can be trusted to fix \ninterchange prices in a way that is fair for banks, merchants, and \nconsumers, then you should be fine with the status quo and have no \nproblem prolonging it for years.\n  That is exactly what the amendment coming before us will do. It will \npostpone for 2 years and put in a study of this issue. Well, we should \nstudy things before we act on them, that is for sure. But let's look at \nthe record. We have had nine different congressional hearings on this \nissue and three separate studies already. We have studied this one to \ndeath. What the banks and credit card companies want us to do is to \nkeep on studying so they can collect $1.3 billion every single month. \nThat is their strategy.\n  I don't place my trust in Visa and MasterCard, and I am not alone. \nLast year, a strong bipartisan majority in Congress said we better \nstand up for small business and retailers and consumers, and we passed \nthis law. The banks and credit card companies are pulling out all the \nstops. I learned yesterday that Chase, which is one of the major \nissuers of these debit cards across America, sent a letter to their \ncustomers in a number of States and said, If you don't repeal the \nDurbin amendment, we are going to end up in a position where we won't \nbe able to give you all of the rewards which we are offering you on \nyour debit and credit card.\n  First, this relates to debit cards which don't carry the big reward \nprograms. Secondly, this kind of veiled threat from these credit card \ncompanies should not be taken seriously by any consumer across America.\n  The last time we had credit card reform, we unfortunately waited \nmonths before it became law. The credit card companies saw it coming. \nSo what did they do? They dramatically raised their interest rates on \nconsumers across America during that period of time. Don't expect any \nfavors from this industry. If we do not regulate the credit card \nindustry and the banks that issue these cards, trust me, the consumers \nwill continue to lose time and time again.\n  As for Chase, I don't think there are going to be any poppy flowers \nsold on their behalf on street corners. If I recall correctly, their \nlast earnings report showed a 48-percent increase in profits over their \nprevious year. They are doing quite well. Now it is time for\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nthem to give small businesses and consumers across America a break when \nit comes to the fees they are charging.\n  Congress said that if banks are going to let Visa and MasterCard fix \nthe interchange rates that merchants pay banks, then the rates fixed on \nbehalf of the biggest 1 percent of banks must be reasonable and \nproportional--reasonable and proportional. This is a narrowly targeted \nreform through the Federal Reserve. The new law will provide a \nconstraint on ever-rising interchange fees that the current broken \nmarket does not provide.\n  We have given this job to the Federal Reserve. They have put out \ndraft rulemaking and they are soliciting comments across the country. \nChairman Bernanke called me a couple of days ago and said they needed \nan additional few weeks to come up with the rule that will still go \ninto effect in July of this year. I understand that. I want him to do \nhis best. I want him to follow what this law says--exempting credit \nunions and community banks with less than $10 billion in assets.\n  The Fed has taken this job seriously, and I am glad they have. The \nFed knows that many small banks are concerned the reform might affect \nthem even though the law clearly exempts them. Last week Chairman \nBernanke told all those small banks at a meeting that he understands \ntheir concerns and will work with them to make sure the final rule \naddresses them.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for the reasonable reform Congress \npassed last year. We don't need another study. A study is an excuse for \nthe credit card companies and the biggest banks in America to take $1.3 \nbillion a month out of the economy and away from small businesses.\n  I want my colleagues to know there is broad support for debit \ninterchange reform. I have received many letters in recent days from \nindividuals, small businesses, and organizations that support reform. I \nwill readily concede that the big box retailers are also benefitted by \nthis. I am not trying to hide that. That is a fact. But the simple fact \nof the matter is this has been generated by a lot of local people and a \nlot of local businesses.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, this is hardball as far as the big banks \nand credit card companies are concerned. I happened to mention that I \nwas brought to this issue 4 or 5 years ago by a good friend of mine, a \nvery conservative gentleman who has been very successful in downstate \nIllinois, named Rich Niemann from Quincy, IL. He owns a bunch of \ngrocery stores and has expanded all across the Midwest. He is a hard-\nworking guy the like of which is hard to find. He and I disagree on a \nlot of things, but I always turn to him when I have a business issue \nbecause I know he will give me an honest analysis. When Rich told me \nthat he started accepting plastic at his grocery stores, it went from \njust a small number of transactions to now almost half of the \ntransactions at his grocery stores are with plastic and he says, They \nare killing me with this interchange fee. The credit card companies and \ndebit card companies are charging him this fee and he has no voice or \nbargain in the process. They charge whatever they want to charge and he \npays it. He is a man who is trying to create jobs in small-town \nAmerica. I thought he had the right approach to this. They should be \nable to recover their reasonable, proportional costs for using a debit \ncard, but why should they be able to penalize a business such as Rich \nNiemann's grocery stores? I said this publicly a couple of days ago \nand, not surprisingly, some folks on the other side decided to go after \nand attack Rich Niemann as a businessman. I will stand with him. From \nmy point of view, he is a good man. I don't think he votes for a lot of \nDemocrats. I hope once in a while he might vote for me, but \nnotwithstanding that, I respect him so much and I am sorry he had to \ntake this beating in the press from the other side. He can take it, \nthough. He has been a tough guy who has stood up for his family and his \nbusiness all his life.\n  Incidentally, on March 18 I received a letter from the American \nCouncil on Education and nine other national associations representing \ncolleges and universities and here is what they said:\n\n       Debit card swipe fees have been a hidden expense for \n     students and families paying for college for which they \n     receive no benefit. As a result of the law enacted last year \n     and the Federal Reserve's proposed rule, we believe colleges \n     and universities will see reduced debit card costs which they \n     will be able to pass on to students through lower costs as \n     well as increased resources for institutional grant aid and \n     student services.\n\n  We don't think about that. We think about gas stations. But the fact \nis students use plastic for everything, and the universities and \ncolleges end up paying these swipe fees to the big banks and the credit \ncard companies and debit card companies as a result.\n  On March 15 I got a letter from the Consumer Federation of America. \nSome of the folks on the other side said this will never help \nconsumers. These businesses are going to take all the savings that \nwould otherwise go to the big banks and credit card companies and they \nare going to take those and go home. Well, I disagree, and so does the \nConsumer Federation of America, the leading consumer advocate in this \ncountry. Here is what they said on March 15:\n\n       The current interchange system is uncompetitive, \n     nontransparent, and harmful to consumers . . . CFA does not \n     support delaying implementation of the new law.\n\n  That is what the amendment on the floor today suggests.\n  On March 15 I received a letter from the consumer groups Public \nCitizen and U.S. PIRG, and here is what they said:\n\n       The Durbin amendment was designed to curb anticompetitive \n     practices in the payment card market . . . we do not support \n     legislation calling for delay of the Durbin swipe fee \n     amendment.\n\n  Yesterday I received a letter from Americans for Financial Reform, a \ncoalition of over 250 national, State, and local groups, including \nconsumer, civil rights, investor, retiree, labor, religious, and \nbusiness groups. Here is what they said:\n\n       From a consumer point of view, the current interchange \n     system is not defensible. Feeble competition in the payment \n     card marketplace has led to unjustifiably high debit \n     interchange fees that the poorest Americans, generally cash \n     customers, are required to subsidize at the store and at the \n     pump. . . . We oppose efforts to delay the implementation of \n     the Durbin amendment through Congressional action.\n\n  Make no mistake, the big banks and card companies want to stop this \nrule before it is issued, because they are afraid that once it is \nissued and once people realize the savings to business and consumers \nacross America, they will never go back. So they are pouring it on to \ntry to move this amendment as quickly as possible to stop the Federal \nReserve from issuing the rule which the law requires them to issue.\n  On March 17, the Hispanic Institute sent me a letter and here is what \nthey said:\n\n       Sixteen countries and the European Union regulate swipe \n     fees and their experience demonstrates that regulation \n     benefits consumers in lower fees and lower cost of goods. \n     There is no evidence that swipe fee regulation will lead to \n     an increase in other consumer fees.\n\n  The National Small Business Association--as I said, we spend more \ntime on the Senate floor venerating small businesses than almost \nanything other than our troops. Here is what the National Small \nBusiness Association said in a statement on March 23:\n\n       The Durbin amendment and the proposed Fed rule are \n     beneficial to America's small businesses. Further delay, \n     equivocation, and another big-bank handout are not.\n\n  I also received a letter from 185 national and State merchant trade \nassociations representing 2.7 million stores and 50 million employees.\n  Let me say at the outset, the coalition I am representing is not \nnearly as powerful or as large politically as the big banks and the \ncredit card companies. They can't match them in terms of their \npolitical power, the number of lobbyists they hire, the number of \nletters they send, and all the rest. For the most part, they represent \na lot of small businesses that are trying their best to get fair \ntreatment. Here is what they say:\n\n       We have repeatedly sought to negotiate with the card \n     companies to reform this broken market and bring savings to \n     our customers. Fifteen years later, we have concluded that \n     normal market forces cannot and do not work in a broken \n     market with price-fixing among banks controlled by a duopoly.\n\n  They mean Visa and MasterCard.\n  They urged Congress to oppose any efforts to delay swipe fee reform.\n  The United Food and Commercial Workers, a union which I used to \nbelong to when I was growing up, said:\n\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\n\n       Delaying swipe fee reform will also delay the creation of \n     thousands of jobs each year that will result in reduced \n     interchange fees. This reform is long overdue for working \n     Americans everywhere.\n\n  The National Community Pharmacists Association and the National \nAssociation of Chain Drug Stores sent me a letter and said:\n\n       We request any assistance you can provide in ensuring the \n     timely completion of the final regulations and enforcement of \n     the Durbin amendment.\n\n  The National Association of College Stores and 20 State associations \nwrote and said:\n\n       Credit and debit purchases account for more than $100 \n     million annually in interchange fees paid by college \n     bookstores and their student and parent customers.\n\n  Let me repeat: $100 million a year paid by college bookstores and \ntheir student and parent customers in interchange fees to the banks and \ncredit card companies.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Excessive swipe fees that would otherwise be returned to \n     students through lower prices, grants, and student services \n     are being misdirected toward credit card companies and large \n     banks. . . . Every month of delay means higher costs for \n     students and parents at a time when schools are being asked \n     to do more with less funding.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2011.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the higher education \n     associations listed below to oppose efforts to delay, amend, \n     or repeal the debit card swipe fee reforms enacted last year \n     in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \n     Act (``Dodd Frank Act'') and regulatory implementation of \n     these reforms by the Federal Reserve. We strongly support \n     these needed reforms, which will provide real relief to \n     students, their families, and colleges and universities \n     across the country.\n       Debit card swipe fees have been a hidden expense for \n     students and families paying for college for which they \n     received no benefit. As a result of the law enacted last year \n     and the Federal Reserve's proposed rule, we believe colleges \n     and universities will see reduced debit card costs which they \n     will be able to pass on to students through lower costs as \n     well as increased resources for institutional grant aid and \n     student services. In addition, implementing this reform will \n     create an opportunity for institutions to offer discounts to \n     students for payments made with checks and debit cards.\n       During this time of economic insecurity, steps like those \n     undertaken in swipe fee reform will help students and their \n     families manage the costs of college with increasingly \n     strained budgets.\n       We urge the Senate to stand up for students and the \n     colleges and universities that serve them by ensuring that \n     these debit card swipe fee reforms are fully implemented in a \n     timely manner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Molly Corbett Broad,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                                   March 15, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: As Congress assesses the impact on consumers \n     of debit interchange legislation it enacted last year, the \n     Consumer Federation of America would like to share with you \n     the conclusions we have reached:\n       The current interchange system is uncompetitive, non-\n     transparent and harmful to consumers. It is simply unjust to \n     require less affluent Americans who do not participate in or \n     benefit from the payment card or banking system to pay for \n     excessive debit interchange fees that are passed through to \n     the costs of goods and services. As a result, CFA does not \n     support delaying implementation of the new law.\n       The Federal Reserve should ensure that financial \n     institutions are reimbursed for legitimate, incremental debit \n     card costs as it finalizes rules implementing new interchange \n     requirements. If such compensation does not occur, these \n     institutions could increase debit card and other related \n     banking charges on their least desirable and most financially \n     vulnerable consumers: low- to moderate-income account \n     holders.\n       Once the law is implemented, the Federal Reserve should \n     also pay close attention to how it affects the financial \n     viability of small depository institutions, especially credit \n     unions, which often provide safe, lower-cost financial \n     products to millions of Americans.\n       Although CFA did not take a position on the interchange \n     provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, we have carefully examined \n     the law and filed comments with the Federal Reserve on how to \n     implement it fairly and effectively. For example, we urged \n     the Federal Reserve to consider increasing its proposed \n     interchange pricing standards as allowed under the law to \n     include several specific, debit-related expenses incurred by \n     financial institutions. CFA also recommended that the Federal \n     Reserve launch a broad, balanced study upon implementation of \n     the effects of the rule on consumers.\n       From a consumer point of view, the current interchange \n     system is not defensible. Feeble competition in the payment \n     card marketplace has led to unjustifiably high debit \n     interchange fees that the poorest Americans are required to \n     subsidize. The new law gives the Federal Reserve authority it \n     can use without delay to make sure that the debit interchange \n     reimbursement financial institutions receive covers their \n     legitimate, incremental costs for providing debit card \n     services.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Travis Plunkett,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 15, 2010.\n\n             Consumer Groups Oppose Durbin Amendment Delay\n\n       To the Bipartisan Congressional Leadership: U.S. PIRG and \n     Public Citizen write in support of the timely implementation \n     of the Federal Reserve swipe fee regulation as prescribed \n     under the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \n     Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted last summer. The \n     law provides numerous reforms to financial industry practices \n     beneficial to consumers, depositors, investors and taxpayers. \n     Included in the Dodd-Frank Act is the Durbin Amendment, which \n     limits the interchange swipe fees charged to retail merchants \n     on debit card transactions. The Durbin amendment was designed \n     to curb anticompetitive practices in the payment card market.\n       It is our understanding that there has been proposed \n     legislation introduced to delay the implementation of the \n     Durbin amendment. We do not support legislation calling for \n     delay of the Durbin swipe fee amendment. While we have urged \n     the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to modify its proposed \n     rule implementing parts of the Durbin Amendment (parts have \n     already taken effect), the rulemaking process, not further \n     legislation, is the appropriate venue for any changes. In \n     addition, consideration of a delay in the Durbin amendment \n     could otherwise imperil timely implementation of the Dodd-\n     Frank Act's other provisions designed to remediate the \n     economic crisis caused by risky, unregulated Wall Street \n     practices.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views urging that \n     the Durbin amendment be implemented by the Federal Reserve, \n     not delayed in the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     U.S. PIRG and Public Citizen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Americans for Financial Reform,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 2011.\n       Dear Senator/Representative: We write to express Americans \n     for Financial Reform's continued support for the Durbin swipe \n     fee amendment which we supported and was included in the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. \n     The current interchange system is uncompetitive, non-\n     transparent and harmful to consumers. It is simply unjust to \n     require less affluent Americans who do not participate in or \n     benefit from the payment card or banking system to pay for \n     excessive debit interchange fees that are passed through to \n     the costs of goods and services. As a result, AFR does not \n     support Congressional delay of implementation of the new law.\n       As you know, Americans for Financial Reform is an \n     unprecedented coalition of over 250 national, state and local \n     groups who have come together to reform the financial \n     industry. Members of our coalition include consumer, civil \n     rights, investor, retiree, community, labor, religious and \n     business groups as well as renowned economists.\n       We oppose efforts to delay implementation of the Durbin \n     amendment through Congressional action. The new law gives the \n     Federal Reserve adequate authority it can use without delay \n     to make sure that the debit interchange reimbursement \n     financial institutions receive covers their legitimate, \n     incremental costs for providing debit card services.\n       From a consumer point of view, the current interchange \n     system is not defensible.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: On behalf of The Hispanic \n     Institute, I urge you to oppose Senate Bill S. 575, House \n     Bill H.R. 1081, and any other effort to delay, amend or \n     repeal the Durbin amendment which passed last year as part of \n     the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act. Delaying \n     implementation of the Durbin amendment hurts consumers, \n     especially low- income consumers.\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\n       The Hispanic Institute's mission is to provide an effective \n     education forum for an informed and empowered Hispanic \n     America. We have already studied the impact of swipe or \n     interchange fees on Hispanic America. In fact, we have been \n     studying the problem of swipe fees for years and have found \n     that the market for these fees is broken and that Hispanic \n     American consumers and businesses are harmed as a result.\n       In 2009 we published a study, ``Trickle-Up Wealth Transfer: \n     Cross-Subsidization in the Payment Card Market,'' that broke \n     new ground by showing that hidden swipe fees imposed on \n     credit and debit cards result in a reverse transfer of wealth \n     and make low-income Americans subsidize high-income \n     Americans--without them even knowing it. We also found that \n     these fees are part of the prices consumers pay every day and \n     that when fees are lower, prices are lower for consumers. Our \n     ground-breaking work has since been cited by the Boston \n     Federal Reserve.\n       On February 17th, we submitted testimony to the House \n     Financial Institutions Subcommittee of Financial Services, \n     along with U.S. PIRG and Public Citizen, voicing support for \n     the Federal Reserve rule to deal with the problems we have \n     found. Unfortunately, the banking industry is fighting to \n     stop these needed reforms. If the banking industry is \n     successful in delaying or repealing reform, consumers and the \n     American economy will pay. Studies indicate that consumers \n     will pay an extra $1 billion to banks every month that reform \n     is delayed, and the more than 95,000 new jobs that reform \n     would create each year will be shelved. This should not \n     happen.\n       As we noted in our testimony:\n       The current swipe fee market is broken and all consumers \n     pay more for less because of escalating swipe fees;\n       Sixteen countries and the European Union regulate swipe \n     fees and their experience demonstrates that regulation \n     benefits consumers in lower fees and lower costs of goods;\n       There is no evidence that swipe fee regulation will lead to \n     an increase in other consumer fees; and\n       Reductions in swipe fees should result in substantially \n     lower prices for all consumers.\n       The Durbin amendment and Federal Reserve rule allow banks \n     to compete on swipe fees and avoid regulation. Reasonable \n     limits are only imposed when the banks centrally fix their \n     fees. If they would compete, all American consumers and \n     businesses would be far better off. We urge you to oppose S. \n     575 and H.R. 1081, and press for the Federal Reserve's rule \n     to be finalized and take effect in order to address the \n     terrible problems with swipe fees that the Hispanic Institute \n     has identified. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Gus K. West,\n     President, Board Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       [From National Small Business Association, Mar. 23, 2011]\n\n               Bills Introduced To Delay Swipe Fee Reform\n\n       The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) in Dec. 2010 proposed new \n     rules limiting the size of the fees banks can charge \n     businesses every time a debit card is used to pay for a good \n     or service. The Fed was required to address debit-card swipe \n     fees thanks to an NSBA-supported amendment, introduced by \n     Sen. Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), to the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act (S. 3217). The final rule is expected \n     by April and currently is set to take effect on July 21, \n     2011.\n       The Fed proposed a number of options that would result in \n     reduced swipe fees for debit-card transactions. One option \n     would allow issuers to set a flat fee of seven cents per \n     transaction. A second option would allow a sliding scale, \n     based on the purchase price, with a maximum fee of 12 cents \n     per transaction. The proposed rule exempts banks with less \n     than $10 billion in assets and does not apply to credit \n     cards.\n       Although NSBA supports no interchange fees being charged on \n     debit-card transactions--since they clear, like checks, at \n     par--the proposal represents significant progress. Currently, \n     merchants pay, on average, debit card processing fees of \n     about 1.3 percent. According to the Fed, the average swipe \n     fee last year was 44 cents. This means that even the highest \n     option would result in swipe fees more than 70 percent lower \n     than the 2009 average.\n       The proposed rules also still present issuers with a large \n     profit margin. According to one bank, a swipe-fee cap of 7 \n     cents per transaction still would produce a profit margin of \n     about 8 percent, compared to the retail industry's average \n     profit margin of one to three percent.\n       While the proposed rule was a significant victory for small \n     businesses, retailers, and consumer groups, it was met with \n     immediate howls by the banking industry, which collected \n     $16.2 billion from debit-card swipe fees in 2009. Arguing \n     that the proposed rule represented governmental interference \n     in the private market (and ignoring the fact that the \n     previous system differed greatly from any notion of a \n     competitive ``market''), the banking lobby responded to the \n     proposed rules with a multi-million advocacy campaign aimed \n     at undermining them.\n       Last week, they achieved their first success in this \n     effort, when Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Bob Corker (R-\n     Tenn.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), Tom Carper \n     (D-Del.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Mike \n     Lee (R-Utah), and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) introduced \n     legislation, the Debit Interchange Fee Study Act (S. 575), \n     that would suspend the implementation of the Fed rule for two \n     years.\n       The bill also mandates that a study on debit interchange \n     fees be conducted by the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller \n     of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n     and the National Credit Union Administration. The outcome of \n     this study is virtually guaranteed to be flawed, given the \n     parameters outlined by the bill.\n       Companion legislation (H.R. 1081) has been introduced in \n     the House, by Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and 27 \n     cosponsors.\n       NSBA is ardently opposed to these efforts, which clearly \n     are aimed at preventing the rules from going into effect \n     rather than illuminating the issue. The swipe-fee system \n     already has been the subject of three separate U.S. \n     Government Accountability Office reports and nine \n     Congressional hearings.\n       The Durbin amendment and the proposed Fed rule are \n     beneficial to America's small businesses. Further delay, \n     equivocation, and another big-bank handout are not.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 28, 2011.\n     To: Members of the United States Senate; Members of the \n         United States House of Representatives\n     From: The 185 undersigned national and state trade \n         associations on behalf of the companies and customers we \n         represent\n     Re: Debit Card Swipe Fee Reforms--Allow Implementation to \n         Move Forward\n       The Merchants Payments Coalition, representing 2.7 million \n     stores and their 50 million employees, urges you to oppose \n     any efforts to amend, repeal or delay swipe fee reform. \n     Derailing swipe fee reform would take more than $10 billion \n     per year out of consumers' pockets and kill more than 95,000 \n     new jobs.\n       Big credit card companies have created a prim-fixing regime \n     that benefits the largest banks, including ``too big to \n     fail'' institutions that have received hundreds of billions \n     of dollars in federal bailout money, at the expense of Main \n     Street merchants and consumers.\n       Small merchants in your community are powerless against the \n     big credit card duopoly. The card companies and big banks \n     have not and will not negotiate with businesses over swipe \n     fees. As a result, these fees:\n       Have tripled over the last 10 years;\n       Largely benefit the 10 biggest banks;\n       Are the second highest expense many small merchants face \n     after labor costs; and\n       Are rising faster than health care costs.\n       This issue is unlike any other we have faced in business. \n     We have repeatedly sought to negotiate with the card \n     companies to reform this broken market and bring savings to \n     our customers.\n       Fifteen years later, we have concluded that normal market \n     forces cannot and do not work in a broken market with price-\n     fixing among banks controlled by a duopoly. So we reluctantly \n     came to Congress.\n       After seven hearings in the House, two of which were held \n     since passage of the debit card reforms, a bi-partisan markup \n     in the House, and two hearings in the Senate on the issue, \n     legislation passed the United States Senate last summer by a \n     strong bi-partisan 64 to 33 vote with 17 Republicans \n     supporting the amendment. Changes were negotiated and adopted \n     during the conference process before the bill was signed into \n     law.\n       The law directs the Federal Reserve to prescribe \n     regulations regarding interchange swipe fees on debit card \n     transactions and requires that the Federal Reserve establish \n     standards for assessing whether an interchange swipe fee is \n     reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the \n     issuer with respect to the transaction. After a lengthy and \n     thorough process conducted by the Federal Reserve of survey \n     design and collection, conference calls, meetings with \n     various groups, and survey analysis, the Board of Governors \n     voted unanimously in favor of publishing a proposed rule on \n     this subject. We see the proposed rule as a compromise of the \n     ideas advanced by the banks and networks and the ideas \n     advanced by the merchants and consumers.\n       The statute further directs the Fed to publish a final rule \n     by April 21, which would take effect on July 21. The Fed has \n     indicated that it intends to meet these deadlines unless \n     Congress directs otherwise, We strongly urge you not to \n     support delay and to allow the rule to take effect as \n     scheduled.\n       Swipe fee reform has been a key vote for each of our \n     associations every time it has been considered and will \n     continue to be. We would urge you to learn more about the \n     issue, listen to all sides, and not sign letters or support \n     legislation that seek to delay; repeal or modify the proposed \n     rule.\n       We urge you to stand with your small Main Street merchants \n     and their customers and allow swipe fee reforms to take \n     effect on time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      The undersigned national and\n     state trade associations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         UFCW,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2011.\n     To All Members of the United States Senate\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the United Food and Commercial \n     Workers International Union (UFCW) and our more than 1.3 \n     million members, we encourage you to oppose any effort to \n     delay or repeal the implementation of ``swipe'' fee reform, \n     also known as interchange fee reform.\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\n       More than one million of our members work in the \n     supermarket and retail industry where swipe fees are a \n     growing cost of business and a concern for the continued \n     success of this important industry. Each time that a UFCW \n     cashier swipes a debit card, the supermarket is charged a \n     percentage of the sale. That fee, hidden from customers, is \n     reflected in higher prices, which in turn impacts our members \n     and customers each day.\n       The banks and card companies want these fees to remain \n     hidden so that they can continue to reap large profits and \n     subsidize the costly benefits and rewards that they give to \n     their wealthiest cardholders. Make no mistake, the banks and \n     card companies want to delay the swipe fee reforms so that \n     they can continue to charge more than $1 billion in swipe \n     fees for each month of delay.\n       But most importantly, delaying swipe fee reform will also \n     delay the creation of thousands of jobs each year that would \n     result from reduced interchange fees.\n       This reform is long overdue for working Americans \n     everywhere. Our members have paid the price for rising \n     interchange fees for far too long.\n       A bipartisan group of 64 Senators courageously passed this \n     important swipe fee reform in 2010. UFCW respectfully asks \n     that you oppose any efforts to delay these reforms and allow \n     the Federal Reserve rule to take effect on schedule later \n     this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph T. Hansen,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 8, 2011.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       To the Bipartisan Congressional Leadership: The National \n     Association of Chain Drug Stores and the National Community \n     Pharmacists Association are writing in support of the \n     implementation of the Durbin Amendment, which was included in \n     the Financial Reform legislation enacted last year. The \n     Durbin Amendment limits the fees charged to retail merchants \n     on debit card transactions (known as ``swipe fees'') to a \n     level that is ``reasonable and proportionate'' to the costs \n     incurred by the banks and credit card associations to process \n     these transactions. The amendment also allows retail \n     merchants options on how their debit card transactions are \n     routed for processing, which provides market competition for \n     this part of the process.\n       The law requires the Federal Reserve to write rules to \n     enforce the ``reasonable and proportional to cost'' \n     requirement by July 2011, although the precise date for \n     enforcing the routing rule is left to their discretion. At \n     this point, the Federal Reserve has issued draft regulations \n     on what is to be considered reasonable and proportionate, and \n     they have closed the comment period on the rules.\n       We believe it is imperative that this process of writing \n     and issuing final regulations continue as required by the \n     law. Debit and credit card interchange fees currently total \n     close to $50 billion annually for retailers. The timely \n     promulgation and enforcement of the regulations will assure \n     the beginnings of reform for both debit and credit cards to \n     assure that fees are ``reasonable and proportionate'' for \n     retailers and the customers they serve in a highly \n     competitive marketplace.\n       We request any assistance you can provide in ensuring the \n     timely completion of the final regulations and the \n     enforcement of the Durbin Amendment, and ask you to \n     communicate that position to the Federal Reserve.\n       Please contact either Paul Kelly or Anne Cassity if you \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely\n     Steven C.

This legislation would \n     delay and effectively kill debit card fee reforms scheduled \n     to go into effect this July; reforms that will have a \n     positive impact on colleges, universities, elementary and \n     secondary schools, and the students and parents they serve.\n       Headquartered in Oberlin, Ohio, NACS is the professional \n     trade association representing the collegiate and K-12 \n     retailing community. We represent more than 3,100 collegiate \n     and elementary and secondary bookstores including school \n     owned and operated bookstores, non-profit student owned \n     cooperatives, small privately owned bookstores, and contract \n     managed bookstore companies. NACS member stores serve nearly \n     95% of America's 17.5 million college students while \n     supporting the academic missions of education institutions.\n       Last year Congress enacted reasonable and measured reform \n     to the swipe fees that colleges and universities, K-12 \n     schools, and other non-profits, and small family owned \n     businesses pay Visa and MasterCard and the big banks every \n     time a student, parent, or alumni pay or donate at these \n     institutions and at collegiate and K-12 retail stores. In \n     fact, according to a recent report by the National \n     Association of College and University Business Officers found \n     nearly \\1/3\\ of all tuition and fee payments made to colleges \n     and universities and nearly half of all tuition and fee \n     payments made at community colleges in 2009 were subjected to \n     excessively high interchange swipe fees.\n       Credit and debit purchases account for more than $100 \n     million annually in interchange fees paid by college \n     bookstores and their student and parent customers. Excessive \n     swipe fees that would otherwise be returned to students \n     through lower prices, grants, and student services are being \n     misdirected towards credit card companies and large banks.\n       Congress established a lengthy, deliberative, fair, and \n     open process for the Federal Reserve to carry out needed \n     debit swipe fee reforms and that process is still ongoing \n     through July, yet S. 575 is an attempt by the big banks to \n     derail this process indefinitely. Every month of delay means \n     higher costs for students and parents at a time when schools \n     are being asked to do more with less funding.\n       We strongly encourage you stand up for education \n     institutions, collegiate and K-12 retailers and our student \n     and parent customers by not co-sponsoring S. 575, the Debit \n     Interchange Fee Study Act of 2011, and also opposing any \n     efforts to move this bill in the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Brian E. Cartier, CAE,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. In closing, I know what I am up against. Don't take on \nChase and all the big banks of America--the ones that have the lion's \nshare of these debit cards--and Visa and MasterCard and not get suited \nup for battle. This is a darn important battle. It will test beyond the \nwisdom or justice of this proposal; it is going to test who owns the \nUnited States Senate. Is this a Senate that is willing to stand up for \nsmall business across America? Is this a Senate that is willing to say \nwe will fight for consumers even at the expense of the profits of the \nbanks and credit card companies?\n  I think consumers across America know on which side we should be. I \nhope we will be. We were last year, with 64 Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, joining to stand up for small businesses and large \nbusinesses alike, retailers and merchants. I know the big banks and \ncredit card companies have enormous resources, and they have a reach in \nevery direction. I know they are running commercials and sending an \narmy of lobbyists to Capitol Hill. They also have allies in the Senate. \nThey will pull out all the stops to roll back any effort to curb their \nabusive practices.\n  I want my colleagues to know I think Main Street is worth standing up \nfor--certainly, when it comes to their fights with Wall Street. Small \nbusinesses, consumers, universities, labor unions, and merchants are \nsick and tired of the banking industry's tricks, traps, and hidden \nfees. They want fees they can see, and they want them set up in \ncompetition, not fixed by credit card companies. They want the Wall \nStreet banks to play by the same rules of the road that the Main Street \nbusinesses play by every day, and I want that too. I hope the Senate \ndoes as well.\n  I urge my colleagues not to let the big banks and credit card \ncompanies avoid accountability for 2 more years. In the name of a \nstudy, do not give a $30 billion handout to the biggest banks and \ncredit card companies in America. That is exactly what the amendment \nfiled on the Senate floor will do. Do not delay interchange reform. Do \nnot delay swipe fee reform. Don't give those banks another \nmultibillion-dollar handout with no strings attached.\n  I urge my colleagues to let the Federal Reserve do the job that was \nsent their way. Let them move forward with the important process of \nswipe fee reform.\n  On behalf of businesses and merchants all across America, they are \ncounting on the Senate to be on their side to help them in reaching \nprofitability and making sure their savings are passed along to \nconsumers and in being the No. 1 engine for the creation of new jobs in \nAmerica. Our question\n\n[[Page S2026]]\n\nis, Whose side are you on? I am on the side of small business and Main \nStreet. I hope my colleagues will be as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2026-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2026-S2028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I enjoyed the previous \nspeaker's presentation. I come to the floor to talk about the ongoing \nnegotiations between the White House, Speaker Boehner, and my \ncolleagues in the Senate regarding the appropriations for the current \nfiscal year.\n  Since the beginning of the 112th Congress, the House and Senate have \nbeen trying to find common ground to finish the appropriations for \nfiscal year 2011. Instead of reaching a long-term compromise, we passed \nno fewer than six short-term continuing resolutions.\n  Not only does that disrupt our military men and women who are trying \nto serve but also every other facet of government and people's lives \nthroughout this country. The funding resolutions that provide little in \nthe way of addressing our staggering deficit have little certainty with \nour trading partners and absolutely no certainty whatsoever to the \nworld market in terms of our ability to manage our Nation's finances.\n  Sadly, rather than reaching a workable, bipartisan solution, \nresponsibly addressing our staggering deficit, which is expected to \nreach $1.5 trillion this fiscal year, our leaders have repeatedly given \nus false choices between continuing resolution proposals that don't go \nfar enough to reduce Federal spending and proposals that I believe \nestablish the wrong priorities for me and my State and many other \npeople as well throughout this Chamber.\n  I believe many of the choices that were made disproportionately \naffect low-income families and seniors. One of my Senate colleagues, if \nyou remember, characterized this process as a ``Hobson's choice.'' I \nagree. The world right now is looking for two things--the world \nmarkets, financial markets--and the people who invest in this country \nare looking for two things. They want us to do a lean and mean budget, \nget our fiscal and financial priorities in line now. They are also \nlooking for us to tackle entitlements, whether it is military, Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, et cetera. Then they will know that, in \nfact, they can invest here.\n  When they invest, the money will be safe and they are actually going \nto get a good return. When Pimco doesn't even do more bonding with \nAmerica, that is a sign. When we have other countries throughout the \nworld being downgraded by the bonding services, it is a problem. We are \nin this financial kind of roll to negativity. We have to get our fiscal \nand financial house in order right away.\n  I have been absolutely disappointed, and I know everybody listening \nin the gallery and those watching today have been absolutely \ndisappointed by the pace of negotiations between the two Chambers. We \nhave had FAA legislation. I want to fly in a safe plane. I get that. We \nhave done the patent bill, and I want safe drugs and everything. I get \nthat. We are on the small business bill now, and the Senator before me \nspoke--I am on the committee. I am happy to do it, and I get it. But \nare you kidding me? We are in the biggest financial mess we have ever \nbeen in, and we are doing everything but dealing with the financial \nmess.\n  Here we are with over a $14 trillion debt. For people listening, when \nI came here, we had an $11.5 trillion national debt. Now it is over \n$14.3 trillion and counting. The deficit, unfortunately--despite \npassing six different CRs and an understanding that passing it would \nmove our negotiations further along, we are once again faced with the \nlikelihood of a government shutdown.\n  I never, ever thought I would be a Senator from Massachusetts and \ncome here and say: Oh, my gosh, I was here when they shut down the \ngovernment. What do I tell the staff and the people back home? I am not \ngoing to participate in that. I am going to be a problem solver. If you \nare liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat--I don't care what \nyour party is--I am going to find solutions to try to avoid any type of \ngovernment shutdown. I don't want one. Nobody I am talking to wants \none.\n  We have to get these negotiations in perspective. We have to actually \nexpress to our leaders, as I just did, that, hey, we are concerned. I \nwant to make sure we tackle these issues.\n  While the Federal budget is only a small part, gosh, I can't tell \nyou--and Senator Carper is here. How many times have we been in \ncommittee hearings and they are talking about wasting billions and \nbillions of dollars--$76 billion just through one program that we are \nattacking.\n  I was in the military budget hearing the other day. It is $104 \nbillion over budget for one weapon system. Are you kidding me? Really? \nIt is phenomenal.\n  We are debating cutting, I guess, $61 billion, give or take, but we \ndon't have a problem with going over budget $100-plus billion in \nvarious programs and wasting billions of other dollars. So, on one \nhand, we are fighting about a small, minute part of what we are doing, \nand on the other hand, we are giving away the money.\n  There was just a report that came out that said we are wasting \nbillions of dollars on duplication. Executive order No. 1: Let's fix it \nso we don't have to worry about that, and that money we save can be \nused for seniors, kids, Pell grants, and all of the things people are \nfighting about right now. I will say, however, a government shutdown \nabsolutely serves no purpose and is in nobody's best interest--not our \ncountry's, not the workers', and it is not in the global economy's best \ninterest.\n  I, for one, stand ready to work with any Senator or any Congressman \nor member of the administration who wants to get together and solve \nthese very real problems. However, I am encouraged about the recent \ndevelopments in the negotiations, which was the news breaking yesterday \nthat a possible deal is close. That is great. They are talking about \n$33 billion. I just cited $104 billion in one military program. In \nMedicare, $76 billion goes out every year just because--I am happy \ndoing it, but the world is looking for that fix, the lean and mean \nbudget, but also for us to get entitlement reform, eliminate the waste \nand abuse--commonsense things that every person in this Chamber and \neverybody listening does in their homes and businesses.\n  Why can't we treat the Federal Government like a business for once? \nThis makes no sense to me. I am not the new guy anymore. You are the \nnew guy, Mr. President. Congratulations for being the Presiding Officer \ntoday. Being the new guy, I hope you agree with me that we have to kind \nof work together--and we have tried to do that, you and I, Senator \nCarper, and others--to try to find that common ground. I think we agree \non the number. It is just a question of do we tackle it here or there.\n  I am from the approach of let's do a little of everything and satisfy \nevery special interest and political interest and just get the problem \nsolved. It will take real choices, tough choices right now. Everybody \nlistening now absolutely understands that everything is on the table. \nWe have to be fair and judicious in our cuts. How do we go from A to Z \novernight? There is no transition period or no consideration for jobs, \nand, actually, the safety of people in some of these cuts.\n  I stand ready to work with each of you to do what it takes and put \npolitics aside. Listen, is there an election this year? I don't think \nso, because I am looking at 2011 right now--2011, as the one year, the \none chance we have to actually solve problems, folks. In 2012, we can \ndo whatever we do in the political season. I get it. For right now, we \nhave a great opportunity to send a message to all those folks who say \nWashington is broken. In Washington, it is like, you are great, you are \ngreat, everybody is great. Senator Carper is great. He is one of my \nbest friends here. But, listen, outside Washington, they have no clue \nwhat we are doing. They don't trust us or think we are addressing the \nreal problems that affect our great country.\n  Our collective work begins by having a clear understanding of the \nseriousness of our budget concerns. I know we have had bipartisan \nmeetings. I am so encouraged, as a relatively new Member, that we have \nhad about 60, 65 people come together to hear the number. Is it fact, \nfiction, or real? What is it?\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\nWe agree we are in trouble. So why aren't all the leaders of this great \ncountry--and there is plenty of blame to go around--getting together \nand seriously letting us know what the priorities are? Why doesn't the \nPresident call my office, or anybody else, and say: Scott, these are my \npriorities. I challenge you to work with me to get them done.\n  What are his priorities for cuts? Does anybody up there know? I don't \nknow. If he called you or me, I know we would give him the respect the \noffice deserves, and we would go out and say: I will work with my \ncolleagues, Mr. President, or Mr. Leader, or Mr. Minority Leader, and \nwe will find those common things we can do. We can start with the \nreport that just came out and eliminate all that duplication. In some \ninstances, I think it was 26 agencies doing the same thing. Are you \nkidding me?\n  I believe the responsibility we have been given is huge. Look at \nthese young people. A lot of them came to the charity basketball game \nwe had last night. It was so exciting to see their faces. They are \nexcited to be here. Every one of them is saying: Oh, my gosh, I have \nbeen in the Senate, working for these people. We look up to them, and \nwe expect them to do better and be better. They challenge us on a daily \nbasis just by those bright eyes, the fact they are out back studying \nwhen they have a few minutes--some more than others, I might add--and \nthey are looking for us to solve problems. It is really not even them \nwe are worried about; it is their great-grandchildren.\n  If we do nothing--is that what you want us to do, folks, nothing? I \nam not going to be part of the do-nothing caucus. I am going to look to \nfind commonsense solutions and work toward commonsense goals, \nregardless of the outcome. If I lose, whatever, but I will have played \na role in history. Right now, at this time, we need to make a \ndifference, a change.\n  I am so hopeful and I am an optimist. I believe we can do it better. \nI believe we have an opportunity to do it better right now. With our \nleadership and that of the other Senators who are going to be here \nsoon, we can get together and solve the problems. We can battle in \n2012. The country is looking at us now to make a difference. I hope we \nwill find the ability to do so. If we don't, then we will have missed a \ngreat opportunity to solve problems.\n  Thank you. I appreciate the Chair's patience and his occasional \nsmirks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I saw no smirks on the face of this Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. It was a good smirk.\n  Mr. CARPER. He is a breath of fresh air and so is the Senator.\n  I wish to follow up. I was not planning on doing this. I wish to talk \na little bit about clean air and the responsibilities the Environmental \nProtection Agency has to meet the Clean Air Act. I wish to follow up on \na point or two Senator Brown has mentioned.\n  He talked about the deficit. I go back a little over 2 years ago, \nwhen then-Senator Barack Obama stood right over there and gave his \nfarewell address to the Senate. It was a good time. A bunch of us were \nhere to hear what the next President of the United States had to say.\n  When it was over, he went down to where all the pages were sitting. \nSenator Obama went down and shook hands with the pages. He walked up \nthis aisle to walk out. I walked over to him--as he was speaking, I had \nwritten down six points I thought he should focus on to reduce the \ndeficit during the time he is President. He looked at my list and said: \nI can't read your writing, Tom. I said: I will send you an e-mail.\n  By the end of the day, I sent him an e-mail amplifying on the six \npoints I mentioned. Among the points I suggested is, we have a lot of \nimproper payments in this government. We are overpaying billions of \ndollars, mistakes, and we need to do something about it.\n  I told him we have a lot of fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. We need \nto, once we identify the fraud, have private sector contractors recover \nthe money, get it back for the Treasury.\n  I told him we have a problem with surplus property. There is a lot of \nproperty. We own thousands of pieces of property and land we do not \nuse. We should sell it and stop paying utilities and security for that \nproperty.\n  I said: We have cost system overruns for major weapons systems, and \nwe need to do something about that. I said that in 2000, a major \nweapons system cost about $42 billion. By 2005, a major weapons system \ncost about $200 billion. By 2007, it was like $295 billion. I said: We \nhave to do something about major weapons systems cost overruns. That \nshould be on your to-do list, if I can be so bold.\n  I mentioned taxes. There is a lot of money owed by companies to the \nTreasury not being collected. The IRS thinks it is over $300 billion a \nyear.\n  That is a pretty good bucket list for a new President-elect. I urged \nhim, when he put together his administration, to focus on those points.\n  Everything I just mentioned, the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs has been working on. Federal financial \nmanagement--everything I just mentioned we have been working on, not \nevery day but every week. We have been working on this list.\n  Last month, we had a top official from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services before our committee. Their responsibilities include \noverseeing Medicare and Medicaid. It turns out that improper payments, \nhonest mistakes made in Medicare, were about $45 billion last year--$45 \nbillion. Overall in the government, not counting the Department of \nDefense, it is $125 billion. This is not fraud. These are mistakes, \naccounting errors--$125 billion. About half of it was Medicare. The \nadministration testified before our committee about 1 month ago and \nsaid with regard to the improper payments for Medicare, which last year \nwere $50 billion: We promise to cut that in half from $50 billion to \n$25 billion--a huge reduction.\n  Eric Holder, our Attorney General, reports that in Medicare, he \nthinks the annual fraud numbers could be as much as $60 billion. Last \nyear, the Attorney General recovered about $4 billion in fraud. The \ngood news is that is more than we have ever recovered in any other year \nsince keeping records. The bad news is there is $56 billion more cash \non the table we need to get.\n  We also put in the affordable health care law a number of tools for \nthe Department of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to \nreduce improper payments, reduce fraud, and get the money that has been \nmisallocated and fraudulently taken. Those are a couple things.\n  It is not as if no one is doing nothing. Some of us are doing a whole \nlot. One of the things we are trying to do in our subcommittee--and \nSenator Brown is the ranking Republican on that subcommittee. We have \nRob Portman, Claire McCaskill, and Tom Coburn--people who do care about \nspending and trying to make sure we spend the taxpayers' money more \neffectively.\n  What we are trying to do is replace what I call a culture of \nspendthrift with a culture of thrift, to look at every program, whether \nit is domestic programs, defense programs, entitlement programs, tax \nexpenditures, tax loopholes, tax credits, to make sure we are getting \nthe best bang for our bucks and, where we are not, to do something to \nfix it. We are actively involved in that and actually getting some \nresults. We obviously need to do a whole lot more. I was not planning \non speaking to this issue, but I wanted to mention that.\n  Second, I wish to follow up on the comments of our Democratic whip, \nSenator Durbin, who authored legislation called the interchange \namendment. He talked about it before Senator Brown did.\n  There have been times in my life as Governor and a former naval \nflight officer and in the Senate when I did things that had unintended \nconsequences. I had the best intentions, but there were unintended \nconsequences to what I did. In my view, flowing from the interchange \namendment we adopted and adopted in conference are unintended \ncircumstances. The intent was good, which was to try to make sure that \nmore of the money from the fee that is collected from swiping our debit \ncards went to the\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\nconsumer, not to the banks and not to the merchants. There is reason to \nbelieve consumers may not benefit from this at all. There was an effort \nto try to protect credit unions and smaller banks in the interchange \namendment. As it turns out, the people who have been lobbying the \nloudest and pressing the most are the credit unions and small banks, \ncommunity banks, saying there are unintended consequences.\n  My hope is we can slow the process down, hit the pause button for 1 \nyear and figure out what the unintended consequences are and see if we \ncannot let cooler heads prevail and avoid unintended consequences and \ndo something that actually may be good for consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2028-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2028-S2029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLEAN AIR ACT\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, what I came to the floor to talk about--\nand I would like to do that now--deals with clean air, it deals with \njobs, it deals with the responsibilities the EPA has with respect to \nclean air and to make sure that as they execute their responsibility, \nthey are mindful of jobs.\n  A lot of people think we cannot have cleaner air without destroying \njobs. As it turns out, we can have both. We can have cleaner air. We \nhave had it for years. We adopted the Clean Air Act in 1970, with major \namendments to it in 1990. We literally created millions of jobs from \nthat act to reduce the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, \nmercury, and other forms of pollution that, in many cases, have killed \npeople--hundreds of thousands of people--over the years. We not only \nsave lives, we improve health in the country. We put a lot of people to \nwork coming up with new technologies that reduce harmful emissions. We \nhave a lot of people working in this country to reduce emissions from \nour cars, trucks and vans and doing it in a way that gives us better \ngas mileage.\n  When I filled up my car with gas over the weekend, it was about three \nand a half bucks per gallon. As the Presiding Officer knows, we are \ngoing to start building by the end of next year in our old GM plant new \ncars, Fisker, cars that drive about 80 miles per gallon. They are \nbeautiful. Chevrolet is selling the Volt and will sell more in the \nyears to come. They are making huge improvements in mileage. We are \ngetting this greater improvement in mileage and reducing our dependence \non foreign oil, cleaning up the air, and putting a lot of people to \nwork. This is one of the deals where we can have our cake and eat it \ntoo.\n  I just came from a Bible study group. There were very nice comments, \nMr. President, about you yesterday at the Prayer Breakfast. Before that \nI did a telephone townhall. Initially, I learned this from Bob Corker, \na Republican Senator from Tennessee, who shared this idea with me a \ncouple years ago. You get a big conference call with people in your \nState. We had 5,600 people on the call. We spent about an hour \ntogether. They raised all kinds of issues.\n  One of the ladies on the call asked me: Why are we letting EPA tell \ncompanies what they can do with respect to their emissions? We are \ngoing to destroy jobs. As it turns out, the premise is not correct. It \nis not that the EPA wants to do this; it is their job. The EPA is being \ntold by the U.S. Supreme Court that under the Clean Air Act, if the EPA \ncan show through good science that there is harm to our health or to \nthe welfare of the people by virtue of our pollution, EPA has no other \nchoice but to regulate it if we will not pass laws to do that.\n  We have not passed laws. Some people say: Why don't we put a tax on \ncarbon, on things we burn and that have carbon in them to make it more \nexpensive and maybe people will use less of it. We are not going to put \na tax on carbon around here. I don't know that too many people have the \npolitical courage to do that.\n  We argued about what President George Herbert Walker Bush did to \nreduce acid rain, reducing dramatically through market systems sulfur \ndioxide. We met our reduction targets in one-half the time at one-fifth \nthe cost. People do not talk about acid rain anymore. There is an \neffort to take that approach and apply it to carbon dioxide. There are \nnot the votes here to do that either.\n  EPA has basically little choice when the Supreme Court interprets the \nClean Air Act. They have to do something. We have not done our part, so \nthe job of EPA is to pass commonsense regulations which will be mindful \nof their impact on jobs. As it turns out, we are going to create a lot \nmore jobs by virtue of cleaning up our air than we are going to lose in \nterms of employment opportunities.\n  The last point I wish to say, if I may, is the Presiding Officer and \nI live in Delaware, the first State to ratify the Constitution. We are \nenormously proud of our State, as our colleagues are of their States. \nIn Delaware, we do not have mountains. One does not find the Blue Ridge \nMountains or the Rockies there. We are a pretty flat, low-lying State, \njust north of Maryland, just south of Pennsylvania, and just west of \nNew Jersey.\n  I joke with people. I say the highest point of land in Delaware is a \nbridge, and that is not much of an exaggeration. We are a low-lying \nState. Something is happening in our lovely little State. We do not \nhave a lot of land. We are starting to see the sea level rise. It is \nnot just on the Delaware beaches and shores, it is happening up and \ndown the East Coast, in the gulf, and over on the West Coast as well.\n  We have great beaches--Rehobeth, Bethany, Dewey, and others. We used \nto replenish our beaches maybe every 5 or 6 years. The waves come in, \nstorms--nor'easters, maybe an occasional hurricane. We have to \nreplenish our beaches. We have to do it more frequently now, not \nbecause of storms but because the sea level is actually starting to \nrise.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, just north of Rehobeth Beach--a great \nlittle beach town--just north of Rehobeth Beach, about 10 miles, is a \nbeautiful natural wildlife refuge called Prime Hook. It is right on the \nDelaware Bay. Prime Hook has a number of beautiful freshwater wetlands \nand marshes. It is a great place for people to hike, watch birds, and \ndo all sorts of activities. It is a real national treasure. We are \nstarting to see saltwater intruding and taking over what had previously \nbeen freshwater marshes and wetlands.\n  If we look at the Delaware River from the Delaware Bay, north up the \nDelaware Bay, it becomes the Delaware River and we head up to \nPennsylvania and into New York. As we go farther and farther up the \nDelaware River, in recent years, we find that instead of turning from \nsaltwater to brackish to freshwater, that line moves farther north.\n  Something is going on. Maybe people do not want to recognize or \nacknowledge that, but something is going on. We are seeing strange \nkinds of tornadoes, frequency of tornadoes, thunderstorms in the middle \nof winter. Out of the 10 hottest years on record, 9 of them have \noccurred in the last decade. Something is going on here. EPA is trying \nto figure out if there is some way we can gradually reduce the emission \nof greenhouse gases into our air and do so consistent with a strong \neconomy and creating jobs, not destroying. I think we can do both. We \nhave to be smart to figure that out and have a partnership with the \nexecutive branch, businesses and the legislative branch and be \nconsistent with what the Supreme Court has ordered EPA to do.\n  One last, quick point. We spend more money for health care than \nJapan, by far. We spend more money on health care than any other nation \non Earth, by far. In Japan, they spend half as much as we do for health \ncare and get better results, everything from higher life expectancy to \nlower infant mortality. They cover everybody. Think about that: They \nspend half as much, better results, and they cover everybody. How can \nthey be that smart and how can we be that dumb?\n  One way we can spend less money on health care is to, frankly, have \ncleaner air. We cannot only save billions of dollars--we have already \nmade great progress--but we can save tens maybe hundreds of billions of \ndollars in health care costs by continuing to clean our air, to make it \ncleaner.\n  With that, I am happy to conclude. It is a joy to be here and see \nyou, Mr. President, presiding in this Chamber and with all these young \npeople to recount one of my favorite stories about Barack Obama and the \nsix points I gave to him 2\\1/2\\ years ago to reduce the deficit. We are \nactually starting to do that, knowing we need to do a whole lot more.\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of rural America. \nAll of Montana is rural America. Despite good intentions, rural America \ntoo often gets overlooked when we pass bills here in the Senate.\n  That is what happened when this body passed an amendment limiting \ndebit card interchange fees last year. It was an attempt to address a \nproblem. But like people on both sides of the aisle, I voted against \nit. I knew it was a mistake because it had unintended consequences that \nwould hurt rural America.\n  It is a mistake now. Since we took that vote, the regulators have \nsaid that the small issuer exemption for banks and credit unions with \nassets of less than $10 billion--which is what that amendment said and \nthe reason why many Members supported the amendment--simply won't work.\n  In a Banking Committee hearing back in February, Chairman Bernanke \nsaid:\n\n       We are not certain how effective that exemption will be. \n     There is some risk that that exemption will not be effective \n     and that the interchange fees available through smaller \n     institutions will be reduced to the same extent that we would \n     see for larger banks.\n\n  At that same hearing, FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair, referring to small \nbanks and credit unions, said:\n\n       I think it remains to be seen whether they can be protected \n     with this. I think they're going to have to make it up \n     somewhere, probably by raising fees that they have on \n     transaction accounts.\n\n  The Acting Comptroller of the Currency has said that the Fed's \nproposed rules have ``long-term safety and soundness consequences--for \nbanks of all sizes--that are not compelled by the statute.''\n  The regulators who have been tasked with implementing these rules \nhave said they simply cannot guarantee that small issuers can be \nexempted from these rules--small issuers being community banks and \ncredit unions. Market forces will drive rates down for the community \nbanks and credit unions that are supposed to be exempt from these \nrules.\n  A lot of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, agree. \nFortunately, we have the opportunity to fix things. I am asking for \nyour help to apply the brakes so we can stop the unintended \nconsequences that come with allowing the Federal Government to set the \nprice of swipe fees on debit cards.\n  This morning, someone asked me: Why is a farmer from Montana leading \nthe charge on an issue such as this? Well, it is simple, really. I am \nnot in this fight for the big banks. I don't think these rules are \ngoing to help the consumers one lick. The cost of a hamburger isn't \ngoing down by a few cents if this is enacted. And there are no \nassurances that retailers would pass these savings on to consumers. \nLet's just say there is a reason Walmart is dumping in a ton of money \nto fight against this.\n  I am stepping into the middle of this fight because when the \ngovernment sets prices on debit card swipe fees, it is the little guys \nwho get hurt. Rural America pays the price. Community banks and credit \nunions get socked. We can't afford to let that happen, and we can \nprevent it.\n  Community banks and credit unions are a critical part of America's \neconomic infrastructure. Without them, small businesses or family farms \nand ranches in America would go by the wayside. When farmers and \nranchers need to invest in a new piece of equipment or buy feed or \ndiesel fuel, who do they turn do? To the community banks and credit \nunions; organizations such as the Stockman Bank, the Missoula Federal \nCredit Union, the First Interstate Bank, or Yellowstone Bank. The list \ngoes on and on.\n  America's community banks and credit unions are the backbone of our \nsmall businesses. These financial institutions are the ones that help \nsmall businesses grow, help small businesses create jobs, and help keep \nrural America growing--not the Wall Street banks.\n  These rules do not allow community banks or credit unions to cover \nlegitimate costs associated with debit card transactions. These are \nguys who simply don't have the means to eat the cost of debit card fees \nthat are limited by the Federal Government--and they don't have the \nvolume to make up this revenue elsewhere, as the big guys do.\n  For community banks and credit unions, this rule will only add to \nbanking costs, and it will prevent community banks and credit unions \nfrom being able to compete with the big guys. If they can't compete \nwith debit products, they will lose customers.\n  It will also limit the use of debit, pushing folks toward credit \ninstead. Already community banks are talking about limiting debit cards \nto $50 or $100, or ending free checking, or adding new fees to ATM \nwithdrawals--measures that will, in the end, cost customers.\n  This rule will further consolidate the financial industry, and that \nis the last thing we need in this country. But in rural America, what \nfinancial consolidation means is that community banks and credit unions \nwill have to compete with Wall Street, with one hand tied behind their \nback. Not only will that hurt Montana's farmers and ranchers and small \nbusinesses, not only will that hurt the ability for rural communities' \nbusinesses to create jobs, it could result--and I think it will \nresult--in community banks going out of business altogether. The same \nis true with credit unions.\n  That is not what anyone would call ``reasonable and proportional.'' \nYes, there is supposed to be a ``carve out'' in this rule for community \nbanks and credit unions. But both Chairman Bernanke and Chairwoman Bair \ntell us this exemption simply will not work.\n  Only in Washington will you get criticized for trying to make sure \nthat legislation actually does what it is supposed to do. Only in \nWashington does this mean you are trying to ``kill the bill.''\n  Some have said this means billions in interchange fees that \nmultimillion dollar box stores will have to pay. But truly, these rules \nare going to put community banks and credit unions out of business--the \nsame institutions that are the lifeblood of rural America.\n  It is a fact that the folks who are going to be hurt--and this is the \nbottom line with this--will be the small businesses, the community \nbanks, and the credit unions, not the big box retailers.\n  That is why Senator Corker and I and a whole bunch of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle voted to stop this rule and take a look at \nthe unintended consequences. Let's slow down, let's study the issue, \nand let's find a thoughtful and careful solution. If we do not do that, \nwe will see our critical community banking infrastructure disappear. \nThis issue is not about picking sides; it is about making sure we do \nnot trample on the financial infrastructure rural America needs to stay \nin business.\n  I ask my colleagues for their bipartisan support on a responsible \nbipartisan bill. Our economy cannot afford to let this rule go into \neffect until we study its impacts, both intended and unintended.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business.\n  This afternoon, quite possibly, or another time, quite possibly, we \nwill have very significant amendments that will strip EPA of its \nmandate to protect the American public from pollution which threatens \nour public health and welfare by inducing climate change.\n  Specifically, I strongly oppose the McConnell amendment, which would \nbe a complete stop-work order for the EPA to reduce carbon pollution.\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\n  I also oppose Senator Stabenow's amendment number 265, which would \nstrip California of its right to impose tailpipe emission standards \nbeyond Federal standards. California has had the right to go beyond the \nFederal standards to protect its citizens from dangerous pollution \nsince 1970. That is 40 years.\n  I oppose Senator Rockefeller's proposal to prevent EPA from studying, \ndeveloping, improving, or enforcing Clean Air Act greenhouse gas \nregulations for at least 2 years. I oppose these amendments because \nthey would allow polluters to keep polluting, they would endanger \npublic health and welfare, and they would increase our dependence on \noil. This is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.\n  As the lead author of the bipartisan Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, \nwith Senator Snowe and Senator Ted Stevens, which passed this body by \nvoice vote, I would like to explain why the McConnell amendment would \nundermine fuel economy and lead to less efficient vehicles in the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment would legislatively prevent EPA from acting to reduce \nvehicle emissions that threaten our public health after 2016, and it \nwould also strip California of its right to protect its own citizens \nfrom dangerous pollution. The prohibition would undermine the bill we \nsought to pass and did pass, and it was signed by President Bush; that \nis, 10 miles of increased fuel efficiency in 10 years. It directed the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation to \nwork cooperatively to increase fuel economy and decrease pollution. \nThis was a big win.\n  I began in 1993 with Senators Slade Gorton and Dick Bryan--no longer \nin the Senate; one from Washington and one from Nevada--and we sat \nright over there and tried to draft some language for a sense of the \nSenate--something as benign as a sense of the Senate--to begin to work \non automobile fuel efficiency, and we could not get it passed.\n  Then Senator Snowe and I got together on an SUV loophole closure \nbill. That went on for several years, and we could not get that passed.\n  Then there was the ten-in-ten fuel efficiency bill, and, voila, we \nwere able to get it passed. It is going well. Cars are more fuel \nefficient, and the corporate average fuel-efficiency standards are \nbeing established in a much more constructive way based on science. As \na result of the law, the administration has put forward the most \naggressive increases in vehicle efficiency since the 1970s, increasing \nfleetwide fuel economy to 35 miles per gallon by 2016. The final rules \nwill save about 1.8 billion barrels of oil and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by nearly 1 billion tons over the lives of the vehicles \ncovered. It seems to me that is very good public policy. As a result, \nAmerican consumers benefit. They will have more efficient vehicles, and \nthey will pay less for gas. And those savings are considerable.\n  This single program to reduce oil consumption and greenhouse gas \nemissions under the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act and the Clean Air Act \nresults in an aggressive policy to advance the goals of both laws. The \nregulations also demonstrate that strong Federal standards are the best \nmeans to ensure that California and other States are not legally \nobligated to enforce more aggressive standards to protect the health of \ntheir citizens--a right Californians have had since 1970.\n  Bottom line: These harmonized standards demonstrate the success of \nten-in-ten fuel economy. Despite the tremendous success of this first \nround of joint fuel economy and tailpipe regulations, the McConnell \namendment would prevent the EPA, the Department of Transportation, and \nCalifornia from pursuing cooperative and coordinated standards again. \nSimilarly, the Stabenow amendment number 265 would prevent California \nfrom participating in this process. This would halt an ongoing \ncooperative process to set a single set of cost-effective standards for \ncars, trucks, and SUVs from 2017 to 2025 which will increase fuel \neconomy, which will reduce pollution, and which will save Americans \nbillions of dollars.\n  It is backward public policy. EPA and the Department of \nTransportation have already conducted the technical assessment which \ndemonstrates the significant increases in fleetwide fuel economy--6 \npercent annually--which is both technically feasible and cost effective \nfor consumers. They are working to complete a single set of standards \nin full cooperation with California. But the McConnell amendment and \nSenator Stabenow's amendment number 265 would stop this effort because \nthe auto industry would prefer to sell gas guzzlers that continue our \ndependence on oil, and the amendments prevent waivers that have been a \npart of the Clean Air Act for decades, preventing leading States such \nas California from doing anything beyond the national standard. So it \nboth handcuffs and cripples corporate average fuel efficiency. It \nstymies it. It stops it.\n  California has 38 million people. We are our own pace setter. We want \nto work with the rest of the States to have a unified standard so that \nwe are not our own economy, so to speak, with fuel efficiency. That is \nthe right thing to do, and it is happening now. This would put an end \nto it.\n  The amendments prevent waivers, as I said, that have been part of \nthis act for decades. That means that never again, no matter what the \nsituation is, can there be a waiver for greenhouse gas emissions. It \nwould turn back the clock on historic efforts to improve the efficiency \nof the Nation's automobiles and slow any future effort to reduce \npollution and improve fuel economy.\n  Bottom line: A vote for this amendment is a vote to increase our \nsusceptibility to oil market price spikes, let there be no doubt, a \nvote to increase how much Americans will spend at the pump for decades \nto come--it will be much more--and a vote to increase pollution that \nthreatens our public health.\n  Unfortunately, these amendments not only stop the vehicle rules, the \nMcConnell amendment strips EPA of its authority to enforce the Clean \nAir Act with regard to pollutants that EPA scientists have conclusively \ndetermined endanger public health, an endangerment finding that the \nSupreme Court ordered EPA to make in the 2007 Massachusetts vs. EPA \ndecision. The Stabenow and Rockefeller amendments similarly delay this \naction. Polluters would be able to continue to pollute, and the agency \ncharged with protecting us from this pollution would be powerless to \nstop it or even limit it.\n  Blocking the Clean Air Act and its lifesaving protections makes no \nsense. This act has had a long and successful track record of reducing \npollution and protecting the health of our children and our families. \nSince its passage in 1970, the act has sharply reduced pollution from \nautomobiles, industrial smokestacks, utility plants, and major sources \nof toxic chemicals and particulate matter. In its first 20 years, the \nact made real strides in reducing pollution, and that provided enormous \nbenefits for public health. In 1990 alone, the act prevented 205,000 \npremature deaths, 674,000 cases of chronic bronchitis, 22,000 cases of \nheart disease, 850,000 asthma attacks, and 18 million child respiratory \nillnesses.\n  The Clean Air Act continues to provide benefits for our children and \nour families. Emissions of six common pollutants have dropped 40 \npercent. In 2010, 1.7 million asthma attacks were prevented and 130,000 \nheart attacks and 86,000 emergency room visits. That is in 1 year \nalone, this past year. And it provides economic benefit to the United \nStates.\n\n  Thoroughly peer-reviewed studies have found that for every one dollar \nspent on clean air protections, we get $30 of benefits in return. In \n2020 alone, the annual benefit of the Clean Air Act's rules is \nestimated to be nearly $2 trillion.\n  Advocates for these amendments argue the United States cannot afford \nenvironmental protection. They continue to say we must poison our air \nand water in order to develop our country. I don't believe that. \nPollution is a burden on our economy. It is not a force for good. Cost-\neffective reduction makes our Nation stronger, not weaker. We harm our \neconomy when we ignore pollution. Time and time again, the people of \nCalifornia have demonstrated that we are unwilling to choose between a \nhealthy environment and a healthy economy, because we choose both. And \nso should the United States.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to reject these misguided \namendments,\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\nwhether they come up this afternoon at 4 o'clock or another time, that \nwould let polluters off the hook, that would increase our dependence on \noil, that would decrease the mileage efficiency of automobiles and \nlight trucks and would harm the environment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all of my colleagues, I think, know \nby now, after all of these months, almost years, how deeply I feel \nabout the need to stop EPA regulation for a period of time so Congress \ncan have the time we need to develop a smart energy policy, which we \nhave not. It is enormously important to the people of West Virginia.\n  Having said that--and I will say quite a lot more--I cannot tell you \nhow strongly opposed I am to the McConnell-Inhofe amendment, not only \nbecause it goes too far, not only because it eviscerates EPA from some \nfundamental responsibilities it has--for example, CAFE standards--but \nit has absolutely no chance whatsoever of becoming law--none. Mine \ndoes. Theirs does not.\n  Do we think we are going to pass, and the President is going to sign, \nsomething that eliminates EPA forever? Oh, they will say: Well, we can \nalways change that in a couple years. No, it is not that. It is a \ntheological decision to pick out a campaign issue for 2012, and that is \nfine because that is the way things go. But to destroy the EPA \npermanently is an act I have not seen since I came here. There will be \npeople in many States, including my own, who think that is a wonderful \nidea, but I would ask them to think more deeply.\n\n  The McConnell-Inhofe amendment makes a point, but it doesn't solve a \nproblem. I am here to solve problems. So is the Presiding Officer. The \namendment would take away EPA's ability to address greenhouse gas \nemissions forever. It doesn't make any difference what happens 5 years, \n10 years from now--all the nuances that have to be made in policy or in \nregulation; if the air starts cleaning up, maybe things can lighten up \na little bit; if it doesn't clean up, maybe we have to do something. \nBut they want to take away and put out of business forever the EPA, \nwhich looks out for the health and the safety of everyone who lives \nhere, and it would be permanently banned from doing its job. Is this an \nadult amendment? It can't be.\n  People must only be looking at the next election, or they must be \nafraid. To be afraid of voters is not a good thing. That is a quick way \nto lose. Telling the voters the truth--the Presiding Officer is pretty \ngood at this--is what is more important in public policy. So they burn \nEPA forever. They can't do anything, no matter what we know or what we \nlearn in the future about greenhouse emissions. They want the total \nelimination of EPA's role, with no other structure in place. Having \nnothing in place is irresponsible, unrealistic, and immature.\n  What we need is a timeout to stop the imposition of EPA regulations--\nregulations that don't allow for the development of clean technologies, \nand that would hurt the economy at a critical time in our recovery, but \nto do it in a way that keeps us all focused and working on a long-term \nenergy policy which doesn't say close down. We should have a pause \nhere, the pause that hopefully refreshes our ability to do clean energy \npolicy. My bill would be effective from the date of its passage, were \nit to pass, so it would be 2 years. That is plenty of time to be able \nto come up with an energy policy. We have avoided doing that for so \nlong now, and I think a lot of that is politics, and it is very sad.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency, I have to say, including to my \nown constituents, is not a frivolous agency. It is the object of much \nscorn in my State and a lot of States that produce coal and probably in \nthe minds of a lot of Senators. It was created to regulate pollution. \nWe think back to wartime London where people couldn't see 5 feet in \nfront of their faces. I think back to when I was a student in Japan for \n3 years at the end of the 1950s, and we couldn't see 3 feet in front of \nour faces. Now all of a sudden we can see for thousands of miles, so to \nspeak, because the air is clean.\n  Again, the Environmental Protection Agency is not a frivolous agency. \nIt was created to regulate pollution. That is its job. Does that make \nit uncomfortable? Yes. Does that make me want to pass my amendment? \nYes, to have a stop for a period of 2 years where they cannot go to \nstationary sources and others and say that you can't do anything. It is \na pause, but at the end of the pause, it doesn't put EPA out of \nbusiness--that would be crazy.\n  It is Congress's job to legislate, and that includes energy policy--\ngranted, stipulated. I think the Presiding Officer would say that is \nlawyer's speak: It is stipulated. It makes it a fact. Congress passed \nthe Clean Air Act in 1970 and has updated it in the decades that \nfollowed. Is the Clean Air Act perfect? Certainly not. Certainly not. \nVery few laws ever are, which is why we are always open to making them \nbetter. But eviscerating the EPA's ability to do its job forever is \nnonsense. It is childlike: I will take my football and I am going home. \nIt feels good.\n  Some folks will get up and cheer, standing up for coal. We know what \nthis does. This is standing up for natural gas. We have a lot of \nnatural gas in West Virginia. Natural gas has 50 percent of the carbon \ndioxide that coal does. So people think that by doing this, people are \ngoing to go ahead and burn coal in powerplants and other places. They \nare not. North Carolina already has 12 powerplants which are being \nswitched from coal to natural gas--probably more by now. That was about \na year ago. Ohio is doing some of the same. Other States are doing some \nof the same. Natural gas is abundantly plentiful. I like natural gas. \nIt is a terrific thing. It is 50 percent as dirty as coal, but it is \nless dirty and it is cheaper. So powerplants are going to that.\n  I am trying to figure out in my mind, How does that help West \nVirginians? How does that help West Virginia coal operators or, more \nimportantly to me, coal miners? If people are suddenly making up their \nmind that they are going--and I have had the president of American \nElectric Power tell me this directly: Of course we will switch to \nnatural gas. He put it more succinctly. He said: I would use banana \npeels if they could produce heat. They don't stay with coal out of \nloyalty. They have to deal with certainty. Here we create permanent \npunting about what the landscape is going to be for energy use and the \nmaking of electric power in our country.\n  Again, may I please bring up once again that this bill has no chance \nof becoming law--the McConnell-Inhofe bill has no chance of becoming \nlaw. So why do they do it? They have to know that. I don't think it \nwill pass here. It certainly isn't going to pass at the White House. In \npolitics you can say, Oh, I wish there were a Republican President in \nthe White House. There isn't. There is a Democratic one. He is not \ngoing to let this happen. He is not going to have an executive agency \nwith an enormous amount to do with CAFE standards and all kinds of \nregulations obliterated, eviscerated, eliminated. He won't do that. He \nwill veto it if it should ever get that far.\n  So what is going on in their minds? What do they think they are \ndoing? Are they trying to impress their constituents, holding high a \nbanner saying, Look, I am courageous; I will get rid of this whole EPA \nthing and we can all celebrate together? Pretty shortsighted, I would \nsay. Pretty shortsighted. Feel good? Yes. Do good? No.\n  I think it is well known in West Virginia we have very serious \ndisagreements with EPA. I say all kinds of things about the EPA \nconstantly in all kinds of situations, but people do care about clean \nair. They do care about clean water also. It is not a sin. Sometimes in \nAmerica you can get the best of both worlds. We want a strong future \nfor clean coal and we want a national energy policy that protects and \npromotes clean coal.\n  Let me make a point. When I say the words ``clean coal,'' the only \nhearing of that is ``coal.'' People don't hear the word ``clean.'' So I \nhave to make a\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\npoint here. Don't blame coal miners for this. Coal miners go into the \nmines every day in these unbelievably difficult situations and they \nmine the coal that is there. It has been there for a billion years that \nGod put there. That is their job. Maybe it is high ash; maybe it is low \nash. Maybe it is high sulfur; maybe it is low sulfur. They mine what is \nthere, and then that gets shipped to a powerplant or to other countries \nfor steel-making purposes.\n  One of the ironies about all of this is some of the loudest anti my \namendment--my little 2-year amendment that stops at the end of 2 \nyears--comes from coal operators who actually don't ship much coal to \npowerplants. They ship most of their coal, because it is low sulfur, \noverseas to the growing market in South Korea and China and a lot of \nother places, including Japan. So what difference does it make to them? \nNone. But they want to be in the chorus so they join the chorus about \nlet's get rid of EPA. They are not affected. They are mainlining it \nright overseas and making tons of money because it is very low sulfur \ncoal and very good for making steel.\n  We know if coal is frozen in time the way Senators McConnell and \nInhofe are proposing, it will be rapidly eclipsed by other energy \nsources. Oh, yes, most especially natural gas. We have so much natural \ngas in West Virginia that you could swim in it if you could get about \n10, 15 feet underground. I like natural gas. It is a great asset to \nhave it in Marcellus Shale. The problems of fracking can be solved, and \nwill be through technology. But that is what is going to happen. Then \nour coal miners are going to look at some of their representatives on \nboth sides of the aisle here and in the House and they are going to \nsay, Now wait a second. I thought you were protecting me. How come I am \nnot mining coal? How come some of these powerplants have now switched \nto natural gas, in the majority, let's say, a few years from now?\n  So McConnell-Inhofe as an amendment codifies the vicious uncertainty \nthat is threatening coal today. Electric utilities are right now \nmaking, as I have indicated, investment decisions based upon that \nuncertainty. It is a bad place from which to make a decision. And with \nvery few exceptions, logically--that means they are not building or \nrebuilding coal-fired plants--natural gas will overtake coal. West \nVirginia wins in either case because we have so much coal, we have so \nmuch natural gas. But in this particular amendment, I am trying to \nprotect coal miners and their jobs by having carbon capture and \nsequestration, by having a policy, and there are others that are out \nthere. We already have two in West Virginia which are taking more than \n90 percent of the carbon out of coal. They are at work. American \nElectric Power Company, Dow Chemical Company, they are both doing that, \nboth making money out of it, and yes, the government helps. But they \nare taking more than 90 percent of the carbon out of coal. Doesn't that \nturn coal into clean coal? Isn't clean coal what we want? Isn't that \nwhat we have to have?\n  This is all part of a drive for an energy future for West Virginia \ncoal miners and others, other people around the country, for a clean \nenergy future. In effect, my amendment is a timeout. It is the timeout \nwe need. It is the only option on the table that can pass. It can pass. \nIt is fine to bring an amendment here which makes us feel good--\nmuscular, antigovernment, let's make government smaller; let's get rid \nof government--and swell your chest and feel good and put out a great \npress release, but then it ends up not passing the Senate or it ends up \ngetting vetoed. One of the two is going to happen. So it is a \nnonstarter.\n  I think a lot of those on the other side of the aisle are going to \nthrow the vote for political purposes, as I indicated. If we can \nremember back to the Omnibus Act in December of last year, the Chamber \nof Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the coal \nassociation, all Republicans had agreed to vote for my 2-year \namendment.\n  It was a timeout amendment. All of them. The papers calculated who it \nwas, how we would get the 60 votes, and we got there. And then what \nhappened--and this is a little bit in the weeds, and I apologize for \nthat--but all of a sudden, nine Republicans withdrew from that omnibus \nagreement, so there was no way for it to come up. Why? I don't know. \nWas that the beginning of a massive plan of thinking that we are going \nto make this an issue for the next 2 years so we can wipe out more \nDemocratic seats? It certainly doesn't have anything to do with energy \npolicy.\n  As I say, my amendment said that for a period of 2 years, the EPA \nwill not have the power to enforce greenhouse gas rules on stationary \nsources, including powerplants, manufacturers, and refineries. So they \ncannot do anything for a period of 2 years--regulatory--about \npowerplants, manufacturing companies, or refineries--for 2 years. The \nmoratorium would last for 2 years, and then it would stop. Why? Because \n2 years is, in fact, enough time, if we can get ourselves together \naround here, for serious people to come up with a serious energy policy \nthat includes clean coal and everything else on the face of the Earth \nthat works to get our country off of foreign oil.\n  Two years is enough time to develop a plan to build the carbon \ncapture and sequestration technologies and get them accepted by Wall \nStreet, which will fund them endlessly once they are convinced they are \nworking on a sufficient scale. As I say, this is being demonstrated by \nthe American Electric Power Company and the Dow Chemical Company in \nWest Virginia right now. I will repeat that they are taking 90 percent \nof the carbon out of coal. It sounds like a good deal, to me. Natural \ngas has 50 percent carbon. Clean coal would have 10 percent carbon. \nWhich is a better deal? I think the second one is. My amendment would \nlead to that.\n  I would say 2 years is enough time to get past this pointless debate \nabout whether climate science is real and find common ground and find \nsolutions that create jobs, protect the air we breath, and make us \nenergy independent.\n  Two years is enough time to take the big decisions about greenhouse \ngases out of the hands of the regulators at EPA and put them back in \nthe hands of Congress. Greenhouse gas emissions are an enormously \nimportant issue, but they are not the only problem we face, and they \ncannot be allowed to take precedence over every other matter that \naffects our people. We really can find ways to solve this problem, \nprotect our core industries, and lessen the costs.\n  The joint CAFE rule--it is a big deal--between the EPA and the \nDepartment of Transportation is a case in point and relevant to the \ndebate today because it is also undermined by the McConnell-Inhofe \namendment. The CAFE rule saves Americans billions of gallons of \ngasoline and reduces our dependence on foreign oil. It does it very \nexplicitly. It keeps going up. The air gets cleaner. I think the figure \nis that transportation overall is something like 50, 60--maybe a little \nmore--percent of our air pollution problems. CAFE standards become very \nimportant.\n  Most of us believe strongly that we need to make our cars more \nefficient, not just for the environment but also because of the high \ncost of gasoline and its impact on every American family, not to \nmention our national security. But under the McConnell-Inhofe \namendment, EPA could never again work on fuel-efficiency standards. The \nrecent progress we have made, which is so widely supported by industry \nand the American people, could be undermined. This is not a solution; \nit is a permanent punt--or maybe a stunt. I will not support that.\n  Last year, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \noverwhelmingly declared their support for my amendment, as I said. The \ndaily newspapers had come out on the Hill and calculated the 60 votes \nthat I had to overcome a filibuster. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was \nall for it.\n  Suddenly, some seem to want to have a fight more than a policy, and \nthey want to have a fight for the next election more than a policy, \nmore than they want to work together to solve the problem. Suddenly, \nthey say: Stopping the EPA for 2 years isn't good enough; we can stop \nthem permanently. Folks back home would love that. They say they would \nrather stand by and do nothing if they can't stop the EPA forever. In \neffect, that is correct. They think the American people will not see \nthrough that.\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\n  My amendment has been around for over a year now. People know what it \ndoes. So to call this a cover vote is disingenuous at best.\n  EPA's regulations that came into effect this year say that if a \ncompany wants to retrofit an existing one or build a new powerplant or \nfactory, they now have to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nBecause of these new rules, companies won't build that new factory, \nthat new powerplant, or employ some of the millions of Americans who \nare out of work. That is why I believe these regulations need to be \nsuspended. That is in my amendment.\n  Senator Inhofe has repeatedly argued that Congress needs to make \nthese decisions. I agree with that. My bill would give Congress the \ntime it needs to discuss the options, and my approach creates a \nreasonable timeout. Doing away with EPA authority doesn't give clarity; \nit indefinitely kicks the can down the road. My amendment, which \nunfortunately will come whenever it comes, no doubt won't do \nparticularly well because all of the folks on the other side and some, \nunfortunately, on this side will vote for that because they think it \nsounds kind of neat. It probably won't do very well, but that doesn't \nmean it is not right.\n  Let's have real solutions, such as clean coal that must play a role \nin meeting our energy needs, and let's be sensible and bipartisan about \nit. West Virginia is ready to provide that coal, and so are a lot of \nother States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and quickly turn to a \ndiscussion about our Nation's energy future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

Madam President, briefly, with regard to the debate \nover the limitations of CO2, global warming gases, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Congress has never made a decision on \nthis. The way it came out, in my view, is an example of judicial \nactivism and a dangerous end run around popular sovereignty in America.\n  Forty years ago, Congress passed the Clean Air Act. That act was \ndesigned to deal with particulates and mercury and NOX and \nSOX--things determined to be pollutants. There was no \nthought at that time that carbon, or CO2, was a warming gas \nthat would create global warming. It was before the global warming \ndiscussion really ever was generated.\n  Congress had no intention whatsoever to say that carbon dioxide, \nwhich is a plant food, which is not harmless to human beings and had \nnever been classified as a pollutant, would be placed under the total \ncontrol of the Environmental Protection Agency. But later an activist \nSupreme Court--5-to-4--seemed to say, but not with perfect clarity, \nthat because now we know or we think some say that CO2 is a \nglobal warming gas that could cause global warming, the EPA must \nregulate what really is a plant food and had never been considered to \nbe a pollutant.\n  I think Congress needs to act. I think Congress needs to assume \nresponsibility. We need to say: No, we are not prepared to direct that \nthe Environmental Protection Agency control all CO2 \nemissions in the country. We never intended that. We are not prepared \nto do that. If we want to start down that road, we in Congress will \nfigure out how we should start down that road and how much ought to be \ndone. But no group of bureaucrats should be empowered to regulate every \nfarm, every apartment building, every schoolhouse, every automobile, \nevery vehicle, every train, much less every electric-generating plant \nin the country.\n  It is a big deal about reality and power in America. It is just one \nmore example of how judges and bureaucrats are utilizing powers really \nnever intended to be given to them. Really, they sort of create that to \nimpose their agenda on the rest of the country. I believe we should \nback away from that. That is why I support Senator Inhofe in his view.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am here to join my colleagues who \nhave been on the floor of the Senate today, with the leadership of \nSenator Boxer, to oppose amendments that would undermine the Clean Air \nAct. The Clean Air Act has been one of the greatest public health \nsuccess stories we have ever had in this country. In 1970, Republicans \nand Democrats came together to pass this landmark legislation to \naddress air pollution that was leading to countless deaths and \nlifetimes spent battling chronic illness, illnesses such as asthma and \nemphysema. That legislation, back in 1970, was signed into law by \nPresident Richard Nixon.\n  It is very clear that the threat of greenhouse gas emissions to \npublic health is real. Two years ago the EPA found that manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions threaten the health and welfare of the \nAmerican people. Their decision was not made in a vacuum and, despite \nwhat some of the supporters of these harmful amendments may claim, \nEPA's decision was based on the best peer-reviewed science. They were \nguided by the best science protecting the public health, not politics. \nThe American Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, \nthe Trust for America's Health and the American Thoracic Society--some \nof our Nation's leading public health experts--all opposed these \nmisguided efforts to stop EPA from protecting our clean air.\n  We have heard the same story from polluters over and over. Today they \ntell us that reducing carbon pollution through the EPA will wreck our \neconomy. Back in 1970, and then again in 1990, they said the Clean Air \nAct would wreck our economy. Time and again we have heard the same \narguments, and they have not been true. It reminds me of Aesop's fable \nof the boy who cried wolf.\n  Since we passed the Clean Air Act of 1970, we have dramatically \nreduced emissions of dozens of pollutants. We have improved air \nquality, and we have improved the public health. The EPA estimates that \nlast year alone the Clean Air Act prevented 1.7 million asthma attacks, \n130,000 heart attacks, and 86,000 emergency room visits.\n  This is particularly important to us in New Hampshire and in New \nEngland because we are effectively the tailpipe of this country. In New \nHampshire we have one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the \ncountry because we are still phasing out some of the coal-fired plants \nin the Midwest that are causing these air emissions.\n  During the same period--since the Clean Air Act saved all of those \nillnesses and deaths last year--we have been able to grow our economy. \nOur gross domestic product has more than tripled, and the average \nhousehold income has grown more than 45 percent. So we know we can \nprotect public health, we can save our environment, and we can grow our \neconomy.\n  I recognize that as Governor of New Hampshire when, back in 2001, we \npassed the first legislation in the country to deal with four \npollutants because we understood that we needed to clean up our air and \nthat we could do that and protect public health and keep a strong \neconomy all at the same time. I wish that same can-do spirit and \nbipartisanship that led to the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 and \nthen later the Clean Air Act amendments in 1990--I wish that same can-\ndo spirit existed today to address carbon pollution. Instead of \ndebating amendments to undercut the Clean Air Act, we should be working \ntogether to enact commonsense legislation to reduce carbon pollution \nand to continue to grow our economy.\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\n  I have no doubt that the American people have the ingenuity and the \ncompetitive spirit to solve our energy challenges. What they need from \nus in Washington is leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject these amendments and then to work \ntogether to craft energy policies that can help move us away from a \ncarbon economy and transition to a clean energy economy.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak about the current \nstatus of the ongoing bipartisan budget talks. We are in a much better \nplace than we were 2 weeks ago. The two sides are much closer than we \nmight be able to tell from the public statements. After 3 months of \nback and forth, two short-term continuing resolutions containing cuts, \nand one near collapse of the talks last week, we are finally headed for \nthe homestretch.\n  Last night, we had a very good meeting with the Vice President. \nAfterwards, he confirmed that the House Republicans and we in the \nSenate are, for the first time in these negotiations, working off the \nsame number. As the Vice President said last night, there has been \nagreement to meet in the middle, around $33 billion in cuts. The \nAppropriations Committees on both sides are now rolling up their \nsleeves and getting to work to figure out how to best arrive at that \nnumber.\n  Today, Speaker Boehner said: Nothing is agreed to until everything is \nagreed to. That is a fair and reasonable position to take. He need not \npublicly confirm the $33 billion number. But as long as both sides keep \ntheir heads down and keep working, a deal is in sight. We are right on \nthe doorstep.\n  But there are outside forces that do not like this turn of events. \nOutside the Capitol today, there was a tea party rally staged to \npressure Republican leaders not to budge off H.R. 1. They want Speaker \nBoehner to abandon these talks and hold firm, even if that means a \ngovernment shut down on April 8. This is a reckless, and, yes, extreme \nposition to take.\n  Earlier today, the Republican leader came to the floor to defend the \ntea partiers rallying outside this building. Let me say this. I agree \nwith some of his points. For instance, I agree that the fact that the \ntea party is so actively participating in our democracy is a good \nthing. They have strongly held views and they joined the debate. This \nis as American as it gets.\n  But the tea party's priorities for our government are wrong. Their \npriorities are extreme because they are out of step with what most \nAmericans want. Every poll shows Americans want to cut spending but \nwith a smart, sharp scalpel, not a meat ax. They want to eliminate the \nfat but not cut down into the bone. They want to focus on waste and \nabuse. They want to cut oil and gas subsidies. They want to end tax \nbreaks for millionaires.\n  They do not want to cut border security or port security funding that \nkeeps us safe. They do not want to take a meat ax and cut vital \neducation programs. They do not want to end cancer research that could \nproduce research that saves many lives. Most of all, unlike the tea \nparty, most Americans do not want the government to shut down. They \nwant both sides to compromise.\n  A deal is at hand if Republicans in Congress will tune out the tea \nparty voices that are shouting down any compromise. These tea party \nvoices will only grow louder as we get closer to a deal, and our \nresolve must remain strong. If the Speaker will reject their calls for \na shutdown, we can pass a bipartisan agreement. Many conservatives whom \nI would otherwise disagree with, agree with me on at least this point.\n  It was very interesting to see on FOX News yesterday three \ncommentators all on the same show, plainly agreeing it is time to \naccept a compromise with Democrats to avert a shutdown. Charles \nKrauthammer was adamant that a shutdown would be avoided and that if \nthe government did shut down, the Republicans would be blamed.\n  Kirsten Powers, a conservative columnist, said: ``What really should \nhappen is if Boehner could strike a deal with the Blue Dogs and the \nmoderate Dems and just go with the 30 billion with the Senate and just \nmove on.''\n  Bill Kristol agreed that while Republicans may like to pass a budget \nsolely on their terms with only Republican votes, the reality is, the \nSpeaker would need Democrats to get a deal done.\n  The tea party may have helped the Republicans win the last election, \nbut they are not helping the Republicans govern. The tea party is a \nnegative force in these talks. But we are close to overcoming this \nforce and cutting a deal.\n  As the negotiations enter the homestretch, here is how we should \ndefine success: First and foremost, a government shutdown should be \navoided. We should all agree on that. It bothers me when I hear some on \nthe other side of the aisle or in the tea party say: We should shut \ndown the government to get what we want.\n  Second, the top-line target for cuts should stay around the level \ndescribed by the Vice President and that both parties are working off \nof. This makes complete sense, since $33 billion is the midpoint \nbetween the two sides, and it is what Republicans originally wanted in \nFebruary before the tea party forced them to go higher.\n  Third, the makeup of the cuts, as I suggested a few weeks ago, should \nnot come only from domestic discretionary spending. We cannot solve our \ndeficit problem by going after only 12 percent of the budget. Mandatory \nspending cuts must be part of the package, and the higher the package \ngoes, the more the proportion should be tilted in favor of mandatory \nrather than discretionary spending.\n  Fourth, the most extreme of the riders cannot be included. There are \nsome riders we can probably agree on. But the EPA measure is not one of \nthem, neither is Planned Parenthood or the other extreme riders that \nhave been so controversial.\n  I believe we can settle on a few measures that both sides think are \nOK. But the most extreme ones do not belong in this budget bill. Those \nare issues that should probably be debated but not as part of a budget \nand not holding the budget hostage to them. If we can adhere to these \ntenets, we can have a deal both sides can live with. Time is short, and \nwe need to begin moving on to the pressing matter of the 2012 budget.\n  Speaking of the 2012 budget, let me say a quick word about that. I \nsaw today that House Republicans planned to unveil their blueprint next \nweek. Interestingly, the report said Republicans no longer plan to cut \nSocial Security benefits as part of that blueprint. They are admitting \nit is not a major driver of our current deficits. That is true, and \nthis is a positive development.\n  It comes after many of us on the Democratic side, including Leader \nReid and myself, have insisted that Social Security benefits not be cut \nas part of any deficit-reduction plan. It is good to see that \nRepublicans, including the House Budget chairman, according to the \nreports in the paper, now agree with us. His original plan called for \nprivatizing the program. I hope we are not going to bring up that again \nbecause it will not pass.\n  But if the House Republicans instead simply insist on balancing the \nbudget on the backs of Medicare recipients instead of Social Security \nrecipients, we will fight them tooth and nail over that too. There has \nto be give on all sides--shared sacrifice, not just in any one little \narea.\n  A lot is at stake in the current year's budgets. But in another \nsense, it is simply a prelude to the larger discussions ahead. We urge \nthe Speaker to resist the tea party rallies of today and the ones that \nare to come, to accept the offer on the table on this year's budget, \nand let us tackle the larger topics that still await us.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. In the Senator's opinion, why would the \nRepublicans, particularly from the House of\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\nRepresentatives, want to cut Social Security, since the Social Security \nsystem has little, if any, effect upon us getting our arms around the \ndeficit and moving the budget toward balance over the next 10 years?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My friend makes a good point. In fact, by law, the \nSocial Security system and its pluses and minuses and the Federal \nGovernment's budget and its pluses and minuses must be separate. So by \ndefinition, by law, the two are separate. Social Security has its \nliabilities and assets, a big pile of assets over here, and the Federal \nGovernment has its liabilities and assets. The twain don't meet. One \nwould think, particularly those who are saying privatize, that their \nopposition or desire to include Social Security in large-scale budget \ndeficit talks, which we need and which are good--and I commend the \ngroup of six for moving forward in this direction--one would think that \nis an ideological agenda because they simply don't like Social Security \nand want to change it, privatize it, whatever, rather than any \nmotivation about the deficit.\n  Then when we see that some of them may want to extend tax breaks for \nmillionaires permanently, which would increase the deficit by a huge \namount, and yet at the same time they say: Let's deal with Social \nSecurity, let's privatize it, which doesn't have anything to do with \nthe deficit, one scratches one's head and says: I don't think deficit \nreduction is what is going on here.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for his erudite analysis.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for his erudite question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business \nfor 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2035-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2035-S2037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEBT AND DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, Abraham Lincoln began his famous \n``house divided'' speech with simple, homespun advice that we should \nfirst ``know where we are and whither we are tending,'' before we \n``judge what to do and how to do it.'' We are embarked on a journey of \ngreat consequence regarding what to do about our Nation's budget and \nhow to do it. This is a vital conversation. We simply must reduce our \nannual Federal deficits and our Nation's debt. But it would seem wise \nat this important time to take President Lincoln's advice and examine \nwhere we are and whither we are tending as we go about making these \ndecisions.\n  I will touch on a few factual landmarks that may help orient us to \nwhere we are and help us learn whither we are tending. The first and \nmost obvious is that we just weathered the worst economic crisis since \nthe Great Depression. Few of us who were here then--I know the \nPresiding Officer was--will ever forget the animal fear and desperate \nurgency displayed by Treasury Secretary Paulsen and Federal Reserve \nChairman Bernanke as they, having looked into that abyss, came to this \nbuilding, to the LBJ room, and pleaded for our help to save the world \neconomy. We are now past the worst depths of the financial and economic \ncrises.\n  As this chart shows, the economic recovery measured in jobs is \nproceeding, though all too tentatively and all too slowly. In Rhode \nIsland, we are still at 12 percent unemployment in the Providence \nmetropolitan area and over 11 percent statewide. To Lincoln's question \nwhere are we, well, gradually trending in the right direction. But no \none can yet rule out a double dip back into deeper recession.\n  Into this gradual and tepid recovery, the Republicans want to inject \nH.R. 1. What can we know about that? Mark Zandi, an economic adviser to \nSenator McCain's 2008 Presidential campaign, says this legislation, the \nHouse bill, will cause 700,000 job losses. That wipes out about half of \nthe recovery, if that number is correct. Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street \ninvestment bank, says that bill, H.R. 1, could lower GDP growth by two \nfull percentage points in the remaining two quarters of the fiscal \nyear. Goldman Sachs is no fool where economic numbers are concerned. It \nwould be a perilous choice to dismiss their warning. Our present rate \nof economic growth is only about 3 percent. So reducing that by a full \n2 percent over a year could wipe out more than half of our economic \nrecovery. Of course, economic growth correlates to Federal revenues so \nthe cuts' damage to economic growth would in turn create revenue loss, \nso there would be less deficit reduction. That is one landmark of where \nwe are. We are in a too-slow economic recovery from what was nearly a \nsecond great depression, and we face a bill from the House that \nthreatens that too-slow recovery.\n  Another mark of where we are and whither we are tending relates to \nthe balance between regular Americans and corporate America's \nrespective contributions to our Nation's revenue. In 1935, regular \nAmericans and corporate America evenly split the responsibility to fund \nour country's obligations. Then in each of these indicated years, it \nbroke through the following ratios: humans twice as much as \ncorporations in 1948; three times as much in 1971; four times as much \nin 1981; and recently the ratio broke through 6 to 1, individual \nAmericans contributing more than six times the revenue that corporate \nAmerica contributes. When people say how overtaxed corporate America \nis, it is worth looking at the facts of where we actually are and \nwhither for decades we have been tending--ever diminished corporate \ncontributions to our Nation's revenues.\n  Look next at how we collect revenues. Look at the landmarks of our \ndysfunctional Tax Code. Start with what it takes to comply with our \nbeast of a code. The National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent office \nwithin the IRS, has calculated that Americans spend 6.1 billion hours \nof time engaged in tax compliance each year. Think of what could be \ninvented, what could be built with 6 billion hours of human work. \nInstead, it is all consumed, every year, in the economic dead weight \nloss of tax compliance. In terms of where we are, that is an important \nfact, and it is an abysmal place to be.\n  Let me take my colleagues to another place. Here is a picture from \nour Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad taken in the Cayman Islands. \nThis nondescript building doesn't look like much. It certainly doesn't \nlook like a beehive of economic activity. But over 18,000 corporations \nclaim this building as their place of business. It gives a whole new \nmeaning to the phrase ``small business'' when we think of 18,000 \ncorporations claiming that building as their place of business. As \nChairman Conrad has pointed out, the only business going on here is \nfunny business, monkey business with the Tax Code, tax gimmickry. This \nis estimated to cost us as much as $100 billion every year. For every \none of those dollars lost to the tax cheaters, honest tax-paying \nAmericans and honest tax-paying American corporations have to pay an \nextra dollar or more to make up the difference.\n  Here is another building with a tax story to tell about where we are \nas we look at our budget debate. This is the Helmsley building New York \nCity. This building is big enough to be its own zip code so that the \nIRS reports of tax information by zip code can tell us a lot about this \nbuilding. Here is what this building tells us from actual tax filings. \nThe well off and very successful occupants of that building paid a \nlower tax rate than the average New York City janitor paid. It seems \nextraordinary, but it is not a fluke. The average tax rate of the New \nYork City janitor is 24.9 percent of their income. Of a New York City \nsecurity guard, is 23.8 percent of their income. And of the occupants \nof that wonderful building, 14.7 percent of their considerably larger \nincomes. That seems as though it must be extraordinary, but it is not a \nfluke.\n  The IRS reports that the tax rate actually paid by the highest income \n400 Americans--the story is the same--the highest earning 400 \nAmericans, in the IRS's most recent calculation, each earned an average \nof $34 million-plus a year, over a third of a billion each and every \nyear, 400 of them. I truly applaud their success. It is a magnificent \nthing. But here is the rub. They actually paid on average only a 16.7 \npercent total Federal tax rate. I asked my staff to calculate the wage \nlevel where a regular single worker starts paying 16.7 percent in total \nFederal taxes. It is at a salary of $28,650. A representative job\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\nat that income level in my home State, in the Providence labor market, \nis that of a hospital orderly which the Bureau of Labor Statistics \ncalculates pays $29,100 a year. At that point, they are paying the same \nas the 400 biggest taxpayers who each earned over a third of a billion \ndollars, 16.7 percent. So it is not just the fortunate and successful \nresidents of the Helmsley building who pay a lesser share of their \nincome to support their country than does the janitor, it is also the \ntop 400 income earners, those averaging over a third of a billion in \nincome, who contribute a lesser share of their income than the hospital \norderly pushing his cart down the halls of Rhode Island Hospital at \nnight.\n  Where are we? Well, it seems to me we are upside down as far as this \nis concerned. I believe no less an economic titan than Warren Buffett, \nthe fabled ``oracle of Omaha,'' agrees with me that this needs to be \ncorrected.\n  The corporate Tax Code makes little more sense. Decades of lobbyists \nhave carved it into a Swiss cheese of tax loopholes, of earmarks for \nthe rich and powerful. The result? We have a nominal corporate tax rate \nof 35 percent. But here is what the New York Times reported last week. \nGeneral Electric, one of the Nation's largest corporations, made \nprofits of over $14 billion last year and paid no U.S. taxes. In fact, \nit actually received a $3.2 billion refund from the taxpayers. Maybe \nthat was a 1-year anomaly. But a previous analysis by the New York \nTimes of 5 years' worth of corporate tax returns found that Prudential \nFinancial only paid 7.6 percent; Yahoo, 7 percent; Southwest Airlines, \n6.3 percent; Boeing, 4.5 percent; and what looks to be our tax \navoidance champion, on $11.3 billion of income, the Carnival Cruise \nCorporation paid 1.1 percent in Federal taxes. One recent paper \nactually calculated their cash effective tax rate at 0.7 percent on \n$11.3 billion in income. Carnival lines is not just taking us for a \ncruise, they are taking us for a ride.\n  But wait, there is more. Don't forget that we make the American \ntaxpayer subsidize big oil to the tune of $3 billion a year, and big \noil has made a trillion dollars in profits this decade. Indeed, on an \neffective tax rate basis, the petroleum-gas industry pays the lowest \nrate of any industry.\n  These are all noteworthy landmarks and each should inform us about \nwhere we are and whither we are tending as we face our budget. But the \nbig landmark, the Mt. Everest of landmarks casting its vast shadow over \nthe entire budget discussion, is health care.\n  I agree with Congressman Paul Ryan. He said:\n\n       If you want to be honest with the fiscal problem and the \n     debt, it really is a health care problem.\n\n  He is dead right. And the landmark feature of this landmark problem \nis this. The health care cost problem is a health care system problem. \nOur national health care costs are exploding. The health care system is \ndriving the costs of Medicare. The health care system is driving the \ncosts of Medicaid.\n  The health care system is driving the costs of private insurance. The \nhealth care system is driving the costs of the military's TRICARE \nsystem. No one is exempt. The health care system is what is driving the \ncost problem in public and private programs alike. So we have to \naddress the health care system problem if we are going to get our \nhealth care costs under control.\n  How do we solve this? We actually have a pretty good toolbox that has \nfive major tools in it.\n  One, quality improvement. Quality improvement saves the cost of \nerrors, misdiagnosis, disjointed care, and so forth. For example, \nhospital-acquired infections alone cost about $2.5 billion every year, \nand they are virtually entirely avoidable. They should never be events.\n  Two, prevention programs. Prevention programs can avoid the cost of \ngetting sick in the first place. More than 90 percent of cervical \ncancer is curable if the disease is detected early through pap smears.\n  Three, paying doctors for better outcomes rather than for more and \nmore tests and procedures can save money while improving the outcomes.\n  Four, a robust health information infrastructure has been estimated \nto save $81 billion a year by the RAND Corporation, and that number may \nvery well be low as the system builds itself out.\n  Finally, five, the administrative costs of our health care system are \ngrotesque. The insurance industry has developed a massive bureaucracy \nto delay and deny payments to doctors and hospitals. The doctors and \nhospitals have had to fight back, so they have had to hire their own \nbilling departments and consultants.\n  In the little Cranston community health center, which I visited a few \nmonths ago, half of the staff are dedicated to trying to get paid, and \nthey have to spend another $200,000 a year on consultants. All of \nthat--the entire war over payment between insurers and hospitals and \ndoctors--adds no health care value--zero. We have heard that on the \nprivate insurance side, anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of the health \ninsurance dollar gets burned up in administrative costs. We know we can \ndo better because the costs of administering Medicare are closer to 2 \npercent of program expenditures. Add this all up, and the numbers here \nare enormous.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisers has stated that 5 \npercent of GDP can be taken out of our health care system without \nhurting the health care we receive. That is about $700 billion a year. \nThe New England Healthcare Institute says it is $850 billion a year. \nThe well-regarded Lewin Group has estimated the probable savings at $1 \ntrillion a year, a figure echoed by former Bush Treasury Secretary \nO'Neill.\n  Not only are the numbers enormous, but the results are a win-win. \nConsider the five strategies: higher quality care with fewer errors and \ninfections; prevented illnesses, so you do not get sick in the first \nplace; secure, complete health records that are there when you need \nthem, electronically, so your doctors, your lab, your pharmacy, your \nhospital, your specialists all know what everybody else is doing; \npayment to doctors and hospitals based on keeping you well and getting \nyou well rather than on giving more procedures and things to you; and \nfinally, not so much infuriating insurance company bureaucracy, \nhassling both patients and doctors. Those are not bad outcomes even \nwithout the savings.\n  So what do we draw from this if we keep all these landmarks in mind, \nlandmarks of where we actually are in this budget debate? Well, our \ncolleagues on the other side, particularly our House Republican \ncolleagues, say they are determined to reduce our annual deficit and \nour national debt, that it is their top priority. But in evaluating \nthat claim, look at H.R. 1, which spends all its cost-cutting fury on \nonly 12 percent of the budget--the nonsecurity discretionary spending--\nand zero percent on the revenue side.\n  If they are really serious about deficit and debt reduction, why risk \ndestroying 700,000 jobs when job destruction only adds to the deficit \nand to our debt through lost economic activity and revenue?\n  If they are really serious about deficit and debt reduction, why is \nnot one corporate tax loophole on the chopping block--not one? Why is \nthe Tax Code off limits in this discussion, as it burns up 6 billion of \nour precious hours every year and makes that hospital orderly, pushing \nthat cart down the linoleum hallway at midnight, pay a higher rate than \nthose fortunate and able Americans who made more than $1/3 billion each \nin a single year?\n  If they are really serious about this, if deficits and debt are \nreally the most important thing we face, why is there no discussion of \ncorporate America's ever-diminishing contribution as a share of our \nnational revenue?\n  If our friends are really serious, why is there no plan for even one \nof the 18,000 corporations in that phony-baloney headquarters in the \nCayman Islands to pay its proper taxes?\n  Finally, if they are really serious, why is there so much pure \npolitical nonsense about ObamaCare and socialized medicine instead of a \nmature discussion about using and improving the tools in the health \ncare bill to address our grave national health care system problem?\n  Further, why is it necessary to throw Planned Parenthood and Head \nStart and every single idealistic young kid in City Year and Teach for \nAmerica under the bus? Not one kid in an American school doing Teach \nfor America can be spared, and yet we must keep our full deployment of \n57,000 troops in Germany? Is it necessary to single out the\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency for the gutting that polluters long \nhave lusted for? Why go after Social Security, which has never \ncontributed a nickel to America's debt or deficit?\n  It just seems to me that until one, just one, corporate tax loophole \nis on the table; until one, just one, subsidy to big oil is on the \ntable, one, just one, subsidy to big agribusiness; until we are even \nbeginning to talk about billionaires contributing Federal revenue in \nthe same share of their income as that hospital orderly; until our \nfriends are not so casual about threatening 700,000 jobs and perhaps \n$20 billion in related tax revenue; until the cuts and all those riders \nin H.R. 1 make it something other than a Republican Trojan horse of \npolitical favors and ideology, then count me a skeptic about their real \npriorities.\n  I have always found that you get a better read looking at what people \nactually do rather than just believing whatever they say. If you look \nat what H.R. 1 actually does, it is the same old Republican agenda--\nattacking programs that help the poor, attacking women's right to \nchoose, attacking national voluntary service, helping polluters get \naround public health measures, reducing the share of revenues paid by \ncorporations and very high income individuals. It is the same old song. \nAnd most important, if you go that road, it is just not adequate to \nmeet the serious problems at hand. We need to look throughout the \nbudget and across all of our opportunities to bring down our Nation's \ndeficits and to bring down our Nation's debt.\n  I look forward in the months ahead to a serious, fair, and sensible \ndiscussion, a mature discussion of how to reduce our deficits and our \ndebt.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life \nand accomplishments of one of the Commonwealth's most outstanding \ncitizens, Mr. Rick Curry, who passed away on November 17, 2010, at the \nage of 65. Rick made significant contributions to his hometown of \nCorbin, KY, as an active citizen, an entrepreneur and the coowner of \none of Corbin's most popular nightspots and downtown attractions, The \nDepot on Main restaurant. I am honored to have called him my friend.\n  Originally from London, KY, Rick graduated from London High School \nand attended the University of Kentucky before enlisting in the U.S. \nAir Force. After being stationed in Japan and completing his military \nservice, he attended Cumberland College and later became the president \nof Curry Oil Company in London, and Petro Haulers Inc., a fuel hauling \nbusiness. Not only was Rick a successful businessman, he was also \ninvolved in property development and owned key commercial properties.\n  Aside from his successful business endeavors, Rick had always dreamed \nof owning a restaurant. In 2004, he began to make that dream a reality \nwhen he purchased and renovated an old department store building in \ndowntown Corbin. This once blighted and vacant building soon turned \ninto a beautiful and thriving restaurant; The Depot on Main. It was \nRick's pride and joy.\n  This renovation was not only significant to Rick personally, but also \nto the Corbin community. It came at a time when economic vitality was \nsuffering and few people dared to make investments. But Rick did. His \ninvestment encouraged business development in downtown Corbin.\n  Many people who had the privilege of knowing Rick remember the \nremarkable recovery he made after suffering a stroke in 2007. He \nhandled that crisis, as he did everything else, with such a positive \nattitude and indomitable spirit. Those qualities, as well as the bonds \nhe forged with so many in the community through his work, through the \nrestaurant and in his life will be what Rick Curry is remembered for.\n  My thoughts go out to his wife Holly, the citizens of Corbin, and \nmany other beloved friends and family members for their loss. Rick was \nan upstanding gentleman and an irreplaceable citizen of the \nCommonwealth. He will be greatly missed.\n  Mr. President, the Corbin News Journal recently published an article \nhonoring Rick and the legacy he left behind. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Depot on Main Owner Dies at Age 65\n\n                          (By Trent Knuckles)\n\n       To those who knew him best, local businessman Rick Curry \n     was the kind of guy who lived life to the fullest--destined \n     to enjoy every moment he was given.\n       Curry, owner of The Depot on Main restaurant in Corbin, \n     died in the early morning hours last Wednesday at the \n     University of Kentucky Medical Center in Lexington after \n     suffering a brain aneurysm. He was 65-years-old.\n       ``I can't say enough about Rick and what a good person he \n     was,'' said Bruce Carpenter, Director of Economic Development \n     for Corbin and part owner, along with his wife Teresa, of The \n     Depot on Main with Rick and his wife Holly. ``He was a good-\n     hearted person. He always wanted to have a good time and have \n     fun. I feel so fortunate to have known him the last six \n     years.''\n       Curry was president of Curry Oil Company, in London, and \n     Petro Haulers Inc., a fuel hauling business. He also was \n     involved in property development and owned key potential \n     commercial properties in London and Corbin.\n       Carpenter said he first met Rick and Holly in 2004, shortly \n     after voters in the city of Corbin approved a measure that \n     allowed that sale of alcoholic beverages at qualifying \n     restaurants in the city limits.\n       Curry always had the dream of owning a nice restaurant and \n     saw opportunity in Corbin.\n       He was one of the first entrepreneurs to take advantage of \n     the new law.\n       Curry purchased the old Daniel's Department Store building \n     and began renovations on what would eventually become The \n     Depot on Main.\n       At the time, Carpenter was beginning a push to create a \n     Main Street Program in Corbin dedicated to revitalizing the \n     city's central business district.\n       ``When I found out what he was doing, I got very excited \n     about it. He was taking an older building and totally \n     renovating it and making it something beautiful. I thought it \n     was a great opportunity to jumpstart downtown,'' Carpenter \n     said. ``It was a tremendous amount of work. He made a big \n     investment in our community. That is what always excited me \n     about Rick was his investment and belief in our downtown.''\n       Corbin Mayor Willard McBurney said news of Curry's death \n     was sad and that the city had lost a valuable advocate and \n     ally.\n       ``He sure took a void on Main Street and turned it into one \n     of the nicest restaurants in this area,'' McBurney said. ``It \n     was a blighted building and he made it something to be proud \n     of. He invested a lot of money into our Main Street. He will \n     be missed.''\n       Curry told the News Journal that construction of The Depot \n     on Main cost about $800,000. Carpenter said his family and \n     the Curry's became close over the years. In 2007, Curry \n     suffered a serious stroke, but made a remarkable recovery.\n       ``He always had such a positive attitude and a good support \n     system around him. Once he was on the road to recover, I \n     think he just fed off that. He will be greatly missed,'' \n     Carpenter said.\n       According to his obituary, Curry was a London native who \n     attended grade school at Saint William Catholic Church. He \n     graduated from London High School and was a member of the \n     school's football team.\n       While a student at the University of Kentucky be joined the \n     U.S. Air Force and was stationed in Japan. After leaving \n     military service had attended Cumberland College.\n       Funeral arrangements for Curry were handled by House-\n     Rawlings Funeral Home.\n       A celebration of Curry's life was held Saturday at St. \n     William Catholic Church in London.\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2038-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. RICHARD STOLTZFUS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary \ncareer accomplishments of one of the Commonwealth's most talented and \ndevoted medical professionals. Dr. Richard Stoltzfus, who has provided \nthousands of Kentuckians with his medical expertise as an internal \nmedicine physician at the Daniel Boone Clinic in Harlan, KY, will \nretire at the end of April after 35 years of dedicated service.\n  Although born and raised in Pennsylvania, Dr. Stoltzfus always knew \nlife held something different in the cards for him. After completing \nhis medical degree at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia, \npracticing internal medicine in Darby, PA, completing his residency \ntraining at Mercy Catholic Medical Center in Philadelphia, and \nvolunteering at Hospital Grande Riviere du Nord in Haiti for 6 years, \nDr. Stoltzfus decided to pursue his goal of providing medical care to \nresidents in rural towns where he believed it was needed most. This \nbelief is what led him to Harlan, KY, where he began work for the \nDaniel Boone Clinic in August 1976. Along with being a practicing \nphysician, he also served as medical director of the Mountain Heritage \nHospice since its beginning in 1980 to 2000, and was chief of medical \nstaff at the Harlan Appalachian Regional Healthcare Hospital during his \n35-year tenure.\n  Dr. Stoltzfus's long career shows his passion for helping others not \nonly by ridding them of illness, but also by promoting overall wellness \nand health. His definition of health is not just the absence of \ndisease, but the presence of physical, social, emotional and spiritual \nwell being. Dr. Stoltzfus forms lasting bonds with his patients because \nthey can see how much he truly cares.\n  Dr. Stoltzfus has said that the years he has spent in Harlan County \nhave been the best years of his life. This may be true, but it is also \nsafe to say that the contributions of dedicated and special people such \nas him are what make communities like it such wonderful and hospitable \nplaces to both work and live. I send my best wishes to Dr. Stoltzfus \nand his wife as they move on to the next phase of life: Dr. Stoltzfus \nhas said they plan to move to Virginia to be closer to their children. \nI am sure their children will be glad to have more of their father \naround--just as I am sure the whole family is very proud of him and his \nlife of accomplishment. I offer my sincerest congratulations to Dr. \nStoltzfus on an exceptional career.\n  Mr. President, the Harlan Daily Enterprise recently published an \narticle honoring the career of Dr. Stoltzfus. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Harlan Daily Enterprise, Feb. 26, 2011]\n\n            Daniel Boone Clinic Physician To Retire in April\n\n                           (By Nola Sizemore)\n\n       After 35 years of service as an internal medicine physician \n     at the Daniel Boone Clinic, Dr. Richard Stoltzfus will retire \n     at the end of April.\n       ``I'd like Harlan County people to know how much I \n     appreciate them making the last 35 years living and working \n     here in Harlan County the best years of my life,'' said \n     Stoltzfus. ``I know I've been able to serve people here and, \n     in turn, I have been blessed by people here in many ways by \n     the show of affection and appreciation my wife and I have \n     received.''\n       Stoltzfus said after he finished his residency training in \n     Philadelphia, Pa. he wanted to practice medicine in a place \n     where he felt there was a real medical need--not in an urban \n     area, but a rural area. He said he learned about a job \n     opening in Harlan County from a friend, Dr. J.D. Miller, who \n     was a physician at the Cloverfork Clinic during that time.\n       ``I met Dr. Miller in Haiti where I was a volunteer for six \n     years prior to coming to Harlan,'' said Stoltzfus. ``I \n     applied for the position and began work at the Daniel Boone \n     Clinic in August, 1976.''\n       Along with being a practicing physician at the Daniel Boone \n     Clinic, Stoltzfus has also served as medical director of \n     Hospice since its beginning. He said in the last few years he \n     had worked as assistant medical director.\n       Stoltzfus also served as chief of medical staff at the \n     Harlan ARH Hospital during his tenure.\n       ``Hospice is a wonderful organization, and I really believe \n     in it,'' said Stoltzfus. ``A lot of people placed in Hospice \n     have a certain life expectancy and most of the time they \n     exceed that. I believe it's because of the care they receive \n     from the wonderful staff.''\n       Stoltzfus said one of his guiding principals, while \n     practicing medicine in Harlan County, had been promoting \n     wellness. He said the definition of health is not just the \n     absence of disease, but it's the presence of physical, \n     social, emotional and spiritual well being.\n       ``I can cure a person of pneumonia, but that person can \n     still be sick,'' said Stoltzfus. ``I may refer them to \n     pastors or counselors or help them work on relationships--to \n     promote a wholesome life. I believe in spending time with \n     patients. I've always seen myself on an equal playing field \n     with my patients. As a physician, of course, I have knowledge \n     to share, but I involved my patients in decision making.''\n       Stoltzfus said there were many points in the last 35 years \n     of living in Harlan County, and two that stood out in memory \n     were his trip to Washington D.C. with the Harlan Boys Choir \n     when they sang at the inauguration of President George Bush. \n     He said he was proud to be a part of those representing \n     Harlan County to the world.\n       ``My family was flooded in 1977,'' said Stoltzfus. ``We \n     lived in Rio Vista and had four feet of water in our house. I \n     remember I had a patient, who had just had a heart attack, \n     that wanted to help me and my wife clean the mud from our \n     home. He wasn't physically able to help, so he sent his wife \n     to help us--that's what Harlan County people do--care about \n     their neighbors. The whole community supported us during that \n     time. Things like that touch your heart. The way the people \n     of Harlan County watch out for each other has always touched \n     me. I love the small town atmosphere evident here in Harlan \n     County.''\n       Stoltzfus said after his retirement, he and his wife would \n     be relocating to Virginia to be near their two children. He \n     said he planned to always keep in touch with his friends here \n     in Harlan County.\n       ``My coworkers are like family to me,'' said Stoltzfus. \n     ``Harlan County is a wonderful place to raise families. It \n     has values of community and caring which I think some \n     communities have lost. Harlan has been put down by a lot of \n     people; but I've always been proud of Harlan because of what \n     they have to offer here. Our children are well educated and \n     very prepared for their future. I'm very proud of our \n     educators here in the county and the job they're doing. \n     Harlan has a lot to offer and I'd recommend it to everyone. \n     I'm going to miss living and working here.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2038-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2038-S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Lieutenant Miroslav ``Steve'' zilberman\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life and \nmilitary service of Navy LT Miroslav ``Steve'' Zilberman, who died 1 \nyear ago today, while serving his adopted country with distinction and \nrepresenting his family with honor as a devoted son, husband, and \nfather.\n  Lieutenant Zilberman immigrated to the United States from the Ukraine \nwith his parents when he was 11 years old. The family settled in the \nsuburbs of Columbus, OH, where he would graduate from Bexley High \nSchool and soon thereafter enlist in the U.S. Navy. The grandson of a \nRussian World War II pilot, Lieutenant Zilberman lived and breathed \nnaval aviation. While serving in the Navy, Lieutenant Zilberman \nreceived a world class education, travelled across continents, and flew \nwith the most elite fleet in the world.\n  After excelling as a naval electronics technician for 2 years, \nLieutenant Zilberman was selected to become an officer through the \nNavy's Seaman to Admiral Program. His commanding officer and fellow \nsailors recognized the strength of Lieutenant Zilberman's character, \nhis officer potential, and his unquestionable loyalty to the United \nStates.\n  As a naval pilot, Lieutenant Zilberman was chosen to fly the E-2C \nHawkeye, a crucial component of all U.S. Navy Carrier Air Wings and one \nof two propeller airplanes that operate from aircraft carriers. Always \nembracing new challenges with determination, Lieutenant Zilberman \nunderstood the requisite hard work and skill needed to become a top-\nnotch E-2C pilot.\n  He studied his aircraft inside and out, and was particularly proud of \nthe nighttime landings he successfully completed. He once landed his E-\n2C Hawkeye at night with only one engine functioning--a significant \nfeat of balancing skill over nerves, displaying an implicit trust in \nhis hours of training and studying. Commander Dave Mundy of the Carrier \nAirborne Early Warning Squadron 121--the VAW-121, also known as the \n``Bluetails''--attests that Lieutenant Zilberman was one of the best \npilots he had ever flown with.\n  On March 31, 2010, Lieutenant Zilberman had been forward deployed for \nnearly 3 months. While returning to\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\nthe U.S.S. Eisenhower after a flight mission over Afghanistan, \nLieutenant Zilberman's plane crashed into the North Arabian Sea, \napproximately 5 miles from the aircraft carrier. One of the plane's \ndual engines lost oil and eventually failed. When it became clear to \nLieutenant Zilberman that there was no way to safely land the plane on \nthe flight deck, he ordered his crew to bail out. Lieutenant Zilberman \nfought valiantly to keep his plane steady long enough for his crew \nmembers to escape. He went down with his plane into the North Arabian \nSea. Lieutenant Zilberman's crew members were rescued shortly after the \ncrash, and the search and rescue effort salvaged portions of the \naircraft. However, after searching more than 5,300 square miles for \nLieutenant Zilberman, the search was called off and he was pronounced \ndead.\n  Each day our servicemembers, like Lieutenant Zilberman, sacrifice \ntheir lives defending our Nation. Their acts of heroism are derived \nfrom a sense of duty, an obligation taken from the belief in the \ngreatness of our Nation. But beyond their courage and bravery, our \nservicemembers are also husbands and wives, sons and daughters, and \nfriends and neighbors. In addition to being a highly capable and daring \npilot, Lieutenant Zilberman was known by his family and friends as \nsomeone with an infectious personality, as Commander Mundy has said, \nsomeone who could walk into a room and reduce any tension or stress.\n  While on board the Ike, Lieutenant Zilberman stayed in touch with his \nfamily via video chat, where he read and danced for his children. \nLieutenant Zilberman was a dedicated husband to his wife Karen, who was \nalso his high-school sweetheart. He was a loving father to his son \nDaniel and daughter Sarah. And he was the loving son--and only child--\nof devoted parents Anna Sokolov and Boris Zilberman.\n  Today marks the 1-year anniversary since Lieutenant Miroslav \n``Steve'' Zilberman's life was taken while serving our Nation. On \nbehalf of a grateful State, I thank him for his service--and his family \nand friends for keeping his memory alive through their thoughts and \nactions that remind us of his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2039-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 JUSTICE AND POLICE REFORM IN GUATEMALA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on a subject that I \nhave discussed before concerning Guatemala's struggling justice system.\n  In a country facing a growing threat from Mexican drug cartels and \nother criminal organizations that have infiltrated every facet of \nsociety, a police force that is notoriously corrupt and ineffective at \ninvestigating crime, a military hierarchy that continues to obstruct \njustice, and a conviction rate in the courts of 2 percent, the \nsituation could hardly be grimmer.\n  Violent crime and smuggling have skyrocketed, impunity is the norm, \nand reports indicate that many people in Guatemala feel less safe today \nthan even during the 30-year internal armed conflict. There are \ncredible reports of police collusion with the drug cartels, and threats \nand assassinations of indigenous activists who have petitioned for land \nreform. And a decade and a half after the signing of the Peace Accords, \nthe military hierarchy, current and former, uses threats and \nintimidation of victims, witnesses, judges and prosecutors to avoid \naccountability for past crimes against humanity.\n  I and others were encouraged last year when President Colom appointed \nrespected human rights activist Helen Mack to assess the weaknesses of \nthe police and to recommend reforms. Ms. Mack has widespread \ncredibility and could be relied on to conduct a fair, thorough review.\n  But any recommendations for reform are only as good as the funding \nand political will to implement them, which is too often lacking in \nGuatemala. Presidential elections are scheduled for September. Unless \nthe current government or its successor is prepared to carry the police \nreform process forward, not only will a critical opportunity have been \nmissed but the security challenges facing Guatemala will worsen \nfurther.\n  Helen Mack accepted her assignment knowing it would be dangerous. Her \nsister Myrna, an anthropologist who had documented the horrific abuses \nof Mayan peasants by the Guatemalan army, was assassinated by the army \nin 1990. Helen also knew that trying to reform the police would \nultimately be a wasted exercise if her recommendations end up \ncollecting dust on a shelf. Yet she has persevered, and it is for the \ngood of all Guatemalans.\n  Other victims of torture, disappearance, and murder during the \ninternal armed conflict are still waiting for justice. When successive \ngovernments failed to hold the military accountable, some victims or \ntheir families turned to the courts, only to be stymied at every turn. \nThe courts have issued contradictory rulings, reversed themselves and \neach other, and cases have dragged on for years. It makes a mockery of \njustice and of officials who are responsible for upholding the rule of \nlaw.\n  No democracy can survive without a functioning justice system, \nincluding a professional, trusted, well financed police force. The \neffectiveness of the police in preventing and controlling crime depends \non the relationship between the police and the public. If the police \nforce is to regain the confidence and trust of Guatemalans, \nparticularly Guatemala's indigenous population which has traditionally \nbeen the target of discrimination and abuse, a concerted and unwavering \neffort must be made to ensure the professionalism, transparency and \naccountability of the police. It should be a priority.\n  Ms. Mack's courageous efforts, and the efforts of others who have \nrisked their lives in support of justice and a better life for the \nmillions of Guatemalans living in poverty, deserve the unequivocal \nsupport of the Guatemalan Government and the Government of the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2039-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TIK ROOT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to say a few words \nabout a situation in Syria that is of particular concern to me and \npeople of my State.\n  Going on 2 weeks ago, a young Middlebury College student, Pathik \n``Tik'' Root, disappeared in Damascus, Syria, where he was studying \nArabic.\n  As anyone who is following recent events in Syria knows, there have \nbeen large public demonstrations, some of which have resulted in \narrests and casualties.\n  Thanks to the efforts of U.S. Embassy Damascus and the Syrian \nAmbassador to the United States, Imad Moustapha, it was determined that \nTik had been arrested and is being held in a Syrian jail.\n  By all accounts, it appears that Tik was arrested simply because he \nwas taking photographs at one of the demonstrations.\n  As an avid photographer myself, I would hope that the Syrian \nGovernment recognizes the innocent conduct of a young, curious American \nstudent who is fascinated, as we all are, by the extraordinary events \ntaking place across North Africa and the Middle East.\n  I and my staff have had multiple conversations with Tik's father, \nwith Ambassador Moustapha, with U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford, and other \nState Department officials about Tik's situation.\n  We are optimistic that he will be released, because he was doing \nnothing wrong and at most he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n  But so far, no one from the American consulate in Damascus has been \nallowed to see Tik, which is unacceptable. Our representatives in \nDamascus should be given immediate access to him--today--to ensure that \nhe is in good health and being treated humanely.\n  I know I speak not only for myself but also for Senator Bernie \nSanders and Congressman Peter Welch, in urging the Syrian authorities \nto release Tik and allow him to return home.\n  This is not a time to be confusing a young American college student \nwith the popular forces that are calling for political change in Syria.\n  Tik is an innocent 21-year-old who poses no threat whatsoever to the \nSyrian Government, but his continued detention will only further \ncomplicate our already difficult relations with Syria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2039-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2039-S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING ELIZABETH TAYLOR\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and honor \nthe\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\nincredible life of Elizabeth Taylor, a true Hollywood movie star, a \ndedicated social activist, and a legendary figure in American history.\n  Elizabeth Taylor was born on February 27, 1932, in Hampstead, London, \nEngland, to Americans Francis Lenn Taylor and Sara Viola Warmbrodt. In \na career that spanned 70 years, Elizabeth Taylor remarkably appeared in \nover 50 films. However, it was her philanthropy and dedication to her \nfellow humankind that have earned my deepest gratitude.\n  Many will remember Elizabeth Taylor for her film career, with \noverwhelming hits such as ``National Velvet,'' which catapulted her to \nstardom and solidified her as Hollywood's newest star. I personally \nrecall this film as one of my childhood treasures, and it remains a \nclassic to this day. Ms. Taylor was a pioneer for women, in film and in \nsociety. When she signed a $1 million contract for the film \n``Cleopatra,'' it boldly declared her status to Hollywood and the \nworld. She also expanded her body of work to include Broadway, where \nshe debuted in the revival of Lillian Hellman's 1939 play ``The Little \nFoxes'' and returned in the revival of Noel Coward's 1930 comedy \n``Private Lives.''\n  Though Elizabeth Taylor earned her household name through her \naccomplishments in the film industry, it was her charitable work to \ncombat AIDS that was truly outstanding. Never one to shy away from \nopposition or controversy, Ms. Taylor wholeheartedly fundraised, \nsupported, and raised awareness for AIDS. Her ability to mobilize a new \naudience was remarkable. In addition to fundraising and contributing \nmillions of dollars to addressing AIDS, Ms. Taylor was a principal \nfounder in the American Foundation for AIDS Research, amfAR, and the \nElizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.\n  Elizabeth Taylor received many accolades throughout her career, \nincluding her appointment as a Dame Commander of the Order of the \nBritish Empire for her illustrious film career and humanitarian work. \nMs. Taylor received two Academy Awards for best actress for her \nperformances in ``Butterfield 8'' and ``Who's Afraid of Virginia \nWoolf.'' Later, she was inducted into the California Hall of Fame at \nthe California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts, by former \nGovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger. While these honors are notable, it was \nMs. Taylor's intangible qualities of perseverance, altruism, and grace \nthat were even more remarkable.\n  Beyond her film career and role as an activist, Elizabeth Taylor was \nan individual with an entrepreneurial spirit. She authored a self-help \nbook, designed jewelry for The Elizabeth Collection by Piranesi, and \ncreated the popular perfumes ``Passion,'' ``White Diamonds,'' and \n``Black Pearls.'' As a reflection of herself, Ms. Taylor's ventures \nalways evoked a sense of class, eternal elegance, and beauty.\n  Please join me in expressing the sympathies of this body to Elizabeth \nTaylor's family, including her children, Michael Howard and Christopher \nEdward Wilding, Elizabeth ``Liza'' Todd, and Maria Burton, 10 \ngrandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren. I have no doubt she will be \nso dearly missed by the many friends, family, and countless individuals \nwhose lives she touched.

Willie was \ndedicated to providing hope for a better life for underprivileged \nchildren in Montgomery, AL, and he was a personal friend. Along with \nthe children and families whose lives Willie helped to change, I mourn \nhis passing.\n  Willie Jones was born on April 3, 1955, and was an alumnus of Alabama \nState University. He began his life of dedication to the YMCA by \nparticipating in the organization's programs as a youth. Starting in \n1968, he worked part time as an aquatic instructor at the Cleveland \nAvenue YMCA in Montgomery, where he would later become the executive \ndirector. His involvement didn't stop there; Willie also served as a \nsenior vice president of the Montgomery YMCA. He held famous father/son \nbanquets that attracted top sports talent to the Cleveland Avenue YMCA \nand provided inspiration for young boys and their fathers.\n  I have always recognized the Cleveland Avenue YMCA as an important \nplace for the advancement of underprivileged youth. The facility opened \nin 1960 in conjunction with Martin Luther King's efforts to obtain \nequal opportunities for all people, including children. Willie and I \nworked together to fund and open the Cleveland Avenue Cultural Arts and \nEducation Center, CAEC, in 2000. The CAEC is the largest YMCA facility \nin the country that is entirely dedicated to the arts. It is a true \ntestament to Willie's commitment to helping America's youth through \ncreative and educational initiatives.\n  In addition to his work for the YMCA, Willie served as the chairman \nof the Montgomery County Community Punishment and Corrections Authority \nand advocated for prison alternatives for nonviolent offenders, another \npassion of his. He also served on the Montgomery Housing Authority \nboard of directors and the Montgomery County Recreation Commission.\n  Willie's advocacy extended beyond the boardroom and into city and \ncounty meetings, which he regularly attended. He was often spotted \naround the community networking with nearly everyone he met. Willie was \na great friend to me and to all people, young and old. His selfless \nlife's mantra was, ``This isn't about Willie Jones, it's about the kids \nat the YMCA.'' I am honored to have assisted with obtaining Federal \nfunding for the Cleveland Avenue YMCA and to have known this man who \nwas so committed to his community and to the greater world around him.\n  Willie is loved and will be missed by his wife Versie and two \nchildren, Jeff and Jennifer. My thoughts and prayers are with them as \nthey struggle with Willie's premature and unexpected death. A tireless \nadvocate for underprivileged children and nonviolent offenders, Willie \nchampioned the notion of a ``second chance'' for kids throughout the \ncommunity and will be fondly remembered for the legacy of service he \nleft behind him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2040-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2040-S2041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ALEX HECHT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor one of my Small \nBusiness Committee staff members and trusted advisers, Alex Hecht, as \nhe prepares to depart Capitol Hill for the private sector. Alex joined \nmy office in March 2005--6 years ago--as regulatory counsel for the \ncommittee, after serving as a legislative analyst for the National \nMulti Housing Council. Since then, Alex has taken on a host of issues \nvital to our Nation's small businesses and has been at the forefront of \nhelping me craft critical legislation to assist these job generators.\n  As regulatory counsel, Alex helped me develop an agenda to help small \nbusinesses fight the onerous regulations they face. And he has \ncontinued his work to this day. As has been noted frequently, our \ncurrent Federal regulatory situation is outrageous. Small firms--our \nNation's primary job creators--with fewer than 20 employees bear a \ndisproportionate burden of complying with Federal regulations, paying \nan annual regulatory cost of $10,585 per employee, which is 36 percent \nhigher than the regulatory cost facing larger firms.\n  To reduce the burdensome task of complying with excessive Federal \nregulations, Alex helped me draft an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet reform bill that created small business advocacy review panels \nwithin the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, through the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act so that the CFPB fully considers small \nbusiness economic effects when it promulgates new regulations. Alex \nalso helped me move the Small Business Compliance Assistance \nEnhancement Act over the finish line in 2007 to ensure that agencies \npublish small business compliance guides for regulations in plain \nEnglish and in a timely manner.\n  Alex was also instrumental in helping me introduce the Small Business\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\nRegulatory Freedom Act of 2011 with Senator Coburn to help ensure that \nthe Federal Government fully considers the small business economic \nimpact of the rules and regulations that agencies promulgate.\n  Since January 2007, Alex has served as my chief counsel on the \ncommittee, overseeing much of its policy work and specializing in a \nnumber of issue areas, including health care and small business energy \npolicy, in addition to regulatory reform. Alex was crucial in helping \nme develop the Small Business Health Options Program Act--or SHOP Act--\nin both the 110th and 111th Congresses. This bipartisan legislation \nwould have made health insurance more affordable and accessible for \nsmall businesses and the self-employed, who represent a majority of our \nNation's uninsured.\n  Alex also helped me craft the Small Business Energy Efficiency Act of \n2007, which was signed into law as part of the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007. This legislation is helping to combat climate \nchange by using Small Business Administration, SBA, resources to assist \nin the development of energy efficiency projects.\n  Additionally, Alex has been inextricably linked with our committee's \nefforts to reauthorize the Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, \nand Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, programs. These critical \ninitiatives foster an environment of innovative entrepreneurship by \ndirecting more than $2 billion annually in Federal research and \ndevelopment, R, funding to the Nation's small firms most likely to \ncreate jobs and commercialize their products. We are presently debating \nsuch legislation on the floor--legislation which represents an \nunprecedented compromise supported by stakeholders from all sides--and \nwe are closer than we have been in 5 years to getting a bill to the \nPresident's desk. This is largely in part to Alex's consistent and \ndedicated efforts.\n  As Alex prepares to leave the Senate, I offer him my sincerest \ngratitude for 6 dedicated years of service to my office and to \nAmerica's small businesses. In particular, I want to thank him for \nserving as acting staff director of the committee in late 2006. Over \nhis years on the Hill, Alex has developed a thorough knowledge and \npassion for Senate procedure and has been key in helping me formulate \nour committee rules each Congress. His absence will be regrettably \nnotable. I wish him, his wife Amy, and his children, Chance and Marin, \nall the best as they begin this exciting new chapter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2041-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DANIEL P. MULHOLLAN\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Today I wish to note the retirement of Daniel P. \nMulhollan as Director of the Congressional Research Service and to \nthank him for his service to Congress over the past 42 years. CRS, an \ninstitution with roots going back to 1914, provides essential support \nfor Congress. Dan Mulhollan has been a part of CRS since September \n1969; and he has led CRS since January 24, 1994, when Librarian of \nCongress James Billington named him CRS Director.\n  As Director, Mulhollan's accomplishments have been impressive. He \nworked to ensure that the analytical services of CRS are explicitly and \nclearly pertinent to the legislative, oversight, and representational \nresponsibilities of Congress and to the current congressional agenda. \nHe expanded the ability of CRS to bring interdisciplinary scholarship \nto bear on matters important to Congress. His efforts to develop and \nimplement a personnel succession plan ensure that professional talent \nwill continue to be available to Congress in the years to come.\n  Following graduate work in political science at Georgetown \nUniversity, Mulhollan came to what was then known as the Legislative \nReference Service. His first division chief recognized the restless \nenergy of this new analyst in American national government and put him \nto work on inquiries about the institutional dimensions of Congress. In \n1973 Mulhollan was named section head and subsequently served as head \nof three sections in the CRS Government Division. He and the teams he \nled worked with committees and Members of Congress on such matters as \nlobbying disclosure, the Watergate investigation, and subsequent \nimpeachment investigation, congressional reorganization, and \ncongressional ethics. In 1981 Mulhollan became assistant chief of the \nCRS Government Division, and in that position he managed research for \nCongress on a wide range of issues, among which were the organization \nand administration of the executive and legislative branches, \nlegislative process, voting and elections, lobbying, and political \nparties and processes.\n  In 1991 Mulhollan received the Library's Distinguished Service Award \nfor his career achievements, and in 1992 James Billington, the \nLibrarian of Congress, appointed Mulhollan as Acting Deputy Librarian \nof Congress for a period of 2 years and commissioned him to head the \nLibrary's effort to enhance its service to Congress. Subsequently, \nMulhollan was named chief of the CRS Government Division; and then in \n1994, Dr. Billington named Mulhollan to be Director of the \nCongressional Research Service. In making the appointment, Dr. \nBillington said, ``Daniel Mulhollan brings to this position \ncomprehensive knowledge of Congress, an understanding of its research \nneeds, a strong commitment to diversity, and a record of effective and \nenergetic administration.'' The Librarian chose well: under Mulhollan's \nenergetic leadership over the past 17 years, CRS has consolidated its \nanalytic abilities and has continually demonstrated its worth to the \nUnited States Congress.\n  I am confident that my Senate colleagues join me in wishing Daniel \nMulhollan well in his retirement, commending his leadership of CRS, and \nthanking him for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2041-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2041-S2042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EARL HOLDING\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today I want to give recognition to an \nindividual who has done great things for the ski industry and the State \nof Idaho. On April 2, Earl Holding will be inducted into the U.S. Ski \nand Snowboard Hall of Fame. His induction is not because of his \nexploits on the slopes, although he knows how to carve a turn in the \nsnow, but because of his passion and unmatched effort in developing \nquality skiing facilities in Idaho, the Western United States, and for \nhis work in bringing the 2002 Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City.\n  Earl Holding purchased Idaho's ski resort of Sun Valley in 1977. His \nattention to detail and the experience he brought to the property from \nowning and managing properties in the hospitality industry, truck stops \nand oil industry was just what the resort needed. He began a \nbeautification project that restored the grandeur of the property by \nrenovating virtually every square foot of the historic buildings, \nadding moonlight sleigh rides and world-class ice shows, and planting \nthousands of new trees.\n  On the ski runs, he put in the world's largest snowmaking system. \nFive new high-speed detachable quad lifts were built along with new day \nlodges and restaurants. With interests in architecture and design, Earl \nHolding showed his talent for uniting culture and charm as well as \ninspiring excitement to his resorts and hotels. As such, he personally \noversaw the design of the new lodges to maximize their breathtaking \nmountain views.\n  Sun Valley was once again a preeminent resort that brought skiers and \ntourists from around the world. In 2009, the Sun Valley Nordic Center \nhosted the International Special Olympics. It was also the training \nsite for numerous international teams as they prepared for the 2002 \nWinter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City.\n  Earl Holding, along with his wife Carol, has restored the charm and \ngrandeur that was Sun Valley shortly after its founding by Averell \nHarriman in 1936. Skiers, winter sports enthusiasts and the entire ski \nindustry have benefitted from the Holding family's passion for \ndeveloping a first-class and highly acclaimed ski resort at Sun Valley \nand elsewhere.\n  His work has also made the State of Idaho a destination location for \nskiers, golfers and other outdoor enthusiasts as he developed Sun \nValley into a five-star, year-round resort. The enormous draw the name \n``Sun Valley'' has in the highly competitive international tourism \ntrade is beyond anything the state could do to attract more tourists.\n  It is indeed a great honor for me to congratulate Earl Holding for \nhis vision, passion and perseverance in making Sun Valley a world-class \nresort,\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\nand for his induction into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2042-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO IRVING AND PHYLLIS LEVITT\n\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Irving and \nPhyllis Levitt and their lives of service to my home State of Delaware \nand their community in Dover.\n  For over 40 years, both Irving and Phyllis have been consummate \nactivists, educators, community leaders, and patrons of the arts. Their \ncontribution to Dover and to the First State can be measured in the \nthousands of lives they have enriched. Since arriving in Delaware in \n1966, Irving and Phyllis have tirelessly demonstrated their concern for \nothers and their commitment to the causes they hold dear.\n  For decades, Irving Levitt worked passionately in public service, \nfilling a number of important roles at the Social Security \nAdministration in Dover and Wilmington. Later, he served on the Dover \nUtility Commission and was elected a city councilman. For 15 years, \nIrving served as the Governor's appointee to the State's Accident \nReferral Board, and he was also a member of the State Board of Nursing.\n  Phyllis brought the joy of English language and literature to \nhundreds of students during her 25 years as a teacher at Dover High \nSchool. In addition to her teaching and her devotion to the Dover High \nstudents, Phyllis served on numerous State education commissions and \nled the Delaware chapter of the National Organization of Teachers of \nEnglish. She also spent several years teaching English at Wesley \nCollege and an English teacher training course at the University of \nDelaware. Following her retirement in 1992, Phyllis chaired the State \nHumanities Council, served on the Governor's Committee on the Arts, and \ntransformed the Dover Art League from a small volunteer group into a \nmajor nonprofit that enriches lives throughout Kent County. Moreover, \nPhyllis chaired the Delaware chapter of the American Civil Liberties \nUnion and, during her retirement, continued to advocate for causes of \njustice on the street corners of our State capital. Irv and Phyllis \ntogether regularly participated in marches, protests, and campaigns to \nimprove conditions for the poor, for migrant workers, and for all who \nsuffered injustice. They became fierce advocates for human rights.\n  As members of Congregation Beth Sholom, both served in leadership \nroles, with Phyllis presiding over the Sisterhood and Irving leading \nthe Brotherhood and later presiding over the synagogue. Their \ninvolvement included roles with Hadassah, Israel Bonds, and the Jewish \nCommunity Relations Council in Dover. Jewish life continues to flourish \nin our State in part because of their devotion to the Delaware Jewish \ncommunity and their involvement with interfaith and multicultural \noutreach programs.\n  Together, Irving and Phyllis Levitt exemplify that ancient \ncommandment found in Deuteronomy: ``Justice, justice you shall \npursue.'' I am proud to be their friend, and I join in congratulating \nthem on the occasion of a dinner in their honor on April 3. May they \ncontinue to serve as a beacon of justice in our community and an \nexample for young people throughout our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2042-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ALFRED SCHWAN\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Born in 1925 to \nPaul and Alma Schwan, as a young man he helped his father at the \nMarshall Ice Cream Company make popsicles and ice cream bars.\n  But Alfred did not go straight into the family business. He left to \nfulfill a dream and serve his country as a pilot and joined the U.S. \nNaval Aviation Corps. Alfred flew torpedo bombers and taught anti-\nsubmarine warfare.\n  He met his wife Doris during a blind date at a USO Club. They married \nin 1946, the same year Alfred was awarded Navy Wings of Gold. A year \nlater they had their first of five sons.\n  Answering a call from his family, Alfred joined the family business \nin 1964 to oversee factory operations and company drivers. Those \ncompany yellow trucks have become beloved across the nation. I know I \nremember fondly seeing the yellow Schwan truck in my neighborhood.\n  With a commitment to integrity and hard work, Alfred went on to \noversee the Schwan pizza business. He guided the production of Schwan \npizza in their plant in Salina, KS, for three decades while also \noverseeing plants in Kentucky and Texas and in my home State of \nMinnesota.\n  He used his flying skills to crisscross the Nation on behalf of \nSchwan--becoming the company's first aviation department.\n  After the death of his brother Marvin, Alfred was appointed CEO, \npresident and chairman of Schwan in 1993. He retired as chairman in \n2009 at the age of 83.\n  Among the many public honors this inspirational and ever optimistic \nleader received includes being honored by the School Nutrition \nAssociation of Kansas as an Outstanding Industry Member of the Year and \ninduction into the Frozen Food Hall of Fame as well as receiving \nSchwan's most prestigious honor--the Marvin M. Schwan Heritage of \nQuality Award.\n  It is appropriate to honor Alfred's passing as March is National \nFrozen Food Month. He gave his energy passionately to this important \nindustry.\n  With more than 700 facilities nationwide, the frozen food industry \nemploys nearly 100,000 Americans in the manufacturing sector alone, \ngenerating a payroll of approximately $3 billion.\n  My home State of Minnesota is home to Schwan's headquarters and over \n7,500 jobs in frozen food. Alfred was such an important leader and \ncitizen of Minnesota when he retired Marshall, Minnesota declared \nJanuary 29, ``Alfred Schwan Day.''\n  During Frozen Food Month, it is important to take a moment to \nremember all-American entrepreneurs and inventors like Alfred Schwan \nand Clarence Birdseye--an American inventor--who ushered in a food \nrevolution in 1930 when his line of frozen foods first hit grocery \nstores. Few other food choices provide consumers with the benefits and \nflexibility offered by frozen foods.\n  I imagine Alfred and Clarence had a lot in common.\n  On behalf of all Americans, I thank Alfred Schwan for his service to \nour country and to U.S. consumers. Frozen foods are a staple in \nAmerican homes, office lunch rooms and school cafeterias. They provide \nan important source of healthy, affordable and convenient food choices \nthat will continue to help feed our Nation and the world.\n  It is appropriate that we take a moment to recognize the passing of a \ngreat innovator and pioneer this Frozen Food Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2042-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2042-S2043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING BRIGADIER GENERAL HENRY A.

These foods \nprovide an important source of healthy, affordable, and convenient food \nchoices that help feed our Nation and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2043-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2043-4", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2043-5", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 471.

A bill to require the use of electronic on-board recording \ndevices in motor carriers to improve compliance with hours of service \nregulations; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nlegislation with Senator Alexander of Tennessee that I believe will \nhave a dramatic impact on the safety of our Nation's highways and \ninterstates, called the Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act. \nThis bill will require the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration FMCSA, to implement regulations requiring \nthe use of electronic on-board recording devices, EOBRs, for motor \ncarriers in order to improve compliance with Hours-of-Service, HOS, \nregulations. Requiring the use of these technologies in motor carriers \nwill not only improve compliance with HOS regulations, but it will also \nreduce the number of fatigued commercial motor vehicle drivers on the \nroad. This will have a profound impact on highway safety and reduce \naccidents and fatalities on our highways and interstates.\n  Hours-of-Service regulations place limits on when and how long \ncommercial motor vehicle drivers may drive. These regulations are based \non an exhaustive scientific review and are designed to ensure truck \ndrivers get the necessary rest to drive safely. In developing HOS \nrules, the FMCSA reviewed existing fatigue research and worked with \nnongovernmental organizations like the Transportation Research Board of \nthe National Academies and the National Institute for Occupational \nSafety. HOS regulations are designed to continue the downward trend in \ntruck driving fatalities and maintain motor carrier operational \nefficiencies.\n  Unfortunately, compliance with HOS regulations is often spotty due to \ninaccurate reporting by drivers as they are only required to fill out a \npaper log, a tracking method that dates back to the 1930s. Inaccurate \nreporting may result from an honest mistake or an intentional error by \na driver seeking to extend his work day. These inaccuracies can lead to \ntoo much time on the road, leaving the driver fatigued and placing \nother drivers at risk. After listening to the many interest groups and \nexperts on this issue in meetings and Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee hearings, I have come to learn that there is \nan available and affordable twenty-first-century technology that can \nensure accurate logs, enhance compliance, and reduce the number of \nfatigued drivers on the road. They are being used today, and they are \nproducing results. I believe that widespread utilization of these \ndevices as soon as possible will significantly reduce further loss of \nlife resulting from driver fatigue.\n  Our legislation will require motor carriers to install in their \ntrucks an electronic device that performs multiple tasks to ensure \ncompliance with HOS regulations. These devices must be engaged to the \ntruck engine control module and capable of identifying the driver \noperating the truck, recording a driver's duty status, and monitoring \nthe location and movement of the vehicle. Requiring electronic log \nbooks that are integrally connected to the vehicle engine as this bill \nrequires will dramatically increase the accuracy of information \nsubmitted for hours of service compliance. Our bill will also require \nthese recording devices to be tamper resistant and fully accessible by \nlaw enforcement personnel and Federal safety regulators only for \npurposes of enforcement and compliance reviews.\n\n  While I understand that some drivers may be reluctant to transition \nto electronic logging devices, I strongly believe that the safety \nbenefits of the use of these devices far outweigh the costs. I don't \nwant to see more lives lost due to driver fatigue resulting from log \nbook manipulation. I also believe that with the rapid development of \nelectronic technology, especially in the wireless telecommunications \narea, we will see strong competition among EOBR manufacturers and \nreduced costs for these technologies. In addition, the price of these \nproducts should go down as the demand increases through regulatory \nrequirement to utilize this equipment.\n  Senator Alexander and I are not alone in calling for this technology \nto be more widely used by commercial vehicles. There are a number of \nSenators, including Senator Lautenberg, who have long been strong \nproponents of implementing the use of this technology. In addition, \nmultiple Federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations have \nrecognized the benefits of this technology and called for its \nwidespread use.\n  For example, Mr. Francis France of the Commercial Vehicle Safety \nAlliance stated at the April 28, 2010, Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation hearing on Oversight of Motor Carrier \nSafety Efforts that,\n\n       All motor vehicles should be equipped with EOBRs to better \n     comply with Hours of Service laws . . . CVSA has been working \n     with a broad partnership to help provide guidance to achieve \n     uniform performance standards for EOBRs.\n\n  Similarly, the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, \nthe Honorable Deborah Hersman, stated at the same hearing that,\n\n       For the past 30 years, the NTSB has advocated the use of \n     onboard data recorders to increase Hours of Service \n     compliance . . . the NTSB recommended that they be required \n     on all commercial vehicles.\n\n  During the same hearing, Ms. Jacqueline S. Gillan, with the Advocates \nfor Highway and Auto Safety, stated that,\n\n       We regard the mandatory, universal installation and use of \n     EOBRs as crucial to stopping the epidemic of hours of service \n     violations that produce fatigued, sleep-deprived commercial \n     drivers . . . at very high risk of serious injury and fatal \n     crashes.\n\n  I have also heard from Administrator Ferro of the FMCSA on her \nthoughts of how EOBRs would enhance compliance and improve highway \nsafety. The FMCSA recently implemented a rule to require that these \ndevices be mandated for truck drivers and trucking companies that have \nbeen found to be noncompliant with FMCSA rules. These rules will be \neffective in June 2012. It is my understanding that the FMCSA is \nlooking to expand these requirements to include more motor carriers, \nand I support those efforts as they reflect the qualities and intent of \nthis legislation.\n  Finally, in addition to the support from safety advocates and federal \ntransportation safety officials, I have also heard from a number of \nArkansas trucking companies currently utilizing this technology. These \ncompanies have\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\nexperienced reductions in driver fatigue, increases in compliance, and \nreductions in insurance premiums. The executives of these companies, \nwhich include J.B. Hunt and Maverick U.S.A. among others, support the \nexpanded use of these devices to increase compliance, improve highway \nsafety, and level the playing field among the industry. I agree with \ntheir views on the importance of widespread utilization of this safety \nand compliance device.\n  The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act, if enacted, will \nrequire the Department of Transportation to issue regulations within \neighteen months from enactment to require commercial motor vehicles \nused in interstate commerce to be equipped with electronic onboard \nrecorders for purposes of improving compliance with hours of service \nregulations. The regulation will apply to commercial motor carriers, \ncommercial motor vehicles, and vehicle operators subject to both hours \nof service and record of duty status requirements three years after the \ndate of enactment of this Act. This population represents a vast \nmajority of drivers and carriers who operate trucks weighing 10,001 \npounds or more involved in interstate commerce. It will cover one \nhundred percent of over-the-road, long-haul truck drivers.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the importance of \nthis technology in saving lives on our nation's highways and \ninterstates. I also ask for their support for this legislation and help \nin moving it to the President as quickly as possible. It is my hope \nthat we move this legislation through the Senate no later than the \nSurface Transportation Reauthorization legislation that the Senate will \ntake up in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Rockefeller, and \n        Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 699. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to carry out a \nprogram to demonstrate the commercial application of integrated systems \nfor long-term geological storage of carbon dioxide, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Department of Energy \nCarbon Capture and Sequestration Program Amendments Act of 2011, along \nwith Senators Barrasso, Rockefeller and Murkowski. It is critical that \nwe work toward reducing our greenhouse gas footprint while producing \nsafe and secure, clean energy here in America. I believe this bill will \ngo far to incentivize early project developers to start reducing carbon \ndioxide emissions through carbon capture and geologic sequestration.\n  This bipartisan bill establishes a national program through the \nDepartment of Energy to facilitate up to 10 commercial-scale carbon \ncapture and sequestration projects. There is a clear need to address \nboth the issues of liability and adequate project financing for early-\nmover projects. The program in this bill is a strong step to building \nconfidence for project developers demonstrating that the projects will \nbe conducted safely while addressing the growing concerns of reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions from industrial facilities, such as coal and \nnatural gas power plants, cement plants, refineries and other carbon \nintensive industrial processes. Such an early movers program will go \nfar also assisting project developers and regulators to better \nunderstand and characterize any risks which may be associated with \nlong-term geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide.\n  In addition, this legislation maps out a clear framework for long-\nterm assurance for geological storage sites. It is essential to \nconsider the issue of safe, long-term storage of carbon dioxide and \ntake the steps needed for site stewardship during the injection phase, \ndirectly after site closure and for long-term preventative maintenance \nof the geologic storage facility.\n  Many stakeholders associate maintenance issues with liability \nconcerns. In my view, these are two separate issues. Maintenance is \nessential for reducing risk and limiting liabilities at a storage site, \nand it is critical to have robust monitoring, accounting, and \nverification of an injected carbon dioxide plume at each of the storage \nsites that would continue well past site closure. With a proper site \nmaintenance program developed for each project, risk will be minimized \nand developers will have greater confidence that liabilities will not \nbe incurred. This legislation will require science-based monitoring and \nverification of the injected carbon dioxide plume throughout the life \nof the project to well beyond the closure phase. This bill is \nconsistent with the current efforts to provide a strong regulatory \nframework for safe geologic storage of carbon dioxide through the \nUnderground Injection Control Program under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct.\n  As carbon capture and sequestration projects grow in both scale and \nnumber, there will be an increasing need to train qualified regulators \nto oversee the permitting, operation, and closure of geologic storage \nsites. This bill also creates a grant program whose goal is to train \npersonnel at State agencies which will oversee the regulatory aspects \nof geologic storage of carbon dioxide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 699\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Long-Term Leasing Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 703, the \nHelping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership Act of \n2011, otherwise known as the HEARTH Act.\n  For far too long, bureaucratic red tape has prevented Indian tribes \nfrom pursuing economic development and homeownership opportunities on \ntribal trust lands. For many years, Indian tribes have expressed \nconcerns about the Federal laws and regulations governing surface \nleases of tribal trust lands.\n  The delays and uncertainties inherent in the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs' lease approval process, as well as the restrictions on the \nduration of lease terms, create serious barriers to the ability of \ntribes to plan and carry out economic development and other land use \nactivities on tribal lands.\n  The HEARTH Act would give Indian tribes the discretion to adopt their \nown surface leasing regulations and, once those regulations are \napproved by the Secretary of the Interior, the authority to enter into \nsurface leases of tribal lands without any further approval of the \nSecretary. The HEARTH Act would provide our nation's Indian tribes with \nnew tools with which to expedite the productive and beneficial use of \ntheir lands.\n  In the 111th Congress, the Committee on Indian Affairs approved a \nvery similar version of this bill but the full Senate did not act on \nthe measure.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to thank Senator Akaka, the \nCommittee's new Chairman, for his leadership on this issue and for \nagreeing to cosponsor this bill with me. I would also like to thank \nSenators Thune, Tim Johnson, Tester, and Tom Udall for cosponsoring \nthis important legislation.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to help us expand economic \nopportunity on tribal trust lands by moving S. 703 expeditiously.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today speak as an original cosponsor \nof an amendment to the Long Term Leasing Act of 1955. I am pleased to \nbe an original cosponsor on this legislation which was introduced by my \ncolleague on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Mr. Barrasso.\n  The Helping, Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership \nAct of 2001, also known as the HEARTH Act of 2011, amends the Long Term \nLeasing Act of 1995. That act allows tribes or individual Indians to \nlease their lands for up to 25 years for certain purposes, including \neconomic development, housing, education, agricultural, and natural \nresource development. The current act requires the Secretary of the \nInterior to approve each individual lease. It can take up to 2 years \nfor each lease to be approved. Often this bureaucratic delay leads to \nthe loss of economic development and other opportunities for tribes.\n  Since the enactment of the Nonintercourse Act of June 30, 1834, and \npredecessor statutes, land transactions with Indian tribes were \nprohibited unless specifically authorized by Congress. Congress enacted \nthe act of August 9, 1955, commonly known as the Long-Term Leasing Act \nto overcome the prohibitions contained in the Nonintercourse Act. The \nLong-Term Leasing Act permitted some land transactions between Indian \ntribes and non-Federal parties--specifically, the leasing of Indian \nlands. The act required that leases of Indian lands be approved by the \nSecretary of the Interior and limited to terms of 25 years.\n  Today, each individual lease of Indian lands still requires approval \nby the Secretary of the Interior. The HEARTH Act of 2011, would allow \neach tribe to develop its own leasing regulations. Those regulations \nwould then be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior for approval. \nThereafter, the tribes would be able to approve their own leases, so \nlong as they are consistent with their regulations.\n  This amendment to the Long-Term Leasing Act will have a significant \nimpact on streamlining the leasing process for tribes. It will reduce \ndelays in entering into economic development opportunities, providing \nhousing and developing natural resources on Indian lands.\n  I thank Mr. Barrasso for his leadership on this critical legislation. \nMy cosponsors are well aware of the positive impact this legislation \nwill have economic opportunities for tribes. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Enzi, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Schumer, and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 704. A bill to provide for duty-free treatment of certain \nrecreational performance outerwear, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S. Outdoor \nAct. In the Pacific Northwest, spending time in the great outdoors is a \npart of life. Our magnificent mountains, our clear rivers and streams, \nand our majestic forests provide for a quality of life that is, in my \nview, unparalleled. Unfortunately, the outerwear that enables us to \nenjoy these wonderful treasures is more expensive than it needs to be. \nThis is because under current law, the United States imposes steep \ntariffs on outdoor performance outerwear like jackets and pants used \nfor skiing and snowboarding, mountaineering, hunting, fishing and \ndozens of other outdoor activities.\n  These high tariffs--and let us call them what they are, taxes--were \noriginally implemented to promote an import substitution policy. They \nwere imposed to discourage American consumers from buying outerwear \nthat was manufactured overseas, even if those were superior products. \nToday, there is no domestic outerwear industry to really protect with \nthese tariffs, yet consumers are still paying through the teeth for \nproducts like snow pants and rain jackets. These tariffs are hammering \nthe pocketbooks of millions of American consumers, and they harm the \nbusinesses that are engaged in promoting enjoyment of the great \noutdoors.\n  But we can fix this in a way that helps American producers better \ncompete globally in an environmentally sustainable manner, and relieves \nconsumers of artificially high costs. But it is more than just reducing \ncosts and promoting innovation.\n  To me, the Outdoor Act is also about encouraging our kids and members \nof our community to get outside, to be active, and to appreciate and \nprotect our natural treasures. I want to associate myself with the \nefforts of the First Lady, Michelle Obama, who is leading an important \ninitiative to get people--especially kids--moving and eating healthier. \nI see the Outdoor Act, which makes getting outside to hike, bike, or \nfish more affordable as complementary of the First Lady's efforts.\n  I am proud that this legislation enjoys support from both sides of \nthe political aisle and especially pleased that my friend, Senator \nCrapo from Idaho, is helping to lead the charge with this initiative. \nFurthermore, I am happy that this legislation is supported by domestic \ntextile and apparel companies as well as the performance outerwear \ndesigners and retailers. This all makes sense given that it will spur \noutdoor recreation and consumption of goods to support these \nactivities. The outdoor recreation industry accounts for $730 billion \ndollars and 65 million jobs across the United States, with 73,000 jobs \nin Oregon. With this bill, we can potentially create even more jobs by \nincreasing the purchasing power of consumers of outdoor goods, by \nsaving them money on unnecessary tariffs.\n  The U.S. OUTDOOR Act eliminates the import duty for qualifying \nrecreational performance outerwear, bringing duties that can be as high \nas 28 percent down to zero. It also establishes the Sustainable Textile \nand Apparel Research, STAR, fund, which invests in U.S. technologies \nand jobs that focus on sustainable, environmentally conscious \nmanufacturing, helping textile and apparel companies work towards \nminimizing their energy and\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\nwater use, reducing waste and their carbon footprint, and incorporating \nefficiencies that help them better compete globally. I urge my \ncolleagues to take a look at this legislation and to work with me to \nmove it toward becoming law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 707. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to provide further \nprotection for puppies; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it might come as a surprise to some to \nlearn that dog breeders who sell animals directly to consumers over the \ninternet are not subject to any Federal regulation. Under the Animal \nWelfare Act, wholesale dog dealers have to have a Federal license and \nare subject to U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection. Wholesale dog \ndealers typically sell their puppies to retail pet stores. But the law \nexempts any ``retail pet store'' from the same licensing and inspection \nrequirements, because there was a day when you bought a dog either from \na licensed breeder or from a store, who bought their dogs from a \nlicensed breeder.\n  While it is not defined in statute, the exemption for retail pet \nstores has been interpreted to mean any outlet that sells dogs directly \nto the public. With the advent of the internet, many people buy puppies \nand dogs from breeders that are not licensed. There are plenty of \nresponsible breeders across the country who care about and take great \npains to properly look after the dogs in their care. But this statutory \nloophole leaves the door wide open for unscrupulous and negligent \ncommercial dog breeders.\n  Today, I am reintroducing the Puppy Uniform Protection and Safety, or \nPUPS, Act with my colleague Senator Vitter. The PUPS Act would require \nbreeders who sell more than 50 dogs a year directly to the public to \nobtain a license from the USDA.\n  This licensing process is simple and inexpensive, but it allows for \nbetter oversight of the facilities that keep dogs to ensure that they \nare complying with minimum Federal standards.\n  The media regularly reports stories about dogs rescued from \nsubstandard facilities--where dogs are housed in stacked wire cages and \nseriously ill and injured dogs are routinely denied access to \nveterinary care. This inhumane treatment has a direct bearing on the \nphysical and mental health of the dogs. I have heard from veterinarians \nin Illinois, who share heart-breaking tales of families who welcomed \nnew puppies into their homes, only to learn later that the animals had \nserious health or behavioral problems. In some cases, these puppies \ncould be treated, but often at great expense to their owners.\n  My bill would also require that dogs and puppies housed at all \nlicensed breeding facilities have space to run around, something we all \nknow dogs love to do, on a surface that is solid, or at the very least \nnon-wire.\n  It is my hope that extending and improving oversight of this industry \nthrough the PUPS Act will help protect the welfare of puppies and dogs \nin Illinois and across the country. Americans should feel confident \nabout the health and well-being of the dog that they welcome into their \nfamily.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. \n        Inhofe):\n  S. 710. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a \nhazardous waste electronic manifest system; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nThune, in cosponsoring a bill to modernize the tracking of hazardous \nwaste. The federal waste law requires the tracking of hazardous waste \nfrom ``cradle to grave.'' This tracking system is designed to provide \nan enforceable chain of custody for hazardous wastes. The law provides \na strong incentive for transporters to manage the waste in a \nresponsible fashion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \neconomic analysis estimates that over 139,000 regulated entities track \nbetween 2.4 and 5.1 million shipments a year.\n  This system provides for appropriate stewardship of the hazardous \nwaste products of our modern world. Unfortunately, the tracking system \nitself is in serious need of modernization.\n  Currently, the tracking is handled entirely through a paper manifest \nsystem. The paperwork burden is enormous. Each manifest form has seven \nor eight copies, which currently must be manually filled out and signed \nwith pen and ink signatures, physically carried with waste shipments, \nmailed to generators and state agencies, and finally stored among \nfacility records.\n  The paperwork burden is so great that 22 States and the EPA do not \neven collect copies of the forms. Those that do so get their copies \nmonths after the waste has been shipped. In the vast majority of cases, \nthe only time regulators look at the manifests is during inspections or \nafter a disaster to identify the responsible parties.\n  Under the Thune-Cardin bill, the paper manifest will be replaced by \nan electronic manifest. The bill sets up a funding system for the \nmanifest paid for by the users of the system, the generators, and waste \ncompanies that handle hazardous waste.\n  An e-manifest system would remove a tremendous paperwork burden, \nassist the States in receiving data more readily in a format they can \nuse, improve the public's access to waste shipment information and save \nover $100 million every year. First responders could get data in real-\ntime. That is why groups as varied as Dow Chemical, Sierra Club and the \nAssociation of State, Territorial, Solid Waste Management Officials \nsupport this bill.\n  EPA does not have the funding to set up this system, so the bill uses \na unique way to contract for the work. Companies will ``bid'' to set up \nthe system at their cost and risk. They will be paid back on a per \nmanifest basis by the users, waste generators, and handlers. This puts \nthe burden on the private company or companies to meet the needs of the \nusers of the system. The legislation is needed so that the funds \ncollected go to the operation of the program rather than go to the \ngeneral treasury.\n  A hearing was held on this issue in 2006 on a similar bill, S. 3871 \nintroduced by Senators Thune, Jeffords, and Inhofe. No serious \nobjections were made at that time and strong support was expressed by \nall the witnesses including EPA.\n  In September of 2008, an equally similar bill introduced by Senator \nThune was reported favorably out of the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and passed the Senate. Unfortunately, the House did not \ntake up the measure.\n  This is legislation that is overdue.

104 Stat. 2399), which also passed with strong \n     bipartisan support, saves more than 160,000 American lives \n     every year, has reduced power plant sulfur dioxide pollution \n     by 64 percent and nitrogen oxides pollution by 67 percent, \n     and has decreased acid rain deposits by 40 percent, all for a \n     total investment of 82 percent less than originally estimated \n     by the Federal Government;\n       Whereas the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 led to a \n     phase-out by 1996 of the most harmful ozone layer-depleting \n     products, for a total investment of 30 percent less than \n     originally projected by the Federal Government, saving \n     millions of Americans from skin cancer;\n       Whereas the Clean Air Act vehicle standards for cars, light \n     trucks, and heavy duty trucks help--\n       (1) to save drivers money at the gas pump by spurring fuel \n     efficiency innovation, at an estimated savings to drivers of \n     $2,800 over the life of a vehicle;

Res. 121\n\n        Designating April 2011 as ``Financial Literacy Month''.\n\n       Whereas according to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, at least 25.6 percent of households in the \n     United States, or close to 30,000,000 households with \n     approximately 60,000,000 adults, are unbanked or underbanked \n     and, subsequently, have missed opportunities for savings, \n     lending, and basic financial services;\n       Whereas according to the 2010 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, 34 percent of adults in the United States, or \n     more than 77,000,000 adults living in the United States, gave \n     themselves a grade of C, D, or F on their knowledge of \n     personal finance;\n       Whereas according to the National Bankruptcy Research \n     Center, the number of personal bankruptcy filings reached \n     1,500,000 in 2010, the highest number since 2005;\n       Whereas the 2010 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that only 16 \n     percent of workers were ``very confident'' about having \n     enough money for a comfortable retirement, a sharp decline in \n     worker confidence from the 27 percent of workers who were \n     ``very confident'' in 2007;\n       Whereas according to a 2010 ``Flow of Funds'' report by the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, household \n     debt stood at $13,400,000,000,000 at the end of the third \n     quarter of 2010;\n       Whereas according to the 2010 Retirement Confidence Survey \n     conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, less \n     than half of workers (46 percent) in the United States have \n     tried to calculate how much they need to save for retirement;\n       Whereas according to the 2010 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, 28 percent, or nearly 64,000,000 adults, admit to \n     not paying all of their bills on time;\n       Whereas according to the 2010 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, 3 in 10 adults in the United States, or more than \n     68,000,000 individuals, report that they have no savings, and \n     only 24 percent of adults in the United States are now saving \n     more than they did a year ago because of the current economic \n     climate;\n       Whereas according to the 2010 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, only 43 percent of adults keep close track of \n     their spending, and more than 11,000,000 adults do not know \n     how much they\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n     spend on food, housing, and entertainment, and do not monitor \n     their overall spending;\n       Whereas according to the sixth Council for Economic \n     Education biennial Survey of the States 2009: Economic, \n     Personal Finance, and Entrepreneurship Education in Our \n     Nation's Schools, only 21 States require students to take an \n     economics course as a high school graduation requirement, and \n     only 19 States require the testing of student knowledge in \n     economics;\n       Whereas according to the sixth Council for Economic \n     Education biennial Survey of the States 2009: Economic, \n     Personal Finance, and Entrepreneurship Education in Our \n     Nation's Schools, only 13 States require students to take a \n     personal finance course either independently or as part of an \n     economics course as a high school graduation requirement;\n       Whereas according to the Gallup-Operation HOPE Financial \n     Literacy Index, while 69 percent of American students \n     strongly believe that the best time to save money is now, \n     only 57 percent believe that their parents are saving money \n     for the future;\n       Whereas expanding access to the mainstream financial system \n     will provide individuals with less expensive and more secure \n     options for managing finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas quality personal financial education is essential \n     to ensure that individuals are prepared to manage money, \n     credit, and debt, and to become responsible workers, heads of \n     households, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and \n     citizens;\n       Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals \n     to make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion \n     caused by an increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas a greater understanding of, and familiarity with, \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas, in 2003, Congress found it important to coordinate \n     Federal financial literacy efforts and formulate a national \n     strategy; and\n       Whereas, in light of that finding, Congress passed the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act of 2003 \n     (Public Law 108-159; 117 Stat. 2003) establishing the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Commission and designating \n     the Office of Financial Education of the Department of the \n     Treasury to provide support for the Commission: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2011 as ``Financial Literacy Month'' \n     to raise public awareness about--\n       (A) the importance of personal financial education in the \n     United States;

Res. 122\n\n           Honoring the life and legacy of Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor, a world-renowned actress and \n     activist whose legendary career spanned 7 decades, passed \n     away on March 23, 2011;\n       Whereas with the death of Elizabeth Taylor, the State of \n     California and the United States lost 1 of the most talented \n     entertainers, philanthropists, and humanitarians in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor was born on February 27, 1923, in \n     London, England to American parents;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor and her family moved to the United \n     States, settling in the State of California, just prior to \n     the start of World War II;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor started acting at the age of 10 \n     and became a star at a young age;\n       Whereas the hard work and dedication of Elizabeth Taylor \n     earned her numerous acting roles in film, television, and \n     theater;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor became 1 of the most successful \n     and sought after actresses in the world;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor received 2 Best Actress Academy \n     Awards for her work in ``BUtterfield 8'' and ``Who's Afraid \n     of Virginia Woolf?'', and she became the first woman to earn \n     a 7-figure paycheck for appearing in a film;\n       Whereas many films that feature Elizabeth Taylor, including \n     ``A Place in the Sun'', ``Raintree Country'', ``Giant'', and \n     ``Cat On A Hot Tin Roof'', have become classic films \n     appreciated by generations of moviewatchers;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor used her fame to raise awareness \n     and advocate for people affected by HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas, at a time when HIV/AIDS was largely an unknown \n     disease and those who were affected by HIV/AIDS were \n     ostracized and shunned, Elizabeth Taylor called for and \n     demonstrated compassion by publicly holding the hand of her \n     friend and former costar, Rock Hudson, after he had announced \n     that he had AIDS;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor testified before Congress saying, \n     ``It is my hope that history will show that the American \n     people and our leaders met the challenge of AIDS rationally \n     and with all the resources at their disposal, for our sake \n     and that of all humanity.'';\n       Whereas, in 1985, Elizabeth Taylor became the Founding \n     National Chairman for the American Foundation for AIDS \n     Research (commonly known as ``amfAR'');\n       Whereas, in 1991, Elizabeth Taylor founded the Elizabeth \n     Taylor AIDS Foundation to provide direct support to those \n     suffering from the disease;\n       Whereas the extensive efforts of Elizabeth Taylor have \n     helped educate the public and lawmakers about the need for \n     research, treatment, and compassion for those suffering from \n     HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor is survived by her children \n     Michael Wilding, Christopher Wilding, Liza Todd, and Maria \n     Burton, as well as 10 grandchildren and 4 great-\n     grandchildren; and\n       Whereas Elizabeth Taylor was truly a legend who touched the \n     lives of generations of people of the United States and \n     millions worldwide with both her inner and outer beauty: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the courageous, compassionate \n     leadership and many professional accomplishments of Elizabeth \n     Taylor; and\n       (2) offers its deepest condolences to her family.\n\n                              S. Res. 123\n\nCommending ACHIEVA on its 60th anniversary of providing strong advocacy \n for and innovative services to children and adults with disabilities \n     and the families of those children and adults in the State of \n  Pennsylvania and designating the week of March 26 through April 2, \n       2011, as ``Celebrating ACHIEVA's 60th Anniversary Week''.\n\n       Whereas ACHIEVA, formerly known as Arc Allegheny, is the \n     premier provider of lifelong support and advocacy services \n     for children and adults with disabilities and the families of \n     those children and adults in Western Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas more than 10,000 children and adults with \n     disabilities and the families of those children and adults \n     rely on ACHIEVA to provide early intervention, family \n     support, advocacy, respite, vocational, recreational, \n     residential, protective, and future planning services;\n       Whereas the innovative services provided by ACHIEVA have \n     been featured as models and best practices by State, local, \n     and national media and have been replicated nationally and \n     internationally;\n       Whereas the traditional family values espoused by ACHIEVA \n     coupled with the best practice services provided by ACHIEVA \n     propel ACHIEVA to the top tier of organizations providing \n     support for people with disabilities;\n       Whereas ACHIEVA has been the leader in Western Pennsylvania \n     in advocating for and protecting the rights of children and \n     adults with disabilities;\n       Whereas family members of children with disabilities \n     founded ACHIEVA in 1951 as a means of protecting the rights \n     of their sons and daughters to live fulfilling and inclusive \n     lives in their respective communities;\n       Whereas the dreams of the founders of ACHIEVA continue to \n     provide the focused mission and vision that drive all of the \n     work ACHIEVA carries out on behalf of its constituents; and\n       Whereas the dedicated volunteers who have provided \n     organizational leadership to ACHIEVA and the dedicated staff \n     members of ACHIEVA who support children and adults with \n     disabilities and the families of those children and adults \n     also deserve to be honored on the 60th Anniversary of \n     ACHIEVA: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends ACHIEVA on its 60th anniversary of providing \n     strong advocacy for and innovative services to children and \n     adults with disabilities and the families of those children \n     and adults in the State of Pennsylvania; and\n       (2) designates the week of March 26 through April 2, 2011, \n     as ``Celebrating ACHIEVA's 60th Anniversary Week''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/31/senate-section/article/S2060-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 471 AND S. 706\n\n  Mr. REID.
