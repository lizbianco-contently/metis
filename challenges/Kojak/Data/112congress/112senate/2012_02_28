Mr. President, last evening in an hour set aside at the \nrequest of Senators Pryor and Alexander, a very good conversation took \nplace on the Senate floor.\n  Senators Pryor and Alexander are exemplary in trying to work things \nout; they are good legislators because they understand no side gets \ntheir way. I have been here a long time, and I have been fortunate to \nget pieces of legislation passed that I sponsored and worked toward, \nbut I have never ever had a piece of legislation that I introduced that \nwound up with that piece of legislation; always there are changes. That \nis the legislative process.\n  That is what Senator Pryor and Alexander talked about yesterday \nevening. It was important. They talked about the need to bring bills to \nthe floor. They focused on appropriations bills--and rightfully so. I \nam a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee, as is the \nRepublican leader, and we understand the importance of working on these \nbills.\n  In the last number of years, we haven't been able to do individual \nappropriations bills, except on rare occasions. We have done these \nomnibus and minibuses, and we are trying to get away from that. I think \nthe framework\n\n[[Page S1064]]\n\nlaid last night was extremely important.\n  The Republican leader and I have talked individually, personally, \naway from everyone, about the need to get this done for the integrity \nof the Senate, and the colloquy last night helped what I think the \nRepublican leader and I wish to get done. We need the agreement of \nSenate Republicans and Democrats that we will work together to complete \nthis important work, and they talked about appropriations bills.\n\n  Senator Warner and Senator Hagan joined Senator Pryor; Senators \nIsakson, Collins, Boozman, and Graham joined Senator Alexander. So it \nwas a significant number of Senators who talked about wanting to do the \nsame thing and I commend and applaud their work.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend yield for me to make a couple \nobservations on what he just said?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have negotiated the top line for the discretionary \nspending for this coming fiscal year. That process is normally done by \nthe passage of a budget by the House and a budget by the Senate, with \nsome reconciliation between the two bodies on the top line. But we \nalready have that number. I wish to second what my friend the majority \nleader said. There is no good reason for this institution not to move \nforward with an appropriations process that avoids what we have done so \nfrequently under both parties for years and years: either continuing \nresolutions or omnibus appropriations.\n  We have an opportunity to avoid that this year. It is the basic work \nof Congress. I wish to second what the majority leader said and \ncongratulate Senator Alexander and Senator Pryor for their leadership \non this issue. I hope we can join together and do the basic work of \ngovernment this year and do it in a timely fashion.\n  I commend the majority leader and associate myself with his comments.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to Senator Inouye, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. He is beginning, with Senator Cochran, the \nhearing process where administration officials come in and report to \nthe individual appropriations subcommittees.\n  Senator Inouye thinks that, come late April, we can start moving some \nof these bills to the floor. We have to wait until the House does \nsomething because otherwise we get into procedural hurdles. But the \nHouse, I am told, wants to move these quickly also. I hope we can get \nthese bills done.\n  The first real good experience I had in the Senate was working as a \nconferee on individual appropriations bills. That is fun. That is what \nlegislation is all about and we have gotten away from that and I hope \nwe can get back to doing some good things in that regard.\n\n\n                           The Auto Industry\n\n  Mr. President, when President Obama took office 3 years ago, the auto \nindustry was on a life support system. It was in very bad shape. I am \nsorry to say the life support system the Detroit auto industry was \nsurviving on, Republicans wanted to pull the plug.\n  One man who is now seeking the Republican nomination for President of \nthe United States said, ``We should kiss the American automobile \nindustry good-bye.'' We can't make up stuff like that. That is what he \nactually said. He called the death of American auto manufacturers \n``virtually guaranteed.'' ``Virtually guaranteed'' is another direct \nquote. So he argued we should let Detroit go bankrupt. But he wasn't \nalone. If he were alone, that would be a lone wolf crying in the \nwilderness, but that is not the way it was. Republicans in this Chamber \nagreed. Many of them agreed.\n  Democrats, though, weren't willing to give up on American \nmanufacturing because saving the automobile industry wasn't about \nsaving corporations; it was about saving millions of Americans who work \nfor these corporations. It wasn't about saving the people who own race \ncars; it was about saving the people who work on assembly lines making \nthe parts to keep those race cars running.\n  There is no way Democrats would walk away from millions of Americans \nwhose jobs were on the line. Americans working in dealerships and \ndistribution centers and manufacturing plants across the country were \ndepending on us to do something, and we did. We didn't give up the \nfight to save the auto industry. We didn't give up even when one Senate \nRepublican called the efforts ``a road to nowhere.''\n  Here, the verdict is in. We were right. The American auto industry \nhas added 160,000 jobs in the last 24 months alone. Last year, General \nMotors reported record profits and sold more vehicles than any other \ncar company in the world. Chrysler is profitable again. People are \nboasting about the quality of American cars, and Chrysler is growing \nfaster in the United States than any other major automobile \nmanufacturer.\n  So when a Republican Presidential frontrunner said we should kiss the \nAmerican automobile industry goodbye, he couldn't have been more wrong. \nWe all make mistakes. We all get one wrong occasionally. The test of \ncharacter is admitting when we make that mistake, and it is time for \nRepublicans to recognize that saving the American automobile \nmanufacturing industry and millions of middle-class jobs was the right \nthing to do.\n  There is good news from the auto industry: Twenty-four months of \nprivate sector job growth is evidence our country is headed in the \nright direction. But too many Americans are still hurting financially \nand struggling to find work, and it is crucial Congress continue \nefforts to create jobs and rebuild our economy. So Democrats are moving \nforward with a bipartisan package of bills that will spur small \nbusiness growth.\n  These measures will improve innovators' access to capital--that is so \nimportant--and will streamline how companies sell stocks through \ninitial public offerings or, as they are called, IPOs. These pieces of \nlegislation will also protect the rights of investors.\n  Next week, Chairman Johnson, the senior Senator from South Dakota, \nwill hold a Banking Committee hearing on this issue. It will be the \nthird hearing on these measures since December. Senate Democrats have \nbeen working on these measures for a long time, and I am so happy to \nhave read that House Republicans are joining Democrats to move this \nlegislation. Commonsense issues such as these should not have to turn \ninto knock-down, drag-out fights. This is something on which we should \nagree.\n  These companies need the ability to get cash to innovate, to grow, to \nbuild. This legislation that is being promulgated in the Banking \nCommittee and the hearing that takes place there is very important to \nour country. I look forward to moving these measures and our economy \nforward with the help of my Republican colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/28/senate-section/article/S1064-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1064-S1065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past few weeks, the American \npeople have begun to feel the painful effects of President Obama's \nenergy policy.\n  Make no mistake, the rising price of gasoline isn't simply the result \nof forces we can't control. It is, to a large extent, the result of a \nvision this President laid out even before he was elected to office. \nThat vision was on clear display just last week.\n  As millions of Americans groaned at the rising cost of a gallon of \ngasoline, the President took to the microphones to talk about a far-off \nday when Americans might be able to use algae as a substitute for gas. \nThen, dusting off the same talking points Democrats have been using for \ndecades, he claimed there is no short-term solution to the problem.\n  In other words, he kicked the can down the road for another day, \nanother time, abdicating leadership on yet another issue of national \nsignificance.\n  This morning, I think it is worthwhile to take a step back from the \nrhetoric and look at what this President has actually done about this \nproblem and what his energy policies would mean for the future because, \naccording to numerous private and public energy experts, gas prices are \nonly going to keep rising in the weeks and months ahead, going up and \nup. Some say the average price for a gallon of gasoline could hit $4 by \nlate spring, early summer, and could reach $5 or even $6 in some areas \nof our country. When that moment comes, Americans should know what the \nadministration had to do with it.\n\n[[Page S1065]]\n\n  For starters, let's not forget that as a candidate the President \nhimself said he preferred what he called a ``gradual adjustment'' to \ngas prices--in other words, higher prices that went up slowly so people \ndid not feel the pinch quite as acutely. Let's also recall that after \nhis election the President chose an Energy Secretary who said he wanted \ngas prices more in line with those over in Europe, where folks pay \nabout $8 a gallon for gas. That is what they pay for gas over in \nEurope, where the Energy Secretary said we should be looking to \nestablish gas prices. Let's not forget that the President chose as \nInterior Secretary a man who, as a U.S. Senator, objected to increased \noil and gas drilling here at home even if the price of gas exceeded $10 \na gallon--right here on the Senate floor. So no one should be surprised \nat the fact that we are well on the road to European gas prices when \nthe President and the two Cabinet officials he chose to deal with the \nissue are all on record supporting them.\n  Let's be honest, the only problem the President sees in all of this \nis the political blowback he is getting for it, and that is why last \nweek he gave another speech--this time to absolve himself from any of \nthe blame for high gas prices even as he sought to take credit for the \nactions of the private sector and that his predecessors took to \nincrease energy production here at home.\n  It is kind of interesting--the President seems to blame his \npredecessor on a weekly basis for the problems we face today, but when \nhe finds something he likes, he doesn't commend him but claims it as an \nachievement for himself. Yes, oil production is at an alltime high in \nthis country, thanks to the decisions that were made before this \nPresident took office.\n  But let's be very clear about something: The actions of this \nPresident are driving down oil production, and here is how. This \nPresident continues to limit offshore areas of energy production and is \ngranting fewer leases to public land for oil drilling. His \nadministration is imposing regulations that will further drive up the \ncost of gasoline for the consumer. He wants to raise taxes on oil and \ngas--a proposal the Congressional Research Service tells us will \nincrease the price of oil and gas and, by the way, send jobs overseas. \nAnd he alone rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline--a potentially game-\nchanging domestic energy project that promises not only energy \nindependence from Middle Eastern oil but tens of thousands of private \nsector jobs.\n  The President has done all of those things, all the while claiming \nthere are not any silver bullets. The fact is this President's policies \nare designed and intended to drive up energy prices, reduce domestic \noil production, increase our demand on foreign sources of oil, and \ndrive high-paying American jobs overseas. Those are the direct results \nof the policies of this administration. So forget the rhetoric; that is \nthis President's record. It is in perfect keeping with the vision he \nset out at the beginning of his administration. This President will go \nto any length to drive up gas prices and pave the way for his \nideological agenda. That is this President's notion of fairness, that \nstruggling Americans pay more at the pump while their tax dollars go to \nprop up solar companies like Solyndra and the executives who run them \ninto the ground.\n  I do not think it is particularly fair--speaking of fairness--for \npeople who are out there trying to scrape a living together to \nsubsidize bonuses for folks who would not even have a business without \na taxpayer handout. That is not my definition of fairness, but that is \nthe economy this President wants. That is what his policies lead to. \nThat is his vision. So, in my view, reversing this President's \nwrongheaded energy policies is the silver bullet.\n  Look, the President can taunt his critics for suggesting that we \nactually use the resources we have, but I think the American people \nrealize that a President who is out there talking about algae when they \nare having to choose between whether to buy groceries or fill up the \ntank is the one who is out of touch. Americans get this issue. They \nunderstand it fully. They get that we need to increase oil production \nright here at home, not simply by relying on pipedreams--pipedreams \nlike algae--or by wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on more failed \nclean energy projects like Solyndra, especially at a time when we are \nrunning trillion-dollar deficits. We cannot afford it.\n  It is time for the President to join with Republicans and put \nAmerican energy and economic security ahead of his own ideological \nagenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/28/senate-section/article/S1065-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was heartened by the dialog between \nSenators Reid and McConnell this morning, talking about more bipartisan \ncooperation, civility, and cooperation to try to deal with \nappropriations bills. I would like to commend to the Republican leader \nnot just those important issues but the equally important issue of \njudicial nominations. It is no secret that the Senate's process for \nconsidering nominations has deteriorated under the Obama administration \nbecause of resistance from the Republican side of the aisle.\n  It is a long-honored tradition in America that a President of the \nUnited States fills vacancies on the Federal courts with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate. That has been the process since the beginning of \nthis Republic. Yet today we find stacked on our calendar literally 19 \njudicial nominees pending on the Senate floor. Fourteen of these \nnominees were reported from the Judiciary Committee last year, some of \nthem as far back as October. They have been sitting here for months. \nSeventeen of the nominees were reported out of committee with broad \nbipartisan support, 12 of them unanimously. Ten nominees, incidentally, \nare supported by their Republican home State Senators.\n  The bottom line is that judicial nominees with no controversy and \nwith widespread bipartisan approval are being held up on the Senate \ncalendar and not approved. Why? I can tell you why. It is fairly clear. \nIt is part of a strategy that says: If you hold up the judicial \nnominees as long as possible, in comes that moment of the so-\ncalled Thurmond rule or Thurmond tradition. This relates to Senator \nStrom Thurmond of South Carolina, who basically said when we are \nengaged in the depths of a Presidential campaign, the Senate should \nstop approval of judicial nominees.\n\n  There is nothing in the law that requires that. There is certainly \nnothing in the Constitution. In fact, we have in our own way found \nexceptions in the past. But what we are seeing now is an effort by the \nRepublicans to hold up or stop judicial nominees in the hopes that the \npositions will be left vacant through the entire calendar year and \nthen, if they have their way at the polls, a Republican President will \nfill the vacancies a year from now with new nominees. That is crass. It \nis unfair.\n  The men and women who submit their names to be considered as judicial \nnominees go through a rigorous background check at many different \nlevels--first by the Senators who would nominate them, then by the \nWhite House, then the routine examination by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, then once reported to the Senate Judiciary Committee for \nfurther investigation and hearing. Their lives are on hold during this \nprocess. They wait on the Senate. Once they have cleared these hurdles \nand finally reach the calendar, many of them believe they can breathe a \nsigh of relief. A unanimous vote or a strong bipartisan vote in the\n\n[[Page S1066]]\n\nJudiciary Committee used to be a signal of success on the floor. Not \nanymore. At this point they reach the ultimate roadblock: they are \nstopped on the Senate floor by the Republican minority.\n  It is not just unfair to judicial nominees--men and women of quality, \nmany of whom have been proposed by Republican Senators--it is \nfundamentally unfair to our court system. You see, many of these \nnominees are filling vacancies that are absolutely essential.\n  Last week I received a letter from the chief judge of the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois, Judge Jim Holderman. His district is one that has \nbeen declared a judicial emergency, meaning the backlog of cases is \nstacking up and the vacancies need to be filled. He was writing to me \nand Senator Kirk asking that we do everything in our power to move two \nnoncontroversial, strongly supported nominees through the Judiciary \nCommittee. They are moved through. These two, who came through a \nbipartisan process, are now sitting on the Senate calendar. They are \nJohn Lee and Jay Tharp. John Lee is my nominee, and Jay Tharp is \nSenator Kirk's nominee. A bipartisan agreement by a bipartisan \ncommittee has led to their selection. No one has questioned their \nability to serve well on the Federal court.\n  This is what Judge Holderman wrote:\n\n       The vacancies [that they would fill] have been declared \n     judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \n     Courts. More than a thousand cases that would have been \n     addressed by judges in those positions have been delayed. The \n     other judges of the district have worked to resolve these \n     cases as promptly as possible along with our other assigned \n     cases, but we need help. . . .\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Recently, two other active judges [in the Northern \n     District] were in the hospital and remain unable to take new \n     assignments. New civil case filings in our district court \n     have increased. . . .\n\n  Judge Holderman concludes by saying, `` . . . the people of the \nnorthern district of Illinois need your assistance,'' he writes to \nSenator Kirk and myself, and the full Senate should ``promptly confirm \nthe nominees Jay Tharp and John Lee.''\n  This is a classic illustration. Well-qualified individuals, having \ncleared the hurdle, receiving strong bipartisan support in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, are mired down on the Senate calendar. Time after \ntime we see when we can finally spring one of these nominations that \nwill have 80 or 90 votes of Senators who approve it. They are \nnoncontroversial. It is clearly a slowdown strategy, so the other side \nof the aisle, saying their prayers that they can replace President \nObama, will literally leave these vacancies for a year or more in the \nhopes that another President will pick another person. That is unfair \nto the process. It is certainly unfair to the nominees. It is unfair to \nthis system of government where we are shirking our responsibility to \nadvise and consent for critical vacancies to be filled so our Federal \ncourts can operate in the best interests of justice across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/28/senate-section/article/S1066-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1066-S1068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nhis usual articulate and prescient comments about our judicial crisis, \nand that is what we have here in the Senate and in the third branch of \ngovernment.\n  I rise today, along with many of my colleagues, to address a serious \nproblem for which there is an easy solution. We have a crisis in our \nthird independent branch of government, and it is one that only we in \nthe Senate can solve. We can solve it. We need to come together as we \nhave in the past and confirm judges to our article III courts and \ndispense with petty politics and hostage-taking.\n  Let me give just one example of how our process has broken down. In \nDecember, for the second year in a row, my colleagues across the aisle \nrefused to consent to confirm even a single judicial nomination before \nthe end of the Senate session. This senseless rejection of the Senate's \nlongstanding practice of confirming consensus nominees is starting to \ndo real damage to our Federal courts. One out of 10 on the Federal \nbench, 1 out of 10 seats on the Federal bench is currently vacant. \nJudicial vacancies are double, two times what they were at this point \nin President Bush's first term. We have confirmed only 3 judicial \nnominees this session, only 5 in the past 2 months, and only 11 in the \nlast 90 days. And of the three judges we have confirmed this session, \nwe had to file cloture on two of them. This is not a responsible use of \nthe Senate's advice and consent powers; rather, this is a handful of \npeople--plain and simple--using the Senate's procedures to thwart the \nwill of the majority of Americans. The vast majority of Americans want \nus to confirm good, moderate, pragmatic judges to the U.S. district \ncourts. After all, judges on the district court don't make law, they \nfollow law. They are not supposed to make law at all. Courts of appeal \nhave a little more latitude, and, of course, the Supreme Court can make \nlaw, although they are supposed to follow tradition and precedent, and \nthey claim they do. We can discuss that a different day.\n\n  A few outside groups are trying to accomplish in the third branch of \ngovernment what they have been unable to accomplish in the other \nbranches of government by making sure that judges with moderate, \npragmatic credentials don't get confirmed in the hopes they can fill \nthe bench with people who meet their narrow ideology at some point in \nthe future.\n  Now, to be sure, my colleagues have offered a wide variety of reasons \nto explain their inability to consent to votes on district court \njudges. Some have said they are upset about the President's improper \nuse of his recess appointment powers, powers about which five experts \ncan give five different opinions. What that has to do with the judicial \nappointments is beyond me. Some have said they are upset about the \nability to get floor time on something that is not even germane to \njudicial nominations.\n  To hold the third branch of government hostage because they have a \ndifferent beef on a legislative issue is virtually unprecedented, at \nleast certainly to the extent it has been done here. Some have given \ninto terrible, misleading, and sometimes even vicious attacks on \npending nominees. I have seen material circulated by outside groups \nthat appear ready to oppose nominees using any and all tactics. Some of \nthem--not all, not most, but some, and any one is too many--can only be \ndescribed as bigoted. I have seen it. I have seen the letters to our \ncolleagues here in an attempt to pressure them.\n  This behavior needs to be stopped, and it certainly needs to stop \nhaving an effect on any Member in this body. I have seen material that \ntwists a candidate's record beyond all recognition. In fact, just \nbefore recess one group circulated patently inaccurate quotes that were \nsupposed to be from a brief written by now Judge Jesse Furman for a \nclient.\n  I have said time and time again--and I will say once more today--the \nSenate certainly has an obligation to take a hard look at the \nPresident's judicial nominees. My view is that ideology does matter and \nevery Senator here has the right to make sure a President's judicial \nnominees are within the mainstream. I would even admit that some \ndefinitions of mainstream are different from others, but when nominee \nafter nominee--many of whom were reported unanimously out of the \nJudiciary Committee, which has some very conservative as well as some \nvery liberal members--are held up by a handful of people, we are not \ntalking about views outside of the mainstream. We are talking about \nsomething larger and, frankly, less defensible.\n  There will always be nominees, especially to the courts of appeals, \nabout whom we will disagree. There will be those whom some of us view \nas so extreme that we will refuse to give consent to holding an up-or-\ndown vote. But let's be clear; that is not what is going on today.\n  What is going on today is obstruction, plain and simple--obstruction \nagainst anybody, any nominee, and obstruction at unprecedented levels. \nThe total number of Federal circuit and district judges confirmed \nduring the first 3 years of the Obama administration is far less than \nfor previous Presidents. The Senate is more than 40 confirmations \nbehind the pace we set confirming President Bush's nominees between \n2001 and 2004. The sheer amount\n\n[[Page S1067]]\n\nof resistance to President Obama's district court judges indicates the \nlevel of obstruction we are facing.\n  In 3 years President Obama's nominees have received five times as \nmany no votes as President Bush's district court nominees did over 8 \nyears. Isn't that incredible?\n  The proof is in the pudding. The President's nominees for district \ncourt are not out of the mainstream. Almost all of them have logged \nyears in public service or worked in law firms or excelled in other \nways that characterized the nominees of previous Presidents. The issue \nis that the standard has changed. It is no longer, will this judge be \ngood for the country and meet the standards we demand from an article \nIII judge. Now, it is, did I personally approve of this judge; and if I \ndidn't, what can I get by voting for him or her or I am going to block \nthat judge and tie the Senate in a knot so judges only in my narrow \nviewpoint can be appointed, even though the President is of a different \nparty and of a different philosophy, even though the majority of the \nSenate on both sides of the aisle are of a different philosophy. This \nis nothing short of tragic.\n  I implore my colleagues to think about what they are doing. Let's \ncome together, as I know we can, and confirm qualified district court \njudges without further gamesmanship, without further obstruction, and \nwithout the further view: It is my way or the highway, and if I don't \nget my way, I am going to try and cripple 1 out of 10 vacancies and \ncripple the article III branch of government. It is getting close to \nthat.\n  There are emergencies on many circuits. The future of our courts and \neven this body could well depend on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I heard the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, and, obviously, I agree and I \nguess I would like to add my 2 cents to the arguments presented.\n  I am a 19-year member of the Judiciary Committee, so I have had a \nfront-row seat for judicial nominations for a long time. Over 800 \njudges have been confirmed since I came to the Senate.\n  Now, it was not so long ago that liberals and conservatives could \neasily win confirmation as long as they were well qualified, fair-\nminded, and had judicial temperament. They were confirmed. It may even \nsurprise some that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed by a vote \nof 96 to 3, and Justice Antonin Scalia was confirmed 98 to 0. That was \na different time.\n  Today partisanship has stalled even the most uncontroversial judicial \nappointments. Senate Republicans allowed no nominees to be confirmed at \nthe end of the last session and have allowed only five so far this \nyear. In this environment even those reported out of committee by voice \nvote without any controversy are unable to receive a floor vote for \nmany months if they ever receive one at all.\n  Let me give a recent example, a judge I recommended to the President. \nJudge Cathy Bencivengo's nomination to the Southern District of \nCalifornia was approved by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. Yet \nshe waited 4 months for a floor vote. Then she was ultimately confirmed \n90 to 6, showing that there simply was no need to hold up the \nnomination in the first place. This level of obstruction is relatively \nnew and has impeded the confirmation process for both judicial and \nexecutive branch nominees.\n\n  Let's do a quick comparison. Nearly 80 percent of President George W. \nBush's judicial nominees during his first term were confirmed--80 \npercent. In contrast, less than 60 percent of President Obama's \njudicial nominees have been confirmed. As a result, the judicial \nvacancy rate stands at nearly 10 percent. That is double what it was \nwhen President Bush left office.\n  Similarly, during the first session of the 112th Congress, the \nconfirmation rate of President Obama's executive branch appointments \nwas only 51 percent. President George W. Bush and Bill Clinton each had \na confirmation rate of over 70 percent during comparable periods in \ntheir Presidency.\n  So, clearly, there has been a change post-Bush, and I think that is \nwhat we are talking about. This is not good for the judiciary, it is \nnot good for this body, and it is not good as standard operating \npractice of the Senate. It is clear we are seeing a degree of \nobstruction that is unprecedented and that hampers the ability of the \njudicial and executive branches to perform their constitutional \nfunctions. It is preventing us, the legislative branch, from fulfilling \nthe responsibility that we owe to the two other branches of government.\n  In my State we have three nominees, each for positions the judicial \nconference has declared to be judicial emergencies, which means \nextraordinarily heavy caseloads. These should win confirmation without \ndelay.\n  I will give you one: Judge Jacqueline Nguyen, a nominee for the Ninth \nCircuit. She is a remarkable jurist with an impeccable record. She was \nconfirmed to the district court 97 to 0 in 2009. She was approved by \nthe Judiciary Committee for the Ninth Circuit by a bipartisan voice \nvote. Yet her nomination has been pending on the floor for nearly 3 \nmonths. This is an easy one: unanimously passed, has served as a \ndistrict court judge, could be voted for and passed if not by 100 \npercent, very close to it. The Ninth Circuit, which has by far more \npending cases per appellate panel than any other appellate court, needs \nher to be confirmed without further delay.\n  There is a reason for this. I think Republicans don't like some of \nthe appellate courts; therefore, what they try to do, candidly, is keep \nthe positions vacant and hope that after the election there will be a \nRepublican President and they will get their nominees through. Well, \nwhat is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and this is not a \ngood way to handle judicial appointments.\n  Let me give another one: Paul Watford should be confirmed quickly to \nthe Ninth Circuit. He is eminently qualified. He clerked for \nconservative Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski and Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg. He served as a Federal prosecutor, and he has been a \ndistinguished practitioner of appellate law in California for many \nyears. He is uncontroversial. He has been endorsed by the former \npresident of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Federalist Society by \nconservative law professor Eugene Volokh and by the general counsels of \nseveral major corporations that he has represented in appellate cases. \nThe Senate should confirm him without delay.\n  Michael Fitzgerald, a nominee to the Central District of California, \nshould also be confirmed quickly. This is a court that ranks as the \nninth busiest in the Nation in terms of filings per judgeship. Mr. \nFitzgerald is an extraordinarily qualified nominee with 25 years of \nexperience as a Federal prosecutor and as a lawyer in private practice. \nHis nomination was also reported by the Judiciary Committee by a \nbipartisan voice vote. Yet his nomination has been waiting for a vote \non the floor for nearly 4 months. All of this is unnecessary. They \ncould go through by unanimous consent.\n  Now, I understand that some of my Republican colleagues believe \nPresident Obama's recent recess appointments are a reason to delay \nneeded confirmations to overburdened courts around the country. I would \nsimply remind my colleagues of a bit of history and ask them to think \ncarefully about whether they want to go down this very dangerous path.\n  Many will recall that President Bush made two controversial recess \nappointments to the Eleventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit in early \n2004. Like Republicans now, Democrats were upset about the President's \nappointments. Nevertheless, in the months that followed, Democrats \npermitted numerous circuit court and district court nominees to be \nconfirmed. The Senate continued to act on such nominees until September \nof 2004--2 months before the Presidential election.\n  So I say to my colleagues--and say this respectfully--take a step \nback. Do not obstruct every judicial nomination from this President. \nOur judicial system depends on a Senate willing to do its \nconstitutional duty and provide advice and consent on judicial \nnominees. Most pending nominees are well-qualified, consensus choices \nfor courts that urgently need them to begin their service. We should \nconfirm them without delay.\n  Our job is to vote. Our job is not to obstruct, to delay. It is to \nvote. We\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\nfunction on a majority system. If you do not think someone is \nqualified, if you do not believe they have the judicial temperament, if \nyou do not believe they have enough experience, if you do not like them \nfor any reason, vote no. That is entirely within the prerogative of a \nSenator. But to hold them up, despite judicial emergencies, despite \nhigh caseloads, is to impact the system of justice.\n  I think this 10-percent vacancy factor now indicates that the \ncondition of justice is, in fact, being affected throughout our \ncountry, particularly in the Ninth Circuit and in California as well as \nin many other States.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Feinstein). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today to continue to address an \nissue which I have just had the joy of hearing the Presiding Officer \nand the Senators from New York and Illinois speak to, and that concern \nI raise today is the ongoing crisis in our courts, the nearly 10-\npercent vacancy rate in judicial positions all across the United \nStates.\n  I rise today as the junior Senator from Delaware but also as a member \nof the Delaware Bar and as a former Federal court clerk, and as someone \nwho has, I think, a personal sense, from that experience and my service \non the Judiciary Committee, of the consequences of these delays--the \nconsequences of steadily climbing caseloads, significant judicial \nvacancies, judicial emergencies in districts across our great country, \nincluding in the State of California, and what that means for people, \nfor companies, for communities for whom justice is being delayed and \nthus denied.\n  Earlier this month I attended the investiture ceremony of Judge \nRichard Andrews who was sworn into the U.S. District Court for \nDelaware. This is the first time in 6 years the very busy District \nCourt of Delaware has had a full complement of district court judges.\n  Although I am relieved and the people of Delaware are grateful to \nhave a full bench, and although Judge Andrews is an extremely talented \nlawyer and a devoted public servant and utterly nonpartisan--just the \nsort of district court nominee about whom the Presiding Officer just \nspoke--his nomination took nearly 6 months to be confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  I am glad Judge Andrews has made it through because in the Senate the \nconfirmation process seems to be more broken this year than last. When \nI joined the Senate in 2010, judicial nominations had slowed to a \ncrawl. I watched with dismay as folks whom I viewed as highly qualified \nwere blocked.\n  Goodwin Liu, for example--a brilliant and qualified legal scholar, a \nnominee twice to the Ninth Circuit--could not overcome a GOP \nfilibuster, in part payback for a view, I believe, on the other side of \nthe aisle of the rough handling of Miguel Estrada, whose nomination was \ndefeated during the Bush Presidency.\n  What I have been most concerned about as a freshman Senator is how \nthe history lying about this Chamber seems to steadily pile up session \nafter session, and the process seems to be weighed down by this burden \nof history.\n  But next, Caitlin Halligan--an extremely competent attorney without a \nsingle partisan blemish on her record--was nominated to the DC Circuit, \nand her nomination, in my view, was also blocked based on a grotesque \nmisrepresentation of her actual record. The major talking point against \nher nomination, if I recall right, was that the DC Circuit already had \nmore than enough judges.\n  Judge Halligan would have been the 9th judge on that court. Notably, \nall the GOP Members who spoke against her had no qualms when the Senate \nconfirmed the 10th and 11th judges to sit on that very same circuit \nduring the Bush nomination period. But I think these sorts of fine \npoints of history are lost on the people, the communities, and the \ncompanies across our Nation who go to the courthouse seeking justice \nand find none.\n  In 2012, as some of the previous Senators have stated, we have so far \nconfirmed just five judges. Today, there are 19 nominees on the floor, \n12 of whom came out of our Judiciary Committee unanimously, who are now \nlanguishing on our Executive Calendar. Republicans have not stated \nobjection to these nominees but refuse to grant consent for a vote to \nbe scheduled.\n  President Obama's nominees have waited four times longer after \ncommittee approval than did President Bush's nominees at this point in \nhis first term, and the Senate is more than 40 confirmations behind the \npace set during the Bush administration.\n  It is not just judges who have been the subject of this ongoing \nweighting down. The Executive Calendar, which I have the privilege to \nflip through every time I preside, is filled with nominees for \nvacancies in every major department and in every major independent \nagency in this government. It is more than a dozen pages long of \nnominations that have sat for months and months.\n  Last month, in response to the Republican obstructionism in moving \nthis Executive Calendar and in filling these administrative vacancies, \nPresident Obama made recess appointments: the Consumer Financial \nProtection chief, Richard Cordray, and members of the National Labor \nRelations Board. Some of us on both sides of the aisle do agree that \nCongress, and not the President, has the right to declare when the \nSenate is in recess. But whatever one's view of these appointments, \nthere is no questioning that in either case, Republicans forced the \nissue through their unprecedented refusal to vote the President's \nnominees up or down and allow him to proceed with the progress of our \nNation.\n  As Senators, we have a responsibility to advise the President as to \nhis nominations and, where we agree, to consent; where we do not, each \nof us is free to vote no. Some Senators have suggested they will oppose \nall nominations in opposition to the President's recess appointments. \nIn my opinion, a pledge to oppose all nominations is a pledge not to do \nhis or her job. In my view, we ought not to make such a pledge. In my \nview, while so many Americans are out of work, and so many of us are \nhere on the public payroll, we can, we should, and we must move forward \nwith the judicial nominees.\n\n  This morning, this session began with a very encouraging moment of \nharmony between the majority leader and the Republican leader on the \nconcept of moving ahead with appropriations. It is my hope and prayer \nwe will do the same on judicial nominations as well.\n  I call upon my colleagues on the other side to rethink this strategy \nof obstruction at all costs because it is the American people who pay \nthe price in the end.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/28/senate-section/article/S1068-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I think it is obvious all around our \ncountry that Americans are struggling right now with gasoline prices. \nThe average American family spent more than $4,000 on gasoline last \nyear, and it will be more this year, with the additional devastating \nprice increases we are seeing now that will wreak havoc on our economy.\n  The national average price of a gallon of gasoline has gone up every \nsingle day for the last 3 weeks. In many parts of our country, prices \nat the pump are around $4 a gallon. But instead of encouraging an \n``all-of-the-above'' approach, which the administration has said it is \ndoing, the administration, instead, has been frustrating every domestic \nsource of energy production that does not conform to a narrow view of \nalternative fuels.\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\n  The President is opposed to increased drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Reserve and opening additional areas of the Outer Continental \nShelf off the Alaskan coast.\n  The people of Alaska have voted to support the ANWR drilling because \nthey know ANWR is an area that is the size, approximately, of the State \nof South Carolina, and the part that would be drilled is approximately \nthe size of Washington National Airport. So they know this would be \ngood jobs for Alaska, and it would not harm the environment at all \nbecause the drilling area is so very small in this vast wildlife \nreserve.\n  The President has also restricted drilling on Federal lands, opposes \nthe development of shale gas and coal, and will not open additional \nareas of the Outer Continental Shelf in the lower 48 States. Even \nthough some State legislatures, such as Virginia, have said they would \nlike to do it, the President has shut that down.\n  The President opposes further drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and \nnuclear energy is also now on the list, I guess, of moratoria. He has \nrejected the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  What the President does favor is the Saudis increasing oil production \nand increased use of solar, wind, and algae at home.\n  Does that substitute for an energy policy? Is that something \nAmericans can count on to increase the supply of energy in our country?\n  Last week, the President said: We cannot drill our way to lower gas \nprices. This statement is inaccurate. Increased domestic production \nwill go a long way toward stabilizing gas prices. Why does this \nPresident want to turn his back on critical sources of domestic energy \nwhich seems incomprehensible to anyone looking at this issue?\n  So I have colleagues on the Senate floor who come from different \nStates--States where unemployment is high and people are looking for \njobs and looking for alternatives.\n  I would like to turn to the Senator from the great State of Missouri, \nMr. Blunt, and ask the Senator from Missouri if he has a view. Is he \nhearing from his constituents in Missouri?\n  Mr. BLUNT. Well, I do. I think I will quickly yield to my good friend \nfrom Ohio and then speak again.\n  Actually, I just met with disabled veterans who are here in town \ntoday. I told them I was going to be talking about energy, and they \nsaid the long-term effort of the Veterans' Administration to get \nveterans to their health care appointments is dramatically impacted by \nthese high gas prices--just like for veterans and retirees of all kinds \nwith the number of dollars going into their gas tanks.\n  As they see the price of that tank of gas go up $10, maybe they \ndecide: I am going to have to quit because that is all the money I have \nwith me or I am going to fill up the tank and see it go to $40, $50, \n$60.\n  As families look at that, as retirees look at that, as veterans look \nat that, they have got to be thinking as that gas tank number changes, \nsomething else they were going to do that week is something they are \nnot going to be able to do. This has dramatic impact on families; it \nhas dramatic impact on the way we live; it has dramatic impact on the \nconfidence people have in our economy.\n  If you look at any charts of gas prices going up, you see consumer \nconfidence going down. It happens in States such as the Senator's or in \nStates in the middle of the country such as Missouri or Senator \nPortman's State of Ohio. I know we have all been home. I am sure you \ncannot have been home and not have heard a lot about gas prices.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. The Senator is absolutely right. I say to my colleagues \nfrom Texas and Missouri, they are right on in terms of the impact on \nOhio families. I was home last week. In fact, I drove from Ohio to \nWashington last night. I had to fill up a couple of times on the way, \nand the price was over $3.70 a gallon. According to AAA, the average \nprice now is over $2.70 a gallon.\n  This is impacting families. I have met with people who were in the \ntrucking business and small operators who are trying to make ends meet. \nThey are saying: Rob, I do not know how this is going to work because \nour gas prices keep going up at a time when our expenses are going up \nas well. They are getting squeezed out. Of course, higher prices for \ngas affect all of us as families, they affect everything we buy, \nbecause that cost is embedded there. So this is hurting our economy in \nvery fundamental ways.\n  Record levels for this time of year. This is not just a seasonal \nissue. This is a longer term failure of an energy policy by the Obama \nadministration. That is something we all need to focus on, not to just \nbe critical of bad policies which have gotten us here, but how do we \nget out of it? What do we do? That is what I wish to talk about for a \nminute today.\n  Let me give you a couple of interesting numbers. The price of gas has \nincreased by 94 percent in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, during the Obama \nadministration. So you are talking about almost a 100-hundred percent \nincrease in the cost of gasoline.\n  There was an all-time high last year of $2.53 a gallon, and again \nover $3.70 this year already. By the way, last year the average amount \nspent by a family in America for gasoline at the pump--over $4,000. So \nthis is a big part of people's budgets. We have been hit hard. At a \ntime when millions of Americans are struggling amid a continuing weak \neconomy, it is particularly tough because budgets are already stretched \nthin.\n  We need to produce more, in my view. If you produce more, you are \ngoing to see prices come down. It is sort of the basic law of supply \nand demand. So right now we have demand around the world maybe picking \nup a little bit, and yet we are not producing as much as we should be. \nAnd, frankly, we are producing less than we have.\n  Let me give you some interesting numbers here that actually surprised \nme in terms of what the President is saying versus the facts. The \nPresident says we are producing more than we have in the past. The \nproduction of natural gas on public lands and waters went down 11 \npercent last year; decline in oil production, 14 percent. In the Gulf \nof Mexico, there was a 17-percent drop from 618 million barrels in 2010 \nto 514 in 2011.\n  The Senator from Texas talked about this. We are not seeing an \nincrease; we are seeing a decrease. This is at a time when all of us, I \nhope, realize that we have to be focused on producing more here at \nhome, one, so we can get prices down, and, two, so we can get less \ndependent on these dangerous and volatile parts of the world. If we do \nnot do that, we are going to be subject to what happens in Libya or \nIran and see gas prices spike up as we are seeing now. We have got to \nproduce more and we have got to produce it here at home to get away \nfrom the OPEC cartel. Washington wastes time by not acting now to \nimmediately expand that production.\n  The White House says you cannot immediately expand production because \nit takes some time. Well, all the more reason to get started with it, \nas the Senator from Texas has said. If we had started a few years ago, \nwe would be in much better shape. But also the price of gasoline \nreflects what people think it is going to be in the future. So even if \nwe made a commitment today to get busy on more domestic production, oil \nand natural gas, it would affect the price because it would affect what \nfolks are thinking about what the future prices are going to be.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would the Senator from Ohio yield.\n  I think the Senator from Ohio is making such a good point, because \nhere the President is saying producing more will not lower prices. Does \nthat seem like the fundamental supply-and-demand explanation that most \neconomists have adopted in our country, that if you supply more the \nprice will go down? Does not that seem like a non sequitur?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. It does. I think most people get it. Because even if you \ndo not have a degree in economics, and I do not, we understand the law \nof supply and demand works. So if you are going to cut the supply, as \nhas happened, you are going to see prices go up.\n  Let me give you an example. In 2010, the President cancelled leases \nin the Gulf of Mexico and the Mid-Atlantic. In 2011, he put forward a \n5-year lease plan that reinstitutes a moratorium in the Atlantic, \nPacific, halves the number of lease sales in the old plan. So, again, \nif supply is going down, you are likely to see prices go up. That is \nexactly what\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\nhas happened. He slowed down permits for deepwater and shallow water \ndrilling in the gulf. He is now set to impose severe new regulations on \noil refiners. That is going to further raise prices.\n  Speaking of oil refineries, that is a big part of the cost of \ngasoline. About 11 percent of the cost, according to the American \nPetroleum Institute, of the price of gasoline comes from refining. By \nputting more and more regulations and costs on refining, you are going \nto have an impact on prices as well that is negative and hurting our \nfamilies.\n  The EPA, the cap-and-trade regime, did not get through the Congress. \nSo they are moving ahead through regulations, causing a lot of \nuncertainty, a lack of construction of refineries. The first new \nrefinery in a generation, in fact, has been delayed because of it.\n  This actually brings us to the second problem, I say to my colleagues \nfrom Missouri and Texas. This is not just about gas prices, as \nimportant as that is; it is about jobs. Because by stopping the \nconstruction of a refinery, we are putting new regulations on not \nallowing the kind of drilling we want to do in the State of Ohio to \nbring jobs, and you are hurting the very jobs Americans need to be able \nto pay their gas bill. These are good-paying jobs. They tend to be jobs \nthat pay well, have good benefits. So a progrowth energy strategy does \nnot just result in a more secure energy source, more reliable energy, \nit also results in more jobs, which we need desperately.\n\n  The President seems to be saying he is going to reverse course. In \nhis State of the Union Address, he says he is for an all-of-the-above \nstrategy. By the way, a week after that, do you know what he did? He \nrejected the Keystone XL Pipeline, which--talk about all of the above--\nwe certainly should be from our strong ally to the North getting oil we \nneed for our refineries to get the cost down.\n  By the way, that pipeline also picks up American oil. I bet you that \nour colleague from North Dakota is going to talk about that in a little \nwhile, because he has been Governor of North Dakota and understands the \nimportance of the Keystone XL Pipeline. So whether it is the offshore \ndrilling we talked about, moving ahead with drilling onshore, and \nexploration that can help create jobs and energy security, whether it \nis the Keystone XL Pipeline, whether, as I talked about in terms of the \nregulations on our refineries, there are things we can do and should do \nand do immediately, if we do these things to have more domestic energy \nproduction, yes, we will begin to see these prices go down and \nstabilize.\n  I come from Ohio. As the Senator from Missouri said, we have a \ntradition of producing oil and gas. It goes back to the turn of the \ncentury, the last century. Then we kind of got away from it for a while \nand people in Texas started producing a lot more oil and gas. We are \nback in the business, thanks to these shale finds. The Marcellus \nshale--it is the Utica shale, it is natural gas. But it is also oil and \nwhat they call wet gas, which is very valuable.\n  I will tell you, having spent a lot of time in eastern Ohio over the \nlast several days, people are excited about this. It is bringing back \ngood-paying jobs, allowing people to stay in these communities and be \nable to raise their families with not just a living wage but real hope \nfor the future.\n  It also will have an effect on our gas prices. We have an \nopportunity, before things get worse, to come up with a different \nsolution, a sensible national energy policy that stops our dangerous \ndependence on foreign oil and leads to more domestic production and \ntherefore prices we can afford at the pump.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to say to the Senator from Ohio that I am very \npleased Ohio is getting back into the drilling business. That is \ncreating jobs in a State that I know has had high unemployment. It is \nso clearly in America's best interests to have our people working.\n  And, of course, the Keystone Pipeline, which our colleague from North \nDakota is going to talk about in a few minutes, is the perfect place to \ncreate jobs; instant jobs with not one dime of taxpayer dollars. This \nwould be private dollars invested in a pipeline that would bring oil \nfrom our friends in Canada all the way through the United States to the \nrefineries in Texas, which it is estimated would produce 830,000 \nbarrels of oil into gasoline a day--a day. Think of what that would do \nto the price.\n  The Secretary of Energy has actually made the statement that we want \ngasoline prices to increase along the lines of Europe. Oh, really? I \nwish to ask my friend from Missouri, how would the working people in \nhis State feel about $8 or $9 per gallon, which is what they pay in \nEurope, as a cost at the pump? What would that do to the economy of \nMissouri? What would that do to the unemployment in Missouri?\n  Mr. BLUNT. I was asked the other day when I was home: Does the \nadministration have a plan? I said: Well, if you listen to what they \nsay, this is their plan, for these gas prices to go up. We are not \nEurope. In spite of what the Secretary of Energy may have said the \nmonth before he was named as Secretary, that our big problem was our \ngas was not as high as gasoline in Europe, that was, according to him, \nour big problem.\n  The President who appointed him said a few weeks before that, at the \nSan Francisco Chronicle editorial board: Under my energy policies, \nenergy prices will skyrocket. So apparently they are well along on the \nplan.\n  As I mentioned a couple of times already, gasoline is twice as high \nas it was in January of 2009. We are not Europe. We are a big country \nthat is dependent on transportation. We drive farther to go to work \nthan most Europeans do. We transport our goods more than most Europeans \ndo. We have this big agricultural economy that feeds a whole lot of the \nworld and only works with affordable energy.\n  There are two points both Senators have made that I wish to drive \nhome. One is that more American energy means more American jobs, and \nnot just the jobs to build something such as the Keystone Pipeline but \nalso the jobs at the refinery when that 800,000 barrels of oil a day \ngets to our refinery. They are American workers running that refinery.\n  If our economy is prosperous, there are more people working in \nmanufacturing and transportation and all of the things that we do for a \nliving. The shortest path to more American jobs is more American \nenergy. We should be working on that, and then the impact on families. \nYou know, as families see what is happening at the gas pump, as I said \nearlier, they give up on other things they would hope to do.\n  The President said at the State of the Union that he was for an all-\nof-the-above strategy. Apparently the regulators do not know about \nthis. The regulators the President has appointed seem to have no clue \nthat the all-of-the-above strategy of coal, of natural gas, of oil, \nneeds to be part of what we are doing as we invest in the future.\n  Nobody is opposed to looking for what comes next after fossil fuel. \nThe concern is we are not there. Even if we knew we were going there, \nwe would not get there for a long time. Even if we knew what would \npower our cars 30 years from now, most cars 20 or 25 years from now \nwill still be pulling up to a gas pump. Most trucks will still be \npulling up to a gas pump.\n  Frankly, the economy could not absorb it any other way. And we do not \nknow yet what is the likely next thing. I am for seeing us invest in \nthat. I am for conservation so we use our energy more wisely. But let \nme say, the poorest people are the last ones who get the new high-\nmileage vehicles or the energy-efficient refrigerator or the new \nwindows. Retired Americans, Americans struggling to get by, are going \nto be the last people to benefit, in most cases, from those ideas.\n  Let's conserve our way out of this or let's price our way out of \nthis. More American energy is good for us. Energy from our friend and \nnext-door neighbor is the next best thing to energy we produce \nourselves. We ought to do all we can to produce all the competitive \nenergy we can on our own. We then ought to do all we can to encourage \nour closest trading partner, our most equitable trading partner. When \nwe send them a dollar, they send us almost a dollar back every single \ntime. Regarding energy security, the odds that we are going to have a \nproblem with our Canadian neighbor are a lot less than the odds that \nsomething will happen in the Middle East that will be a problem for us. \nBecause of these new finds in gas shale, oil shale, tar sands, and \nother things, we can now use small\n\n[[Page S1071]]\n\nplatforms to access it that would not be disruptive in a significant \nway; a small drilling platform doesn't do that.\n  I thank our good friend, Senator Hutchison from Texas, for putting \nthis discussion together and for being such a leader on energy issues. \nSenator Hoeven, when he was Governor, saw what could happen in the \neconomy of a State when we decide we are going to make the most of our \nnatural resources. The economy of North Dakota changed dramatically \nwhile he was Governor because it became an energy producer and is now \none of the biggest energy producers in our country. He wants to talk \nabout the Keystone Pipeline, and I wish to hear that if the Senator is \nready. We can go back to the Senator from Texas, and then we will hear \nfrom Senator Hoeven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nthe point he made about trading with Canada, our ally and closest \nneighbor, our biggest trading partner, as opposed to having Canada ship \nthe oil they are now producing in the Alberta sands over to China or \nover someplace else, and sometimes it would be shipped back in or we \nwould be taking oil from the Middle East, and all the things that can \nhappen when oil is being shipped from the Middle East to America are \nrisks we would have to take.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, if I may make a final point. Every other \ncountry in the world looks at its natural resources, and the first two \nwords they think of are ``economic advantage'' or ``economic \nopportunity.'' That is what the Canadians are doing. Only in the United \nStates do we have any significant number of leaders who look at our \nnatural resources, and the first words they think of are \n``environmental hazard'' and ``what is the worst thing that could \nhappen?'' And ``what if that happened every day?''\n  The Canadian Prime Minister was in China just in the last month \ntalking about selling their oil to the Chinese, who want to buy it. \nThat is what the Canadians should be doing. They would prefer to sell \nit to us. We should buy it. But they are not going to decide that if \nour most logical partner doesn't want it, we will just let our economy \nsuffer and not do anything with it. Nobody else looks at energy \nresources that way. We should not either, and we should not expect the \nCanadians to do that.\n  That pipeline is either going to go south to our refinery or west to \nthe coast, where they will ship that oil to Asia. We should not let \nthat happen. They don't want it to happen. We should not be upset with \nthem if we will not buy it and they decide they are going to benefit \nfrom their own resources, as they should.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator makes the exact right point. Of course, \nthey should look for markets so their people can be employed. The folly \nis that America would not be the logical place to say, yes, we want it, \nof course. Let me give a statistic, and I will ask the Senator from \nNorth Dakota his opinion. Frankly, he has been the leader in the Senate \nto try to get the Keystone Pipeline approved by the State Department \nand the White House. He has been the leader. I was amazed just \nyesterday that the White House did a kind of a double backflip with a \ntwist. The Wall Street Journal said it best: ``Obama's Keystone \nJujitsu.'' What the administration did, in a mind-numbing kind of \nlogic, was say: We said no after more than 3 years of environmental \nstudies that all approved the Keystone Pipeline coming from Canada down \nthrough Oklahoma and into the refineries in Texas. Instead of approving \nit after more than 3 years of good environmental studies that came out \npositive, the President said no.\n  But yesterday, the President said: We will approve and say it is a \ngood idea to do the pipeline from Oklahoma down to Texas. That is not \nbad; it is great to have that, but the problem is, if we do the 830,000 \nbarrels a day that would come from Canada all the way down to the \nrefineries in Texas, it would produce 34 million gallons of oil a day, \nor the equivalent of more than 16 million gallons of gasoline.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota, who could be bypassed with this \nnew plan, how is that going to affect the rest of America--not the \nAmerica between Oklahoma and Texas but the rest of America, including \nthe State of North Dakota? Why would he think the President would think \nthat is a solution?\n  I wish to make sure the Senator has up to 10 minutes, so I ask \nunanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for up to 10 \nminutes. I ask him, how on Earth does this affect the price of gasoline \nwhen we could be putting 34 million gallons of oil, or more than 16 \nmillion gallons of gasoline a day into people's tanks? How could the \nPresident say that would not lower the price?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \norganizing this colloquy with the Senator from Missouri and the Senator \nfrom Ohio on this very important issue.\n  We have our American consumers paying more than $3.70 at the pump \ntoday. Actually, today the price is $3.72. That is the right question \nbecause that hits every single American. As the Senator from Texas and \nthe other Senators have pointed out, when the administration took \noffice, the price of gasoline per gallon was about $1.85. Today, it is \n$3.70. Actually, again, this chart is already old; today the average \nprice is $3.72. In some places, it is already well over $4. The \nprojection is that by Memorial Day, gasoline will be $4 a gallon and by \nlater this summer it could be as much as $5 a gallon.\n  Let's put that into perspective for just a minute, following up on \nthe question by the Senator from Texas. Recently, the President wanted \na payroll tax cut, and the Congress passed that payroll tax cut. As the \nPresident liked to point out, that was about $1,000 a year. The benefit \nof that payroll tax averaged about $1,000 a year for the American \nworker or about $40 a paycheck. People get a paycheck every week, so it \nwould be $40 a paycheck for the average working American. That is about \n$20 a week.\n\n  When we are paying between $4 and $5 a gallon for gas at the pump, we \nmore than pay that additional $20 we got in that payroll tax, don't we? \nIn other words, it costs us more than that. In essence, we have gone \nback because of the high price of gasoline.\n  What is the administration doing? As the Senator from Missouri just \npointed out, the administration has an all-of-the-above strategy. What \nis that? That means we produce more energy from all our resources--oil, \ngas, biofuels, solar, wind, nuclear, and biomass. I agree with that. We \nshould produce all our energy resources and have an all-of-the-above \nstrategy. The problem is the administration is saying that, but they \nare not doing it. They are saying we should have an all-of-the-above \nstrategy, but they are not doing it. Not only are they not doing it, \nthey are actually blocking oil and gas development in our country, and \nthey are blocking our ability to get oil from our closest ally and \ntrading partner, Canada.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline, which they have turned down, is a great \nexample of that. That is 830,000 barrels a day that we are not getting \nfrom Canada, because after 3\\1/2\\ years of study, the administration \nturned down the project. The Keystone XL Pipeline and projects similar \nto it are very important parts of the solution. We still get 30 percent \nof our crude from the Middle East and Venezuela. Oil prices are going \nup because of instability in the Middle East. That creates a risk \npremium to the price of gasoline, which we could reduce substantially \nby producing more oil and gas here at home and with our closest friend \nand trading partner, Canada.\n  Ironically, the President wanted a payroll tax cut to stimulate our \neconomy, he said, and to help the American worker. Then he more than \ntakes away any benefit from that payroll tax cut by blocking our \nability to develop oil and gas in this country and to get oil from \nCanada. In my State of North Dakota, not only can we not get our oil to \nmarket because we cannot put it into the Keystone XL Pipeline and get \nit to refineries, we cannot get the oil from Canada either, and our \nconsumers, working Americans, pay the price at the pump. Why would the \nadministration do that? Why?\n  I think some insight is provided by Ted Turner's letter on the CNN \nWeb site. He has a letter on that Web site,\n\n[[Page S1072]]\n\nand everyone can check it out. Mr. Turner cites a number of arguments \nas to why we should not get oil from Canada. First, he says: That oil \nwe get from Canada--we will just export it, so it will not reduce gas \nprices in the United States. But in a recent Department of Energy \nreport, dated June 22, 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy says just \nthe opposite; that the crude we bring in from Canada will be refined in \nthe United States, and it will lower gas prices in the United States on \nthe east coast, the gulf coast, and in the Midwest--not ``may'' reduce \ngas prices but ``will'' reduce them on the east coast, the gulf coast, \nand in the Midwest. Mr. Turner's letter says the pipeline will leak \nand, gee, we don't want a pipeline that leaks.\n  As my second chart shows, this is the second Keystone Pipeline. This \nfirst Keystone Pipeline has already been built. He says that Keystone \nPipeline leaked, so we cannot build a second one. The first one had no \nunderground leaks. The leaks he refers to were minor leaks at some of \nthe joints as they constructed the thing, which is normal and they were \nquickly and readily handled and they were no problem. That is \nfunctioning today just fine, and there are no underground leaks. So \nthat is not accurate either, is it?\n  As a matter of fact, let's take a look at this chart. Those are not \nthe only two pipelines we have in the United States. There are others. \nWe have thousands of oil and gas pipelines across the country. But \nsomehow building one more that will bring in 830,000 barrels a day to \nhelp reduce the price of gas is a problem. Really? That doesn't make \nmuch sense.\n  The other argument he uses is that we are producing that oil in \nCanada in the oil sands, and that is not good because we have to \nexcavate to do it. What is the reality with producing oil sands? It \ndoes have somewhat higher greenhouse gas emissions. How much? About 6 \npercent. That is how much more greenhouse gas emission we get. But we \nare moving from excavating to produce that oil and gas to in situ. In \nsitu is drilling just like we do for conventional oil. That means the \nsame amount of greenhouse gas, the same footprint. Eighty percent is in \nsitu. It has the same amount of greenhouse gas. We have deployed new \ntechnologies and produce more energy and do it with better \nenvironmental stewardship. So these arguments aren't accurate.\n\n  But the reality is this: Folks like Mr. Turner, rich and famous, I \nguess they can pay $4 for gasoline. They can pay $5 for gasoline or a \nlot more. That isn't a problem for them. The problem is for hard-\nworking Americans who have to pay that price at the pump every single \nday. So the administration has to decide who they are going to side \nwith on this issue. Who are they going to side with on this issue? Are \nthey going to continue to side with, I guess rich and powerful \ninterests that want to see those gasoline prices go higher, and for \nwhom the price of gasoline at the pump really isn't an issue or with \nhard-working Americans for whom this creates real hardship? That is the \nissue we have here with this vote that we will be having on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  The reality is this: We can have North American energy security. We \ncan do it. Right now, between Canada and the United States, with some \nhelp from Mexico, we produce about 70 percent of our crude. The \nKeystone XL project alone would take us up over 75 percent. And with \nother sources, which some of my colleagues have referred to, such as \nshale and the in situ drilling I have talked about, we can easily meet \nour needs. In fact, if we include the work we are doing with natural \ngas, with biofuels, and with energy efficiency, I believe we can truly \nhave North American energy security--meaning we can supply the energy \nneeds in the United States and North America, with our friends in \nCanada, within 5 to 7 years. But we have to get started. We have to get \nstarted.\n  So let's get started, Mr. President. Let's start by approving the \nKeystone XL Pipeline project. Let's show the world we are serious about \ngetting this done. Asking the Saudis for more oil, as some of my \ncolleagues have done, doesn't solve the problem. Nor does taking oil \nout of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That doesn't solve the problem. \nWe solve the problem by truly producing all of the above--not saying it \nbut doing it.\n  It is ironic the administration praises TransCanada for moving \nforward on building the only portion of this pipeline they can build \nwithout a Presidential permit. He praises them for moving forward at \nthe very time the administration is blocking the project. And while \nthey are blocking it, that means not one more drop of oil is coming \ninto this country from Canada, not one more drop of oil is coming from \nmy State of North Dakota down to the refineries to help reduce the \nprice of gasoline at the pump. That is not an all-of-the-above energy \npolicy. That is not helping American workers. And that is exactly why \ngasoline is $3.70 a gallon and going higher.\n  It is time for Congress to act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/28/senate-section/article/S1072-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1072-S1073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SURFACE TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. First, let me express my disappointment that we are not \nhere debating the surface transportation reauthorization bill. We had a \nbill that came out of the Environment and Public Works Committee and \ncame out of several other of our committees by unanimous vote, so it is \na bipartisan bill. It is a bill that will save jobs and create jobs \nhere in America. It will reinvest in our own infrastructure to make \nAmerica more competitive. And, as I said, it has been done in a \nbipartisan manner thanks to the hard work of many people.\n  I see Senator Boxer on the floor. Thanks to her incredible \nleadership, we have an agreed path forward from the point of view of \nthe relevant amendments. So what is holding up the process? It is these \namendments that have absolutely nothing to do with the transportation \nprograms of this country. We are talking about policy in Egypt, which \nhas nothing to do with our transportation needs. I would start by \nsaying how disappointed I am that we haven't yet started the real \ndebate on our transportation reauthorization bill which will create \njobs, save jobs, modernize America, and make us more competitive.\n  Let me yield for a moment, if I could, to my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend would yield for a question and keep the \nfloor--and I ask unanimous consent that the time for this colloquy not \nbe taken off his time, or does he have unlimited time?\n  Mr. CARDIN. It is 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, let me say thank you to my friend. I know he is \nhere to talk about judges, which is a critical issue. I am very happy \nhe is going to do that. The lack of action on these qualified nominees \nis hurting our people.\n  But I wanted to thank him for his comments. The Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Cardin, is a senior member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and has worked so hard, along with our invaluable \nstaff, and provided an invaluable contribution to the Transportation \nbill. I guess the question I will get to is this one: With 2.8 million \njobs on the line--that is 1.8 million jobs we have currently attached \nto a highway bill and then an additional 1 million jobs which will be \ncreated because of some of the work we did on TIFIA to leverage the \njobs--does not my friend believe this is the time to move a jobs bill, \nwhen we are in the process of seeing this economy finally turn around? \nThe turnaround is not as fast as we want, but does my friend believe \nthe timing of this couldn't be better; and that if we pass this bill, \nwhich is so bipartisan, it will kick this economic recovery into higher \ngear?\n  Mr. CARDIN. The Senator is absolutely correct. We need more jobs in \nAmerica. I congratulate the Obama administration for turning our \neconomy around. We have had 23 consecutive months of private sector job \ngrowth, but we don't have enough jobs yet. We have to create more jobs. \nNow is the time to be bold on looking for responsible programs that can \nmove this country forward and creating more jobs, not only initially in \nroad construction, in bridge construction and transit construction, but \nmaking us more competitive for the future and creating permanent \njob growth for America, jobs that cannot be exported.\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\nThat is what we should be doing, and that is why the surface \ntransportation bill is so important for us to bring up and debate and \npass.\n\n  And, quite frankly, the Senator from California had performed \nsomething unprecedented--well, not unprecedented but unusual here--in \nthat she got bipartisan support from three committees, and we are \nworking on the fourth now. Senator Boxer has gotten all the committees \ntogether, and so it is time to move this bill forward for jobs \nthroughout America.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My very last question. I hope my friend is aware that \nright now the leadership is working very hard to take this very \nunwieldy list of amendments and get it down to some responsible number \nso we can begin, finally, in earnest. I have to point out that I don't \nunderstand how my Republican friends think it is appropriate to add to \na highway bill the issue of birth control. I don't know how my friends \non the other side think it is appropriate to repeal environmental laws \non this highway bill. I don't understand, as my friend from Maryland \npointed out, how they can say they can see a connection between a \nhighway bill and what is happening in Egypt.\n  We care about all these issues, and the Senate will address these \nissues, but this is a jobs bill, a bipartisan jobs bill. So I want to \nend by thanking my friend for yielding to me, and I look forward to his \nremarks on judges, and I look forward to getting back to our \ntransportation bill, which I am hopeful will happen at some point \ntoday.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I am concerned that our judicial confirmation \nprocess in the Senate has broken down due to partisanship, particularly \nfor noncontroversial judges. Judge Russell's nomination now joins a \nlong list of backlogged, noncontroversial judicial nominations that are \nstuck on the Senate floor. As of yesterday, the Senate calendar \ncontained 20 judicial nominations approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee which are still awaiting a final vote. Fifteen of these \nnominees have been pending since last year, and 18 of them have \nreceived strong bipartisan support from the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nThese are noncontroversial nominees that are due the up-or-down vote on \nthe floor of the Senate, and there is no justification for the delay in \nthe Senate's carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.\n  The Senate is responsible for the rising vacancy rate in our Nation's \narticle III courts. The victims here are not only the nominee and his \nor her family, who are waiting on final Senate action, but the American \npeople are also victims. They face increasing delays in courts that are \noverburdened and understaffed. A higher vacancy rate means lack of \ntimely hearings and decisions by our Federal courts, affecting our \ncitizens' access to justice and a fair and impartial resolution of \ntheir complaints.\n  In Maryland, we are trying to fill a vacancy that was created during \nthe end of President Bush's term of office when Judge Peter Messitte \ntook senior status in 2008. So this vacancy has been there for a long \ntime. It is time for us to act. Judge Russell is an excellent \ncandidate. He received bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee \nand is ready to take office upon being confirmed by the Senate. The \ntime for action is now.\n  Judge Russell brings a wealth of experience to this position in both \nState and Federal courts. Earlier in his career, he served as a Federal \nprosecutor and as an attorney in a private law firm. He now sits as a \nState trial judge court in Maryland. He has the experience.\n  He graduated from Morehouse College with a B.A. in political science \nin 1988 and a J.D. from Maryland Law School in 1991. He passed the bar \nexamination and was admitted to practice law in Maryland in 1991. He \nthen clerked for Chief Judge Robert Bell on the Maryland Court of \nAppeals, our State's highest court.\n  He worked as a litigation associate for 2 years at Hazel, Thomas, and \nthen briefly at Whiteford, Taylor. He then served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney for the District of Maryland from 1994 to 1999, handling civil \ncases. In that capacity, he represented various Federal Government \nagencies in discrimination, accident, and medical malpractice cases. He \nthen worked as an associate at the Peter Angelos law firm for 2 years.\n  In 2002, he went back to the U.S. Attorney's Office handling criminal \ncases until 2007. He represented the United States in the criminal \nprosecution of violent crime and narcotics cases during the \ninvestigatory stage, at trial, and on appeal. This included the \ninitiation and monitoring of wiretaps to infiltrate and break up \nviolent gangs in Baltimore City. He also served as the Project Safe \nNeighborhood coordinator for the office from 2002 until 2005. He \nparticipated in community outreach programs, including attending \ncommunity meetings on behalf of the office, and attending meetings with \nthe Baltimore State's Attorney's Office to reduce violent crime in \nBaltimore neighborhoods.\n  In January 2007, Governor Ehrlich, who I am sure you are aware was \nthe Republican Governor of our State, appointed Judge Russell to serve \nas an associate judge of the Baltimore City Circuit Court for a term of \n15 years. As a trial judge, Judge Russell has presided over hundreds of \ntrials that have gone to verdict or judgment and has experience in \nhandling jury trials, bench trials, civil cases, and criminal cases. He \nhas the professional experience which has been recognized by a \nRepublican Governor and a Democratic President. He should receive a \nvote on the floor of this body and he should be confirmed.\n  Judge Russell has strong roots, legal experience, and community \ninvolvement in the State of Maryland. He was born and raised in \nBaltimore City, and has extended family who live in Baltimore. He \nserves as director and trustee on the board of the Enoch Pratt Free \nLibrary, which serves the disadvantaged throughout the State of \nMaryland. He served on the board of directors of the Community Law \nCenter, which is an organization designed to help neighborhood \norganizations improve the quality of life for their residents. So he \nbrings experience as a community activist as well as his professional \nexperience.\n  He has also served as a board member of several organizations that \ndevote substantial resources to helping the disadvantaged, including \nBig Brothers and Big Sisters of Maryland. I know he has often spoken to \nyoung people in schools about the obligation, duty, and mandate of a \njudge, and tries to demystify the role of a judge in a black robe. \nJudge Russell is particularly concerned with addressing the drug \nviolence and mental health problems that plague Baltimore City.\n  The reason I went through all of his qualifications right now, even \nthough his nomination is not pending, is that we have to put a face on \nthe people who are being denied the opportunity for an up-or-down vote \nbefore the Senate. You hear the numbers; I have mentioned them--20--\nbacked up. That is a large number when you look at the vacancy rates on \nour courts. When you look at this vacancy that has been pending now for \nthe people of Maryland for 3 years, they have a right to action on the \nfloor of the Senate. They have a right to have these nominees heard in \nregular order. But I want the people to know about this one individual \nand how qualified he is to assume the position on the District Court of \nMaryland.\n  I urge my colleagues to do everything they can. Let's carry out our \nresponsibility. I am absolutely confident that Judge Russell possesses \nthe qualifications, temperament, and passion for justice that will make \nhim an outstanding United States District Court\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\njudge for the District of Maryland. He will serve the people very well \nin this position. I therefore urge my colleagues not only to allow us \nto vote on Judge Russell's confirmation, but let us vote on the 20 \nnominees who have been reported out of the Judiciary Committee, and \nshow the American people we are ready to carry out our \nresponsibilities.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, my Republican \nfriends: It is way past time for us to carry out our responsibility. \nStop putting filibusters or holds on these judicial nominations. Let's \nvote on them and carry out our responsibilities as Senators.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, recently I came to the floor of the \nSenate to talk about the lack of faith the American people have in the \npolitical system and in our government. My focus that day was on \ncampaign finance laws and the impact of the Citizens United decision by \nthe Supreme Court 2 years ago.\n  Today I am here to discuss, along with my colleagues, another dynamic \nof Capitol Hill that is making people lose faith in Washington: the \napparent inability of Congress to get routine business done; \nspecifically, the failure of the Senate to fill the dozens of judicial \nvacancies that exist around the country.\n  This doesn't need to be a partisan debate. I know Senators on each \nside have their own reasons why it is the other party's fault. But we \nneed to put those arguments behind us and agree to do the people's \nbusiness.\n  We have actually done a good job, as Senator Cardin has pointed out, \non the Judiciary Committee with having a number of judges who have come \nthrough that committee and are waiting approval on the floor. But \noften, we approve judges and they don't get floor votes for months and \nmonths. Also, the vast majority of judges who get approved, get \napproved unanimously in committee. That was my experience with the \njudge I recommended from Minnesota who now is a judge. So we got her \ndone, but there are so many more, as you know, and so many \njurisdictions with heavy caseloads which are awaiting judges.\n  Once these judges get to the floor, almost all of them get a handful \nof no votes. Why is that? They have been vetted. They have been vetted, \ntheir records have been looked at, they have gone through a committee \nhearing, they have been looked at by Senators on both sides of the \naisle in the Judiciary Committee. And if they have reached that point \nof being on the floor of the Senate, it is no surprise that they might \nget a few no votes. So I don't see this as a partisan issue, but it is \nan issue we must get done.\n  If almost all the Senators support almost all the judges, this isn't \nabout pushing one side's agenda or judicial philosophy. These are \nextremely qualified judges who Senators believe will be fair, impartial \njurists, committed to objectively interpreting the law. But the fact is \nthat we are lagging way behind in the confirmation pace under previous \nPresidents of both parties and with the Senate controlled by either \nparty. By this time in the Presidency of Bill Clinton, the Senate had \nconfirmed 183 judges. By this time in the Presidency of George W. Bush, \nthe Senate had confirmed 170 judges. And yet as of today, we have only \nconfirmed 129 judicial nominees of President Obama.\n  It is important to note that President Bush actually ended up getting \nfive more judges approved in his first term than President Clinton. So \nwe don't have a case where there has suddenly been a decline over time \nwith the judges' approval. In fact, it went up after Clinton and now, \nas we can see, it is going down. There doesn't seem to be any \nindication at this very moment in time that we are speeding up the \nprocess. While earlier in the year we did confirm a number of judges, \nthere was an agreement. There are still way too many out there, and we \nneed to move on them now.\n  Typically, the Senate will approve noncontroversial judicial nominees \nbefore the end of the session in December. But that did not happen this \npast year, and we have not made too much progress since returning in \nJanuary. It doesn't take too long to approve a judge on the floor. \nOften, we have an hour or two of debate and then vote on two or three \njudges. So we can get these judges confirmed quickly if both sides \nconsent.\n  Some people listening are probably thinking there must be an \nexplanation; that I am somehow leaving out key numbers when I have just \nexplained that we only need an hour or two for each of these 20-some \npending judges. Maybe they are thinking there aren't as many vacancies \nas under previous Presidents. But, no, under President Clinton there \nwere about 53 vacancies at this point in his Presidency. Under \nPresident Bush, there were 46 vacancies. Right now, under President \nObama, there are in fact 85 judicial vacancies.\n  Maybe people at home are thinking the slow process is a result of \ncontroversial nominees but, no, it is not that, either. As I mentioned \nearlier, most of the judicial nominees awaiting a floor vote were \napproved unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee. That is not a \ncommittee, as the President knows from serving on that committee, of \nshrinking violets. There are people with very diverse views. And most \nof these nominees, as I explained, came through with all of their \nsupport. In fact, 16 of the 19 nominees waiting for a floor vote \nreceived unanimous votes in committee. They were approved by every \nsingle member of the Judiciary Committee from both parties.\n  Most of those unanimous judges have been waiting for a vote for \nmonths. We should confirm them right away. We should confirm them this \nweek. We can have a vote so that the few people on the other side of \nthe aisle who do not agree with those nominees can register their \nobjection and vote no. But there is no reason to hold up all of these \nnominees for all of these jurisdictions across the country.\n\n  For the judges who have come out of committee more recently, I \nunderstand that Senators need time to look at their records and \nqualifications. That is an important part of the process. But after a \nreasonable period of time, let's move on to confirm the newer judges as \nwell. Let's vote up or down on all of the judges and get them on the \nbench.\n  I also want to point out that the judicial nomination process is \nbipartisan. That may surprise some people watching at home. They may \nthink I am making that up. But the truth is that nominees don't move \nforward in the Judiciary Committee unless both of the home State \nSenators sign off. So whether it is two Democrats or two Republicans or \none from each party, both Senators have effective veto power over the \njudicial nominees from their State. And usually the judges proposed by \nthe President first are recommended by Senators. So it is not a \nquestion of President Obama picking whomever he wants and appointing \nthem to the judiciary. He has to pick people who are okay with both \nSenators regardless of party. It forces a President of either party to \nchoose high-quality, well-respected mainstream judges.\n  I remain hopeful we can rectify this situation and start getting \njudges approved in a timely manner and catch up to where we were under \nprevious Presidents. But it is not about keeping some scorecard from \nPresident to President, as much as I have loved using these statistics \ntoday, or from Congress to Congress. In truth, it is about justice. And \nwe all know that. We are constantly hearing complaints about the slow \npace of Federal courts. Those delays are real, and they impact people--\nreal people--every day. Whether we are talking about people seeking to \nprotect their rights under the Americans With Disability Act or \ncompanies trying to resolve commercial disputes--I have a few of them \nin my State--unreasonable delays in court proceedings undermine our \nsystem of justice, and things won't get any better if we understaff our \nFederal judiciary.\n  There are many problems facing our country that do not have simple \nsolutions. There are many problems for which the two parties have \nvastly different solutions. But in this case with judicial vacancies, \nthere is only one solution, and it is well within our grasp given that \nso many of these judges were noncontroversial.\n  This is the solution, Mr. President. It is two words: Let's vote. \nLet's vote on all of the pending nominees, and let's continue to vote \nas more nominees emerge from the Judiciary Committee.\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\nIf a Senator wants to vote no on a particular nominee, if he or she \nwants to give a long and glorious speech about why they are opposed to \nthe nominee, please let them do that. Let them do that today. All we \nare asking for is a vote.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \ndiscuss our broken judicial confirmation process. I know many of my \ncolleagues will discuss individual nominees and how long they have \nlanguished on the executive calendar without a vote. We can point to \nmany statistics about the length of time it takes to confirm President \nObama's nominees versus President Bush's and how many nominees each had \nconfirmed in their first term.\n  This is an important argument to make. And while these statistics are \nhelpful in highlighting the problem, they are merely the symptoms of a \nmuch larger disease--a broken Senate. Since joining the Senate in 2009, \nI've said repeatedly that we must take decisive action to reform our \nrules in order to restore deliberativeness to this body.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, Senators Harkin, Merkley, and I \ntried to do that. Ultimately, our success was limited. We didn't \nachieve the broad reforms we wanted. But we did initiate a debate that \nhighlighted some of the most egregious abuses of the rules, including \nhow the rules are manipulated to obstruct the confirmation process for \njudges and executive branch nominees.\n  There was some hope that the debate we had, along with the modest \nreforms that were adopted, would encourage both sides of the aisle to \nrestore the respect and comity that is often lacking in today's Senate. \nUnfortunately, any goodwill rapidly deteriorated and the partisan \nrancor and political brinksmanship quickly returned.\n  That is why we are here again today, talking about yet another aspect \nof this body's dysfunction--the broken judicial confirmation process.\n  This is not a new problem, nor is it one on which either side can \nclaim to be innocent. For about the past decade, the minority party--\nwhether Republicans or Democrats--has gone to inexcusable lengths to \nslow or block judicial nominees who have strong majority support. This \nhas lead to a new norm in the Senate--the need for any nominee to get \nat least 60 votes for confirmation. This directly conflicts with the \nFounders' intent and a plain reading of the Constitution.\n  The arguments my colleagues and I make today--that judicial nominees \nwho have been approved by the Judiciary Committee deserve a vote by the \nfull Senate--are the same arguments my Republican colleagues made when \nPresident Bush's nominees were held up by a Democratic minority.\n  In April 2003, the freshmen members of the 108th Congress sent a \nletter to Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Daschle. That \nfreshman class was made up of nine Republicans and one Democrat. I'd \nlike to read part of that letter. The senators wrote:\n\n       [W]e write to express our concerns about the state of the \n     federal judicial nomination and confirmation process. The \n     apparent breakdown in this process reflects poorly on the \n     ability of the Senate and the Administration to work together \n     in the best interests of our country. The breakdown also \n     disserves the qualified nominees to the federal bench whose \n     confirmations have been delayed or blocked, and the American \n     people who rely on our federal courts for justice. . . . We \n     seek a bipartisan solution that will protect the integrity \n     and independence of our nation's courts, ensure fairness for \n     judicial nominees, and leave the bitterness of the past \n     behind us.\n\n  Regrettably, the rest of the Senate did not heed their advice and the \nconfirmation process remained dysfunctional. Two years later, Senator \nHatch, a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wrote an op-ed in \nthe National Review Online that clearly outlined the problem. Senator \nHatch's commentary began with the following:\n\n       Judicial nominations will be one of the most important \n     issues facing the Senate in the 109th Congress and the \n     question is whether we will return to the tradition of giving \n     nominations reaching the Senate floor an up or down vote. The \n     filibusters used to block such votes have mired the judicial-\n     confirmation process in a political and constitutional crisis \n     that undermines democracy, the judiciary, the Senate, and the \n     Constitution.\n\n  He then went on to argue that there was a solution to address this \ncrisis--using the Constitutional Option to amend the Senate rules. Just \nas I argued last year at the start of the session, Senator Hatch stated \nthat at the beginning of a new Congress, a simple majority can invoke \ncloture and change the Senate rules. The rules weren't amended then, \nand they weren't amended last year, either. This is why we are here \ntoday, having the same debate about judicial nominations that the \nRepublicans had when they were in the majority and President Bush's \nnominees were stalled.\n  It's time we stop having this debate and actually fix the process. \nBoth sides have acknowledged the problem and offered solutions when \nthey were in the majority. In the 108th Congress, Senator Frist \nintroduced a resolution to change Rule XXII that would have gradually \nreduced the cloture threshold on nominations after successive votes \nover the course of several days of debate. That resolution was \ncosponsored by Senators McConnell, Kyl, and Cornyn--all members of the \ncurrent minority leadership.\n  Last year, at the beginning of this Congress, Senators Harkin, \nMerkley, and I introduced a resolution to reform the rules. It included \nreforms that would have addressed the broken confirmation process, \nincluding reducing the post-cloture time on nominees from thirty hours \nto two and requiring real debate in order to sustain a filibuster. \nUnfortunately, neither of these resolutions was adopted.\n  During the debate on our resolution last year, Senator Harkin made a \nvery good point. He said, ``I believe each Senator needs to give up a \nlittle of our pride, a little of our prerogatives, and a little of our \npower for the good of this Senate and the good of this country.'' Let's \nhope that someday enough of our colleagues will agree with him and we \nfinally institute the reforms necessary to restore the Senate's \nreputation as the ``World's Greatest Deliberative Body.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the freshman class of \nthe 108th Congress and Senator Hatch's National Review op-ed be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2003.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: As the ten newest members \n     of the United States Senate, we write to express our concerns \n     about the state of the federal judicial nomination and \n     confirmation process. The apparent breakdown in this process \n     reflects poorly on the ability of the Senate and the \n     Administration to work together in the best interests of our \n     country. The breakdown also disserves the qualified nominees \n     to the federal bench whose confirmations have been delayed or \n     blocked, and the American people who rely on our federal \n     courts for justice.\n       We, the ten freshmen of the United States Senate for the \n     108th Congress, are a diverse group. Among our ranks are \n     former federal executive branch officials, members of the \n     U.S. House of Representatives, and state attorneys general. \n     We include state and local officials, and a former trial and \n     appellate judge. We have different viewpoints on a variety of \n     important issues currently facing our country. But we are \n     united in our commitment to maintaining and preserving a fair \n     and effective justice system for all Americans. And we are \n     united in our concern that the judicial confirmation process \n     is broken and needs to be fixed.\n       In some instances, when a well qualified nominee for the \n     federal bench is denied a vote, the obstruction is justified \n     on the ground of how prior nominees--typically, the nominees \n     of a previous President--were treated. All of these \n     recriminations, made by members on both sides of the aisle, \n     relate to circumstances which occurred before any of us \n     arrived in the United States Senate. None of us were parties \n     to any of the reported past offenses, whether real or \n     perceived. None of us believe that the ill will of the past \n     should dictate the terms and direction of the future.\n       Each of us firmly believes that the United States Senate \n     needs a fresh start. And each of us believes strongly that we \n     were elected to this body in order to do a job for the \n     citizens of our respective states--to enact legislation to \n     stimulate our economy, protect national security, and promote \n     the national welfare, and to provide advice and consent, and \n     to vote on the President's nominations to important positions \n     in the executive branch and on our nation's courts.\n       Accordingly, the ten freshmen of the United States Senate \n     for the 108th Congress urge you to work toward improving the \n     Senate's use of the current process or establishing a better \n     process for the Senate's consideration of judicial \n     nominations. We acknowledge that the White House should be \n     included in repairing this process.\n       All of us were elected to do a job. Unfortunately, the \n     current state of our judicial confirmation process prevents \n     us from doing an\n\n[[Page S1076]]\n\n     important part of that job. We seek a bipartisan solution \n     that will protect the integrity and independence of our \n     nation's courts, ensure fairness for judicial nominees, and \n     leave the bitterness of the past behind us.\n           Yours truly,\n         John Cornyn; Mark Pryor; Lisa Murkowski; Lindsey Graham; \n           Elizabeth Dole; Saxby Chambliss; Norm Coleman; James \n           Talent; Lamar Alexander; John E. Sununu.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the National Review Online, January 12, 2005]\n\n Crisis Mode--A Fair and Constitutional Option To Beat the Filibuster \n                                  game\n\n                      (By Senator Orrin G. Hatch)\n\n       Judicial nominations will be one of the most important \n     issues facing the Senate in the 109th Congress and the \n     question is whether we will return to the tradition of giving \n     nominations reaching the Senate floor an up or down vote. The \n     filibusters used to block such votes have mired the judicial-\n     confirmation process in a political and constitutional crisis \n     that undermines democracy, the judiciary, the Senate, and the \n     Constitution. The Senate has in the past changed its \n     procedures to rebalance the minority's right to debate and \n     the majority's right to decide and it must do so again.\n       Newspaper editorials condemning the filibusters outnumber \n     supporting ones by more than six-to-one. Last November, South \n     Dakotans retired former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     in no small part, because he led the filibuster forces. Yet \n     within hours of his election to succeed Senator Daschle as \n     Minority Leader, Senator Harry Reid took to the Senate floor \n     to defend them. Hope is fading that the shrinking Democratic \n     minority will abandon its destructive course of using \n     filibusters to defeat majority supported judicial \n     nominations. Their failure to do so will require a deliberate \n     solution.\n       If these filibusters were part of the Senate's historical \n     practice or, as a recent NRO editorial put it, merely made \n     confirming nominees more difficult, a deliberate solution \n     might not be warranted. But this is a crisis, not a problem \n     of inconvenience.\n       Senate rules reflect an emphasis on deliberation and \n     debate. Either by unanimous agreement or at least 60 votes on \n     a motion to invoke cloture under Rule 22, the Senate must end \n     debate before it can vote on anything. From the Spanish \n     filibustero, a filibuster was a mercenary who tries to \n     destabilize a government. A filibuster occurs most plainly on \n     the Senate floor when efforts to end debate fail, either by \n     objection to unanimous consent or defeat of a cloture motion. \n     During the 108th Congress, Senate Democrats defeated ten \n     majority-supported nominations to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     by objecting to every unanimous consent request and defeating \n     every cloture motion. This tactic made good on then-\n     Democratic Leader Tom Daschle's February 2001 vow to use \n     ``whatever means necessary'' to defeat judicial nominations. \n     These filibusters are unprecedented, unfair, dangerous, \n     partisan, and unconstitutional.\n       These are the first filibusters in American history to \n     defeat majority supported judicial nominations. Before the \n     108th Congress, 13 of the 14 judicial nominations on which \n     the Senate took a cloture vote were confirmed. President \n     Johnson withdrew the 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas to be \n     Supreme Court chief justice the day after a failed cloture \n     vote showed the nomination did not have clear majority \n     support. In contrast, Democrats have now crossed the \n     confirmation Rubicon by using the filibuster to defeat \n     judicial nominations which enjoy clear majority support.\n       Focusing on President Clinton's judicial nominations in \n     1999, I described what has been the Senate's historical \n     standard for judicial nominations: ``Let's make our case if \n     we have disagreement, and then vote.'' Democrats' new \n     filibusters abandons this tradition and is unfair to senators \n     who must provide the ``advice and consent'' the Constitution \n     requires of them through a final up or down vote. It is also \n     unfair to nominees who have agreed, often at personal and \n     financial sacrifice, to judicial service only to face \n     scurrilous attacks, trumped up charges, character \n     assassination, and smear campaigns. They should not also be \n     held in permanent filibuster limbo. Senators can vote for or \n     against any judicial nominee for any reason, but senators \n     should vote.\n       These unprecedented and unfair filibusters are distorting \n     the way the Senate does business. Before the 108th Congress, \n     cloture votes were used overwhelmingly for legislation rather \n     than nominations. The percentage of cloture votes used for \n     judicial nominations jumped a whopping 900 percent during \n     President Bush's first term from the previous 25 years since \n     adoption of the current cloture rule. And before the 108th \n     Congress, the few cloture votes on judicial nominations were \n     sometimes used to ensure up or down votes. Even on \n     controversial nominees such as Richard Paez and Marsha \n     Berzon, we invoked cloture to ensure that we would vote on \n     confirmation. We did, and both are today sitting federal \n     judges. In contrast, these new Democratic filibusters are \n     designed to prevent, rather than secure, an up or down vote \n     and to ensure that targeted judicial nominations are defeated \n     rather than debated.\n       These filibusters are also completely partisan. The average \n     tally on cloture votes during the 108th Congress was 53 43, \n     enough to confirm but not enough to invoke cloture and end \n     debate. Democrats provided every single vote against \n     permitting an up or down vote. In fact, Democrats have cast \n     more than 92 percent of all votes against cloture on judicial \n     nominations in American history.\n       Unprecedented, unfair, and partisan filibusters that \n     distort Senate procedures constitute a political crisis. By \n     trying to use Rule 22's cloture requirement to change the \n     Constitution's confirmation requirement, these Democratic \n     filibusters also constitute a constitutional crisis.\n       The Constitution gives the Senate authority to determine \n     its procedural rules. More than a century ago, however, the \n     Supreme Court unanimously recognized the obvious maxim that \n     those rules may not ``ignore constitutional restraints.'' The \n     Constitution explicitly requires a supermajority vote for \n     such things as trying impeachments or overriding a \n     presidential veto; it does not do so for confirming \n     nominations. Article II, Section 2, even mentions ratifying \n     treaties and confirming nominees in the very same sentence, \n     requiring a supermajority for the first but not for the \n     second. Twisting Senate rules to create a confirmation \n     supermajority undermines the Constitution. As Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman once argued, it amounts to ``an amendment of the \n     Constitution by rule of the U.S. Senate.''\n       But don't take my word for it. The same senators leading \n     the current filibuster campaign once argued that all \n     filibusters are unconstitutional. Senator Lieberman argued in \n     1995 that a supermajority requirement for cloture has ``no \n     constitutional basis.'' Senator Tom Harkin insisted that \n     ``the filibuster rules are unconstitutional'' because ``the \n     Constitution sets out . . . when you need majority or \n     supermajority votes in the Senate.'' And former Senator \n     Daschle said that because the Constitution ``is \n     straightforward about the few instances in which more than a \n     majority of the Congress must vote. . . . Democracy means \n     majority rule, not minority gridlock.'' He later applied this \n     to judicial nomination filibusters: ``I find it simply \n     baffling that a Senator would vote against even voting on a \n     judicial nomination.'' That each of these senators voted for \n     every judicial-nomination filibuster during the 108th \n     Congress is baffling indeed.\n       These senators argued that legislative as well as \n     nomination filibusters are unconstitutional. Filibusters of \n     legislation, however, are different and solving the current \n     crisis does not require throwing the entire filibuster baby \n     out with the judicial nomination bathwater. The Senate's \n     authority to determine its own rules is greatest regarding \n     what is most completely within its jurisdiction, namely, \n     legislation. And legislative filibusters have a long history. \n     Rule 22 itself did not even potentially apply to nominations \n     until decades after its adoption. Neither America's founders, \n     nor the Senate that adopted Rule 22 to address legislative \n     gridlock, ever imagined that filibusters would be used to \n     highjack the judicial appointment process.\n       Liberal interest groups, and many in the mainstream media, \n     eagerly repeat Democratic talking points trying to change, \n     rather than address, the subject. For example, they claim \n     that, without the filibuster, the Senate would be nothing \n     more than a ``rubberstamp'' for the president's judicial \n     nominations. Losing a fair fight, however, does not \n     rubberstamp the winner; giving up without a fight does. \n     Active opposition to a judicial nomination, especially \n     expressed through a negative vote, is the best remedy against \n     being a rubberstamp.\n       They also try to change the definition of a filibuster. On \n     March 11, 2003, for example, Senator Patrick Leahy, ranking \n     Judiciary Committee Democrat, used a chart titled \n     ``Republican Filibusters of Nominees.'' Many individuals on \n     the list, however, are today sitting federal judges, some \n     confirmed after invoking cloture and others without taking a \n     cloture vote at all. Invoking cloture and confirming \n     nominations is no precedent for not invoking cloture and \n     refusing to confirm nominations.\n       Many senators once opposed the very judicial nomination \n     filibusters they now embrace. Senator Leahy, for example, \n     said in 1998: ``I have stated over and over again . . . that \n     I would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported.'' Since then, \n     he has voted against cloture on judicial nominations 21 out \n     of 26 times. Senator Ted Kennedy, a former chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee, said in 1995 that ``Senators who believe \n     in fairness will not let a minority of the Senate deny [the \n     nominee] his vote by the entire Senate.'' Since then, he has \n     voted to let a minority of the Senate deny judicial nominees \n     a vote 18 out of 23 times.\n       Let me put my own record on the table. I have never voted \n     against cloture on a judicial nomination. I opposed \n     filibusters of Carter and Clinton judicial nominees, Reagan \n     and Bush judicial nominees, all judicial nominees. Along with \n     then-Majority Leader Trent Lott, I repeatedly warned that \n     filibustering Clinton judicial nominees would be a \n     ``travesty'' and helped make sure that every Clinton judicial \n     nomination reaching the full Senate received a final \n     confirmation decision. That should be the permanent standard, \n     no matter which party controls the Senate or occupies the \n     White House.\n       The Senate has periodically faced the situation where the \n     minority's right to debate has improperly overwhelmed the \n     majority's right to decide. And we have changed our \n     procedures in a way that preserves the minority's right to \n     debate, and even to filibuster legislation, while solving the \n     crisis at hand.\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\n       The Senate's first legislative rules, adopted in 1789, \n     directly reflected majority rule. Rule 8 allowed a simple \n     majority to ``move the previous question'' and proceed to \n     vote on a pending matter. Invoked only three times in 17 \n     years, however, Rule 8 was dropped in the Senate rules \n     revision of 1806, meaning unanimous consent was then \n     necessary to end debate. Dozens of reform efforts during the \n     19th century tried to rein in the minority's abuse of the \n     right to debate. In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson described \n     what had become of majority rule: ``The Senate of the United \n     States is the only legislative body in the world which cannot \n     act when its majority is ready for action. . . . The only \n     remedy is that the rules of the Senate shall be altered.'' \n     Leadership turned gridlock into reform, and that year the \n     Senate adopted Rule 22, by which \\2/3\\ of Senators present \n     and voting could invoke cloture, or end debate, on a pending \n     measure.\n       Just as the minority abused the unanimous consent threshold \n     in the 19th century, the minority abused the \\2/3\\ threshold \n     in the 20th century. A resolution to reinstate the previous \n     question rule was introduced, and only narrowly defeated, \n     within a year of Rule 22's adoption. A steady stream of \n     reform attempts followed, and a series of modifications made \n     until the current 60-vote threshold was adopted in 1975. The \n     point is that the Senate has periodically rebalanced the \n     minority's right to debate and the majority's right to \n     decide. Today's crisis, with constitutional as well as \n     political dimensions and affecting all three branches of \n     government, presents an even more compelling case to do so.\n       These filibusters are an unprecedented shift in the kind, \n     not just the degree, of the minority's tactics. After a full, \n     fair, and vigorous debate on judicial nominations, a simple \n     majority must at some point be able to proceed to a vote. A \n     simple majority can achieve this goal either by actually \n     amending Rule 22 or by sustaining an appropriate \n     parliamentary ruling.\n       The Senate exercises its constitutional authority to \n     determine its procedural rules either implicitly or \n     explicitly. Once a new Congress begins, operating under \n     existing rules implicitly adopts them ``by acquiescence.'' \n     The Senate explicitly determines its rules by formally \n     amending them, and the procedure depends on its timing. After \n     Rule 22 has been adopted by acquiescence, it requires 67 \n     votes for cloture on a rules change. Before the Senate adopts \n     Rule 22 by acquiescence, however, ordinary parliamentary \n     rules apply and a simple majority can invoke cloture and \n     change Senate rules.\n       Some object to this conclusion by observing that, because \n     only a portion of its membership changes with each election, \n     the Senate has been called a ``continuing body.'' Yet \n     language reflecting this observation was included in Senate \n     rules only in 1959. The more important, and much older, sense \n     in which the Senate is a continuing body is its ongoing \n     constitutional authority to determine its rules. Rulings by \n     vice presidents of both parties, sitting as the President of \n     the Senate, confirm that each Senate may make that decision \n     for itself, either implicitly by acquiescence or explicitly \n     by amendment. Both conservative and liberal legal scholars, \n     including those who see no constitutional problems with the \n     current filibuster campaign, agree that a simple majority can \n     change Senate rules at the beginning of a new Congress.\n       An alternative strategy involves a parliamentary ruling in \n     the context of considering an individual nomination. This \n     approach can be pursued at any time, and would not actually \n     amend Rule 22. The precedent it would set depends on the \n     specific ruling it produces and the facts of the situation in \n     which it arises.\n       Speculation, often inaccurate, abounds about how this \n     strategy would work. One newspaper, for example, offered a \n     common description that this approach would seek ``a ruling \n     from the Senate parliamentarian that the filibuster of \n     executive nominations is unconstitutional.'' Under long-\n     standing Senate parliamentary precedent, however, the \n     presiding officer does not decide such constitutional \n     questions but submits them to the full Senate, where they are \n     debatable and subject to Rule 22's 60-vote requirement. A \n     filibuster would then prevent solving this filibuster crisis. \n     Should the chair rule in favor of a properly framed non-\n     debatable point of order, Democrats would certainly appeal, \n     but the majority could still sustain the ruling by voting for \n     a non-debatable motion to table the appeal.\n       Democrats have threatened that, if the majority pursues a \n     deliberate solution to this political and constitutional \n     crisis, they will bring the entire Senate to a screeching \n     halt. Perhaps they see this as way to further escalate the \n     confirmation crisis, as the Senate cannot confirm judicial \n     nominations if it can do nothing at all. No one, however, \n     seriously believes that, if the partisan roles were reversed, \n     Democrats--the ones who once proposed abolishing even \n     legislative filibusters--would hesitate for a moment before \n     changing Senate procedures to facilitate consideration of \n     judicial nominations they favored.\n       The United States Senate is a unique institution. Our rules \n     allowing for extended debate protect the minority's role in \n     the legislative process. We must preserve that role. The \n     current filibuster campaign against judicial nominations, \n     however, is the real attack on Senate tradition and an \n     unprecedented example of placing short-term advantage above \n     longstanding fundamental principles. It is not simply \n     annoying or frustrating, but a new and dangerous kind of \n     obstruction which threatens democracy, the Senate, the \n     judiciary, and even the Constitution itself. As such, it \n     requires a more serious and deliberate solution.\n       While judicial appointments can be politically contentious \n     and ideologically divisive, the confirmation process must \n     still be handled through a fair process that honors the \n     Constitution and Senate tradition. If the fight is fair and \n     constitutional, let the chips fall where they may. As it has \n     before, the Senate must change its procedures to properly \n     balance majority rule and extended debate. That way, we can \n     vigorously debate judicial nominations and still conduct the \n     people's business.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Mr. President, we were engaged in lengthy debate for \nmonths--maybe years--about health care in the United States, and I \nbelieve we passed a historic bill that addresses some of the most \nfundamental issues about health care: first, to address affordability \nbecause if you can't afford it, it doesn't matter how good medical care \nis; second, to make sure it was successful for people rich and poor \nalike; third, to make sure the basic health insurance policies being \noffered in America covered the most important things in a person's \nlife. That was part of the debate, and an important part of it.\n  A fundamental principle of health care reform is to ensure Americans \nhave access to a comprehensive package of health services--we call them \nessential benefits under the law--which includes maternity care, \nvaccinations, and preventive care.\n  Many years ago when I was a new lawyer working in the Illinois State \nSenate, someone approached me and said: Are you aware of the fact that \nyou can buy a health insurance plan that covers a family and literally \ncovers a newborn but exempts coverage for the first 30 days of their \nlife in Illinois?\n  I said: No, that is impossible.\n  He said: No, that kind of health care is for sale, and it is a little \ncheaper because we all know that if a baby is born with a serious \nproblem, the first 30 days can be extremely expensive.\n  They were literally selling health insurance plans that left that \nfamily and baby vulnerable for 30 days. We changed the law in Illinois \nand said: You can't offer a health insurance plan that covers maternity \nand newborns unless you cover them from the moment they are born. So it \nwas written into the law as a protection against consumers who \nunwittingly would sign up for the cheaper policy that would never be \nthere when they needed it.\n  When we talked about the Federal standards when it came to health \ninsurance, we wanted to make certain that some of the most basic \nthings--the essential services--were covered, and that includes \nmaternity care, vaccinations, and preventive care for women.\n  There is an amendment we will consider this week offered by Senator \nBlunt of Missouri that I am afraid will threaten the vital consumer \nprotections in the health reform law. These protections ensure that \nwomen, men, and children have access to basic health care. The \namendment by Senator Blunt would allow any employer or insurance \ncompany to deny health insurance for any essential or preventive health \ncare service they object to on the basis of ``undefined'' religious or \nmoral convictions. That means an employer can not only deny access to \nfamily planning and birth control, but they could deny access to any \nhealth care services required under our new Federal health care reform \nlaw.\n  Many supporters of this amendment stress how the amendment will \nprotect\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\nemployers with religious objections to things such as coverage for \ncontraception, but in reality this amendment goes much further: it \nwould allow employers to deny coverage for any health service. For \nexample, under the Blunt amendment, if an employer objects morally to \nvaccinations, then their insurance policy would not have to cover \npotentially lifesaving vaccinations for the children of that employer's \nworkers or if an employer has religious objections to mental health \ncare, their employees would not have access to basic health care \nservices that we fought to protect. The Blunt amendment will have a \nharmful effect on all people and would undermine our Nation's effort to \nensure that everyone in this country has access to a basic standard of \nhealth coverage.\n  Who opposes the Blunt amendment? It is not just women's groups, as \nyou might expect, but the American Academy of Pediatrics, AIDS United, \nthe American Nurses Association, and the American Congress of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists.\n  Mr. President, I know your personal background and field of study has \nincluded theology and religious training, in that area, and I know this \nparticular debate was brought on because of President Obama's decision \nwhen it came to the health care coverage offered by religious colleges, \nuniversities, and charities. The President's offer at this point says \nthat no religious-sponsored institution, such as a college, university, \nhospital, or charity, will be forced to offer health services that \nviolate their basic principles and values, their religious values. The \nPresident goes on to say, though, that the employees of that \ninstitution would have the right, on their own initiative, to a service \nnot provided to them under the hospital or university policy that they \ncould secure by going directly to the insurance company. It removes the \nchurch-sponsored, religious-sponsored institution from making the \ninitial decision that might run counter to their values but gives the \nfreedom to the individual employee to pursue the health care under the \nlaw which they consider to be essential, such as family planning. Some \nsay this is unacceptable. I think it strikes the right balance--the \nbalance between respecting the conscience and religious values of \ncertain institutions while still protecting the freedom of individuals.\n  There has been a lot of talk in this Presidential campaign about \nreligion, and much of it has come from a former Senator from \nPennsylvania. I would like to remind him and those who have not \nfollowed it closely that there are exactly three provisions in the U.S. \nConstitution when it comes to religion. One of them says that we have \nthe freedom of religion, religious belief, which gives us the right to \nbelieve what we want to believe or to believe nothing. That is \nguaranteed under the Constitution. Secondly, the government will not \npick a religion. I have heard candidates say we are a Christian nation. \nNo. We are an American nation, which includes many Christians but also \nothers of different religious beliefs, and the Constitution says the \ngovernment will never pick its religion. The third point that is often \noverlooked--and I would refer to the Senator from Pennsylvania--it is \nin the Constitution that there will be no religious test for office. In \nother words, we could not establish under the law, if anyone cared to, \nthat only Christians or Jewish people could be elected to the Senate or \nthe House. That is strictly unconstitutional.\n\n  Those three principles have guided us well, and it is important for \nus to make sure as we tackle the issues of the day that we apply the \nprinciples that have endured. In this circumstance, we have to \nunderstand that militant secularization is as intolerant as militant \ndesecularization. We have to try to strike that balance.\n  I recommend to those who are following my remarks and would like to \nread more an article that was published in the New York Times on \nFebruary 24 by Joe Nocera entitled ``A Revolutionary Idea.'' Mr. Nocera \nis a thoughtful writer, and he traces the history of this. His opening \nremarks include the following: ``Rick Santorum is John Winthrop''--\nreferring, of course, to Mr. Winthrop who joined with the Puritans in \ntrying to assert that our government needed to stand for puritanical \nvalues and beliefs. That debate, which even predates the Constitution, \nis one that molded our country and makes it what it is today. There \nemerged from that debate over the Puritans and what they would do a \nfeeling that there had to be a separation between church and state, \nreligious belief and secular administration of our government. That is \nthe debate that continues today.\n  This generation, regardless of the issue of the day, needs to \npreserve the same basic values that led to this debate in the early \nColonies and ultimately to our constitutional principles. As we find \ncountries all over the world bitterly and violently divided over \nreligion, we need to take care in our generation that we protect the \nbasics. The President's decision when it comes to health care through \nthe insurance policies protects those basic values.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, would you state the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 1813, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1813) to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and \n     highway safety construction programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 1730, of a perfecting nature.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at the beginning of this month--in fact, \nFebruary 7--I moved to proceed to the surface transportation bill that \nis before us today--an extremely important bill, a bipartisan bill. \nThis effort has been led by two fine Senators--one quite progressive \nand the other very conservative--Senators Boxer and Inhofe, the \nchairman and ranking member of the very important Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. This is a vital job-creating measure. The bill \nwould create and maintain up to 2.8 million jobs.\n  On February 9, 2 days after I moved to this bill, the Senate voted 85 \nto 11 to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. The bill has broad \nbipartisan support. But immediately after the Senate moved to the bill \non February 9, Senator Blunt asked unanimous consent that it be in \norder to offer his amendment on contraception and women's health. I was \nstunned. I couldn't believe this. I said, What is going on here? I \nobjected at the time. I didn't see why this surface transportation jobs \nbill was the appropriate place for an amendment on contraception and \nwomen's health.\n  But the Republican leader and others on the Republican side of the \naisle have made it very clear the Senate is not going to be able to \nmove forward on this important surface transportation bill unless we \nvote on contraception and women's health. My friend the Republican \nleader said it on national TV\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\non ``Face the Nation'' with Bob Schieffer. Senator McConnell said, \n``The issue will not go away.''\n  So I believe it is vital to get this jobs bill done. What is standing \nin the way is the Republicans' insistence on having a vote on a measure \nthat would deny women access to health services such as contraception \nand even prenatal screenings. So after discussing it with numerous \nSenators, I decided we should set up a vote on the one amendment, on \ncontraception and women's health. There has been enough delay on this \nbill. So we will have a vote on this Blunt amendment on Thursday. After \nthat, we hope to be able to work out an agreement to have votes on a \nnumber of nongermane amendments on each side. Maybe we will need to \nhave some side-by-sides, the Republicans may need some side-by-sides on \nour amendments. That is fine, but let's move forth.\n  Meanwhile, the managers have made tremendous progress on clearing \nmore than 25 agreed-to amendments. I know the managers will want to \nwork on clearing even additional germane amendments. So I believe this \nprocess will be the most constructive way to move the bill forward. I \nhope this will help us be in a position to work through to completing \nthe transportation bill by the end of next week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Blunt amendment \nNo. 1520 to be called up; that on Thursday, March 1, at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Blunt \namendment; further, that no other amendments be in order prior to the \nvote in relation to the Blunt amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1520 to Amendment No. 1730\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up the Blunt amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] for Mr. Blunt, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \n     Hatch, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1520 to amendment No. 1730.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to \n protect rights of conscience with regard to requirements for coverage \n                    of specific items and services)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.__. RESPECT FOR RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) As Thomas Jefferson declared to New London Methodists \n     in 1809, ``[n]o provision in our Constitution ought to be \n     dearer to man than that which protects the rights of \n     conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority''.\n       (B) Jefferson's statement expresses a conviction on respect \n     for conscience that is deeply embedded in the history and \n     traditions of our Nation and codified in numerous State and \n     Federal laws, including laws on health care.\n       (C) Until enactment of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111 148, in this section \n     referred to as ``PPACA''), the Federal Government has not \n     sought to impose specific coverage or care requirements that \n     infringe on the rights of conscience of insurers, purchasers \n     of insurance, plan sponsors, beneficiaries, and other \n     stakeholders, such as individual or institutional health care \n     providers.\n       (D) PPACA creates a new nationwide requirement for health \n     plans to cover ``essential health benefits'' and ``preventive \n     services'' (including a distinct set of ``preventive services \n     for women''), delegating to the Department of Health and \n     Human Services the authority to provide a list of detailed \n     services under each category, and imposes other new \n     requirements with respect to the provision of health care \n     services.\n       (E) While PPACA provides an exemption for some religious \n     groups that object to participation in Government health \n     programs generally, it does not allow purchasers, plan \n     sponsors, and other stakeholders with religious or moral \n     objections to specific items or services to decline providing \n     or obtaining coverage of such items or services, or allow \n     health care providers with such objections to decline to \n     provide them.\n       (F) By creating new barriers to health insurance and \n     causing the loss of existing insurance arrangements, these \n     inflexible mandates in PPACA jeopardize the ability of \n     individuals to exercise their rights of conscience and their \n     ability to freely participate in the health insurance and \n     health care marketplace.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that health care stakeholders retain the \n     right to provide, purchase, or enroll in health coverage that \n     is consistent with their religious beliefs and moral \n     convictions, without fear of being penalized or discriminated \n     against under PPACA; and\n       (B) to ensure that no requirement in PPACA creates new \n     pressures to exclude those exercising such conscientious \n     objection from health plans or other programs under PPACA.\n       (b) Respect for Rights of Conscience.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111 148; 42 U.S.C. \n     18022(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(6) Respecting rights of conscience with regard to \n     specific items or services.--\n       ``(A) For health plans.--A health plan shall not be \n     considered to have failed to provide the essential health \n     benefits package described in subsection (a) (or preventive \n     health services described in section 2713 of the Public \n     Health Service Act), to fail to be a qualified health plan, \n     or to fail to fulfill any other requirement under this title \n     on the basis that it declines to provide coverage of specific \n     items or services because--\n       ``(i) providing coverage (or, in the case of a sponsor of a \n     group health plan, paying for coverage) of such specific \n     items or services is contrary to the religious beliefs or \n     moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity \n     offering the plan; or\n       ``(ii) such coverage (in the case of individual coverage) \n     is contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of \n     the purchaser or beneficiary of the coverage.\n       ``(B) For health care providers.--Nothing in this title (or \n     any amendment made by this title) shall be construed to \n     require an individual or institutional health care provider, \n     or authorize a health plan to require a provider, to provide, \n     participate in, or refer for a specific item or service \n     contrary to the provider's religious beliefs or moral \n     convictions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title, a health plan shall not be considered to have failed \n     to provide timely or other access to items or services under \n     this title (or any amendment made by this title) or to \n     fulfill any other requirement under this title because it has \n     respected the rights of conscience of such a provider \n     pursuant to this paragraph.\n       ``(C) Nondiscrimination in exercising rights of \n     conscience.--No Exchange or other official or entity acting \n     in a governmental capacity in the course of implementing this \n     title (or any amendment made by this title) shall \n     discriminate against a health plan, plan sponsor, health care \n     provider, or other person because of such plan's, sponsor's, \n     provider's, or person's unwillingness to provide coverage of, \n     participate in, or refer for, specific items or services \n     pursuant to this paragraph.\n       ``(D) Construction.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) or (B) \n     shall be construed to permit a health plan or provider to \n     discriminate in a manner inconsistent with subparagraphs (B) \n     and (D) of paragraph (4).\n       ``(E) Private rights of action.--The various protections of \n     conscience in this paragraph constitute the protection of \n     individual rights and create a private cause of action for \n     those persons or entities protected. Any person or entity may \n     assert a violation of this paragraph as a claim or defense in \n     a judicial proceeding.\n       ``(F) Remedies.--\n       ``(i) Federal jurisdiction.--The Federal courts shall have \n     jurisdiction to prevent and redress actual or threatened \n     violations of this paragraph by granting all forms of legal \n     or equitable relief, including, but not limited to, \n     injunctive relief, declaratory relief, damages, costs, and \n     attorney fees.\n       ``(ii) Initiating party.--An action under this paragraph \n     may be instituted by the Attorney General of the United \n     States, or by any person or entity having standing to \n     complain of a threatened or actual violation of this \n     paragraph, including, but not limited to, any actual or \n     prospective plan sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering a \n     plan, any actual or prospective purchaser or beneficiary of a \n     plan, and any individual or institutional health care \n     provider.\n       ``(iii) Interim relief.--Pending final determination of any \n     action under this paragraph, the court may at any time enter \n     such restraining order or prohibitions, or take such other \n     actions, as it deems necessary.\n       ``(G) Administration.--The Office for Civil Rights of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services is designated to \n     receive complaints of discrimination based on this paragraph \n     and coordinate the investigation of such complaints.\n       ``(H) Actuarial equivalence.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall prohibit the Secretary from issuing regulations or \n     other guidance to ensure that health plans excluding specific \n     items or services under this paragraph shall have an \n     aggregate actuarial value at least equivalent to that of \n     plans at the same level of coverage that do not exclude such \n     items or services.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall be effective as if included in the enactment of Public \n     Law 111 148.\n\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the majority leader is leaving the \nfloor, I wish to say I am pleased he has decided to take us forward on \nthis highway bill.\n  So where do we stand? We are in a situation, here in the 21st \ncentury, where in order to move forward on a highway bill--a bill that \nfunds our highways, our roads, our bridges, and our transit systems--in \norder to move forward on a jobs bill--where 2.8 million jobs are at \nstake in this great Nation--we have to have a vote on birth control. I \nwant to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, What are you \nthinking? But if this is what you want to do, fine.\n  I want to make it clear to the people who are listening that the \nBlunt amendment would say that any insurance company and any employer \nfor any reason could deny coverage to their employees. But it is not \njust about birth control; it is any service.\n  Now, Mr. President, you serve proudly on the HELP Committee, and you \nwere very instrumental in working through the essential services that \nare covered, the preventive services that are covered. It is very \nimportant that we note what those are. We have a list of the essential \nservices and the preventive services, and what I am going to do is to \nread them. As I read them, I want people who are listening to this to \nthink about whether these services are important, and to understand \nthat under the Blunt amendment any one of these services can be denied \nby any employer, any insurance company, for any reason.\n  So I am going to list these services: Emergency services, \nhospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health treatment, \npreventive and wellness services, pediatric services, prescription \ndrugs, ambulatory patient services, rehabilitative services and \ndevices, and laboratory services.\n  Those are the categories of essential health benefits this Senate \nvoted to make sure are covered under insurance plans. That is the law. \nThe Blunt amendment would allow any insurer and any employer to deny \nany of these services for any reason. All they have to say is they have \na moral objection.\n  Let's take maternity and newborn care. If somebody works for you, and \nthey are not married and they are pregnant and are having this child, \nyou can say: From now on, I am not covering anybody who works for me \nwho isn't married because I have a moral objection.\n  Mental health treatment. You could say: I don't consider this a \ndisease. I think if God decided that somebody has mental health \nproblems, that is just the way it is. I deny that.\n  It goes on and on.\n  Emergency services. If some employer believes if you have a heart \nattack it is God's will, that is their moral belief. That is it. They \ncan deny that kind of coverage.\n  Now we go to preventive health, and I am going to read these. The \nBlunt amendment would also say any employer, any insurance company can \ndeny any of these benefits to anybody at any time.\n  So listen to these services which came, again, out of your committee. \nBreast cancer screenings. Maybe an employer doesn't believe that is \nnecessary. They could deny it. Cervical cancer screenings, hepatitis A \nand B vaccines, measles, mumps vaccine--there is some controversy over \nvaccines. Somebody could say: Well, I have a moral problem. I am not \ngoing to offer these vaccines in my plan.\n  Colorectal cancer screenings. We found out those save lives, a huge \nnumber of lives. They say the death rates are going down, because of \ncolorectal cancer screenings, by 50 percent. An employer or an \ninsurance company could deny that kind of screening.\n  Diabetes screening, cholesterol screening, blood pressure screening, \nobesity screening, tobacco cessation, autism screening, hearing \nscreening for newborns, sickle cell screening for newborns, fluoride \nsupplements, tuberculosis testing, depression screening, osteoporosis \nscreening, flu vaccines for children and the elderly, contraception--\nthere. That is what started all of this, contraception.\n  By the way, 15 percent of women who take contraceptives take them to \nprevent cancer, to prevent debilitating monthly pain, and it is even \ntaken to prevent serious skin problems that are very debilitating. But \nthere is no mention of that in the Blunt amendment. No, no.\n  HIV screening, STD screening, HPV testing, well woman visits, breast \nfeeding support, domestic violence screening, and gestational diabetes \nscreening, which is the kind of diabetes some women get when they are \npregnant.\n  So here is where we are. The Blunt amendment would take this list of \npreventive health benefits, this list of essential health benefits, and \nsend a very clear, unequivocal message to every insurer in this country \nand every employer that regardless of any other laws, if they decide \nthey have a moral objection or religious objection, they do not have to \noffer this coverage.\n  Remember what we are talking about. We are talking about coverage. We \nare not saying people have to do all of these things. If I have an \nobjection to doing any of these things, as an employee I don't have to \ndo it. But I have coverage if I decide to do it. That is the beauty of \nthe health care bill we passed. It says: Here are essential health \nbenefits; here are preventive health benefits. Employers and insurers, \nyou have to offer this coverage. If people want to take it, they can, \nand what will happen is good.\n  Now, when we hear the other side describe the Blunt amendment, they \nwill not tell you what it is. But I have a very clear take on what it \nis because I printed it out, and it says: A health plan shall not be \nconsidered to have failed to provide the essential health benefits \npackage described in subsection (a) or preventive health services \ndescribed in section 2713 if they decide they have a moral or religious \nobjection.\n  That is the basis of it. So we take that and say: OK, here are the \nessential health benefits. They no longer have any meaning. Here is the \nlist of preventive health benefits. Those are at the whim of the \nemployer, the whim of the insurance company, and it is really \ndisturbing.\n  Mr. President, you have some great career in your life, and you are a \ngreat Senator now. Before that you told a lot of great stories and a \nlot of great jokes. I have to tell you that Jon Stewart took this issue \non and said: Well, I will tell you something. I love the Blunt \namendment because I am an employer and I believe humor is the best \nmedicine. Humor is the best medicine, he said.\n  So he said: So that is what I am going to do. I have an example.\n  Then this guy comes on to the stage with a very bad cold and flu and \nhe is sneezing. He says: Mr. Stewart, do I have to have another \ntreatment now?\n  He says: Yes. And he takes a seltzer bottle and sprays it all over \nthe guy. That was his treatment because it was funny, and he was \nsupposed to laugh and that was supposed to cure this person.\n  He said: Not another treatment.\n  So in the darkest moments one finds consolation in humor. But just \nthink, there are people who believe and have a strong moral and \nreligious conviction that they don't want to take medicine. They just \nbelieve they are in the hands of God. I personally respect it 100 \npercent, and people die for their right to have that view, and I think \nthat is appropriate. We should respect religion, everybody's religion. \nSo the way to deal with that is if that individual doesn't want to ever \nbe treated, that is their choice. But, frankly, if they put at risk a \nchild who has cancer--and we have had cases like this in America where \na parent said they didn't believe in medicine--a child could be cured \nwith some cancer treatment, people have stepped in and said: We are \ngoing to make sure the child gets treatment.\n  So all we are saying in our health care bill is, here is a list of \nessential health services and preventive health services that \nscientists and doctors have told us will save our families pain and \nsuffering and cost and all the rest, and we make them available through \nthe insurer and the employer. That is all. People don't have to take \nthem, but they are available.\n  Under the Blunt amendment, if your boss happens to be a person who \ndoesn't believe in medicine, he can just say: Sorry, I am not a \nbeliever. You can have an insurance plan that may have nothing behind \nit--no services, none of these services that we worked so hard to put \ninto law.\n\n[[Page S1081]]\n\n  So it is stunning that in this year we would be on a highway bill \nanticipating a vote on Thursday on an amendment that has to do with \nwomen's health. There is a lot of concern out there because we saw when \nthis whole thing started there was a hearing in the House of \nRepresentatives where they had a panel on women's health that dealt \nwith, especially, access to birth control. Not one woman was on that \npanel, and the men decided it was wrong that women should have access \nto birth control without a copay even when the doctors and the \nscientists have said it is so important.\n  When our families are planned, what happens? There are fewer \nabortions. It is not even arguable. Fewer abortions. I would think we \ncould be in agreement on that. Fewer problems for our families, fewer \neconomic problems when they plan their families.\n  Now, if you don't want to plan your family, that is just fine. You \ndon't have to take that coverage. You don't have to take that \ncontraception.\n  So the President, in his decision, I thought, struck a great \ncompromise. What he said was, because the experts, the medical \nexperts--the Institute of Medicine told us contraception is a very \nimportant choice for people because 15 percent of them use it not just \nfor birth control but to fight disease, cancer, and cysts on their \novaries and such. Because that is important, we put it in this list of \nessential benefits, preventive benefits. But if you are a church, you \ndon't have to offer it to your employees. That is what the President \nsaid.\n  There are 335,000 religious institutions that are exempted from \nhaving to offer this through insurance. The religious-affiliated \nhospitals and universities were uncomfortable because they wanted to be \nable to not be directly connected to the contraception, and the \nPresident struck what I thought was a good compromise. He said to those \ninstitutions: OK. It will be offered to your people, but it will be \ndone by a third party.\n  Almost everyone applauded it. Catholic Charities applauded it, the \nCatholic Health Association applauded it. They represent thousands of \nproviders. Catholics United applauded it, and the bishops were still \nunhappy. But the institutions that provide the service felt the \nPresident struck a good bargain.\n  So we were all pleased. We thought this was fine because everybody's \nreligious freedom should be respected, and that is what the President \ndid. But now we have the Blunt amendment. Not only does this open a \nPandora's box, it opens a very dangerous policy. It allows insurers and \nemployers to simply say they have a moral problem with something and \nthey don't have to offer a list of services. Maybe they will do it \nbecause they really have a moral conviction, but you can't really prove \nit. Maybe they will do it because they want to save some money. We \ndon't know. But it opens a very bad situation. We have to table or beat \nthis Blunt amendment. It is very dangerous.\n  How about having it on a highway bill? I still can't get over it. \nWhen I first heard about it, I thought: What does it have to do with \nhighways? Maybe it says you can't take a birth control pill when you \nare driving on a highway. I mean, there was no connection, and there is \nno connection.\n  But the majority leader is right to get a vote. I will tell you why: \nIt is holding up our highway bill. We can't get off dead center. We \nhave been on this bill days and we can't get off dead center because my \nRepublican friends want to vote on contraception and women's health \ncare on a highway bill.\n  So we are going to do it and, hopefully, that will signal our \ngoodwill to move forward with this bill. There are 2.8 million jobs at \nstake. Our bridges are in desperate need of fixing. We have 70,000 \nbridges that are in very bad condition, and 50 percent of our roads are \nnot up to standard. We have had stories of bridges crumbling, and we \nhave had stories of highways in trouble. So we shouldn't be stuck on \nthis bill.\n  I could proudly say that Senator Inhofe and I worked in the most \nremarkable bipartisan way to get a great bill out of our committee. The \nBanking Committee did the same, Senators Johnson and Shelby. The \nCommerce Committee got a little stuck, but they are getting unstuck, \nand we are moving forward on that piece. Finance has done an excellent \njob of finding the funds for us to fill the trust fund.\n  I want you to think in your mind's eye of a football stadium that \nhosts the Super Bowl. Think of what it looks like when it is jam packed \nwith people. It is about 100,000 seats. Fifteen of those stadiums could \nbe filled with unemployed construction workers. So think about what \nthat would look like, 15 Super Bowl stadiums sold out, every seat \nfilled. That is how many unemployed construction workers we have \nbecause of the housing crisis.\n  This bill will put them back to work. In a bipartisan fashion we have \nprotected the 1.8 million jobs, and we create up to another 1 million \njobs. So I can't believe we are discussing birth control on a highway \nbill, but such is life. That is the way it is. If that is what we need \nto move this bill forward, I am happy.\n  If we have to move on some other issues that are not germane to the \nbill, I am even willing to do that, because that is really what is at \nstake. What is at stake is construction jobs. What is at stake is \nfalling bridges. I do not have to tell my friend the effect of a \nfalling bridge. We know it happens. Senator Inhofe is eloquent on the \npoint. He lost a constituent who was taking a walk and a huge piece of \na bridge fell and killed her. This is not the way to run a country that \nis the No. 1 economic power in the world.\n  I tell you, if we want to stay the No. 1 economic power in the world, \nwe cannot be stuck in traffic and have all that congestion. Billions of \nhours and billions of dollars are lost because we are not keeping up \nwith the image that was painted for us by Dwight Eisenhower way back \nwhen I was a kid when he said we need to have a network of highways \nthat run seamlessly across our Nation and connect us, one to the \nother--a national highway system. We cannot lose that vision.\n  There are some people who say: Why do we need a national system? \nLet's just have the States do it.\n  No. This is one Nation under God, indivisible. We need to be \nconnected. When the imports come in from all the various countries, \nfrom the Asian nations into Los Angeles--and 40 percent of our imports \ncome in there--we take those, we put them on trains and trucks, and \nthey get shipped out all across America to every State in the Union. \nThat is commerce. That is called commerce, interstate commerce. We need \nthe roads to be ready and able to take that kind of traffic and not \nhave a situation where so much is added to the cost of transport \nbecause there is so much congestion that we begin to lose our \neffectiveness as an economic power. That, frankly, is where we are. Not \nonly do we import, we export, so we have to take the exports to the \ncoasts, the east coast and west coast. We have a lot of opportunity to \ngo to the gulf coast. If we do not keep up with this national system of \nhighways, we are in trouble.\n  This is a great bill. This bill is a reform bill. You take it down \nfrom a lot of titles to just a couple dozen titles. We do not \noverspend. We keep spending at current levels. The Finance Committee \nhas done its job to help us build a trust fund for 2 years.\n  The last point I would make before yielding the floor because I know \nmy friend from Georgia is here, and he is my very good friend--I know \nhe has some remarks he might have on this subject or another subject, \nand he is going to talk to me as the chairman. We have some work we \nwant to do, so I am going to close it here.\n  What I want to say is that this is really close to an emergency, and \nI do not overstate it. The entire transportation program expires on \nMarch 31. That means all of our States are going to be hit with the end \nof a program that is essential to their people, to their businesses. \nThat is why we have 1,000 organizations representing millions of \npeople--from the chambers of commerce, to the AFL CIO, to the granite \npeople, to the cement people, to the general contractors; seriously, \nthe AAA--it goes on and on from A to Z, 1,000 organizations that are \nbehind our bill. They are not going to look kindly on a situation we \ncould come to, which is that we do not have a bill. You cannot just \nextend this bill because the money is not in the trust fund anymore. It \nis not like past years where you could extend it. The money is not in \nthe trust fund. If we have to cut one-\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\nthird, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of workers who would \nbe laid off.\n  I again thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, because he is \ngetting us off center here. He is getting us off that line. We are \nmoving forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no motions in \norder other than a motion to table prior to the vote in relation to \namendment No. 1520.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Remembering Dr. Young Woo Kang\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the march of progress in America can be \nmarked by the expansion of freedom. Slaves who were denied full \ncitizenship under our Constitution were given their rights with \namendments after our Civil War. Civil rights legislation in the 1960s \nhelped African Americans and others claim their rightful place in our \nsociety. And women, denied a vote in America for generations, finally \nwon that right early in the 20th century.\n  Yet it took us until nearly the end of the 20th century to \nacknowledge the rights of another group of Americans who have suffered \ndiscrimination throughout history: people with disabilities. I would \nlike to take a moment to recognize one of the heroes of the disability \nrights movement who passed away this past Thursday at the age of 68.\n  Dr. Young Woo Kang was a champion for people with disabilities in \nAmerica, his native South Korea, and throughout the world. Born in a \nsmall farming village in South Korea under the shadow of the Korean \nwar, Young Woo Kang overcame adversity to become the first blind South \nKorean to earn a Ph.D.\n  Dr. Kang's life reminds us that disability can happen to anyone at \nanytime. When he was 14 years old, a soccer injury cost him his \neyesight. He spent the next 2 years in the hospital and endured several \nsurgeries before learning that he would never regain his sight.\n  That was in 1960. At that time, there were only two professions in \nSouth Korea open to the blind: masseur and fortune teller. But Young \nWoo Kang had other plans. When he was refused admission to college \nbecause of his disability, he challenged the system and won. And when \nhe was allowed to take the college entrance exam, he scored in the top \nten--out of hundreds of students. Dr. Kang became the first blind \nperson to graduate--with highest honors--from Yonsei University, South \nKorea's oldest and most prestigious university.\n  He planned to earn a post-graduate degree in special education from \nthe University of Pittsburgh. In fact, he had already been accepted at \nthe university when he learned that South Korean policy prohibited its \ncitizens with disabilities from studying abroad.\n  He lobbied successfully to have this policy changed--not only for \nhimself but also for the thousands of other South Koreans with \ndisabilities.\n  In 1976, after obtaining his Ph.D., Dr. Kang taught international \naffairs at Taegu University in South Korea and became a disability \nrights advocate.\n  He urged the passage of legislation in Korea similar to the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and helped develop the first Braille alphabet for \nthe Korean language. He also founded Goodwill in Korea, which provides \njob training and career services to people with disabilities.\n  Dr. Kang and his wife Kyoung, or ``Kay,'' as she is known, were \nblessed with two sons, Paul and Chris. Dr. Kang and his wife both \nworked in the Gary, Indiana, public school district for decades--he as \na supervisor for special education and she as a teacher for visually \nimpaired students. He also served as an adjunct professor for \nNortheastern University in my home State of Illinois.\n  In 2002, Dr. Kang was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve \non the prestigious National Council on Disability, an independent \nfederal agency that advises the President and Congress on issues \naffecting the 54 million Americans with disabilities.\n  A moment ago I mentioned Dr. Kang's sons. Dr. Paul Kang is an \nophthalmologist and has served as the President of the Washington, DC \nMetropolitan Ophthalmological Society. Chris Kang, a familiar name to  \nmany in this Chamber, was a member of my Senate staff for 7 years. Like \nhis father, Chris is brilliant and hard-working.\n\n  After graduating from the University of Chicago and the Duke \nUniversity Law School, Chris came to work for me answering \nconstituents' letters and emails. Chris says he was drawn to public \nservice by the example of his father, who taught him that government \ncan limit people, but it can also help people.\n  He rose quickly through the office ranks, moving from answering \nletters to serving as one of my Judiciary counsels. He became my chief \nfloor counsel and served 4 years negotiating legislation, helping me \nbetter understand Senate procedure, and conducting important whip \ncounts.\n  Three years ago, Chris Kang accepted a position as Special Assistant \nto the President on the White House legislative affairs team. He has \nmade history in his own right by helping to pass such historic laws as \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Affordable Care Act, \nand the Fair Sentencing Act. Last year, Chris moved into a new \nposition, a promotion, as senior counsel in the White House Counsel's \noffice, where he is now the President's top advisor on judicial \nnominations.\n  How's that for an American success story--an immigrant father \nappointed by a Republican president and his American-born sons, a \ndoctor and Senior Counsel to a Democratic President?\n  The great humanitarian Helen Keller, who lost her hearing and her \nsight as a young child, was asked once whether she could imagine any \nfate worse than losing one's sight. She replied, ``Yes, losing one's \nvision.''\n  Like Helen Keller, Dr. Young Woo Kang lost his sight due to an \ninjury. But he was blessed with vision. That vision enabled him to \ncreate a life for himself that was almost unimaginable in the world in \nwhich he grew up. He had a vision of an America and a world in which \npeople were measured by their abilities, not their disabilities. His \nvision and courage helped to expand our own vision and make us a better \nnation.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to his wife Kay, his sons, Paul and \nChris, and his extended family, friends and colleagues. Dr. Kang lived \na life of accomplishment and inspiration. His legacy will live on \nthrough his sons and four grandchildren, including 4-month-old Katie, a \nsource of great pride for Dr. Kang. And his mission will live on \nthrough the good he achieved and the doors he opened for people with \ndisabilities in Korea and America and around the world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1520\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I would like to talk for a moment about \nreligious freedom. Our country was founded on the belief that all \nAmericans should have the right to practice their religious beliefs as \nlong as their faith does not infringe on the rights of others. This \nconcept, which is, I have the freedom to stretch out my hand as far as \nI can unless I punch Hannah here in the face--I do not have the freedom \nto do that; that is impinging on Hannah's rights--actually pertains to \nmore than just freedom of religion but our basic concepts of what \npeople's rights are, and this is an idea that is woven through our \nConstitution and our Bill of Rights. I have the right to choose my \nprofession, where I live, and I have a right to choose my doctor \naccording to my own faith, but I do not have the right to choose yours.\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\n  When we wrote the health reform bill, we made sure to account for \nthis balance. The health reform law required insurance companies to \ncover preventive health benefits without copays, and we asked the \nInstitute of Medicine to study which preventive health benefits should \nbe included. Last summer, the IOM--the Institute of Medicine--\nrecommended to the Department of Health and Human Services that \ncontraceptives should be covered, along with cancer screening, \nscreening for domestic violence, and many other services that have been \nshown to improve women's health.\n  A number of religious institutions objected to being required to \ncover contraceptive services as a preventive health benefit for their \nemployees. President Obama heeded their concerns, and he created an \nexception for churches and other religious institutions. The President \nwent even further by saying that religiously affiliated organizations \nwill not have to pay for contraceptive coverage for their employees. I \nwill say that again. A religiously affiliated, nonprofit employer will \nnot have to pay for contraceptives for their employees--and that was \napplauded by a lot of Catholic groups, for example--but the employees \nwould have the right to contraception, to exercise their religious \nrights. And very often, contraception is used as a medical preventive--\nI think 15 percent of all use of contraception is to prevent maladies \nwomen have.\n  I believe all Americans should be able to freely and fully practice \ntheir religious beliefs to the extent their practice does not infringe \non the freedom of others. I believe this freedom is at the heart of our \nsociety in America.\n  I applaud the President for finding a solution that protects \nreligious freedoms while also providing health care to nearly all \nwomen. However, my friend Senator Blunt, with whom I am actually \nworking on a separate transportation amendment, has filed a nongermane \namendment that goes much further than the President's accommodation of \nreligious employers.\n  His amendment says that any employer or health insurer could opt out \nof any essential benefit or preventive service required by the \nAffordable Care Act. All they have to do is say that their objection is \non religious or moral grounds. This amendment would upend how our \nentire insurance system works. It would allow any employer to opt out \nof covering any health care service guaranteed to Americans by the \nAffordable Care Act. This is an unprecedented proposal, one that could \nchange the structure of health care in our country much for the worse.\n  The President found a balanced approach that maintains women's access \nto health care, while allowing religiously affiliated organizations to \nopt out of paying for it. On the other hand, Senator Blunt's amendment \nwould allow employers to prohibit health plans from providing \npreventive health services guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act. For \nexample, under this amendment, an employer could object to covering \nvaccines for children. There are people in this country--I am sure many \nof them are employers--who have a moral objection to vaccines, so the \nplan would not be required to cover it or an employer could choose not \nto allow an insurer to cover maternity care for a single woman. There \nare people with moral objections to people having children outside \nmarriage. So the woman would have to pay for her prenatal care and her \nmaternity care out of pocket, if the employer just says: Oh, nope. I \nhave a moral problem with that.\n  Of course, Senator Blunt's amendment ignores the religious freedom of \nwomen to be able to access contraceptives. The President's \naccommodation a couple weeks ago protected the religious freedom of \nreligious organizations, while also protecting the religious freedom of \nthe women who are their employees. Remember, the employees have \nreligious freedom too.\n  The Blunt amendment violates the freedom of women to receive the kind \nof scientifically proven health care that she chooses--she chooses. \nThis proposal does not simply put women's access to birth control in \nthe hands of their employers, it does not simply allow politics to get \nbetween women and their doctors, it changes the way health care is \nprovided in our country. It violates a core belief in our society that \nour religious decisions are our own and that each of us, every woman \nand man in our society, has the right to make decisions about our own \nhealth for ourselves and for our families.\n  Over the last decade, we have seen proposal after proposal that would \npoliticize the decisions that women make with their doctors. Now we are \nseeing an all-out attack on women's rights to protect their health by \nusing contraceptives, something that almost all women in this country \nuse at some point in their lives. These women choose to do that. It \nconforms with their own beliefs about what is best for them.\n  I think we all believe, or almost all of us believe that women should \nhave that right. This seems to be a clear case of one person's \nreligious beliefs impinging on the rights of others. It is a deeply \nworrying case of one person's hand meeting another's face.\n  I rise to urge my colleagues to fight back against these assaults. I \nurge my friends on both sides of the aisle to think about this, to \nrespect the decisions that each woman makes about her health care, to \nprotect each woman's religious freedom, her liberty, and to oppose \nSenator Blunt's amendment to undermine this basic freedom.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Dental Crisis in America\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I am here for Senator Boxer, in terms \nof the Transportation bill, but before I get into transportation, I \nwanted to say a word on another issue that does not get the attention \nit deserves, and that is why, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nPrimary Health Care, I will be holding a hearing on the dental crisis \nin America.\n  As I think many Americans know--although they do not hear a whole lot \nabout it--we as a Nation are in the midst of a very severe dental \ncrisis. More than 47 million Americans live in places where it is \ndifficult to get dental care. About 17 million low-income children \nreceived no dental care in 2009. One quarter of adults in the United \nStates ages 65 or older have lost all of their teeth. Low-income adults \nare almost twice as likely as higher income adults to have gone without \na dental checkup in the previous year.\n  I should tell you that bad dental health impacts overall health care. \nWhen you talk about dental care, you are talking about health care in \ngeneral. If people have bad teeth or no teeth, they are unable to \ndigest their food, which causes digestive problems. People who have \npoor teeth can get infections leading to very serious health problems. \nAnd, in fact, there are instances where people have actually died \nbecause of poor teeth and infections. Furthermore, the risk for \ndiabetes, heart disease, and poor birth outcomes are also significant \nif people are not having their teeth well maintained.\n  Since 2006, there were over 830,000 visits to emergency rooms across \nthe country because we have a lot of low-income people who are in \nsevere pain and they can't find a dentist. So they go into an emergency \nroom, and I suspect maybe they get their tooth extracted or get some \npain killer. But that is certainly not an adequate substitute for \nproviding the dental care that all Americans need.\n  Almost 60 percent of children ages 5 to 17 have cavities, making \ntooth decay 5 times more common than asthma among children of this age. \nIn fact, as I understand it, the single most prevalent reason for \nchildren being absent from school is, in fact, dental problems.\n  In the midst of the severe need for more dentists, what is happening \nis our dentists in our dental communities are becoming older and many \nof them are retiring. In fact, we need a lot more new dentists to \nreplace those who are retiring. The sad truth is that more dentists \nretire each year than there are dental school graduates to replace \nthem.\n  One of the other problems we are facing is that only 20 percent of \nthe Nation's practicing dentists provide care\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\nto people with Medicaid. So that is a serious problem. We need more \ndentists but, equally important, we need to make sure that dentists are \nproviding service to the people who need it the most. And one of the \nsad realities of contemporary dental life is that only 20 percent of \nthe Nation's practicing dentists provide care to people who are on \nMedicaid, and only an extremely small percentage devote a substantial \npart of their practice to caring for those who are underserved.\n  The current access problem is exacerbated by the fact that private \npractices are often located in middle-class and wealthy suburbs. What \nwe need is to bring dentists into those areas where people need dental \ncare the most. That is certainly something we need to do.\n  Further, we need to expand Medicaid and other dental insurance \ncoverage. One-third of Americans do not have dental coverage. \nTraditional Medicare for seniors does not cover dental services. States \ncan choose whether their Medicaid Programs provide coverage for dental \ncare for adults, and the truth is many of them do not.\n  Let me give some good news, though, in terms of where we are making \nsome progress. Recently--and I have been active in this effort--there \nhas been an expansion of federally qualified community health centers. \nCommunity health centers provide health and dental care to anybody in \nthe area regardless of their ability to pay. We now have a situation \nwhere community health centers are providing dental services to over \n3\\1/2\\ million people across the country.\n  I am happy to say in the State of Vermont, in recent years, we have \nseen a very significant increase not only in community health centers \nin general but in community health centers that are providing state-of-\nthe-art dental care. We have beautiful new facilities located in \nRichford, in the northern part of our State; in Plainfield, VT, in the \ncentral part of our State; and in Rutland. Burlington is just \ndeveloping a beautiful new dental facility.\n  Furthermore, one of the areas where I think we are seeing some \nprogress not only in Vermont but around the country--and which I think \nhas huge potential--is putting dental offices right in schools. I know \nin Burlington, VT, we helped bring that about some years ago, and we \nhave kids from all over the city of Burlington getting their dental \ncare at one particular school. It is working phenomenally well, and we \nhave similar programs in Bennington and Richford.\n  I did want to mention that I think the time is now for the Congress \nto begin addressing this issue. One of the things I have done recently \non my Web site--which is sanders.senate.gov--I have asked people in \nVermont and all over the country to tell us their stories in terms of \nwhat happens if they do not or if members of their family don't have \naccess to dental care. We have received more than 1,200 stories from \nVermont and all over this country. Those stories are heartbreaking \nbecause they tell the tales of people who are suffering every day \nbecause they simply don't have the money to go to a dentist to take \ncare of their dental needs. These are parents who are worried about \ntheir kids and pointing out how hard it is to find affordable dental \ncare in their communities. So if people want to write my office, they \ncan go to my Web site, sanders.senate.gov, and we would love to hear \nfrom them. Because I think there are a lot of stories out there that \nare not being told.\n  What I wish to do now is to read from a publication that we have just \nproduced called ``Dental Crisis in America: The Need to Expand \nAccess.'' This will be distributed and released tomorrow at our \nhearing, but I did want to read a few stories which I think speak to \nthe experience that a whole lot of people from one end of this country \nto the other are having regarding lack of access to dental care.\n  This is from a woman named Heather Getty, who lives in East \nFairfield, VT, in the northern part of our State. This is what she \nsays:\n\n       My husband and I and our four kids are the working poor. We \n     have to think about rent and electricity before we think \n     about dental care. My wisdom teeth have been a problem for \n     over a decade now. I take ibuprofen and just keep on going. \n     My husband has not seen a dentist since he was a teenager. \n     He's afraid of the costs if they find something. So it's been \n     20 years. Because of Vermont's Dr. Dynasaur program, at least \n     my children have been lucky enough to have regular cleanings, \n     but I have to comb through the Yellow Pages to find an office \n     who will accept their coverage. One time I missed an \n     appointment because my car broke down, and when I called to \n     reschedule, they told me that we had been blacklisted and \n     that no one from my family could be seen by that office \n     again. We've learned over the years how important dental care \n     is. If you get preventive care early, you are less likely to \n     have problems later on.\n\n  That is from Heather Getty in East Fairfield, VT.\n  Let me read a statement from Shawn Jones in Brattleboro, VT.\n\n       Last year, I had a toothache that was so painful, I had \n     trouble eating and sleeping. My girlfriend is also covered by \n     Medicaid so I called her dentist, but they wouldn't see me. \n     So I called 12 more dentists in the area, but they all said \n     the same thing: They weren't taking new Medicaid patients. A \n     few said to call back in three months, which seems like a \n     long time to live with a bad toothache. Finally, someone from \n     Office of Vermont Health Access helped me get an emergency \n     voucher to get my tooth pulled. I'm just grateful that my \n     girlfriend had a car to get me there.\n\n  That is just a couple of the statements that came from Vermont, and \nin fact from all over the country. But let me read a statement from Dr. \nDavid Nash, who is the William R. Willard Professor of Dental \nEducation, Professor of Pediatric Dentistry, College of Dentistry, \nUniversity of Kentucky in Lexington. Dr. Nash writes:\n\n       Society has granted the profession of dentistry the \n     exclusive right and privilege of caring for the oral health \n     of the nation's children. Unfortunately, the dental delivery \n     system in place today does not provide adequate access to \n     care for our children. In many instances it is because few \n     dentists will accept Medicaid payments. In other countries of \n     the world, children's oral health is cared for by dental \n     therapists, primarily in school-based programs. This results \n     in an overwhelming majority of children being able to receive \n     care. Dental therapists as utilized internationally do not \n     create a two-tiered system of care. They have extensive \n     training in caring for children, significantly more than the \n     typical graduate of our nation's dental \n     schools. International research supports the high quality \n     of care dental therapists provide. The time has arrived \n     for the United States to develop a new workforce model to \n     care for our children's oral health.\n\n  What Dr. Nash is talking about is another issue we will be discussing \ntomorrow in the hearing; that is, it is clear from international \nstudies and, in fact, from some States in the United States that there \nare well-trained people who can take care of certain types of dental \nproblems who are not dentists. I think that is an area we need to \nexplore--how can we expand the dental profession to include people who \ndo not graduate dental school but who have the qualifications to take \ncare of a variety of dental problems?\n  Let me read another story that comes from Vermont regarding what \nhappens if you don't have dental care. It is from Kiah Morris from \nBennington, VT.\n\n       When I was pregnant, I had a tooth infection that had \n     gotten into my lymph nodes and I needed a root canal, but \n     adult Medicaid has a $495 cap, which wasn't enough. Dental \n     care shouldn't be a luxury.\n\n  What she is saying is that in Vermont and in many other States where \nyou do have Medicaid helping out for dental care for low-income people, \nthere is often a cap, and that cap is much too low to provide the \nservices many folks need.\n  So the bottom line is that we have a crisis in terms of access to \ndental care in this country. We lag behind many other countries around \nthe world in that regard. We have many people who have no dental \ninsurance at all. Some who do have dental insurance, such as my family, \nhave very limited coverage--I think it is about $1,000 a year. \nMeanwhile, the cost of dental care is sky-high, and we are also going \nto explore why that is so. I am not sure I understand or many people \nunderstand why dental care is as expensive as it is. What I do know is \nthat there is a city in northern Mexico whose function in life is to \nprovide dental care for Americans who go down below the border because \nthey can't afford dental care in this country.\n  There is a serious problem. People don't have dental insurance. Low-\nincome people don't have access to dental care. We have many dentists \nout there who are not accepting Medicaid patients or, if they are \naccepting Medicaid patients, they are accepting very few of them.\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\n  The population of our dentists in general is getting older, and we \nare losing more of them to retirement than we are seeing graduates of \ndental school. Even the dentists who are graduating are often not \nmigrating to the areas where we need them the most. Many dentists are \ninvolved in making our teeth white and shiny and our smiles very \nbeautiful, but meanwhile in those communities there are people who are \nseeing the teeth in their mouth rot away, there are kids who have \ndental problems, and they are not getting the treatment they need.\n  I hope that tomorrow at the hearing we are going to bring forth some \ngreat panelists. We will be talking about the issue. I intend, as soon \nas we can, to introduce comprehensive legislation to make sure every \nperson in this country has access to affordable and decent-quality \ndental care.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are debating the Transportation bill, \nso let me say a few words about transportation.\n  I think everybody in this country--or at least anybody who gets into \nan automobile and drives around--understands that we have a major \ninfrastructural crisis in this country and that it is becoming more \ndire each passing year.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers has reported that we should \nbe investing $2.2 trillion over the next 5 years simply to get our \nroads, bridges, transit, and aviation to a passable condition. This is \nmore than eight times the annual rate of spending proposed in the bill \nunder consideration.\n  The first point I think we should acknowledge is that the legislation \nbefore us, which I support and which is significantly a step forward, \nis a very modest proposal going nowhere near as far as we should be \ngoing.\n  Clearly, I see when I go home to Vermont, and I am sure you see when \nyou go home to Pennsylvania, the very apparent infrastructural needs we \nas a nation face. In my State of Vermont, just under one-third of \nVermont's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. \nAbout one-third of Vermont's bridges are structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. Thirty-six percent of our Federal aid roads are \nin need of major repairs. In fact, a recent national report ranked \nVermont's rural roads as the worst in the Nation, and that was before \nthe very terrible storm we experienced, Tropical Storm Irene, which \ncaused hundreds of millions of additional dollars of damage to our \nroads.\n  I think the point here is not a complicated point. I was a mayor for \n8 years, and I had to deal with the roads and the water system in the \ncity of Burlington, and I think I speak for every mayor in the world \nwhen I tell you that infrastructure does not get better all by itself. \nI think we can all agree that if you do nothing, if you do not invest \nin repairs, it is just not going to get better. In fact, it will get \nworse.\n  It is really dumb that we as a nation end up spending a lot more \nmoney than we should in repairing our roads and bridges and water \nsystems because we don't adequately fund maintenance. If you keep up \ngood repair, it will end up costing you less money. If you ignore them \nand they deteriorate and you need to massively rebuild them, it ends up \nbeing a much more expensive proposition.\n  So as a nation what we should be doing is properly maintaining our \ninfrastructure, investing a certain sum every single year. And I should \ntell you that compared to the rest of the world, we do not do a \nparticularly good job of that. Right now, the United States invests \njust 2.4 percent of our GDP on infrastructure. Europe invests twice \nthat amount, and China invests almost four times our rate. Roughly 9 \npercent of their GDP goes to infrastructure. So in terms of our own \nneeds, we are falling behind. Internationally, other countries are \ndoing a lot better than we are.\n\n  Equally important is that we are in the midst of the worst economic \ndownturn since the Great Depression. If you look at those people who \nhave given up looking for work, those people who are working part time \nor want to work full time, real unemployment in this country is not \njust the official 8.2 percent, it is closer to 15 percent. And what \neconomists tell us is that if we are serious about creating jobs, \ninvesting in infrastructure is probably the best way to do that. It is \nthe easiest way to create meaningful, decent-paying jobs. For every $1 \nbillion of Federal funds spent, we can create or maintain nearly 35,000 \njobs. Given the economic crisis we face, that is exactly what we should \nbe doing.\n  In addition to preserving more than 1.8 million jobs, the legislation \nwe are dealing with today, which is being presented by Senators Boxer \nand Inhofe, will create up to 1 million new jobs by expanding the TIFIA \nProgram--a measure championed by Chairperson Boxer. This is an \nextremely important issue. It is important for our productivity because \nwhen you have a crumbling infrastructure, productivity suffers. It is \nimportant in terms of international competition. It is important in \nterms of job creation. It is important in order to provide a basic need \nfor millions of Americans.\n  People do not want to drive on roads which are falling apart, that \nhave huge potholes. People want to make sure when they go over a \nbridge, that bridge will not collapse. People want to make sure we have \na strong rail system, not a rail system which, in fact, is far behind \nthose of Europe, Japan, and China.\n  This bill, while modest in terms of our needs, is a step forward. It \nis a bipartisan bill. I hope we can get to it and pass it as quickly as \npossible because the infrastructure needs of this country are great, \nand they must be addressed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the achievements of \nthe U.S. Senate Youth Program, USSYP, an organization that has molded \nsome of our Nation's brightest students to become the next generation \nof public servants.\n  This year marks 50 years of a commitment to educate and nurture \ntalented young leaders interested in serving their communities. The \nUSSYP hails from a strong family that valued bipartisanship and \ndemocratic lawmaking. William Randolph Hearst's sons, George R. Hearst \nand Randolph A. Hearst, envisioned this program and brought it to life \nwith the collaboration of then-Senators Tom Kuchel, R CA, Mike \nMansfield, D MT, Everett Dirksen, R Ill., and Hubert Humphrey, D MN.\n  The USSYP was created by S. Res. 324 in 1962 ``to increase young \nAmericans' understanding of the interrelationships of the three \nbranches of government, the caliber and responsibilities of federally \nelected and appointed officials, and the vital importance of democratic \ndecision making not only for America but for people around the world.''\n  I would also like to commend the State departments of education \nacross the country that select the outstanding students each year and \nthe Department of Defense, which provides competitively selected \nmilitary officers from every service branch to serve as guides and \nmentors to the students during the program. The Hearst Foundations have \ncontinued to administer and fund the program since inception, including \ncollege scholarships for each student given with the encouragement\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\nto continue their studies in history and government.\n  This year, 104 impressive student delegates were selected because of \ntheir outstanding leadership abilities and volunteer work by the chief \neducational officer from each State to travel to Washington and serve \nas young ``senators'' from their respective States for 1 week. They \nwill keep a busy schedule attending meetings and briefings with \nSenators and congressional staff, the President, a Justice of the \nSupreme Court, leaders of Cabinet agencies, an ambassador to the United \nStates, and top members of the national media.\n  The USSYP has a proud roster of more than 5,000 alumni of the program \nwho continue to use the skills they learned from their experience as \ndelegates and many of whom have become public servants.\n  I am proud to serve as an honorary cochair of the program, and I send \nmy best wishes to each of the students selected to represent their \nStates during Washington Week. I especially send my sincere \ncongratulations to the two Nevada delegates, Daniel Waqar of Las Vegas \nand Benjamin Link of Eureka.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/28/senate-section/article/S1086-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING JUDGE ROGER J. MINER\n\n Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a truly \nbrilliant and dedicated jurist who served New York and the Nation as a \npublic servant his entire life. On Saturday, February 18, 2012, I was \nheartbroken to learn that my mentor and friend, Judge Roger J. Miner, a \nU.S. Court of Appeals judge for the Second Circuit, passed away of \nnatural causes in his home in Hudson, NY.\n  I was extremely fortunate to have had the privilege to work with \nJudge Miner as a law clerk, when he served in the Northern District of \nNew York. I cherished his confidence and support in all my endeavors \nand I feel blessed to have been able to call him a personal friend and \nmentor. He not only taught me clear legal analysis, but also inspired \nme with his integrity, fairness, and great love of public service. I \nwill always remember his generosity, kindness and great intellect that \ntaught me so much.\n  Born in Hudson, Judge Miner received his bachelor's degree from State \nUniversity of New York at Albany and his law degree from New York Law \nSchool with honors in 1956, where he served as managing editor of the \nLaw Review.\n  Judge Miner was admitted to practice in New York and in the U.S. \nCourt of Military Appeals in 1956. Serving on active military duty from \n1956 to 1959, Judge Miner was awarded the Commendation Ribbon with \nMedal Pendant for his work on the revision of the Manual for Courts-\nMartial. He was admitted to the Bar of the Republic of Korea in 1958. \nJudge Miner later was honorably discharged in October 1964 with the \nrank of captain in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, in the U.S. Army \nReserve.\n  Judge Miner wrote Ohio State Law Journal Volume 67 in 2006 where he \ndescribes his defense of a person he believes to be the last civilian \ntried by court martial. The trial was conducted in Korea in 1958 during \nJudge Miner's service as an officer in the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps of the U.S. Army. Although a challenge to the jurisdiction of the \ncourt martial was rejected and the civilian defendant's conviction was \nset aside for another reason at trial--the Supreme Court ultimately \ndecided that courts-martial have no jurisdiction over civilians. This \ndevelopment also led to the passage of the Military Extraterritorial \nJurisdiction Act to allow for prosecution in U.S. District Courts of \ncivilians employed by or accompanying the Armed Forces overseas.\n  After leaving active duty, he returned to Hudson, NY, to practice law \nwith his father, and served as the city's corporation counsel from 1961 \nto 1964.\n  Judge Miner served as an assistant district attorney of Columbia \nCounty, and soon after became district attorney of Columbia County \nuntil 1975. The following year, he was elected as justice of the New \nYork State Supreme Court, Third Judicial District, where he served for \nfive years.\n  Judge Miner was nominated in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan to the \nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. In 1985, \nPresident Reagan promoted Judge Miner to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit, where he served for nearly three decades.\n  Judge Miner was one of three finalists considered to fill a seat on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court in the late 1980s, but ultimately was not \nnominated because he openly supported a woman's right to choose. As his \nwife Jacqueline has recalled she urged him to lie and say he was \nopposed to choice. He said, ``My reputation is too big a price to pay \nfor a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.'' This is an example of one of \nthe many courageous choices he made throughout his life, where he put \nhis integrity and what was right ahead of personal ambition or \npolitical expediency.\n  Judge Miner was an adjunct professor for his alma mater, New York Law \nSchool, and for Albany Law School. He also served as a member of the \nboard of trustees of the Practicing Law Institute. He held honorary \ndegrees from New York Law School, Albany Law School, and Syracuse \nUniversity.\n  Judge Miner is survived by his wonderful wife of 36 years Jacqueline, \nfour sons, Larry, Ronald, Ralph, and Mark; his brother Lance, six \ngrandchildren, a nephew and a niece, and his extended family. My \nthoughts and prayers are with his family.\n  Mr. President, I ask all members of this esteemed body to join me as \nwe honor the life and legacy of Judge Roger J. Miner. Our country has \nlost a great leader, and a fine jurist who will be deeply missed in New \nYork and across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/28/senate-section/article/S1086-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1086-S1087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor and \nprivilege to recognize the work of Arkansas Children's Hospital, ACH, \non the occasion of its centennial celebration. Founded in 1912, ACH has \nbeen at the forefront of pediatric medicine in Arkansas and across the \nNation for the last century. Friends and supporters of ACH will gather \non March 5, 2012, to celebrate 100 years of ACH history and care to the \nchildren of Arkansas, and I join with them in congratulating Arkansas \nChildren's Hospital on its 100th birthday.\n  Designed originally to serve as an orphanage for the underprivileged \nchildren in Arkansas, the Arkansas Children's Home Society was \nestablished on March 2, 1912, with a mission to provide and care for \nthe neediest children in Arkansas. Dr. Orlando P. Christian became the \nfirst superintendent of the society and soon laid out a vision to build \na children's hospital. Kicking off a fundraising campaign for the new \nhospital in 1919, Dr. Christian stirred attendees with a moving speech \nand concluded by asking, ``The question is no longer what shall we do, \nbut how and when shall we begin our task?''\n  It took only 7 years for this goal to become a reality when the \nhospital opened on March 9, 1926, with only two beds but a fully \nequipped operating room. In the years following, Arkansas Children's \nHome and Hospital, as it was then known, would face various challenges \nand triumphs as it continued to add new facilities and services in \nsupport of its mission. When Dr. Christian retired in 1933, Mrs. Ruth \nOlive Beall became the new superintendent. Her 27-year tenure brought \nthe facility through the difficulties of the Great Depression and World \nWar II and saw the institution formally become Arkansas Children's \nHospital.\n  The Burn Center opened in 1953 and continues to be the only center of \nits kind in the State, treating over 2,000 adults and children every \nyear. The Heart Center at ACH is one of the premier centers in the \ncountry. In 2011, doctors at the Heart Center performed an astonishing \ntotal of 31 heart transplants, bringing new life and hope to dozens of \nchildren and families. In an effort to expand medical care across the \nState, ACH added a helicopter to its transport services in 1985. Now, \nmore than 1,200 children each year are brought safely to ACH through \nthe Angel One transport helicopters. This addition had a significant \nimpact on the State's infant mortality rate and continues to provide \nchildren across the State expanded access to the excellent medical care \nat Arkansas Children's Hospital. As they like to say,\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\n``Arkansas Children's Hospital and Angel One are dedicated to providing \nCare, Love and Hope . . . at 180 miles per hour.''\n  With each passing year, ACH continues to reinvent itself and add \nvital services necessary for the care of its patients. This summer, the \nnew South Wing will give ACH its largest expansion to date, with a \nbrandnew ER, NICU, Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit, and multiple new \nclinic spaces. This wing will bring ACH to a total of 370 patient \nrooms. For a facility that started with only two beds, Dr. Christian \nwould be proud of the century of progress made at Arkansas Children's \nHospital.\n  Mr. President, when the original orphanage was established in 1912, \nit had a simple mission: to provide and care for the neediest children \nin Arkansas. A century later, Arkansas Children's Hospital continues to \nhold fast to that mission and provide world-class care to every child, \nwithout regard to the family's ability to pay. I am proud of the work \nACH and its staff does for the children in Arkansas and across our \nNation. My State is truly blessed to have such great care, and I am \nexcited to see the ways this institution will continue to expand in the \nyears to come. I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating \nArkansas Children's Hospital on 100 years of service in Arkansas and in \nwishing ACH another 100 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/28/senate-section/article/S1087-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRESIDENTIAL POLICY DIRECTIVE ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT \nSECTION 1022 OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                              2012--PM 42\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Attached is the text of a Presidential Policy Directive establishing \nprocedures to implement section 1022 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112 81) (the \n``Act''), which I hereby submit to the Congress, as required under \nsection 1022(c)(1) of the Act.
