Madam President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 365, \nS. 2343.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to calendar No. 365, S. 2343, a bill to \n     amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend the reduced \n     interest rate for Federal Direct Stafford Loans, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, following my remarks and those, if any, of \nthe Republican leader, the Senate will begin debate on several motions \nto proceed to Republican budget resolutions. Consent was asked last \nnight, I am quite sure, that the first hour be equally divided between \nthe two leaders, with the majority controlling the first half and \nRepublicans the final half. That is already done?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. There will be up to 6 hours of debate on the motions to \nproceed to the budget resolutions. Senators should expect five rollcall \nvotes around 4 p.m. if all time is used, and it probably will be.\n\n\n                       Measure Placed on Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, S. 3187 is at the desk and due for a \nsecond reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3187) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to revise and extend the user-fee programs for \n     prescription drugs and medical devices, to establish user-fee \n     programs for generic drugs and biosimilars, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to this legislation at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbill shall be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                             Obstructionism\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is almost universally acknowledged that \nRepublican obstructionism has reached new heights in the Senate. There \nare separate articles written about it. There are even now books \nwritten about it. Democrats would have to break a filibuster, I guess, \nto declare the sky blue or the Earth round, and passing the most \ncommonsense and consensus legislation could take weeks or months. So \nwith a mile-long list to do, we can't afford to waste any time. Yet \ntoday Republicans will force the Senate to waste a day on a series of \npolitical show votes. We will spend hours debating and voting on a \nhandful of nonbinding budget resolutions even though we already have a \nlegally binding budget. If one of the Republicans' budgets passed--\nwhich it won't--by law, it is nonbinding. We have a binding budget \nresolution.\n  The Senate could spend the day passing tax cuts for small businesses \nthat grow and hire people or even legislation to keep the Food and Drug \nAdministration running. We could be considering the Paycheck Fairness \nAct, ensuring American women receive equal pay for equal work. We could \nbe debating cybersecurity legislation, and the Pentagon says the No. 1 \nissue facing this country today is cyber-insecurity. We could be \nworking on a farm bill. Senators Stabenow and Roberts have done such an \noutstanding job saving the country $23 billion and reducing the debt by \nthat much. We should be on that bill. We could be protecting 7 million \nstudents from rate hikes on their Federal loans. We could even move a\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nseries of appropriations bills to implement the budget we have already \nenacted. Instead, we will debate and vote on a series of stunt budgets.\n  Republicans aren't interested in getting anything done this year. \nThey have said so from the very beginning. Their leader, my friend from \nKentucky, has said the No. 1 issue is to defeat President Obama. So \nthey don't mind wasting a day of the Senate's time on useless political \nshow votes.\n  Republicans can say over and over that they are only forcing votes on \nfour Republican budgets today because Democrats failed to pass their \nown budget. That couldn't be further from the truth. In August Congress \npassed and President Obama signed a budget that reduces the deficit by \nmore than $2 trillion. It is called the Budget Control Act. Twenty-\neight Republican Senators, including my friend the minority leader, \nvoted for that last legally binding budget. But since August those \nRepublicans have developed a case of amnesia. Why else would they walk \naround Washington claiming we don't have a budget? And unlike the \nhollow Republican budget resolutions the Senate will waste the day \ndebating, the Budget Control Act actually has the force of law. If \nRepublicans were serious about reducing the deficit, they wouldn't be \nworking so hard to undo that August law, which cuts more than $2 \ntrillion from the deficit.\n\n  Democrats agree that the across-the-board cuts to domestic spending \nand defense programs--agreed to in the Budget Control Act--aren't the \nideal way to solve our Nation's fiscal problems. But the cuts were \ndesigned to be tough so lawmakers were forced to reach a balanced deal. \nUnfortunately, Republicans refuse to be reasonable. They refuse to \nraise even a penny of new revenue or ask millionaires to contribute \ntheir fair share to help reduce our deficit. And Democrats won't agree \nto a one-sided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while \nforcing the middle class to bear all the hardship. The American people \nagree with this.\n  These four stunt budgets all take that one-sided approach, which \nprotects wealthy special interests at the expense of ordinary \nAmericans, and they clearly illuminate the Republicans' priorities--to \nshower the wealthy with tax breaks paid for by the middle class. All \nfour of the Republican plans cut investments that help middle-class \nfamilies get back on their feet in order to increase tax breaks for \nbusinesses that ship jobs overseas. All four plans would double the \nstudent loan rate. It would put colleges out of reach for many students \nin order to protect tax loopholes for special interests. All four plans \nend Medicare as we know it, gutting seniors' health benefits to lavish \nmore tax breaks on millionaires and billionaires.\n  Yesterday the Senate showed it is possible to advance policies that \nimprove our economy and put Americans back to work as long as Democrats \nand Republicans work together. On an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote \nyesterday, we passed the Export-Import Bank reauthorization that will \nsupport 300,000 jobs during the next year, and these jobs will help \nAmerican companies sell their products overseas. But every moment we \nwaste refighting old battles or revisiting Republicans' failed economic \npolicies is time that could be better spent creating jobs. The time for \nshow votes is over. Now it is time for the Senate to get back to work \nputting Americans back to work.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, before I was Republican leader, I was \nprobably best known as a lonely warrior against campaign finance reform \non the grounds that it violates the first amendment right to free \nspeech. Before that, I was probably best known--at least in some \nquarters--for an ad that I ran in my first Senate campaign that \nfeatured a pack of bloodhounds running around looking for my opponent, \nwho had missed so many votes giving paid speeches around the country \nthat we thought we should call him out on it. Well, I can't help but \nthink back on that ad when it comes to Senate Democrats and the Federal \nbudget. Where in the world is it? Where is the budget?\n  We have a nearly $16 trillion debt. We are borrowing more than 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend. Entitlements are going broke. Millions \nare out of work. And Senate Democrats can't even put a plan on a piece \nof paper so we can have a vote. What are they doing over there? What \nare they doing?\n  Isn't anybody over there embarrassed by the fact that they haven't \noffered a budget in 3 years? It has been 3 years since the Democrat-led \nSenate felt it needed to put a budget together so the American people \ncan see what their priorities are and what they plan to do to fix this \nmess, 3 years in which they have completely abdicated their \nresponsibility as the majority party to show the American people what \nthey stand for, to put their vision in black and white for all the \nworld to see. The fact is they don't have it. They don't have a budget.\n  As far as I can tell, their only plan is to take shots at our plans \nand hope nobody notices that they don't have one of their own. They are \nso unserious, they won't even vote for a budget that was written by a \nPresident of their own party. It doesn't get more irresponsible than \nthat.\n  I think Treasury Secretary Geithner summed it up pretty well when he \nwas asked a few months ago what the administration planned to do to \naddress entitlements--the single biggest driver of the national debt. \nHere is what the Secretary of the Treasury had to say:\n\n       We're not coming before you today to say we have a definite \n     solution to that long-term problem. What we do know is, we \n     don't like yours.\n\n  You have to give the guy points for candor--no plan of his own, but \nhe doesn't like ours. What breathtaking disregard for the problems we \nface.\n  So if you are looking for a simple three-word description of the \nDemocratic approach to the problems we face, it is this: Duck and \ncover. Duck and cover. They don't have a budget of their own. They are \ngoing to vote against their own President's budget later today, in all \nlikelihood, and they are going to vote against every budget Republicans \nput up.\n  Now, the majority leader has tried to get around all this by \nsuggesting that the Budget Control Act we negotiated last fall should \ncount as a budget since it sets the top-line amount we are going to \nspend. But he knows as well as I do that is not a budget. A budget is a \nlist of priorities. It reflects your values as a party. It shows the \ntough choices you are willing to make. It is not just dollar figures, \nit is a vision. It is the responsibility of any majority party to put \none together, to stand and be counted. But since Democrats refuse to do \ntheir duty by the Nation, Republicans will attempt to do it for them.\n  Later today we will vote on five different budget proposals: the \nPresident's, Congressman Paul Ryan's, Senator Pat Toomey's, Senator \nPaul's, and Senator Mike Lee's. We will give Democrats a choice and see \nif they have the courage to get behind any of these proposals--or none \nof them--and we will learn a lot in the process.\n  By the end of the day we will know whether there is a budget that \nWashington Democrats support, and the American people will know without \na doubt who is voting for solutions in this town and who isn't. They \nwill know who has a plan to fix the mess we are in and who doesn't. \nThey will know who would rather spend their time criticizing others \nthan doing the hard work of setting priorities and making choices.\n  Senate Democrats do not want to explain how they will fix the fiscal \nmess we are in. They do not want to say how they will preserve and \nstrengthen entitlements. What they want to do is complain about others. \nThey are putting their desire for campaign material ahead of their \nresponsibility to govern.\n  The tragedy is every year they do so, the problems we face only get \nworse. The debt gets bigger, entitlements get closer to insolvency, and \nthe American people have to go another year wondering when things will \never change.\n  Some people up here think it is time to do something now and we will \nknow who those people are by their votes.\n  Madam President, I now ask the Chair execute the order with respect \nto the five motions to proceed to the budget resolutions provided for \nunder the order.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3183-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3183-S3222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nS.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 6 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees, with the majority controlling the first 30 minutes and \nthe Republicans controlling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this is a consequential discussion \ntoday. It is a question of the future economic policy of the United \nStates. That is what we are talking about here today. I just heard the \nRepublican leader say there is no budget. I don't know how to say this, \nbut sometimes I wonder if colleagues pay attention to what they are \nvoting on here. Last year in August we did not pass a budget \nresolution; instead, we passed a budget law.\n  Anybody who has had 10th grade civics knows a law is stronger than \nany resolution. A resolution is purely a congressional document. It \nnever goes to the President for his signature. A law has to pass both \nbodies and be signed by the President. Last year, instead of a budget \nresolution, we did a budget law called the Budget Control Act.\n  The Budget Control Act set the budget for the next 2 years, for this \nyear and next. More than that, it set 10 years of spending caps, saving \n$900 billion. In addition, the Budget Control Act gave a special \ncommittee the authority to reform the tax system and the entitlement \nsystem of the country, and it said: If you come to an agreement, \nspecial committee, your action cannot be filibustered. You have to go \nright to the floor for a vote. And if you do not agree, there will be \nan additional $1.2 trillion of spending cuts put in place.\n  The special committee did not agree, so that additional $1.2 trillion \nof spending cuts is now the law, in addition to the $900 billion of \nspending cuts. That is a total spending cut package of more than $2 \ntrillion. That is the biggest spending cut package in the history of \nthe United States. For our colleagues to say there are no spending \nlimits in place--really? What is the Budget Control Act, then? It is a \nlaw passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. It passed in the House. It was \nsigned by the President of the United States.\n  Why are they engaged in this diversion? I think I know why. Because \nthe last time our colleagues on the other side were in control, when \nthey had it all, the House, the Senate, the White House--from 2001 to \n2006 they had both Houses of Congress, until 2008 they had the White \nHouse, so of course nothing could be changed in terms of the policies \nthey put in place until we had a new President. And what happened when \nthey had total control and their policies were in place? Republican \npolicies led the United States to the brink of financial collapse. That \nis what happened. Do you know what they want to do now? They want to go \nback to those failed policies and do it all over again.\n  We cannot let them do that. That would be a disaster for this \ncountry. It would be a disaster for the world's economy. I do not know \nwhat could be more clear than when their policies were in place they \nbrought this Nation to the brink of financial collapse. I remember \nthose days. I remember being called to a special meeting in this \nbuilding with the leaders of the House and the Senate and the head of \nthe Treasury Department under President Bush and the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, who told us if they did not take certain actions the \nnext day there would be a financial collapse in the United States \nwithin days. I was in the room when the rescue for the major financial \ninstitutions in this country was designed and we were told, late on a \nSaturday night, if we did not reach agreement by the next day the Asian \nmarkets would open Sunday night and they would collapse and our markets \nwould open the next Monday and they would collapse.\n  Barack Obama was not the President; George W. Bush was the President. \nThe Republican economic policies had been put in place in 2001, in \n2002, in 2003, and those policies were still in place when we came \nclose to collapse. We do not forget.\n  Let's go back to what happened with the private sector jobs picture. \nAt the end of the Bush administration we were losing 800,000 jobs a \nmonth. Now we are gaining 130,000 in the last month. In the months \nbefore that, immediately preceding, we were gaining about 200,000 jobs \na month. We have had a gain, now that the economy has started to turn \naround under this President, of 4 million jobs created in the private \nsector.\n  There it is. The red line is the results of the last time the \nRepublicans controlled the policy here--job losses every month. \nFinally, under this President things have begun to turn around. Instead \nof losing jobs we are gaining jobs, and the same is true on economic \ngrowth. On economic growth the record is very clear. In the last \nquarter of the Bush administration the economy was shrinking at a rate \nof almost 9 percent. You can see it there, that long red bar--the \neconomy in the last quarter of the Bush administration shrinking at a \nrate of almost 9 percent. But that, too, has turned around under this \nnew President and we are now averaging economic growth of about 3 \npercent--a dramatic improvement.\n  But our Republican friends are not satisfied. They want to take us \nback. They want to take us back to those failed policies that had the \neconomy shrinking at a rate of 9 percent, had us losing 800,000 jobs a \nmonth. We are not going to support that. We are going to oppose that. \nOne thing the Republican leader got right is we are going to be voting \nagainst going back to those failed policies that put this economy in \nthe ditch, that put us on the brink of financial collapse. He is \nabsolutely right. We are going to oppose that.\n  Our policies have begun to turn things in the right direction. Here \nare the positive signs for the U.S. economy: 26 consecutive months of \nprivate sector job growth; 11 consecutive quarters of real GDP growth; \nunemployment rate down; manufacturing has expanded for 33 consecutive \nmonths; consumer confidence is showing signs of improvement--in fact, \nthe last consumer confidence reading is at a 4-year high; U.S. auto \nmanufacturers that were on the brink of bankruptcy under the Bush \nadministration policies, the Republican policies, are now returning to \nprofitability; and State revenues are showing signs of improvement.\n\n  One way we can reality-test is how is our economy doing compared to \nour major competitors. How are we doing compared to the Europeans? How \nare we doing compared to Japan? How are we doing compared to the United \nKingdom? On every one of those tests the United States comes out on \ntop. Our economy is performing better than the European zone--all the \nEuropean countries combined. We are doing better than Japan. We are \ndoing better than the United Kingdom. This chart shows the story. Our \neconomic growth is the best, compared to our major competitors.\n  If there is any doubt that Republican policies had us on the brink of \nfinancial collapse, we can look to the study that was done by Alan \nBlinder, the former Deputy Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mark \nZandi, who advised the McCain campaign on economic policy. The two of \nthem did an analysis of the Federal actions taken to deal with the \nfiscal crisis and the financial crisis. Here is what they conclude:\n\n       We find that its effects on real GDP, jobs and inflation \n     are huge, and probably averted what could have been called \n     Great Depression 2.0.\n\n  When our friends attack the President and say he did not lead--\nreally? He averted a depression. He prevented a financial collapse, \nbecause that is exactly where we were headed when the Republicans were \nin control.\n  Zandi and Blinder went on to write:\n\n       When all is said and done, the financial and fiscal \n     policies will have cost taxpayers a substantial sum, but not \n     nearly as much as most had feared and not nearly as much as \n     if policymakers had not acted at all. If the comprehensive \n     policy responses saved the\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\n     economy from another depression, as we estimate, they were \n     well worth their cost.\n\n  That is exactly right. But what do our colleagues on the other side \nwant to do? They want to take us to extreme austerity. They want to \nslam on the brakes, even while this economy is in a fragile recovery. \nWe do not have to wonder what would happen if we adopted the policies \nthey are presenting here on the floor of the Senate today. We do not \nhave to imagine it; we can just look across to Europe because they are \npursuing the policies that our colleagues on the other side advocate \nhere today. What is happening? We have kind of an experiment going on \nbecause what our Republican friends are pushing for is being done in \nEurope. What are they experiencing? Here is a column from the former \nGerman Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, ``Austerity Is Strangling \nEurope.''\n\n       [T]he direction of European economic and financial policy \n     must change, away from pure austerity toward growth. Greece, \n     Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain have made substantial \n     progress in stabilizing their finances. But the economic and \n     political situation in these countries shows that austerity \n     alone is not the way to resolve the crisis.\n\n  Do we have a problem with debt? Absolutely. Do we need to deal with \nit? Absolutely. I was part of the Bowles-Simpson commission. I was part \nof the group of six. I have spent hundreds of hours negotiating with \ncolleagues on both sides to get a result. But the answer is not extreme \nausterity right now. Almost every economic analyst says if you do that \nyou will slam this country right back into recession. Again, we do not \nhave to look very far to find out if that is true, because Great \nBritain has tried that approach. What have they experienced? Here is an \narticle from the Wall Street Journal on April 26: ``U.S. Slips Back \nInto Recession.''\n  That is exactly the formula that is being presented by our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle today. Let's slam on the brakes. We are \ngoing to put this thing right back in recession. Hey, they had their \nchance. They ran the economic policy of this country for 8 years under \nthe Bush administration, and sure enough they had this country on the \nbrink of financial collapse. Now they want to return to those same \nfailed policies. What a mistake that would be.\n\n  We have heard the Republican leader say there is no budget; we have \nno budget. As I indicated in the beginning of my remarks, we do have a \nbudget law that was passed last year. It is called the Budget Control \nAct. Let me read from the Budget Control Act because maybe my \ncolleagues missed it when they were voting on it. Here is what it says \nin two places:\n\n       The allocations, aggregates, and levels\n\n  Referring to spending levels--\n\n     set in subsection (b)(1) shall apply in the Senate in the \n     same manner as for a concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2012.\n\n  Is that confusing? It says ``in the same manner as for a concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2012.''\n  The identical language is repeated for 2013:\n\n       The allocations, aggregates, and levels set in subsection \n     (b)(2) shall apply in the Senate in the same manner as for a \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2013.\n\n  That is about as clear as it can be. I might add, the Budget Control \nAct, as I indicated earlier, is stronger than any resolution because a \nresolution is purely a congressional document. It never goes to the \nPresident for his signature. So the Budget Control Act that set the \nbudget for 2012 and 2013 has the force of law, unlike a budget \nresolution that is not signed by the President.\n  The Budget Control Act also sets spending limits not just for 2 years \nbut for 10 years. It caps spending for 10 years, saving $900 billion. \nIt also provided the full enforcement mechanisms, including a deeming \nresolution that allowed budget points of order to be enforced for the \nappropriations bills that come in 2012 and 2013.\n  The Budget Control Act did something else. It created a \nsupercommittee, a reconciliation-like procedure to address entitlement \nreform and tax reform backed up by a $1.2 trillion so-called sequester. \n``Sequester'' is just a fancy word for more spending cuts.\n  The Budget Control Act that is the law said if the special committee \ndidn't reform the tax system, didn't reform the entitlement system, \nthat there would be another $1.2 trillion of spending cuts imposed on \ntop of the $900 billion. We all know the special committee didn't reach \nan agreement, so that additional $1.2 trillion of spending cuts is in \nplace. That is a total of $2 trillion in spending cuts. That is the \nbiggest spending cut package in the history of the United States.\n  For our friends on the other side to say there are no spending limits \nin place is just wrong. It is just wrong. We do have a problem. We have \na big problem. This chart talks about the spending and revenue of the \ncountry over the last 60 years and tells us why we have a problem. The \nred line shows the spending in the United States over that period. The \ngreen line shows the revenues. We can see on the chart there is a big \ngap between the spending and the revenue, and that is why we have \ndeficits.\n  Our friends on the other side like to refer to one part of the \nequation. They just like to talk about spending. But the reality is \ndeficits are created by the gap between the revenue and the spending. \nWe can see on this chart we are at or near a 60-year high on spending. \nWe have come off the 60-year high a little bit, and we are at or near a \n60-year low on revenue. We have to work both sides of the equation. \nAgain, we are at or near a 60-year high on the spending, and we are at \nor near a 60-year low on revenue.\n  So what is to be done about it? The public says we ought to have a \nbalanced plan: 62 percent say the best way to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit is a combination of additional revenue and spending cuts. Eight \npercent say we ought to just increase taxes. Seventeen percent say just \ncut programs.\n  I was part of the so-called Bowles-Simpson Commission. There were 18 \nof us; 11 of the 18 supported the conclusions that called for that kind \nof approach--additional revenue but also additional spending cuts. That \nis what the American people say we ought to do, but that is not what \nour friends on the other side are proposing. They propose additional \ntax cuts, to dig the hole deeper before we start filling it in.\n  Then they say: In addition to that, we will have Draconian spending \ncuts because if we are going to have more tax cuts that primarily go to \nthe wealthiest among us, and we are trying to reduce the deficit, that \nmeans we have to have even more spending cuts.\n  Let me just say that the budgets our Republican friends are going to \nbe offering today have something in common. Every one of them ends \nMedicare as we know it. Every Republican budget offered today ends \nMedicare as we know it. One of the Republican budgets being offered \ntoday cuts Social Security by 39 percent. That is their answer. If we \nare going to have more tax cuts for the wealthiest among us--and many \nof them are not paying their fair share of taxes--and if we are going \nto give them additional tax cuts, trillions of dollars in some cases in \nthese budgets they are presenting today, then how are we going to make \nit up? Their answer is end Medicare as we know it, and that is in every \none of their budgets.\n  One of them has gone so far as to say: Let's cut Social Security \nbenefits 39 percent. We will be voting on that later today, and we will \nsee who stands behind that proposal.\n  Every Republican budget cuts taxes for millionaires by at least \n$150,000 a year. Are you listening? Every Republican budget being \noffered today cuts taxes for millionaires by at least $150,000 a year \non average.\n  Every Republican budget being offered today protects offshore tax \nhavens.\n  What are offshore tax havens? This is a picture of a building down in \nthe Cayman Islands. It is an Ugland House. It is a little five-story \nbuilding down in the Cayman Islands. That building claims to be the \nhome of 18,857 companies, and they all say they are doing business out \nof that little building down in the Cayman Islands--18,857 companies.\n  They are not doing business out of that building. They are doing \nmonkey business out of that building, and the monkey business they are \ndoing is avoiding the taxes they owe in the United States.\n  Every Republican budget protects those offshore tax havens. The first \nHouse Republican budget plan we will be voting on today is totally \nunbalanced. There is no revenue. In fact, it\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nis a lot more tax cuts, $1 trillion of additional tax cuts for the \nwealthiest in our country. They do cut some things other than taxes; \nthey cut health care by almost $3 trillion. They shift Medicare to a \nvoucher system which will end Medicare as we know it. They block-grant \nfor Medicaid, going right after the most vulnerable in our society: \nchildren, the disabled, and those who have the least. They cut the \nsafety net for seniors, children, the disabled, which will increase the \nnumber of uninsured by more than 30 million. They have large cuts to \neducation, energy, and infrastructure. Cutting education doesn't make a \nwhole lot of sense to me. Talk about eating your seed corn, that is it.\n\n  After our House Republican colleagues put out their budget, the \nCatholic bishops said this in the Washington Post: Bishops say Ryan \nbudget fails moral test.\n  The House Republican budget authored by Mr. Ryan fails the moral \ntest. It certainly does.\n  Let's go to the next slide. This plan cuts discretionary spending $1 \ntrillion beyond what the Budget Control Act did. If you look at \npriorities, it kind of leaps out at you. Health care is cut by almost \n$3 trillion. It goes from $12.7 trillion to $9.9 trillion.\n  Then we go to the question of education, where the United States is \nalready lagging. In fact, the United States ranks 25th out of 34 OECD \ncountries in math. We are 25th in math. In science we are 17th out of \n34. So we are 25th out of 34 in math, and we are 17th out of 34 in \nscience. The budget from the House Republicans says to cut education by \n25 percent; cut it from $77 billion to $58 billion. That is a 25-\npercent cut in education under the House Republican plan.\n  We have all seen gasoline prices rising. We are thankful they have \nbeen easing back in recent days. But, nonetheless, on May 14 gasoline \naveraged $3.75 a gallon. What is the Republican answer to rising \ngasoline prices? Well, let's cut those energy programs that are \ndesigned to reduce our dependence on foreign energy. Let's cut them 60 \npercent. That is what the House Republican plan does. It cuts programs \nto reduce our dependence on foreign energy from $4.7 billion a year to \n$2 billion. That is a 60-percent cut in programs to reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy.\n  If anybody has driven on the highways of America, we all know we have \nwork to do there. If we look at spending on infrastructure in our \ncountry versus our major competitors, we can see China is spending 9 \npercent of its GDP on infrastructure: roads, bridges, airports, and \nrail. Europe spends 5 percent, and the United States spends 2.4 percent \non infrastructure. We ought to do better than that.\n  So what is the Republican answer? On transportation funding, they cut \nit 34 percent. They cut it 34 percent. I think we understand the \ndirection our Republican colleagues want to take this country, and it \nis full speed in reverse. They want to go back to the failed policies \nthat put this country on the brink of financial collapse the last time \nthey were in charge.\n  We will hear our colleagues on the Republican side say we can't raise \nany revenue. We can't raise any revenue, even though revenue is at or \nnear a 60-year low right now. If we look historically at what it has \ntaken to balance the budget, the last five times we balanced the \nbudget, revenue was at 19.5 percent to 20.6 percent of GDP. Under the \nRepublican plan, it never gets above 18.7 percent. So I don't think \nthey are very serious about balancing the budget.\n  Former Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg said this about \nthe need for more revenue:\n\n       [W]e also know revenues are going to have to go up, if \n     you're going to maintain a stable economy and a productive \n     economy, because of the simple fact that you're going to have \n     this huge generation that has to be paid for.\n\n  That is the baby boom generation.\n  Former Senate Budget Committee Chairman Domenici also said we need \nmore revenue. He said:\n\n       A complete deficit reduction plan--one that can gain \n     support from Republicans and Democrats--will need to combine \n     comprehensive spending cuts with structural entitlement \n     reform and new revenues . . . [A]dditional revenues will be \n     needed if we are serious about controlling our debt.\n\n  One of the issues that has become more and more clear in recent \nmonths is that income disparity is widening in America. This shows, \nsince 1979, what has happened to the top 1 percent in terms of their \nincome and what has happened to the middle quintile and the lowest \nquintile. Everybody else has been pretty much stagnant since 1979. The \ntop 1 percent has gone up like a rocket. I have nothing to be critical \nabout in terms of people doing well. We want everyone to succeed, not \njust part of the population.\n  The hard reality is that since 1995, the effective tax rate for the \nwealthiest 400 taxpayers in this country has been cut from about 30 \npercent to 18 percent. That is not fair. The Republican plan is to give \nthem more tax cuts. In fact, the House Republican plan on revenue \nprovides an additional $1 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest among \nus by giving millionaires an average tax cut of more than $150,000 a \nyear. It does not contribute one dime of revenue to deficit reduction.\n  I want to end where I began. The last time our colleagues on the \nother side were in charge, when they controlled everything here from \n2001 to 2006 and the White House until 2008, their Republican policies \nled the United States to the brink of financial collapse. The proposals \nthey are making here today are to take us right back to those failed \npolicies. We shouldn't let them do that. That would be a mistake for \nour country and it would be a mistake for the world.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the fundamental question we as a \nNation have to ask is: What are we going to do now? What are we going \nto do for the future? What is our plan for the future? The problem we \nhave in this Senate is that the Democratic majority steadfastly and \nadamantly refuses to lay out their vision for the future while \ninvesting a considerable amount of time and effort in attacking anybody \nwho does. They even voted down their own President's budget, as bad as \nit is--the most irresponsible budget ever submitted here, in my \nopinion.\n  This is an odd situation we are in, and I will say that our country \nhas never been in more danger financially. Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson--Senator Conrad served on their committee--came before the \nBudget Committee, of which I am the ranking member, and told us in a \nsigned statement--that this Nation has never faced a more predictable \nfinancial crisis. In other words, the course we are on today is \nunsustainable. They told us that. They told us it could happen within \nas little as 2 years, and that was over a year ago that they gave that \ntestimony.\n  We are in the danger zone financially. I know a lot of people would \nlike to say it is not so, but it is so. Look at this chart. This chart \nshows the total debt of the eurozone, including the U.K., and the \nUnited States. Our debt exceeds that of the eurozone. We have a larger \ndebt than they do. My good friend Senator Conrad, who is such a fine \nperson, noted that President Bush presided over a period in which our \ndebt increased, and it did increase. The largest debt President Bush \never had was $480 billion in 1 year, which was too large. President \nObama has never had a budget that was less than a $1,200 billion \ndeficit, and next year it will be over $1,000 billion again, according \nto expert testimony. We are on an unsustainable path. So I would note \nthat our $15.5 trillion debt for the United States is greater than the \neurozone and the eurozone has a larger population than we do.\n  Let's look at this chart, which drives that number home again, in \ncase anybody is worried about it. I am. It shows the average debt per \nperson in the countries we have been reading about that are in \nfinancial trouble, and it hits them sometimes surprisingly, and we \nnever know quite how it is going to hit. But look at this: The debt in \nSpain, which we know is in a rocky financial position, is $18,000 per \nperson; Portugal, $19,000; France, $33,000; Greece, $38,000--Greece's \ndebt per person is $38,000, whereas the United States is $44,000. Yes, \nwe have a little larger economy, but this is the danger zone.\n  A few people were saying we could have a financial problem in 2007 as \na result of the bubble in housing. They\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nwarned us that might happen. A lot of people said: Oh, no, not this \ntime; it is different; we have it under control. Yet we had a financial \ncrisis that we haven't recovered from yet. So I would say we do need to \ntake action.\n  We do not have a budget. If we have a budget, why did President Obama \ncomply with the United States Code and submit a budget this year? If we \nhave a budget, why did the House pass a budget? If we have a budget, \nwhy did four different Democratic Congressmen and groups of Congressmen \nsubmit budgets in the House? If we have a budget, why did Senator \nConrad seek to have a budget markup in the committee? He basically \nsaid: Well, we may not bring it up on the floor, but the law says we \nshould have a budget and I am going to bring one up in committee. The \nday before the committee met, the Democrats met in conference and told \nhim not to do it.\n  So we were expecting to have an actual markup of a budget presented \nby the Democratic leadership and we didn't get it. Why? Senator Reid \nsaid it would be foolish to have a budget--foolish. What did he mean by \nthat? Why would the Democratic leader, attacking Republicans this \nmorning, say it is foolish for us to produce a budget? Well, he said \nthat because he meant it would be foolish politically. It would be not \nsmart politically because the Democratic leadership in the Senate would \nhave to lay out a vision for the future and the vision they wanted to \nsell and could agree on was one the American people wouldn't like. It \nwouldn't be smart. They would reject it. We would add the numbers up \nand see how much they actually want to increase taxes, how much they \nare going to increase the debt, how much spending is going to increase. \nThat is not leadership. It is an utter failure of leadership.\n\n  In contrast, the Republican House produced a budget that changes the \ndebt course of America. It puts us on a sound financial path. One can \nagree with it or disagree with it. We will have other budgets offered \ntoday from the Republican side that will have substantial support, that \nwill change the debt course we are on, balance the budget in a certain \nnumber of years, and put us on a sound financial path. I expect every \none of those budgets to be opposed by every Member on the other side of \nthe aisle. Again, it appears they will unanimously vote down President \nObama's budget and not offer one of their own, directly contrary to the \nlaw.\n  I know the majority leader this morning said: Well, filibuster is our \nproblem. But we can't filibuster a budget. The Congressional Budget Act \nis designed to ensure that a budget will be passed. The Congressional \nBudget Act does not allow a filibuster. Only 51 votes are needed to \npass a budget, so why is it being mentioned? Because they prefer to \nhide under the table and not stand up and be counted and not address \nthe greatest trouble this Nation has, which is our debt.\n  I see some of my colleagues here today, and I ask unanimous consent \nto participate in a colloquy with my colleagues for up to 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I see Senator Blunt here, who was part \nof the leadership in the House before he came to the Senate. I know he \nhas a deep understanding of these issues and the place we are in as a \nNation today. I also see Senator Thune from South Dakota, who is an \nactive member of the Budget Committee and part of the leadership here \nin the Senate.\n  I am pleased to yield to Senator Blunt and ask him how he feels this \nmorning as we move forward today to bring up a series of budgets with \nno plan from the majority party in the Senate.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am embarrassed that we are not serious \nabout this issue. Senator Thune and I served in the House together \nwhile the Senator from Alabama was leading in these budget fights in \nthe Senate, and we had a budget every year. We didn't always every \nsingle year have a budget the House and the Senate could agree on, but \nthe House always had a budget and the Senate always had a budget. We \nalways complied with the 1974 Budget Act that says we have to have a \nbudget. It says we have to have a budget by April 15.\n  Frankly, we can't do our work without a budget. We can't get spending \nunder control without a budget. We can't appropriate the way we should \nwithout a budget because the budget sets forth how much money we are \nwilling to spend on defense and how much money we are willing to spend \non military construction and how much money we are willing to spend on \nenergy. If we don't have that, we don't have a starting place.\n  I have all the respect in the world for our friend from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, but to be the chairman of the Budget Committee and to \nhave to come to the floor and talk about what is wrong with the other \nbudgets that have been produced when his committee hasn't produced one \nhas to be frustrating for him, no matter how effective he seemed when \nhe was talking about what was wrong with the people who had a plan. It \nis easy to find out what is wrong with somebody's plan, particularly \nwhen one doesn't have any obligation, apparently, on their own part to \ncome up with a plan.\n  We remember when the White House was asked a few weeks ago, when \nSenator Reid said the Senate will not have a budget and what their \nposition on that was, they said: We don't have a position on that.\n  The President submitted a budget. Why did the President submit a \nbudget if he doesn't want the Congress to act on a budget? The House \nvoted on his budget this year. It was 414 to 0. Not a single Democrat \nor Republican in the House voted for the President's budget. Last year \nwe voted on the President's budget, as I assume we will again today. \nNot a single Democrat or Republican voted for the President's budget \nlast year, and the position of the White House is they don't care. It \nis an amazing situation to find ourselves in.\n  Whoever is in charge of the Senate in the future needs to have a \ncommitment to the American people that we are going to have a budget, \nwe are going to have an appropriations process, and we are going to get \nthis spending under control. We have maxed out the credit card; \neverybody gets that. The Senator from Alabama showed this morning with \nhis chart the figures representing our debt relative to the countries \nwe sort of laugh at, how irresponsible they are--numbers that I think \nwe ought to look at pretty carefully. When our debt per person is \ngreater than the Greek debt per person--I haven't seen the front page \nof a paper in a while that didn't have something about chaos in Greece \non it because they have let their government get bigger than their \neconomy can support. They have let their debt get bigger than the gross \ndomestic product of their country by almost two times, but now we have \nexceeded our debt by--our debt exceeds our potential to produce goods \nand services in a year for the first time ever. In fact, in the 3 years \nwe haven't had a budget, the debt of the country has increased almost \n$5 trillion, as we have spent over $10 trillion in those 3 years \nwithout a budget. It is unacceptable. Everybody here knows it is \nunacceptable. And every American family, frankly, who thinks about it \nknows it is unacceptable.\n\n  The Senator's fight, along with what I am sure has to be Chairman \nConrad's frustration to not have a budget, could not be a more \nimportant topic for us to be talking about today or for the American \npeople to be asking the question: Why not? Why are you refusing to do \nyour job? I know nobody in this Chamber knows as much about the budget, \nin my opinion, as the Senator does. Your frustration of where this does \nnot allow us to go to do the right things is as great as anybody's, \nmaybe greater than anybody's. But I think all of us know we should be \ndoing the right thing here, which is to obey the law, create a budget, \nand have a budget that gets us to the place we know we need to get to, \nwhere our economy, once again, is right-sized to our government or, \nmore importantly, our government is right-sized to our economy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Briefly, before I go to Senator Thune and get him \nengaged in this discussion, based on the Senator's experience in the \nbudgetary process, I'm sure he is aware that about 60 percent of \nFederal spending is mandatory entitlement spending. Does the Senator \nthink we can develop a long-term plan for the future that fails to \naddress that large portion that is growing faster than the other part \nof the budget?\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. No, we cannot. Last year, for the first time ever, all of \nthe money that came in was less than the money that went out \nautomatically to these programs, where, if you meet the definition for \nthe program, you get the money. It is at 60 percent now. It has not \nbeen that many years ago that it was at 50 percent. It was not that \nmany years before that it was at 40 percent.\n  So we have to deal with these issues because they lead us to an \ninevitable place. Do we want to be Europe today a few years from now? \nSurely not. Surely the answer is no. We cannot avoid that unless we \nhave a plan.\n  It is easy to talk about how bad the other plan is. But what we all \nought to be doing is coming up with a plan that gets us to where we all \nknow we need to be.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  I thank Senator Thune for his leadership and active participation in \nthis debate. I ask the Senator, what is on his mind this morning, as we \nare heading for votes on four different budgets?\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to my colleague from Alabama, who is the ranking \nmember on the Budget Committee, I got on the Budget Committee in this \nsession of Congress and have been on it now for 2 years. We have not \nwritten a budget either year. So it sort of begs the question about \nwhether the committee has any relevance around here anymore.\n  But to the point about spending and debt--we get down here and we \ntalk about it. I think it has been interesting. The former Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen--who up until several months \nago held that position--would come in front of Congress, in front of \ncongressional committees, and say the greatest threat to America's \nnational security is our national debt. There are a lot of external \nthreats the United States faces. The world continues to be a dangerous \nplace, with al-Qaida and the Iranian nuclear capability and China and \nNorth Korea. You can go right down the list. But for the top ranking \nmilitary official in this country to come before Congress and say the \ngreatest threat to America's national security is our national debt \nspeaks volumes about what our priority ought to be. To think that we \nhere in the Senate now for over 1,100 days have not passed a budget is \npretty stunning in light of that reality; and also to say that somehow, \nbecause the Budget Control Act last summer passed, we did not need a \nbudget misses the point.\n  The reason we had the Budget Control Act is because we did not pass a \nbudget. The Budget Control Act is what you get when you do not pass a \nbudget. You end up at the 11th hour having to put something together to \ndeal with the issue of the debt limit, which is what we were dealing \nwith at that time. It did put some caps on spending, but it does not do \nanything to deal with the long-term structural challenges facing this \ncountry, which is what a budget is designed to do.\n  The President submitted a budget this year, which would suggest he \nthought we ought to be working on a budget. The chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, as my colleagues have mentioned, even called a Budget \nCommittee markup, where we went there and said: Bring amendments. We \nwent, we brought amendments, and we gave opening statements. We gaveled \nit out and said we are not going to do it.\n  So here we are again on the floor of the Senate without a budget, \nhaving to vote on other budgets presented by some of our colleagues, \nthe House of Representatives, which passed a budget this year earlier, \nand the President's budget. To be fair, the President at least \nsubmitted a budget. It was a terrible budget if you are looking at the \nissues of spending and debt. In fact, I think the reason it got voted \ndown 414 to nothing in the House of Representatives is because it added \n$11 trillion to the debt. It takes our total debt at the end of the 10-\nyear period to $26 trillion and spends $47 trillion over the next 10 \nyears and raises taxes by $2 trillion in a very fragile economy. It was \na bad attempt, but at least it was an attempt. It was an attempt that \nyielded zero votes in the House of Representative, and it will be \ninteresting to see if on the floor of the Senate today there will be \nany Democrats who will vote for their President's budget proposal.\n  But the point the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Missouri \nmake is a good one, and that is simply this: We have a responsibility \nunder the law to spell out what we would do to get this country on a \nmore sustainable fiscal path. That is something that is in the budget \nlaws that the Senator from Alabama pointed out. Yet here we go on, year \nafter year after year now--3 years in a row, over 1,100 days--without \nthe Senate doing its job and passing a budget. That is significant for \na lot of reasons, not the least of which is this is the fourth year in \na row where we are going to have a trillion dollar deficit. Under this \nadministration, you have the highest deficit, the second highest \ndeficit, the third highest deficit, and the fourth highest deficit in \nhistory--4 consecutive years now of trillion dollar deficits.\n  But we are concerned about the economy. We need the economy to get \ngrowing again, to expand, to create jobs. That helps address all these \nthings. What is interesting about it--and I know both my colleagues on \nthe floor are well aware of this--there is a lot of research that has \nbeen done with regard to developed countries that start carrying these \nhigh debt loads. All the analysis suggests when you get a debt-to-GDP \nratio of more than 90 percent, it costs you about a point to a point \nand a half of economic growth every single year. Well, in our country, \na percentage point of economic growth means a million jobs. So our debt \nto GDP--which is now over 100 percent--means it is draining our economy \nof economic growth and, therefore, lots of jobs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said about the President's budget, if \nhis budget were to be enacted, it could cost us up to 2.2 percent of \neconomic growth over the course of the next 10 years, which would \namount to 2.2 million jobs. So we know the President's effort was \nnot serious. He did at least put something out there. But we need a \nserious discussion in the Senate about a budget that will put us on a \npathway not only to get spending and debt under control but to allow \nthe economy to grow and expand and get Americans back to work. That is \nwhat is at stake here. That is why we believe we ought to have a \nbudget. That is why we are going to have an exercise today where at \nleast we get a chance to vote on some budgets as advanced by some of \nour colleagues in the House of Representatives as well as here in the \nSenate and the President's budget.\n\n  The fact is, this is the third year in a row where we have not \nfollowed the law and gone through the process of getting a budget here \non the floor of the Senate. For our colleagues on the other side to \nsuggest it is not necessary simply because the Budget Control Act was \npassed last summer not only is inconsistent with the law, but it begs \nthe point about why did the President submit his budget, why did they \ncall a Budget Committee markup in the first place? Clearly, somebody \naround here thinks we ought to be doing our job. But we are not doing \nit.\n  So I would hope, as we debate this issue today, at least we will put \nin front of the American people the arguments we think need to be made \nwith regard to getting spending and debt under control, addressing the \nlong-term, the mandatory side of the budget my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Blunt, mentioned. That is where we know the money is. That is \nwhat nobody wants to deal with. We keep squeezing a little bit more out \nof the discretionary side of the budget. We have to take that on if we \nare going to save Social Security and Medicare and reform these \nentitlement programs. That is what a budget process would do. It does \nnot take 60 votes under the law. It takes 51.\n  To come down here and say Republicans will filibuster again is \ncompletely out of whack with what we know to be the facts around here \nand the law; that is, that it takes 51 votes to pass a budget and a \nreconciliation bill that could possibly follow.\n  I appreciate the leadership of my colleague from Alabama as the \nranking member on the Budget Committee. I look forward today, at least, \nfor the chance for us to talk about a budget and what we ought to be \ndoing for the future of this country since we do not have a budget on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I could not agree with the Senator more. I would note,\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\nthe reason we are here today is because a budget was not produced. The \nParliamentarian of the Senate ruled that a budget has not been produced \nand, therefore, under the rules of the Budget Act, budgets that have \nbeen filed can be brought to the floor. That is how we were able to \nforce the votes today.\n  Senator Thune, briefly--and I will also ask Senator Blunt, who is in \nour leadership--isn't it a fact that what happened with the Budget \nControl Act is that we had spent so much money, we had reached the \nspending limit of America--the debt ceiling--and we had to have a last-\nminute effort to reach an agreement; the Republicans insisted that we \nhad to reduce spending, and we got a reduction in spending from $47 \ntrillion over the next 10 years to $45 trillion? You would have thought \nthat was going to bankrupt America--that we would spend $45 trillion \ninstead of $47 trillion.\n  That is not a budget. It was a limit on spending, and it was done \nbecause Republicans said: We are not going to raise the debt limit \nuntil you at least cut some spending. That is all that could be \naccomplished. We avoided a crisis, but it was a pretty tense time.\n  Senator Blunt.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I would like to stay on this. Saying the Budget Control \nAct is a budget--as Senator Thune mentioned, if that was the budget, \nwhy did the President submit one? Nobody believes that is a budget. The \nParliamentarian said it was not a budget. But what it is--it would be \nas if your family sitting down to decide what money you are going to \nhave to spend this year said: OK, we have X number of dollars. Let's go \nout and spend it. That is no budget, particularly when you had to \nborrow 40 percent of the X number of dollars you said you had. We are \nborrowing 40 percent of the money we are going to spend. The only \nnumber we have that we have agreed to is the maximum amount we will \nspend, knowing we do not have anywhere near that number, and we have \nnot allocated that in any way.\n  That is no budget. Everybody knows that. Everybody also knows you \ncannot get there unless you have a way to get there. Your family says: \nOK, we have done the budgeting for the year. We decided if we borrow \nalmost as much money as we make, and we spend that somewhere, that is \nour budget. We have not decided where we are going to spend it, we have \nnot decided how we are going to spend it, and we have not even decided \na reasonable way we are going to get it, but we said: Here is the \nnumber we are going to spend. Now, family, let's all go out and start \nspending and we will meet here later this year and see how it worked \nout. It makes no sense at all, and everybody knows that.\n  Interestingly, we do not hear much about this. It is surprising to me \nthat every day there is not a story about why for the first time ever \nfor 3 years straight now the Senate has decided it does not have to do \nthe work the law requires it to do, as we dig this hole deeper and \ndeeper and deeper. The longer we wait, the more difficult the solution \nis going to be. Every single day that passes, it is harder to solve \nthis problem than it would have been the day before. Now we have gone 3 \nyears without a budget and apparently we are going to go through the \nrest of this process without a budget. By the time we get to the end of \nthis year, we will be approaching that fourth year without a budget. It \nis not as though this would be a good idea, the law says we have to \nhave one. And we should have one.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Blunt has been in the leadership in the House. \nHe is in the leadership of the Senate. Be frank with us. What is it \nthat would cause the majority party not to want to lead, not to want to \nlay out a plan for the future, and attack anybody who does lay out a \nplan? I know it is hard. We all know this is a tough thing. But doesn't \nthe Senator think a party that aspires to lead the Senate should, \ninstead of hiding under the table, stand up and say what they believe \nwe should do over the next decade financially?\n  Mr. BLUNT. I think the law even requires it. I think the leader on \nthe other side, the majority leader, has been pretty clear about it. It \nis bad politics to have a budget, bad politics to tell the American \npeople officially what we are for, bad politics for our Members to have \nto go on record saying what they are for.\n\n  The President submitted a budget. There are 54 Members of the \nPresident's party here in the Senate. Fifty-one of them could pass this \nbudget. It would be the Senate-passed budget. Then you would go to the \nHouse and say: OK, let's look at the House budget and the Senate budget \nand see if we can agree on a budget.\n  But they actually have been pretty transparent. You have to give them \nsome credit for not trying to be different than they really are. They \nsaid: It would be politically foolish for us to pass a budget because \nthen people would know what every one of the 51 of our Members is for, \nand they would have to say what they are for.\n  My guess is that nobody in the majority will say they are for \nanything today--not for the President's budget, not for any budget we \nwill submit. So you go home and say: I am not for any of that. You \ncan't accuse me of being for a bad plan because I am for no plan.\n  That is where we are.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, we need revenue--they use that word but will not \nexplicitly say whom they want to tax except a very few rich. The \nBuffett tax would produce about $4 billion a year when we have a $1,200 \nbillion deficit.\n  I would note that Senator Manchin, a former Governor of West \nVirginia, said in today's Politico that he would have been impeached if \nhe failed to produce a budget as West Virginia's Governor. He said: \nSure I have a problem with failing to offer a budget. As a former \nGovernor, my responsibility was to put a balanced budget forward.\n  Well, I see my colleague is here. I think our time is up. There might \nbe a couple of minutes for Senator Thune.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator will yield for a minute, I assume in \nAlabama and Missouri and I know in South Dakota our States pass \nbudgets. It can be done. You can balance your budget. It would be nice \nif we had a requirement in the Constitution that would demand that the \nway many of our States do. Certainly, there doesn't seem to be the \npolitical will here to do it absent that. But it can be done, and hard \ndecisions have to be made. South Dakota went through it last year, made \nsome hard choices, our Governor, our legislature. Those are the types \nof hard decisions that are going to have to made here, but it takes a \ncertain amount of political will and a willingness to make hard \ndecisions. As the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Missouri \nhave both pointed out, there doesn't seem to be the willingness here to \nmake those hard votes.\n  As has already been pointed out, the leader on the other side has \nsaid: What point is there in doing a budget? And the President of the \nUnited States and his folks, when they were asked whether the Senate \nought to do a budget, said: Well, we don't have an opinion about that, \nwhich I think is really ironic coming from the leader of the free world \nabout whether this country ought to have a budget to work with.\n  But that being said, as our time winds down here, to argue, as our \ncolleagues have, that we don't need one misses the point. The \nParliamentarian has ruled that the Budget Control Act was, in fact, not \na budget. We need to do a budget here in the Senate. More importantly, \nthe American people expect it and the taxpayers deserve it. That is why \nwe ought to be having a debate on what we are going to vote for today, \nnot what we are going to vote against.\n  It will be interesting to see if any of our colleagues on the other \nside vote for any of the budget proposals we put forward today, \nincluding the President of the United States; his budget will be voted \non along with several other Republican budgets. I have a feeling we \nwill be for some things. I have a feeling, as you said earlier, that \nthey are not going to be for anything.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, is the time up on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the use of \ncalculators be permitted on the Senate floor during consideration of \nthe motions to proceed to budget resolutions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I wish to go back to the point my \ncolleagues have made. It is fascinating to me. You did not hear them \ntalk for one moment about the substance of their proposals--not a \nmoment. Did you notice that? I wonder why that would be? I think I \nknow. It is because their proposals would take us right back to the \nfailed policies that brought this country to the brink of economic \ncollapse. That is what happened the last time they were in charge. They \ncontrolled both bodies from 2001 until 2006, the White House until \n2008. So none of those policies they put in place when they controlled \nboth Chambers could be changed. And where were we at the end of 2008? \nWhere were we? We were losing 800,000 jobs a month and the economy was \nshrinking at a rate of 9 percent. And the proposals they have, the \nsubstantive proposals they are making here today, take us right back to \nthose same failed policies.\n  It is no wonder you did not hear them saying one word about the \nbudget proposals on which we are going to be voting because they are \nthe same failed policies that put this country in the ditch. Instead, \nwhat you hear them say is that we on our side have no budget. \nFascinating.\n  Well, let me just put up again what we passed last year in law called \nthe Budget Control Act.\n  Let me again read from that law. It says:\n\n       The allocations, aggregates, and levels--\n\n  Spending levels--\n\n     in subsection . . . shall apply in the Senate in the same \n     manner as for a concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2012.\n\n  In the next clause, it makes the exact same statement for 2013, that \nthe Budget Control Act that was passed last year will serve in the same \nmanner as a budget resolution.\n  Earlier this year, pursuant to that law, I gave the appropriators, \nwhich I am required to do under the law, what they could spend, and \nhere it is. I have this chart being blown up.\n  Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, $13,397 million; Armed Services, \n$146,698 million; Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, $22,167 million; \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, $15,016 million; Energy and \nNatural Resources, $5,276 million. It sounds kind of like a budget does \nit not? Doesn't that sound kind of like a budget? Well, guess what, it \nis a budget. It is in the Budget Control Act that we passed last year \ninstead of a budget resolution.\n  Again, anybody who has taken high school civics knows a budget law is \nstronger than any budget resolution. Why would that be the case? \nBecause a budget resolution is purely a congressional document. It \nnever goes to the President for his signature. A budget law, by \ndefinition, has to be signed by the President. So last year, instead of \na budget resolution, we passed a budget law called the Budget Control \nAct. Pursuant to that law, I gave the appropriators--earlier this year, \nbefore the deadline--their allocations, and I was just reading from \nthem. Finance, $1,337 billion; Foreign Relations, $28,640 million; \nHomeland Security, $102,276 million; the Judiciary Committee, $18,545 \nmillion; Rules and Administration, $41 million. It sounds a lot like a \nbudget doesn't it? Because that is exactly what it provided. It \nprovided the spending limit this year and for next year. That is in the \nBudget Control Act we passed in the Senate last year on a strong \nbipartisan vote, passed the House of Representatives, and signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States.\n  So when we hear over and over that there is no budget, no spending \nlimits for this year, it is just not so. There are spending limits for \nthis year. There are spending limits for next year. They are included \nin the Budget Control Act, which is a law. It was passed. It was signed \nby the President. That Budget Control Act limited spending for the next \n10 years--put spending caps in place. Budget resolutions rarely have \nspending caps for more than 1 year. The Budget Control Act had 10 years \nof caps, saving $900 billion. That is the law.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan is on the floor--a very valued member \nof the Budget Committee. Welcome to this debate. We have been hearing a \nlot from the other side--interestingly enough, I want to say to the \nSenator, almost nothing about the substance of their proposals. I \nassume that is because they want to go back to the same failed policies \nthat put this country in the ditch we are still digging out of. All \nthey want to talk about is not having a budget resolution--not one word \nthat instead of a budget resolution, we passed a budget law, as the \nSenator well knows, the Budget Control Act.\n  How much time will the Senator need?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will use 7 minutes or so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will allocate the Senator 10 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, first let me thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who I have to say is going to be sorely missed. In fact, I \nam not sure we are going to let him go. I think we are going to lock \nthe doors to his office and not let him leave. He has been such an \nincredible valued Member of the Senate and a leader for our country on \nthese issues.\n  It is absolutely true that what we are really debating is whether we \ngo back to policies that put us in the huge deficit ditch in which we \nfind ourselves or whether we continue to go forward as a country. We \nneed to keep going forward and going forward even more quickly \ncertainly. But in my State, we are seeing us begin to move forward, \nwith manufacturing coming back and innovation opportunities, and we \nneed to continue to push for that.\n  But let me stress as well what the chairman has said. We passed the \nBudget Control Act by 74 votes in the Senate--74 votes, a bipartisan \nvote--on August 2, 2011. It put in place the spending caps the chairman \ntalked about. It laid out something that, frankly, in my time since \nbeing here starting in 2001, has been done differently and, frankly, \nhas a stronger basis for it because instead of just having something \npassed by the House and the Senate, it was actually signed by the \nPresident. It is law. It has the force of law, and it is in a situation \nwhere it has even more impact than it would normally.\n  So, yes, we did not do the normal process. What we did was one better \nthan the normal process, which is the Budget Control Act. It did pass. \nIt did put in place the spending caps and set up, as you know, a \ndeficit reduction commission and a requirement on cuts that will take \nplace in January.\n  It is also true that what we do not have is a long-term plan. As the \nchairman has talked about over and over again, we have to come together \non a long-term deficit reduction plan. So we agree on that. There are \nmany people who have talked about that, worked on various proposals. \nThe President has lead negotiations. Members in this body have. And \ncertainly the chairman of the committee has continued to lead those \nefforts. And we need to get that done. But in terms of what we have on \na budget resolution that puts in place limits or caps, that has been \ndone.\n  Now, when we look at what is in front of us and the votes we are \ngoing to be having today, it is very simple in terms of values. The \nquestion is, Are you on the side of the middle class or on the side of \nmillionaires in this country?\n  You know, folks in my State, the middle class, feel as though the \nsystem has been pretty much rigged against them. All they want is a \nfair shot. We have families in Michigan struggling to make ends meet, \nand they are struggling to send their kids to college. Over and over \nagain, they look at what is going on here and scratch their heads. And \nwhy in the world would we continue to focus on things that help a \nprivileged few, those who have had the most benefits in the last \ndecade? Why do we continue to see policies like these budgets that, in \nfact, focus on more tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and ask \nmiddle-class families to sacrifice more and more? They shake their \nheads and say: What is going on here? You guys just do not get it, what \nis happening to the majority of families.\n  And what we are seeing once again is that rather than focusing on \njobs and bringing the economy back on track, bringing jobs back to the \nUnited States, strengthening our ability to make things and grow things \nin this country, which has to happen if we are going to have a middle \nclass and have an economy, what we see our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle do is wanting to double student loan rates\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\nand eliminate Medicare as we know it in order to give another round of \ntax cuts to millionaires and billionaires. That makes absolutely no \nsense.\n  Instead of spending our time passing jobs bills that we need to pass, \nby the way, including the farm bill, which affects 16 million people in \nthis country when we talk about rural communities and agriculture and \nfood processing and all of our efforts on food policy across the \ncountry, instead of doing that, they want to spend their time focusing \non something that will give more tax breaks to millionaires and ask \nmiddle-class families one more time--just one more time--to sacrifice.\n  Folks in my State are saying we have had enough of this. What we \nought to be doing is our to-do list--stopping outsourcing and rewarding \ncompanies that bring jobs home; helping responsible homeowners \nrefinance and take advantage of today's lower interest rates; cutting \ntaxes for small businesses that are creating jobs and investing in \ntheir companies; continuing critical investments in clean energy \nmanufacturing for the future; passing a farm bill for 16 million \nAmericans whose jobs rely on agriculture and our rural economy; and we \nshould focus on helping our veterans coming home from the war find \ngood-paying jobs, thanking them for their service.\n  We have a lot to do. Instead, we are in the same old failed debate \nthat got us in the hole, that got us to the situation where there was a \ncrisis on Wall Street, that got us to the point where we lost millions \nand millions of jobs in the past. Are we going to go backward or \nforward? That is the question.\n  Right now, what are the differences when we look at the four \ndifferent Republican plans? They are very similar. Here are three basic \nthings that are the same. They all end Medicare as an insurance plan \nand increase costs by thousands of dollars for seniors in our country, \nwhich puts them back in a plan that is before 1964, where seniors would \nhave to try to find private insurance. Of course, as we get older, we \nall spend more health care dollars; we need more health care, so costs \nwill be higher. It is tougher for older people to find affordable \ninsurance. That is why we created Medicare in 1965. They want to go \nback prior to that time.\n  Second, they allow student loan rates to double. All the plans would \ndouble the cost of that. I don't know about anybody else, but in \nMichigan, where we are transforming the economy and going to advanced \nmanufacturing and new technology, we have folks in their forties and \nfifties going back to school, and we have young people going to \ncollege. They are not asking for more expense. The average student debt \nin Michigan is about $25,000. They are not asking to add to that \nanymore. All four of these proposals would do that--double the student \nloan interest rate.\n  By the way, these are loans where people are taking out the money, \nand they are responsible and they are paying it back. But they are \nasking for help to make sure they can afford to be able to have those \nloans, so they can dream big dreams and go to college and be \nsuccessful. I thought that is what our country was all about. When I \nwas growing up in the little town of Clare--my dad was sick when I was \nin high school--if I hadn't had help with tuition and fees and \nscholarship and loans, I would not have been able to go to college. The \ngreat thing about our country is that a red-headed, freckled-face girl \nin Clare, who folks didn't know--folks somewhere decided that maybe I \nought to have a chance to go to college. Because of that, I have had \ntremendous opportunities in my life. We have a lot of young men and \nwomen working hard every day who deserve the same opportunity. People \nwho lost a job and are going back to get training deserve the same \nopportunity.\n  All four of these plans end Medicare as an insurance plan, increase \nby thousands of dollars costs to seniors, double student loan rates, \nand all of it is to make sure that we give more tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires. I know at least one or more of these \nplans adds $150,000, I believe, in average tax cuts. That is more than \nthe average person in Michigan makes in a year--or the average person \nin America. We are saying to seniors, families, and students that we \nwant you to pay more so we can give another tax cut to the folks who \nhave already gotten the majority of the benefits in the last 10 years \neconomically.\n  Let me stress one more time before ending, I think this goes to the \nvalues represented in these budgets. Do we want to say that retirees \nand older people in our country have the opportunity to live long \nlives? Social Security and Medicare are great American success stories. \nThey literally brought a generation out of poverty to live in dignity, \nlike my mom, who is almost 86, to a place where she is healthy and can \nplay with her grandkids because she had the opportunity to be in a \nsystem called Medicare, and will be able to live longer. Those are good \nthings, good values, not bad values.\n  All four of these budgets--the Paul budget would end Medicare in \n2014; the Lee budget would end it in 2017; the Ryan budget in 2023; and \nthe Toomey budget in 2023. I cannot imagine that Americans want to go \nback to that system where seniors cannot count on the ability to have \ntheir doctor and get their medicine and have the dignity of a long and \nhealthy life.\n  Madam President, I urge our colleagues to vote no on every one of \nthese resolutions which go backwards, and support our efforts to keep \nAmerica going forward and focus on those things that will make our \neconomic recovery even faster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we need to lay out a plan for the \nfuture of this country. That is what this is all about. My colleague \njust said vote no on all of them and keep going, don't go back. What I \nhear being said--and there is no ambiguity about it--is let's keep on \nthe path we are on. This is good enough. Here is the letter: Let's be \nhappy. We are in Washington, and we are having fun, I caught a fish and \nwe had a party, send more money.\n  Isn't that what it is all about, isn't this what we are hearing from \nthe other side? Send more money. We will take care of things for you. \nWe don't have to cut anything. We are not on an unsustainable path. \nActually, we cut spending over the next 10 years from $47 billion to \n$45 billion. Aren't we great. That is a huge increase over the current \nlevel of spending; it increases spending every year under the Budget \nControl Act--not nearly enough to change the debt course of the \ncountry. But that is OK.\n  By the way, do you know what President Obama's budget does? It wipes \nout the sequester. Before the ink is even dry on the Budget Control \nAct, the agreement at the eleventh hour to reduce spending over the \nnext decade by $2 trillion, President Obama submits a budget in \nFebruary proposing to wipe out the sequester--all $1.1 trillion of it. \nWhat kind of commitment do we have to control spending? Send more \nmoney; that is the solution. Tax, spend, tax, spend. I wish it weren't \nso. I wish I could say differently.\n  Well, let me ask this question: Do my colleagues not feel a \nresponsibility to tell the American people what their financial plan \nfor the future of America is? Do they have no responsibility? Do they \nfeel no sense of obligation, no duty? All they want to do is attack \nanybody else's plan who is trying to save this Republic from financial \ndisaster--attack them because they might want to reduce spending \nsomewhere, and somebody might not like it because they didn't get quite \nas much from the government as they got before. Are there no programs \nthat we are prepared to reduce or eliminate that are wasteful and not \nworthwhile? Is there nothing in this government? Maybe we stop GSA from \nhaving hot tubs in Las Vegas; maybe we ought to at least do that. How \nabout the TSA, which has warehouses with millions of dollars of \nequipment in them that is not even being used? What about the $500 \nmillion Solyndra loan and other bogus loans to political cronies? And \nevidence is coming out that there is more of that. Can't we cut that? \nOr will they say that is anti-energy?\n\n  What they need to do is get off the backs of the energy producers and \nallow more energy to be produced. It doesn't take taxpayer money to \nproduce more energy and have decent regulations. Do you know what they \ndo? They send checks to Uncle Sam. They pay royalties on offshore and \nFederal lands. They pay taxes on the money they make. The people who \nwork at the oil companies pay taxes.\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\nThat is the way you get money, not by just taxing somebody.\n  I think the American people fundamentally understand that a tax on \nthe rich is a tax on the private sector, and when you overtax the \nprivate sector, you get less of it. It is the private sector that \ncreates the wealth that pays the taxes that allows us to distribute \nmoney here and go back to our districts and act as though we are some \nhero for returning people their money that we took from them, and we \nwant to be some specially credited person because we brought back some \nbacon to our district. The American people understand this. They are \nnot happy about this.\n  The Budget Control Act is not close to what we need to do to put our \ncountry on a sound path. It is not close. I have to say that the \nPresident's budget undoes half of that. When I said the Budget Control \nAct took spending down from $47 trillion to $45 trillion, President \nObama's budget that was submitted a few weeks ago would add $1.6 \ntrillion back, so that would make it go from $45 trillion to $46 \ntrillion in spending over 10 years.\n  This is the way they propose to operate this government. That is what \ntheir plan is. Why won't they lay it out? Because they know the \nAmerican people will look at it and say: Good grief, that is not what \nwe want for this country. You guys have to get your house in order. We \nexpect you to cut some spending. We know there is waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the capital. You better get busy.\n  All we hear from my Democratic colleagues is: Send more money. What \nis particularly troubling is the suggestion that it is OK, we don't \nhave to make any changes. But we do. We do have to make changes.\n  Let me show you this chart. The changes will be difficult, but not so \nbad as to have the country be damaged in any significant way. This is \nwhere our spending level is today, $3.6 trillion. This is the next \ndecade under the Budget Control Act, where we cut spending. In that \nlate-night confrontation before the government was to shut down because \nwe reached the spending limit and could not borrow anymore money, an \nagreement was reached to take $2 trillion out of spending over 10 \nyears. That is what this chart is--after that cut had been put in \nplace. President Obama wants to wipe out half of it. So it would add $8 \ntrillion in new spending. If you cut that to $6 trillion or $5 \ntrillion, we would balance the budget. You would still show an \nincrease; it would just maybe be a $4 trillion or a $5 trillion \nincrease in spending instead of $8 trillion. We could make a big \ndifference there.\n  The path we are on is unsustainable. The path we are on leaves us in \nthe danger zone. The path we are on has led us to have more debt than \nEurope and more per capita than any country in Europe, and it is \nunsustainable. I am worried about this.\n  I am particularly worried that we don't have a sense in this body \nthat we have to make changes. We are going to have to look at the \nentitlement programs. I have heard Senator Conrad say this repeatedly. \nHe served on the debt commission, and they said we have to do that.\n  Does the President propose any entitlement changes in his budget? No. \nAre the Democratic Members of the Senate proposing entitlement changes? \nNo. Who is? Congressman Ryan has proposed entitlement changes. He is \nprepared to defend them as being the kind of changes that will \npreserve, protect, and sustain Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n  We cannot allow entitlement spending to continue to increase at rates \nfour and five times the inflation rate. That is an unsustainable \nspending course. When 60 percent of our budget is increasing at three \nor four times the inflation rate, we are in big trouble, and we can't \ntax our way out of that. That is just a fact. Upper income people are \ngoing to have to contribute more to Medicare. They just are. We don't \nhave the money. We can't just make it up and act like that is not \nreality. It is reality.\n  So I think the budgets we will see from this side will be attacked \nviciously as wanting to kill these programs. They are not designed to \nkill these programs. They are designed to put us on a financial path \nwhere we can be healthy and prosperous and sustain the benefits we have \npromised. But a big chunk of Medicare is paid for out of the General \nTreasury of the United States, and people with big incomes ought to \ncontribute to some of that, and they can do that. We can do that as a \nnation.\n  So, Madam President, I think it is rather odd that we have come to \nthe floor and called up--without debate, without opportunity to amend--\na series of budgets. Why? Because no budget has been produced in the \nBudget Committee, and under the rules of the Senate members can bring \nup a budget. We don't get to have amendments, but we can bring up one. \nUnder the Budget Act, the Budget Committee should have hearings, have a \nmarkup, offer amendments, and bring the budget to the floor with a \nguaranteed 50 hours of debate, unlimited amendments, and then final \npassage within a certain time. That is the way it works. It guarantees \npriority to a budget because the people who wrote the Budget Act in \n1974 knew how important a budget was. They gave it priority. It can't \nbe filibustered. It can pass with 50 votes, with the Vice President--51 \nvotes otherwise can pass the budget--because we need a budget, and we \nshould be seeking to do that.\n  To me, it is pretty frustrating to see our current situation. So I \nguess I will conclude by asking: Does the majority party not feel an \nobligation to tell the American people where they would like to lead \nthe country; and do they not, in a time of financial crisis, want to \nlay out a plan they can rally behind and ask the American people to \nrally behind to save our country?\n  It is an absolute fact this country has never, ever, ever, been in a \nfinancial condition as severe as this one. We have never, ever faced \nthe long-term systemic debt threat we face today. We have never been on \na path so unsustainable. Never. Nothing close to it. This is a threat \nto the future of America, and the party that aspires to lead the Senate \nshould lay out its plan. The President should be engaged. He should be \ninsisting we pass a budget that has some meaning and would change the \ndebt course of the country. Yet what do we have? Nothing but attacks on \nMembers of Congress who lay out plans that would actually do that.\n  They do not want to bring up a budget. Why? They say it is foolish. \nIt would be foolish for us. Yes, it would be foolish to reveal \nourselves. The American people might add up how many taxes we want to \nincrease. They might add everything up and say: Your plan doesn't \nchange the debt course. They may add things up and say: You spend too \nmuch. So we don't want to do that. That would be foolish.\n  I have never seen a situation where, in a time of crisis, this Nation \nhas had a failure of leadership as great as we are seeing today. Now \nmaybe I don't get this. Maybe something is wrong with me. But I think \neveryone who cares about the Republic should be prepared to stand and \nvote on proposals to put us on the right path.\n  We are not on the right path today. We have a threat out there that \ncould put us in a financial crisis overnight. It could happen very \nquickly. When that occurs, it will be too late to fix it.\n  We saw the warnings that led to the 2007 financial crisis. That was a \ndeeply damaging event--that crisis. We haven't gotten over it yet, and \nwe could have another one. Wouldn't that be terrible? These numbers \ndon't assume we have a recession. They have no real recession projected \nin the numbers we will see. We need to avoid a debt crisis, another \nfinancial crisis, as Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, on the debt \ncommission, told us to avoid. We need to do that, and we are going to \nhave some leadership on both sides of the aisle, I believe.\n  So, Madam President, I will reserve the remainder of my time, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, Senator Menendez is here to be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, and we can do that at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, last year the Budget Control Act \nbecame the law of the land, and it set discretionary spending limits \nfor security and nonsecurity spending for not just 1 year but for 2 \nyears. It puts us on a\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\npath to reducing the deficit by more than $2 trillion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  We now hear claims from our friends on the other side of the aisle \nthat we don't have a budget. I guess if one says say it often enough \npeople may believe it. But it seems our Republican colleagues have \nselective amnesia about the Budget Control Act.\n  We have a budget. It is called the Budget Control Act, and it has the \nforce of law, which is more than we can say for any of the proposals \nbefore us today. So today's debate makes me wonder if we are on a dance \nfloor instead of the Senate floor because we have already taken one \nstep forward and now it is two steps back.\n  These Republican proposals call for extreme cuts on the backs of \nseniors, students, and the most vulnerable in our society without \nasking any contributions from millionaires and corporations. That is \nnot fair, it is not balanced, and it doesn't reflect the priorities of \nNew Jersey's middle-class families.\n\n  I strongly believe we must get our Nation's fiscal house in order, \nand I have always supported a fair and balanced approach to reducing \nour deficits. But I cannot, in good conscience, support proposals in \nwhich working families, seniors, and students must endure billions in \ncuts while oil companies--making $1 trillion in profits over the next \ndecade--and billionaires are not asked to pay their fair share.\n  Supporters of the House Republican budget, introduced by Congressman \nRyan, justify their radical changes to Medicare and other programs by \nsaying: We simply can't afford it. But in the very same Republican \nbudget in which we can't afford that, we see an average tax cut of over \n$\\1/4\\ million to millionaires, and that is on top of the six-figure \ntax break they are already currently receiving from the Bush tax cuts. \nAt the same time Republicans propose to add thousands of dollars of \nincreased costs on the backs of middle-class seniors, they somehow find \nthe money for another tax cut for millionaires that is worth more than \nfour times the entire average household income of an American family.\n  People who have worked hard to build personal wealth should be \napplauded for their success. At the same time, many of them are willing \nto contribute to help the Nation in this tough economic time, if we \nask. We know from experience that asking a fair share from the \nwealthiest and most successful, as we did during the Clinton era of \nprosperity, will not break our economy. It just comes down to a matter \nof fairness.\n  What we are seeing today is our friends on the other side of the \naisle taking yet another run at shifting our Nation's financial burdens \nonto middle-class families, seniors and students, all while defending \nspecial breaks for their special interests. How is that fair? How is \nthat balanced? It is not. And we can't let it stand.\n  Let's talk about the facts. Republicans are not only seeking to \nrepeal the affordable care act, but they are also dismantling Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other vital programs. Under the Ryan budget, New Jersey's \nhealth care system would be devastated. The Republican plan would cut \n$39 billion in health benefits from New Jerseyans over the next decade, \nleaving families unable to find care and doctors unable to provide it. \nTheir plan will throw upwards of 465,000 low-income families and \nseniors off Medicaid, kick more than 70,000 young adults off their \nparents' health insurance, and leave more than 3 million New \nJerseyans--including 877,000 children--worrying about whether they will \nhit their lifetime benefit limit and lose coverage as a result.\n  For seniors, the Republican plan ends Medicare as we know it, leaving \nretirees to worry about whether the system they paid into their entire \nworking lives will really be there for them when they need it. Their \nplan would force seniors out of the Medicare they know and instead \nprovide an inadequate voucher they claim will cover the premiums for \nprivate insurance. That claim, however, is false, leaving seniors with \nan increase in out-of-pocket expenses of over $6,000 a year.\n  It also means immediately higher costs for the more than 126,000 \nseniors in New Jersey who have saved a combined $95 million on \nprescription drugs because every one of these Republican budgets will \nreopen the gap in prescription drug coverage we call the doughnut hole. \nThe Republican budget also means 1 million seniors in New Jersey who \nhave already accessed no-cost preventive health services, such as \ncancer screenings, would now be forced to pay for those screenings out \nof pocket. It also means 270,000 seniors and disabled individuals in my \nhome State who rely on Medicaid for services such as long-term care \nwill be kicked out of the system.\n  The most shocking about all of this is the radical Ryan budget seems \nto be the least extreme of the Republican budgets. For example, Senator \nPaul's proposal calls for Medicare to end abruptly on January 1, 2014, \nwhile simultaneously decreasing Social Security benefits and raising \nthe eligibility age to 70. Senator Toomey's plan would force seniors \noff Medicare and only provide a modest voucher to purchase private \ncoverage. It would slash Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion--$180 billion \nmore than even the Ryan budget calls for--and shift a massive and \nuntenable burden on the States while leaving millions of families \nwithout coverage.\n  How is that fair and balanced? It is not, and we should reject these \nproposals.\n  Here is another fact about the Ryan House budget. Instead of making \ncollege more affordable, more accessible, and more achievable, the Ryan \nbudget will do the exact opposite. It will create additional obstacles \nfor students that could--according to a study by the Education Trust--\nultimately take Pell grants away from 1 million students. For those who \naren't kicked out of the system entirely, it will freeze the maximum \nPell Grant award, despite tuition costs rising far above the rate of \ninflation. To add insult to injury, the Ryan budget would allow the \ninterest rate on subsidized Stafford loans to double--a debate that is \nall too familiar to this body.\n  My Republican colleagues claim to support lower rates, but then they \nfilibustered them, and now they are proposing a budget that would allow \nthe interest rates to double. So for more than 60 percent of students \nwho receive Pell grants while also taking out loans, the Ryan budget is \na double whammy. Not only will they lose some or all of their Pell \ngrants, they will be forced to pay double the interest on their loans, \nwhich will only increase with a reduction in Pell grants.\n  Today receiving some form of higher education is almost a \nprerequisite for a 21st-century career. In fact, young adults with only \na high school diploma are almost three times as likely to be unemployed \nand earn just over half as much as those with a bachelor's degree.\n  But even as the demand for college graduates in the workforce \nincreases, so have the costs of tuition, making higher education all \nthe more critical, as well as for the Nation to be the global leader \ncompetitively. Yet it is more out of reach for millions of students if \nwe follow these plans. How is that fair? How is that balanced? It is \nnot, and it just shows the misguided priorities that are behind these \nproposals.\n  Middle-class families can't afford it. Seniors can't afford it. \nStudents can't afford it. That is why we can't afford to let it happen.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, just to respond to my friend, the \nranking member of the committee--and I have a lot of respect for the \nranking member. The truth is on the larger issue we are not all that \nfar apart. The larger issue is, as a nation, we are on an unsustainable \ncourse. This is as clear as it can be, and we have to deal with it. We \nhave a difference with respect to what we have right now. I believe we \ndo have a budget in place for this year and next year. The place where \nI would agree with the gentleman is we don't have the longer term plan.\n  The problem is, Are we really going to get all sides to get off their \nfixed positions right before a national election? That is a matter of \njudgment. I don't believe that it is going to happen.\n  I was part of the Simpson-Bowles Commission. In fact, Senator Gregg \nand I were the ones who got the Commission appointed, and he and I were \n2 of the 11--five Democrats, five Republicans, one Independent--who \nvoted in favor of the long-term plan that Bowles-Simpson put before the \nAmerican people that would have reduced\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\nthe debt from what it would otherwise be by more than $4 trillion. \nDepending on what baseline you use, even more than that. That is the \nminimum we need to do.\n  I actually tried to convince the Commission to do $5.6 trillion. That \nwas my proposal to the Commission, a $5.6 trillion package of deficit \nreduction and debt reduction. Why did I pick that? We could balance the \nbudget in 10 years if we did.\n  But I do want to go back to this question about whether we have a \nbudget right now, for this year. I say, with respect, I believe it is \nvery clear we do. The Budget Control Act--not a budget resolution but a \nlaw--said very clearly the allocations, aggregates, and levels of \nspending shall apply in the Senate in the same manner as for a \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2012. That \nidentical language follows for 2013.\n  So pursuant to the Budget Control Act, in April I provided to the \nappropriators and the authorizers these budget allocations for \nappropriations: For security discretionary budget authority for 2013, \n$546 billion; for nonsecurity discretionary budget authority, $501 \nbillion. That is a total, onbudget, of $1,040,000,000,954; mandatory \nspending, $815 billion, $671 billion, for a total of \n$1,862,671,000,000.\n  Then to the authorizing committees, I went through some of these \nnumbers previously. The Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, $13,397 \nmillion; on entitlements for that same committee, $124,580 million; on \nArmed Services, $146,698 million; on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs, $22,167 million.\n  Again, I could go through every committee, but there it is. The \nappropriations spending limits have been provided to the appropriators. \nThe authorizing committees have been given their designations. So for \nthis year and next, it is clear we have spending limits put in place. \nWhat we don't have is the longer term plan. That is where I would agree \nwith the gentleman. The question is, Is there any prospect of the two \nsides coming together, getting off their fixed positions right now? I \ndoubt that very much.\n  Madam President, Senator Paul is here and he has this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we are currently borrowing $50,000 a \nsecond. We borrow $4 billion a day, and we are borrowing over $1 \ntrillion every year.\n  The situation has gotten out of control, and I think the situation of \nour deficit and our country threatens our country. In fact, I think it \nis the No. 1 threat to our national security, and our security as a \nnation is this overwhelming burden of debt.\n  Many economists have said this burden of debt is actually causing us \nto lose 1 million jobs a year. It crowds out private investment because \nwe have to take care of financing this enormous debt.\n  Amidst all of this, we have rules in place. There is a Budget Act \nthat we have had in place since the 1970s that requires that this body \nput forward a budget. The problem is we have no budget and have had no \nbudget for 3 years.\n  Now, one would say: How can this be when we have a law that says the \nmajority party has to have a budget, and yet we have no budget? They \nare in defiance of the law. Then if you were to come to us and say you \nwant money spent on X item, we can't even do anything about it because \nthere are no appropriations bills. If we don't have a budget, we don't \nhave appropriations bills, and we can't alter up or down the \nappropriations bills because we don't have a budget to go by.\n  In fact, every bit of spending we do here is in defiance of our own \nrules because we are supposed to compare the spending bills to the \nbudget, and we have no budget.\n  Many of us have been promoting something new--this would be a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution--because we don't seem to \nbe doing a very good job balancing the budget. When you have less money \ncoming in, you spend less money. Every American family has to do this. \nWhy can't Washington simply spend what comes in? It shouldn't be that \ncomplicated. But they aren't obeying their own rules, so I think we \nneed stronger rules. That would be an amendment to the Constitution \nthat says we must balance the budget.\n  We had a vote on it. Forty-seven of us on our side of the aisle voted \nfor it, and no one on the other side voted for it. Our balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution would require that the budget balance \nwithin 5 years. In that vein, our office has put together a budget that \ndoes balance in 5 years, and it actually, over a 10-year period, would \nreduce the deficit by $2 trillion. Ours is the only budget that will \nbalance in 5 years and begin paying down the debt over 10 years.\n  Right now, Congress has an approval rating of 11 percent. Maybe that \nhas something to do with the fact that we aren't doing our job. We \naren't passing a budget, much less a balanced budget amendment. If \npeople vote for our budget, we would balance in 5 years and begin \npaying down the debt. I think the stock market would be ecstatic to \nhear this.\n  How do you do this? In order to balance the budget, we have to tackle \nentitlement reform. Currently, Social Security is $6.2 trillion short \nof money. The taxes people pay into Social Security are less than what \nwe pay out. Social Security is essentially insolvent.\n  You ask: Well, how come my check keeps coming?\n  Your check will always keep coming. As the bankruptcy grows deeper \nand deeper, your checks will come--they won't buy anything. You are \nalready seeing this at the pump. Gasoline prices have doubled. Is it \nbecause gas is more precious? No. It is because the value of the dollar \nis shrinking. The value of the dollar is shrinking because we print all \nthis new money to pay for this massive debt. It is unsustainable, and \none way or another it is going to come to a head.\n  Will it come to a head through the destruction of our currency paying \nfor this debt? I don't know, but we certainly need a budget. Ours will \nbe a budget that balances in 5 years. People say: Why don't you \ncompromise with the other side?\n  We will, but they have to have a budget. If ours balances in 5 years \nand the other side will promote one that balances in 10, compromise \nwould be 7\\1/2\\. But if the other side doesn't have a budget or if the \nother side has a budget--the President put forward a budget, and we \nwill vote on that too. His never balances. So we have infinity for \ntheir side, and we have 5 years on our side. How do we get halfway from \ninfinity to 5 years?\n  If we are going to compromise, they have to come to the table. We \nhave to engage in a debate. Entitlements are 65 percent of the budget. \nThey call it mandatory spending, and nobody wants to do anything about \nit. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid is 65 percent of the budget. If \nwe don't tackle entitlement reform, we can't fix it. We have a proposal \non the table.\n  Social Security reform, we fix Social Security. The way we fix it is \nwe gradually let the age of eligibility rise to 70 over about 20 years, \nand we means-test the benefits--not on the current people but on the \nnext wave. My generation will have to wait longer. Why? Is it because \nwe want to change things? No. It is because we are living longer. We \nall have a longer life expectancy, and then we had smaller families. \nThis isn't anybody's fault. It is not the Democrats' fault and it is \nnot the Republicans' fault. We just had a bunch of large families born \nafter World War II. They are all retiring, and each subsequent \ngeneration had less children. It is a demographic fact. Combine that \nwith the fact that we are living longer, and we have to make changes.\n  But we have a proposal on the table. We will fix Social Security. How \ndo we compromise if the other side will not come up with a proposal?\n  Social Security is $6 trillion in the hole. Medicare is $35 to $40 \ntrillion in the hole. We have a solution. We will give every senior \ncitizen in the country the same health care plan I have. The same \nhealth care plan that every Senator and Congressman has, we are willing \nto give it to them. Do you know whose idea this was? Senator John Kerry \nfrom Massachusetts, a Democrat. We have taken his idea and put it \nforward, but we can't get anybody on that side to talk to us. They have \ngiven up. It is an election year. They are not going to do anything \nthis year. They didn't do anything last year.\n  So we haven't done anything to fix entitlements. We have done nothing \nto\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\nfix Social Security, nothing to fix Medicare. How do you compromise \nwith a side that has no proposition, that won't put anything forward? \nBut we have a 5-year plan that balances in 5 years, and we fix Social \nSecurity. We save Social Security in perpetuity--which, I laughingly \nsay, is a long time.\n  We also fix Medicare. We save Medicare. Medicare is facing a $35 to \n$40 trillion deficit, and we are willing to save it. But the other side \nhas to come to the table, and nobody is showing up to debate these \nissues. No one is proposing any budget on the other side. No one is \nproposing any entitlement reform.\n  In our budget we save Social Security, we save Medicare, and we go \none step further. We have tax reform that would help the country and \nwould make it fair.\n  Some on the other side say, well, let's get rid of all those \nloopholes for special interests. We do it. We do a flat tax: 17 percent \nfor all businesses, 17 percent for all personal. You get to deduct your \nkids and your house, and that is it. No other deductions. No other \nspecial interest exemptions. No other special credits for any special \nbusiness or special enterprise. A flat 17 percent for everybody. We \nwould see a boom in this country like we have never seen if we would do \nit.\n  What would compromise be? Maybe the other side wants 25 percent, and \nI want 17 percent, and we go in the middle and we do 22 percent. That \nwould be compromise. But how do we compromise with the other side when \nthere is no budget? There is no entitlement reform proposed from the \nother side. There is no tax reform proposed from the other side. How do \nwe compromise if there is no other side?\n  If the other side has decided not to show up this year--if this year \nis going to be a waste of time and everybody is going to just run for \noffice, maybe we shouldn't be paid this year. Maybe you shouldn't pay \nyour Congressman, maybe you shouldn't pay your Senator this year if we \nare not going to have proposals from both sides.\n  This means we should be talking about entitlement reform, talking \nabout tax reform, talking about budgets, and there would be give-and-\ntake.\n  The only way to get give-and-take in our country is people need to \nshow up for the debate. We need to do our job. Why is there not a \ncommittee in Washington, not any committee--why is there not any \ncommittee meeting every day on how to fix Social Security? Nobody is \ntalking about it. Why is there no committee discussing Medicare reform \nmeeting every day, Republicans and Democrats, talking, figuring out a \nway out of this? There is no such committee.\n  Why is there not a committee on tax reform, discussing how we could \nmake our Tax Code simpler and make it easier for people to figure out \nand make the rates lower so we could spur the economy? Every time we \nhave lowered tax rates, unemployment is cut in half. When we had an \nupper rate of 90 percent and Kennedy lowered it to 70 percent, \nunemployment was cut in half. When Reagan lowered the top rate from 70 \npercent to 50 percent, unemployment was cut in half. When Reagan \nlowered it again from 50 to 28, unemployment was cut in half.\n  But we as a country have to decide that we do not want to punish rich \npeople, that we do not want to go out and punish corporations. We work \nfor these people. We want them to do better. The oil and gas industry \nemploys 9.2 million people and pays $86 million a day in taxes. We want \nthem to do better. Let's not punish them with more taxes and \nregulations. Let's make their taxes lower and their regulatory burden \nlower so they can drill for more oil in our country and employ more \npeople in our country. These are the decisions we have to make as we go \nforward.\n  We have a budget that can balance in 5 years. It is what our country \nneeds. I think people would react, and the marketplace in particular \nwould react in a tremendous fashion if we would move forward and vote \nfor a budget.\n  The Republicans will have four or five budgets presented. Some of \nthem balance in 5, some of them balance in 8, some of them balance in \n28. But we are at least trying. We are showing up and we are presenting \nbudgets that would balance at some finite period of time. I tell people \nif it is never going to balance, it should not even be presented. If it \nis not going to balance in your lifetime--if you say it is going to \nbalance in somebody else's lifetime when somebody else is going to be \nhere in Congress--you have abdicated your responsibility. We can do \nbetter than this. The American people expect us to do better than this. \nThe American people expect us to show up and do our job.\n  We will today vote on these budgets. What I ask of the American \npeople is: Look and see how your Representatives vote. Look and see how \nyour Senators vote. Look and see whether your Senators believe in \nbalancing the budget or if they think it doesn't matter; we will just \nprint up more money.\n  But realize if their answer is to print up more money, if their \nanswer is deficits do not matter, if that is their answer, I want you \nto get mad and I want you to get angry and I want you to get even. \nEvery time you go to the gas pump and pay $4 for gas I want you to know \nwhy gas prices are rising. Not because gas is more precious but because \nyour dollar is less valuable, and that is because of the massive debt \nwe run and the irresponsibility up here that nobody is willing to \ntackle it.\n  There are some on our side willing to make the tough decisions. Is it \neasy to stand here and say to the people in Kentucky and the people in \nAmerica that the only way to save Social Security is letting the age of \neligibility rise? Do you think that is popular? Do you think I am \nsaying that to pander and try to get votes? I am saying that is because \nit is the only thing that is going to save Social Security, the only \nthing that will save our country, is we have to make difficult \ndecisions. I think that is what needs to happen.\n  People need to say: Are you willing to make the tough decisions? Are \nyou willing to stand up and say this is how we would fix Social \nSecurity; this is how we would save the system; this is how we would \ncorrect this deficit that is dragging us all down?\n  One side is willing to do that. I am willing to do that and I hope my \nfellow Senators will today consider voting to balance the budget.\n  I yield my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we are waiting for a number of Senators \nwho have sought time. They will be coming to the floor and we will hear \nfrom them momentarily.\n  Let me say Senator Paul is sincere. One place I agree with him is \nthat the country has to face up to our deficit and debt situation. As I \nindicated earlier, I was part of the Simpson-Bowles commission. We \nagreed to, and voted on, significant reforms, spending cuts, but we \nalso used some additional revenue to have a balanced plan.\n  I believe that has to be the test for any of the proposals that are \nmade here. As I see the proposals coming from our Republican colleague, \nthey flunk that test because they are not balanced. There is nothing on \nthe revenue side. In fact, in all of their plans, there are deep \nadditional tax cuts aimed at the wealthiest among us. None of the \nRepublican plans have less than a $150,000 tax cut, on average, for \npeople with earnings of over $1 million a year.\n  Senator Paul's plan is truly radical. He didn't mention a lot of the \nelements, but his plan includes massive tax cuts for the wealthiest \namong us. He scraps the entire tax system and goes to a 17-percent flat \ntax. That is a massive tax cut for those of us who have higher income--\nmassive tax cut. I can tell you it would be a massive tax cut for my \nfamily.\n  He also cuts discretionary spending, education, and energy, by huge \namounts. I will go into that in a bit. He cuts health care by almost $4 \ntrillion.\n  He replaces the current progressive system with a 17-percent flat \ntax. He eliminates the estate tax--eliminates it. He eliminates taxes \non capital gains and dividends--eliminates them. My goodness, think \nabout what that would mean. People such as Warren Buffett would pay \nalmost nothing in taxes. The richest people among us would pay almost \nnothing in taxes, because he eliminates taxes on capital gains and \ndividends.\n\n  But he is not so generous when it comes to lower income people. He \nraises taxes on lower income people by ending the earned-income tax \ncredit and the child tax credit. He eliminates it.\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\n  Perhaps most stunning, his answer to saving Social Security is to cut \nthe benefits 39 percent. The plan does not include a dime of revenue \nfor Social Security. That is what Senator Paul has before this body. \nReally? Is that what we should do? Massive tax cuts for the wealthiest \namong us and make up for it by cutting Social Security benefits 39 \npercent. That is the Paul plan. He increases the retirement age three \ntimes faster than the Fiscal Commission plan and he shifts to something \nhe calls ``progressive indexing'' for those earning above $33,000, \nwhich cuts their benefits even deeper over time.\n  I respect his desire to do something about deficits and debt, but the \nanswer is not massive tax cuts. Eliminate the estate tax? Eliminate \ncapital gains taxation? No taxes--wow. Warren Buffett should send him a \nthank-you letter. And cut Social Security 39 percent?\n  I can go into the other details. He cuts energy dramatically. He cuts \neducation. What is his education cut? I think we have it there. We will \ngo into the specifics of the massive cuts so we can have more tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest among us, trillions of dollars, and then cut Social \nSecurity 39 percent. That is breathtaking. We will see how many \ncolleagues are going to stand up and support that in a vote later \ntoday.\n  Senator Durbin is here. I thank him very much for his involvement. He \nhas not only served on the Simpson-Bowles commission but also served on \nthe group of six and has spent literally hundreds of hours trying to \nfind a way on a bipartisan basis working together to come up with a \nplan that is balanced and fair, to get us back on the track and save \ntrillions of dollars on the debt. I applaud him for it. He has shown \nenormous courage and also extraordinary energy trying to get our \ncountry back on track.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Conrad. Let me say the \nretirement of Senator Conrad from North Dakota is a great loss to the \nSenate and to the Nation. We have only six or seven months left to do \nsomething significant. It will be easier to do it when Kent Conrad is \nworking with us. I hope we can achieve it.\n  I also want to say for those who have come to the floor over and over \nto say it is time for a budget resolution, it bears repeating that we \npassed the Budget Control Act, which is a law. A resolution is just \nthat, a resolution passed by the House and Senate, recommending our \nspending levels. A budget law passed by Congress, signed by the \nPresident, has the force of law and it in fact is going to determine \nour spending levels for the next year. The people who come to the floor \nand say isn't it about time we had a budget resolution so we knew what \nwe were going to spend next year--we do. We passed it on a bipartisan \nbasis. In fact, the Republican Senate leader voted for it, so it was \nnot as though it wasn't a bipartisan effort, it was all the way, and \nthe President signed it and it guides our spending.\n  Let me speak for a moment about those ``thrilling days of \nyesteryear,'' as they used to say on the old radio serial, going back \nto 2001, if you can stick with me for a minute. That was the last time \nthe United States of America had a balanced budget. Who was President \nat the time? It was President Clinton, who left that budget for \nPresident Bush. That represented, I think, two or three successive \nyears of balanced budgets.\n  I said to my staff: Take a look at the last time our budget was in \nbalance, take a look at today, and compare spending and revenue between \nthose two periods of time. I think the Senator from North Dakota told \nme once something like 19.6 percent of GDP in that year of balance was \nbeing spent, 19.6 percent was being raised in revenue, and there was \nthe balance.\n  Now we have drifted to the point where I think spending is around 24 \npercent, is that close? And the actual revenue is down to 14 percent. \nThe 10-percent delta equals the deficit.\n  But in specifics, what has happened in that period of time? Thanks to \nSenator Inouye, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, here is a \nchart which tells the story. The blue line, of course, this bar, \nrepresents the spending and revenue in fiscal year 2001, the last time \nwe had a balanced budget, and the red bar represents fiscal year 2012. \nI asked them to compare it and here is what we found. The security in \nthere represents, of course, military spending, primarily military \nspending. In the period of time we were last in balance until today we \nhave seen roughly a 60-percent increase in military spending--\nunderstandable, two wars, all the buildup that has been part of it--OK? \nA 60-percent increase.\n  Now let's take a look at nondefense spending. That would be \neverything from medical research, building highways or helping to build \nhighways, education, basic health care. What has happened in real \ndollars since we were last in balance in that nonsecurity discretionary \nspending? Flat. Zero increase. But if you listen to the debate over the \nlast 2 years here, you would think it was all the increase--all the \nincrease we have seen in our deficit is attributable to these \nnonsecurity programs. Those are the ones we have been cutting away at. \nI think they represent 12 percent of the budget. We keep cutting away \nall these nondefense programs but they have not added to our deficit \nsince we last were in balance.\n  Now look at mandatory programs. Mandatory programs, obviously \nMedicare and programs such as that, have seen an increase of about 30 \npercent because yesterday 10,000 Americans reached the age of 65, today \n10,00 more, and tomorrow 10,000 more, and for the next 18 years 10,000 \na day. Boomers have arrived. After paying into Social Security and \nMedicare for a lifetime they walk up to the window and say now it is my \nturn. It is understandable.\n  The demographics are growing for those who are covered by these \nmandatory programs, and the costs have been growing right along with \nthem--a 30-percent increase.\n  Take a look at revenues, compared with when we were last in balance. \nRevenues have gone down 13 percent. Senator Conrad and I were on the \nBowles-Simpson commission and 18 of us sat there for a year-plus and \nlistened to all this testimony about everything. Here is where we came \ndown. He and I both voted for it. We believe the premise of the \nSimpson-Bowles commission is the right premise--everything must be on \nthe table. Everything.\n  What do you mean by everything? Spending cuts must be on the table, \nboth on the defense side and the nondefense side. In addition, we have \nto put the entitlement programs on the table. My friends, we cannot \nignore this conversation. We are 11 or 12 years away from Medicare \ngoing bankrupt. We have to have a serious conversation about this, and \nwe have to look seriously at the question of revenue.\n\n  We cannot ignore the fact that we have seen a decline in the revenue \ncoming into the Federal Government since we last had a budget \nimbalance. We have to put all that on the table. I added another part \nthat fits right into the revenue conversation, the Tax Code. This is \nnot Holy Writ. The Tax Code is a compilation of laws passed over a long \nperiod of time that takes about $1.2 trillion out of the Treasury every \nyear for deductions and credits and exclusions and special treatment.\n  They asked us at one of these meetings about the Tax Code: What do \nyou think is the most expensive provision in the Tax Code that takes \nthe most money out of the Treasury? I said, mortgage interest for sure. \nWrong. The most expensive is the employers' exclusion of health \ninsurance premiums. So imagine when we get into the debate about tax \nreform and the first item up is the biggest item up, employers' \nexclusion of health insurance premiums. Imagine that conversation. If \nwe say your employer can no longer take the full deduction, what does \nit mean to you as an employee in terms of your out-of-pocket expense, \nin terms of your health insurance coverage? So I am not going to \nsuggest tax reform is an easy exercise. It is hard, but it has to be \npart of the conversation.\n  Here is where we come down: We are having an exercise today, which is \nnot worthless, it is important. It is an exercise in discussing the \nbudget. What Senator Conrad has spelled out are different visions of \nthings. What we find coming from the other side of the aisle is \nprimarily talk about more tax cuts--particularly for the higher income \npeople--in the belief that that is how you\n\n[[Page S3196]]\n\nspark an economy and get it to go. I disagree with that premise. I \nthink the way to move this forward is for working families and middle-\nincome families to have more spending power. I don't believe we can \ngive more money to the richest people in America and expect the economy \nto take off.\n  Also we find that many of the entitlement programs, which have now \nbecome critical safety net programs, are victims of the budget \nresolutions that come to the floor. I cannot imagine what life would be \nlike for 40 million Americans on Social Security with a 39-percent \ncut--as Senator Paul suggested--in Social Security benefits. Too many \nof these people are living on their Social Security checks and barely \ngetting by. A 39-percent cut is cruel and unrealistic. I don't think it \nis going anywhere. And the notion from others that we can keep cutting \ntaxes from the highest income categories, let me say, we will never \nbalance the budget doing it. Never. If we don't balance the budget, we \ncould jeopardize our economic recovery.\n  We have a cliff we are going to face on December 31. It is a big \ndeal. I cannot remember a time when I have been in the House or Senate \nwhen so many things are going to happen in one day. But on December 31, \nall of the Bush tax cuts expire on the highest income levels as well as \nthe lower and middle-income levels. For example, I think the 10-percent \ntax rate goes away, and the child tax credit is cut in half. All of \nthese things mean more taxes for every American paying into income tax.\n  Secondly, we are going to see the end of the payroll tax cut--the 2-\npercent cut we have had for 2 years that the President put in place.\n  I could go through the litany. The bottom line is this: We need to \nstart that honest conversation about the deficit now, and we need to \nput something on the table ready to be discussed. The group of eight--\nthere are four Democrats and four Republicans--has been meeting for a \nlong time. We are trying to put together a bill, something that could \nactually become law. I don't think it is the last word, but it may be \nthe first word in the debate. If we cannot get anything done before the \nelection, let's hope that the day after the election we can put this on \nthe table and say: Here is our starting point. Let's solve the problem \non a bipartisan basis, put everything on the table, and do it in a \nthoughtful, balanced way.\n  I think that is what the American people are looking for. They really \nare. They are beyond the charades of: Oh, this won't touch me, let's \nhit somebody else. I think everybody realizes we are in the soup \ntogether. If we come out of this together, think about where we will be \nas other Nations around the world are struggling to survive \neconomically. I could go through the list in Europe, but we know it \nwell. We don't want to put ourselves even close to that position.\n  The debt ceiling expires December 31, or soon thereafter. If we do \nnot renew the debt ceiling, America will have defaulted on its debt for \nthe first time in history. That is totally irresponsible. It is an \ninvitation for the downgrading of our credit rating and the upgrading \nof the interest rates we pay and the upgrading of the deficit we owe. I \nhope the statements made by the House Speaker in the last couple of \ndays don't reflect the position of his party when it comes to the debt \nceiling. That would be a totally irresponsible act in terms of our \neconomy.\n  I will join Senator Conrad today in voting against the budget \nresolution that has come to the floor. But I will say this: I am glad \nwe are having this conversation. We need to have more of them, and we \nneed to have a bipartisan effort with both parties to make sure we deal \nwith the current spending in a responsible way. And equally important, \nwe need to find a way to get past the December 31 cliff in a way that \nwill build the economy and not take away from it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for his leadership and the \nextraordinary effort he has made to get us back on track. I thank him \nfor supporting Simpson-Bowles and the group of six that is now the \ngroup of eight. Senator Durbin has spent hundreds of hours in good-\nfaith negotiations to bring both sides together so we actually get a \nresult and not the political charade that so often goes on around here, \nbut serious solutions to serious problems.\n  Senator Wyden is a very valuable member of the Budget Committee and \nis here on the floor. No Senator has proposed more serious solutions to \nAmerica's problems than Senator Wyden, and he has done it without the \nbenefit of having a committee staff that he controls. He does it based \non his own hard work and the work of his office staff. He has proposed \nmajor tax reform, major health care reform, and he has done it in a \nbipartisan way. In many ways, I think he has set an example for \neverybody in this Chamber.\n  How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Approximately 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, without turning this into a bouquet-tossing \ncontest, I want Senator Conrad to know how much I appreciate his \nleadership. I also want to make sure people understand the record. If \nthe Congress had passed the bipartisan proposal the Senator put \ntogether on the budget with Senator Judd Gregg, the Conrad-Gregg \nproposal--a Democrat joined with a Republican--in 2010 we could have \nforced an actual effort to put together a comprehensive tax reform and \nspending agreement. As we know--and I don't need to go over the \nhistory--some of the sponsors of the proposal were not even willing to \ngo along. But I think it is important that the country understand we \nhave to do this in a bipartisan way. If Senator Conrad and Senator Judd \nGregg had prevailed in 2010, we could have forced actual spending \nreductions and tax reform in a bipartisan effort. I sure wish we had \nproceeded with it. And as one who supported it, I still think that \nwould have been preferable.\n\n  For 7 years before being elected to the Congress, I had the honor of \nserving senior citizens. I ran the Senior Citizens Legal Aid Office, I \nserved as the public advocate on our State's nursing home board, and I \ntaught gerontology at several of our universities.\n  What I enjoyed most was the personal contact I had with senior \ncitizens as a voluntary board member of our senior nutrition program. \nIt is known as Loaves and Fishes, and through it I could bring meals to \nseniors at their homes on a number of occasions as part of the Meals on \nWheels Program. Meals on Wheels is one part of government that truly \nunderstands the connection between the heart and the head. It touches \nthe heart because I saw when we bring a nutritious meal to seniors, we \ncan spend time visiting with them at home. Often they will tell us that \nwe are the only visitor they will have during that day. It causes us to \nuse our head and a sharp pencil. We can see without Meals on Wheels, as \nsure as the night follows the day, some of those seniors are not going \nto be able to stay in the community. They will end up needing \ninstitutional services, and those services are more costly. And, of \ncourse, seniors will often be less happy with those kinds of \ninstitutional programs.\n  I bring up Meals on Wheels today because several of the proposals \nthat are offered by colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not \ngoing to be bipartisan because they substantially cut the part of the \nbudget that funds Meals on Wheels. Through our research we specifically \nfound that in several instances it will be between 17 and 59 percent in \njust the upcoming year.\n  Putting Meals on Wheels at risk like that defies common sense. I have \nalready indicated from a compassion standpoint alone it warrants \nsupport. But even if Meals on Wheels doesn't grab your heart the way it \ndoes for me, it certainly ought to get the attention of your head \nbecause it is the kind of program that lets seniors have more of what \nthey want, which is to be at home at less price to the taxpayers. It \ndefies common sense to not be bipartisan in terms of approaching \nsomething like Meals on Wheels.\n  I think what is common sense is what Chairman Conrad and other \ncolleagues have touched on, and that is tackling the big issues in a \nbipartisan way. Certainly when it comes to Medicare, that is what is \nneeded. I would only say, having worked in this area, we ought to start \nwith the fact that we are looking at--I am not the first to describe \nthis--a demographic tsunami. For the next 20 years we are going to\n\n[[Page S3197]]\n\nhave 10,000 seniors turning 65 every single day--10,000 seniors turning \n65 every single day.\n  Fortunately, we have made a commitment in this country to those \nsenior citizens, and it is called the Medicare guarantee. That is the \ncommitment we have made to older people. It is a commitment to good \nquality, affordable health care. And if absolutely nothing is done, it \nis a commitment at risk. If nothing is done, the Medicare guarantee is \nin peril. My own sense is that if nothing is done, Medicare--as Senator \nConrad pointed out, it is already facing cuts with sequestration--will \nface a steady diet of benefit cuts and cost shifting until we do not \nrecognize the Medicare guarantee as it stands today. That is \nunacceptable to me. It ought to be unacceptable to every Member of the \nSenate.\n  As Chairman Conrad has noted, Medicare reform is going to have to be \nbipartisan. The reason I believe that is that if it is not, much like \nwe saw with health care reform, if it is done on a partisan vote, as \nsoon as the ink is dry on the signature of the passed bill, the other \nside will move to undo it or repeal it or radically alter it. I say the \nMedicare guarantee is too important for that, and that is why I, with \nother colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the help of the \nchairman, have been working to get bipartisan Medicare reform ready and \nteed up for enactment at the first possible opportunity. It is outlined \non my Web site, Bipartisan Options for Reform. I am interested in \nworking with every colleague here in the Senate to pursue it.\n  Here is what it is going to take: First and foremost, it will protect \nthe most vulnerable seniors, what are called the dual eligibles, which \nare seniors who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. The \nprotections for those dual eligibles must be ironclad.\n  Unfortunately, a number of the offerings we are going to see from \ncolleagues on the other side do not ensure ironclad protections for \nthese vulnerable seniors--the dual eligibles--and by block-granting \nMedicaid, they put at risk the most vulnerable seniors, the seniors who \nneed nursing home care that is paid for by Medicaid, and since Medicaid \nis a Federal-State program, by block-granting it, we put at risk the \nmost vulnerable seniors. That is certainly not in line with what people \nwill see on my Web site that outlines bipartisan approaches on which \nDemocrats and Republicans can come together for Medicare reform.\n  The second part of Medicare reform is to ensure that we protect \ntraditional Medicare. Traditional Medicare mandates that the government \npay doctors and other providers for services, as well as providing \nprivate sector choices that have to offer coverage that is at least as \ngood as traditional Medicare. By doing that, we force traditional \nMedicare and the private choices to hold each other accountable. It is \ngoing to be pretty hard to protect traditional Medicare and its \npurchasing power with some of what we are going to see later this \nafternoon that actually proposes to end traditional Medicare within the \nspace of 2 years.\n  Third, Medicare reform--and we went into this in a very good hearing \nthat was held in Chairman Conrad's Budget Committee--is going to \nrequire comprehensive consumer protection. I have been involved in this \nsince the days when I would go visit senior citizens and they would \nbring out a shoe box full of health insurance policies that weren't \nworth the paper on which they were written. It was a Medigap scandal \nthat we finally fixed in 1990. I have seen how these rip-off artists \ntry to exploit our seniors. So at Chairman Conrad's hearing we talked \nabout comprehensive consumer protections and specifically ensuring that \nany Medicare reform would have to have a strong risk-adjustment program \nso that if, for example, any network of health care providers or an \ninsurer took mostly healthy people, their contribution from the \ngovernment would be far less than the contribution that would be \nafforded for a program that took a greater number of older people with \nhealth challenges.\n  So I bring this up only by way of saying I am committed to bipartisan \nMedicare reform. I think Medicare is really sacred ground. It can only \nbe preserved and protected by ensuring that we take the steps I have \njust outlined--three or four of them this afternoon--which ensure that \nwe put seniors and their well-being before ideology and politics. This \nafternoon we are going to hear several alternatives offered by \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle that, in my view, don't do \nthat, don't meet that test. In effect, we are going to be dealing with \nideology rather than the kinds of principles I have outlined here today \nthat I think can win support from colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand that people can see on my own Web site have attracted the support \nof influential Republican voices.\n  So we have a test to meet. It is a test that builds on a bipartisan \napproach to a program that is sacred--I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. --and that is built around a Medicare guarantee that must \nbe protected and preserved. A number of the proposals we will get from \nthe other side this afternoon don't meet that test.\n  I want colleagues to know that I am committed to working with them to \nproduce what America wants in this Congress; that is, bipartisan \nMedicare reform that ensures that this very special program prospers in \nthe days ahead. We are up to it. We are up to it if we build on the \nbipartisan example Senator Conrad started years ago with Senator Gregg.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. I thank him for the extraordinary \nwork he has done on the Budget Committee. I thank him for the \nextraordinary work he has done as an individual Senator to propose \nbipartisan tax reform, bipartisan Medicare reform, and the kinds of \nthoughtful solutions we so desperately need.\n  I see Senator Lautenberg is here. We are glad to have the Senator. \nHow much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask for recognition from the \nPresiding Officer to move ahead with my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to inform the Senator from New \nJersey that Senator Alexander is scheduled to be here at 12:30 or \nthereabouts, so if the Senator could consume about that amount of time, \nwe can make this all work.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will give the Senator a good greeting.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, one thing we know is that a budget \nisn't just a collection of numbers, it is an expression of principles \nand priorities and direction.\n  While I have the floor, I will take a moment to say to our friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota that he has been one of the strongest \nchiefs of the Budget Committee. I sat on the Budget Committee for a \nlong time. I think it is fair to say, Republican or Democrat, the \nSenator from North Dakota deserves the thanks and respect from \neverybody here for the detail and for the arduous task he took on to \nmake sure our budgets were clear. No matter how often the challenges \ncame, Senator Conrad would stand and give the background and give the \ndetails that got him to a point of view, and we are grateful, and we \nwill certainly miss his presence here.\n  The budgets the Republicans have put forward today confirm their true \npriorities.\n  I had a good business career before coming to the Senate, and I \nremember that during the Second World War we raised taxes on high \nincomes and on excess profits because the country needed the revenues. \nWe needed to make investments.\n  Again, the budgets the Republicans have put forward today confirm \ntheir true priorities. What are they? They really are pushing, working \nhard to make sure people who make millions can get tax breaks. It is a \nlittle hard to understand, with the shortages we have and needing to \ninvest in more programs, that they are worried about those who make \nmore than $1 million a year. I have had a good business career, and I \nwant to make sure our country is strong, and I want to make sure my \ncontribution is included among those who should be paying.\n\n  What Republicans do not seem to care about in their budgeting is \nseniors, children, and middle-class Americans. At a time when our \neconomy is\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\nfighting against strong headwinds and too many Americans are out of \nwork, the Republicans are offering the same old prescriptions: tax cuts \nfor the rich and austerity for everyone else.\n  Now, I have seen this country of ours through adversity many times, \nand I have seen it come out stronger on the other side. But our \nrecoveries have never been spurred by starving the middle class while \ngiving tax breaks to the wealthy. Prosperity has never trickled down \nfrom the wealthy few. Prosperity has always grown up from a broad \nmiddle class. We can't build a building starting with a chimney, and we \ncan't build a society's strength by starting from the top. It has to \nhave a foundation at the bottom that is strong and has the ability to \nsupport the needs of our total society.\n  But a strong middle class depends on a first-rate educational \nsystem--and forgive the personal annotation here for a moment more. \nWhen I got out of the Army--I was a high school graduate. I enlisted \nwhen I was 18, and I was lucky. I was able to get an education paid for \nby the government. I was one of 8 million soldiers--service people--who \ngot our education paid for virtually because of the fact that we had \nserved in the military. As a result, half of those who were in \nuniform--8 million out of 16 million--got a college education.\n  I can tell my colleagues that it enabled me, working with two \ncolleagues, to start a company that the three of us founded, a company \nthat took years and years to build. Slowly and energetically it began \nto develop. Today that company produces the labor statistics every \nmonth for the worldwide knowledge of what is happening with working \npeople, what their wages are, what employment is like. The name of the \ncompany is ADP. We have 50,000 employees now. We were three poor boys \nwith nothing going for us except the willingness to work hard, and that \nis the value. What did we get? It was determined that was the greatest \ngeneration. Why? Because an education was given to so many who could \nlearn but didn't have the ability to get to college.\n  What we need is a society with affordable and accessible health care \nand a tax system where everyone pays their fair share.\n  The Republican budgets include vicious cuts to the middle class. Just \nlook at what they do to education. They slash funding for education by \n$19 billion. They want to do that now when we desperately need the \nskills and the knowledge that education brings and the opportunity for \ninvention and creation. They want to take away $19 billion. That is not \ngoing to help us get out of the hole we are in.\n  The Ryan budget coming from the House of Representatives would cut \neducation, as I pointed out, by $19 billion. They don't want us to see \nthe specific programs they cut, but let's look at the devastating \nconsequences if their cuts were distributed evenly.\n  I don't know whether Head Start is a familiar operation in our \ncountry, but it is one of the most valuable. I believe there are about \na million children who participate in the program. Look at the face of \nthis child, looking through a narrow prism. There are 200,000 of these \nchildren who will be told: Stay home. There is no room for you. We \ncan't afford to pay for you.\n  I recently went to a Head Start school in New Jersey and I met the \nchildren. I am such a professional grandfather that all little kids \nlook beautiful to me. I met the children. What they were learning was \nthat learning is fun. Words mean something. Pictures mean something. \nThey were prepared, when they got to kindergarten or first grade, to \nsay that learning is good.\n  I met a child there. The children lined up to greet me. This is a \nschool that is bilingual.\n  I said: What is your name?\n  The little boy standing in front of me said: My name is Julio.\n  So I put my hand out to shake his hand, and he pushed it aside and \ninstead he wrapped his arms around my legs and gave me a hug. All the \nlittle kids who followed thought he was the leader, so they all gave me \nhugs. It was one of the best days I have had, to see what happens when \nwe treat these little kids to an opportunity to learn. Imagine slashing \nfunding for a program that will help children learn how to learn.\n  These cuts are shortsighted. They are cruel. Ten million college \nstudents could see their Pell grants cut by more than $1,000 in 2014--\nvery painful.\n  With less support and rising costs for higher education, young people \nwould be forced to take on more debt in order to attend college because \nwe see college tuition is going up rapidly across the country.\n  The Republican budgets address student debt too. They would let the \ninterest rate on the new student loans double, increase by twice. It is \nan outrage. Why are Republicans putting obstacles in front of young \npeople seeking an education? I never would have been able to attend, as \nI said, Columbia University without that government help for me and the \nservices that ADP provides. It enabled me to cofound one of America's \nmost successful companies. The investment this country made when we \ncame home from World War II helped to create the momentum and direction \nof this country with decades of prosperity.\n  But instead of offering a helping hand to this generation of \nstudents, the Republican proposals close the door in their faces. \nGovernment investments in science, technology, and medical research are \ncut by more than $100 billion over the next 10 years. Medical research \nfunding alone could take a hit of nearly $6 billion by 2014.\n  What does that do? It delays research on new treatments for diseases \nsuch as cancer, childhood asthma, and juvenile diabetes. Imagine \ntelling a parent of a sick child that we could not help find the money \nto help him get back with his friends out in the play yard or the \nschoolroom or going to school on a regular basis. Is that where America \nwants to be? Right now we are finding across the country that there is \na greater likelihood that autism will enter into a family's \ndifficulties with a child being born with autism. How can we say no \nwhen we see, in my State alone, that 1 in 29 male babies has autism? \nThat is a plague. That is a terrible statistic.\n  Then we want to talk about cutting back on health research? In their \nbudgets, instead of helping seniors retire with dignity, Republicans \nhave proposed to end Medicare as we know it, giving seniors a voucher \ninstead of guaranteed care. If that voucher cannot cover the cost of \nneeded medical services, Republicans say: Hey, too bad; you are on your \nown. We have heard comments from them saying: Well, so what if you are \npoor. It does not matter.\n  I look at this chart that says: ``Ends Medicare As We Know It To \nProvide Tax Cuts For The Wealthy.'' They want to say that to people who \nneed the care, who are fortunate enough now under present conditions to \nbe able to have long-term care with a disease that is terminal.\n  The Republican plan would also cut Medicaid. Medicaid is a program \nfor those less able to provide for themselves because of low income or \nno income. The Republican plans also want to cut that by more than $800 \nbillion over 10 years. Medicaid provides vital resources such as \npregnancy services for expectant mothers and nursing home care for \nseniors.\n  We created Medicare and Medicaid because it was decided in this \ncountry as a society that we have to be there for seniors and the poor \nwhen they get sick. But now the Republicans are proposing to break that \npromise. They seem to do it without shame.\n  Republicans are not even exempting the hungry from their cuts. They \nwould eliminate food stamps for up to 10 million Americans over the \nnext decade.\n  In their obsession with austerity, they cut through far more than the \nfat in the budget. They cut into the bone.\n  Many on the other side--and I do not say all; a lot of people on the \nother side are good people concerned about their constituents, \nconcerned about what happens--but many on that side say balancing the \nbudget is the mission, the only mission. And in order to do it, they \nwant to make sure that includes a high priority for tax breaks for the \nmillionaires.\n  We could reduce our deficit if we required the wealthiest among us to \npay at least the same tax rate as middle-class Americans on all of \ntheir income. But, instead, a Republican budget would give millionaires \nan average tax cut of almost $400,000 a year. Their\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\nplan shreds the safety net for seniors and the poor while padding the \nmattress for the rich.\n  I ask my colleagues, please get your priorities straight. America \nneeds your help across the board. Your families, your neighbors, your \nState, all need your help. Millionaires do not need more tax cuts, and \nthey certainly should not get them at the expense of seniors, children, \nand the middle class.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Senator Alexander is next. I wonder if we could enter into a quick \ntime agreement to get the next Senators slotted. That might help us \nmanage the floor, I would say to my colleague, Senator Sessions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Right. I believe Senator Toomey is here and would be \nprepared to go next after Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have Senator Reed slotted in between.\n  I wonder if we could propose--I say to Senator Alexander, how much \ntime would you like?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, Mr. President, what I wish to request is--\nSenator Coons and I were hoping to introduce a piece of legislation on \nanother matter and talk about it. I think, given the focus on the \nbudget here, I am going to suggest to Senator Coons, who will be coming \nhere at 12:45, that we just mention our bill. If he could have time to \ndo that, and then we would stay focused on the budget, and we will talk \nabout the other matter tomorrow.\n  So what I wish to do, if I may suggest, is ask that I have 5 minutes \nto speak on the budget and maybe 5 minutes to speak on the other \nmatter, for Senator Coons to be recognized for 5 minutes, and that \nwould take all of the time I would ask for.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The problem is, we are oversubscribed by that. It is \ndifficult to--we have not been yielding for things that are not budget \nrelated, I would say to the Senator. So I wonder if it would be \nagreeable if the Senator would take 5 minutes on the budget, we come \nback to Senator Reed, if he could take 5 minutes on the budget, and \nthen we go to Senator Toomey for 15 minutes on the budget because he \nhas a substantive budget alternative that deserves additional time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I think that is a reasonable request. I \nwonder if I might ask on behalf of Senator Coons that if he should come \nto the floor during that period, he be recognized for 1 minute to \nsimply stand up and say he was planning to do this, but we will defer \nthe introduction of our bill until tomorrow out of respect for the \nbudget discussion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander be \nrecognized for 5 minutes on the budget, Senator Reed of Rhode Island \nfor 5 minutes on the budget, then Senator Toomey for 15 minutes on the \nbudget, and if Senator Coons comes after that point he be recognized \nfor a minute on a separate matter, and then we come back to Senator \nWhitehouse for 8 minutes. If we could lock those in I think that would \nhelp all Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, am I now recognized for 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President. Please let me know when 30 \nseconds is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n\n                      Foreign Student Legislation\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Coons will come to the floor in \na few minutes. He and I have been working together on legislation that \nmany Senators on both sides of the aisle support.\n  Very simply, it pins a green card on the lapel of any foreign student \nwho is involved in science, engineering, technology graduate programs \nwho gets a degree and who wants to stay in the United States and work. \nWhat we would like for them to do, instead of going home to create the \nnext Google in India or China or some other country, is to stay here \nand create it here.\n  The legislation has broad support. It is a recommendation of the \nAmerican Competes Act which I worked on and many others did in 2005 and \n2007. We will come to the floor and talk about that tomorrow. But I \nwanted to salute Senator Coons for his leadership on this issue and \nrecognize it.\n  Now I will turn to the budget with my remaining time.\n  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently said the \nworst mistake President Obama made was not embracing his own fiscal \ncommission's recommendations to reduce our debt by $4 trillion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Today, our national debt is more than $15.6 trillion, which is nearly \n$1.9 trillion higher than it was when the fiscal commission released \nits recommendations and $6.4 trillion higher than when President Obama \nwas sworn in. In January 2013, the first thing the next President will \nhave to do is to ask the Congress to increase the debt ceiling. The \nfundamental problem is that Washington does not know how to balance its \ncheckbook.\n  The President has proposed a budget that raises taxes by $1.9 \ntrillion over the next 10 years and still spends more than it takes in \nevery year, instead of endorsing the fiscal commission's \nrecommendations--or any other plan to address our Nation's fiscal \ncrisis. According to the Congressional Budget Office, under the \nPresident's budget, interest on our debt will triple over the next 10 \nyears, and by 2022 we will be spending more in interest than we spend \non national defense.\n  This is an irresponsible proposal, and instead of playing politics we \nshould be working together on a plan to address the debt, which is the \nmost urgent problem facing our country and, according to former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, the biggest \nthreat to our national security.\n  The Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission plan, the Domenici-Rivlin plan, \nand the Gang of Six proposal all offer bipartisan blueprints for how to \naddress it. Each of these proposals would reform the Tax Code and \nrestructure entitlement spending--the main source of our dangerous \nFederal debt--so that seniors can count on Medicare and Social Security \nand taxpayers can afford them.\n  Mandatory entitlement spending, which is 58 percent of the Federal \nbudget, is growing at nearly 3 times inflation and bankrupting our \ncountry. Discretionary spending, which funds our national defense, our \nhighways, our national parks, and National Laboratories, is only 36 \npercent of the Federal budget and is growing at the rate of inflation. \nFocusing our budget cutting on discretionary spending is just a way for \nCongress--to use the President's words--to kick the can down the road. \nThe real work is reducing the growth of mandatory spending.\n  Although the Senate is not debating its own budget resolution, going \n1,113 days without passing a budget, we are debating several proposals. \nI do not agree with every one of these, but I do support the House-\npassed budget because it is a serious proposal to cut out-of-control \nspending and help solve our fiscal crisis.\n  I will also support the proposal offered by Senator Toomey. Even \nthough it cuts nondefense discretionary spending to 2006 levels, which \nI believe is too low, it reforms mandatory entitlement spending, it \ncloses tax loopholes, it lowers tax rates, and it would save Medicare \nfor future generations.\n  Senator Toomey and I have also discussed the possibility of allowing \nStates to have the option of choosing per capita caps on their average \nMedicaid expenditures per beneficiary as an alternative to traditional \nblock grants, and I am encouraged by these discussions.\n  Last August, I supported the Budget Control Act because it was an \nopportunity to take an important step in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The House-passed budget and the budget proposed by Senator Toomey are \nopportunities to take the next step after the Budget Control Act. I \nlook forward to working with them to adopt a responsible budget that \ngrows the economy and reduces our debt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\n                         Student Loan Interest\n\n  Mr. REED. In 46 days, the interest rate on subsidized student loans \nwill be doubled. Zeroing in on these budgets that are before us, all of \nthem seem to support the essence of the Ryan budget, which is to allow \nthis to happen. In fact, the Ryan budget in the House not only allowed \na doubling of student interest rates, it also recommended eliminating \nthe in-school interest subsidies for student loans, putting middle-\nclass families at a particularly severe disadvantage.\n  We have 46 days to stop this increase on the interest charges to \nmiddle-income students. We have to act. We have seen denial, delay, and \ndisruption. We have not seen the cooperation we need to help students \nand families throughout this country.\n  The budget before us not only allows this interest rate to double, \nbut it will also, through its tax policies, favor the wealthiest and \nnot those who are struggling in the middle simply to get ahead or \nsimply to stay where they are. One of the other interesting aspects of \nthe proposal is that as we look at this student rate interest doubling, \nmy colleagues on the other side have said: We will fix it. We are for \nfixing it. But, again, ask yourself: If they are for it, why are they \nvoting for several budgets today that would, in fact, support the \ndoubling? It seems to be an incongruity I cannot understand.\n  In addition to that, they said: Well, if we are going to go ahead and \nstop this doubling of the rate, let's do it by paying for it with the \nprevention fund, which is a program in health care that I think, over \ntime, is not only going to help families all across this country, but \nit is going to begin to do what we have all said we have to do, bend \nthat cost curve for health care.\n  Instead of a debate about how to pay for this in a responsible way--\nand we are certainly open to proposals if they have them, other than \nthis prevention fund, which I think is a nonstarter--they have \nsuggested that our proposal, which is to close an egregious loophole in \nthe Tax Code, is somehow a tax increase or somehow does not do the job. \nBut Politifact, which is an objective body that looks at these various \ncharges, has evaluated one claim that, in fact, our offset is a tax \nincrease. Here is what they say:\n\n       Actually, the bill changed tax rules only for S-\n     corporations, and only on professionals like lawyers and \n     accountants who could be taking advantage of the tax code to \n     avoid paying payroll taxes. The Democrats took the additional \n     step of saying the rule change would only apply to \n     individuals who reported more than $200,000 in income.\n       The bill's intent was to close a loophole on people who are \n     avoiding payroll taxes, taxes that they are supposed to pay \n     anyway.\n\n  The Republican criticism ``gives the impression that all kinds of \nmom-and-pop operations might be subject to new, additional taxes, when \nactually the bill is aimed squarely at high-income professionals who \nare taking advantage of a loophole.\n  The claim was rated by this organization as false. We are closing a \nloophole that benefits the wealthy and some of the most powerful \ninterests in this country in order to allow middle-income families to \nsend their children to school. I cannot think of anything more sensible \nor anything more fair.\n  I will just return to the final point about these budgets. As I read \nthem, they, by and large, echo the Ryan budget, which allows for a \ndoubling of the interest rate on students and does other things that \nwill harm middle-income and middle-class people all to benefit the \nwealthiest through additional tax cuts. That is not good fiscal policy, \nnot good educational policy. It is not good policy for the growth of \nthis country, to invest in education, and it is not fair. I would hope \nthat we would reject them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nAlexander, in briefly making reference to a bill which we introduced \ntoday and which we will speak about in more detail on the Senate floor \ntomorrow.\n  At the moment, the Senate is engaged in an important and purposeful \ndebate on the budget. I support Chairman Conrad and his leadership of \nour Budget Committee. We will cast a series of other important and \ndifficult votes on budget matters later today. But I take 1 minute to \nsay that at a time when there is not enough bipartisanship, I am \ngrateful to Senator Alexander for his leadership and for working with \nme on an issue that will, I hope, move forward--the debate on how we \nmake the promise and the opportunity of America open to more real job \ncreators.\n  The record shows that a significant number of the most innovative and \nfastest growing companies in America were founded by immigrants. \nImmigrants have long contributed significantly to our culture, to our \nstrength, and to our competitiveness. I think this particular bill, \nwhich opens a new class of visa for students from outside the United \nStates who would pursue master's or doctoral programs in STEM, is an \nimportant step forward.\n  There are many other issues in immigration we need to resolve. There \nare many other elements we need to reform. But I am grateful for the \nchance to work with Senator Alexander on this bill and will address it \nfurther tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the budget resolution I \nhave introduced and on which we will have a vote later today, at least \non a motion to proceed. I want to start with underscoring the magnitude \nof the challenge we face. We have a full-blown crisis that awaits. It \ncould arrive at any moment virtually if we do not change the course we \nare on.\n  The deficit we have in 2012, $1.3 trillion, is the fourth consecutive \nyear with a deficit of over $1 trillion. We are now routinely running \ndeficits that are 7, 8, 9 percent of GDP. Of course, every year we run \na deficit, the excessive spending over the tax revenue has to be funded \nby more borrowing. So we have the mounting debt that is now at stunning \nlevels. For much of the post-war era, after the big repayment of debt \nafter World War II, the national debt fluctuated somewhere around 40 \npercent of our total economic output.\n  Today our actual debt held by the public is 73 percent of our total \neconomic output, and that is just the publicly held debt. That does not \ninclude the liabilities within the government, which, if you add that, \nis up to 100 percent of our total economic output. This has never ended \nwell for a country that last chose to run up massive deficits and \nmassive debt. I would argue that we are seeing exactly how this \ntypically plays out. We are seeing it across the Atlantic in Europe \nwhere countries are a little further down this road than we are today, \nhaving run big structural deficits for longer than we have, and having \naccumulated more debt as a percentage of GDP than we have thus far.\n\n  We see what has happened, especially in countries such as Greece \nwhere it is particularly acute, and other countries, especially on the \nperiphery of Europe, that arguably are not terribly far behind. This is \ncompletely unsustainable, and I think what we are witnessing today on \nthe Senate floor is that there is one party in this Chamber that is \naddressing the problem. There is one party that is proposing very \nspecific solutions.\n  It is perfectly reasonable to have objections and disagreements with \nany number of elements in my budget resolution or Senator Paul's or \nSenator Lee's or the Ryan budget. But what I do not understand is how \nthe majority party, the party that is actually in control of this \nChamber, can think that it is OK not to have an alternative, not to \noffer a vision, not to offer a solution to the biggest problem we face \nas a nation and one that is imminent; one that if left unaddressed \ncertainly will result in a crisis. It is just a question of when.\n  So I think this is an unacceptable abdication of responsibility. But \nthat is where we are. I would argue that what got us into this problem \nis too much spending. Look at the numbers. They speak volumes. Since \n2000, Federal spending has more than doubled. We took spending, which \nwas as recently as 2007 only a little over 19 percent of our total \neconomic output, and grew that to 24 percent of our economic output. \nThat is a tremendous surge, not just in the absolute dollars in \nspending but in the relative size of spending relative to our economy.\n  President Obama's budget is not a serious attempt to deal with this. \nIt was\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\nput on the floor of the House of Representatives and got precisely zero \nvotes. It failed 414 to 0, meaning not a single Democrat wanted to vote \nfor the President's proposal. I can understand why. The President's \nproposal is to increase spending, increase taxes, and increase debt.\n  The President's proposal claims to level off debt as a percentage of \nGDP for a brief time but then starts to grow again. The reason the \nPresident absolutely refuses to offer a budget resolution that solves \nthis problem is because he refuses to deal with the real underlying \ndriver of this, which we all know are the big entitlement programs.\n  The current structure of these programs is unsustainable. If anyone \ndoubts it, look at what CBO has shown us and has told us. By 2021, 9 \nyears from now, if we take three categories of Federal spending: the \nSocial Security Program, interest on our debt, and health care \nentitlements, those three things combined will consume almost 90 \npercent of all of the revenue we can realistically hope to collect, if \nthe last several decades are any indication of what we are going to \ncollect.\n  How could it possibly be that we would continue down this path where \nthose three categories are going to consume virtually the entire \nbudget? I would also observe it is a simple matter of arithmetic that \nno significant Federal Government program can grow faster than the \neconomy for very long because everything has to be paid for by the \neconomy. In fact, it has to be paid for by some fraction of the \neconomy. If we have a big program that is consistently growing much \nfaster than the economy, well, it will consume everything. Then these \nprograms will collapse, and then what are we going to do?\n  Rather than waiting for that day to come, some of us are proposing \nspecific solutions for this problem. Medicare is growing much faster \nthan the economy. Medicaid is growing, arguably, at least two times as \nfast as the economy. Other mandatory health care programs, if President \nObama gets his way, will grow even faster.\n  This is all completely unsustainable, and we are going to fix this \nproblem. The question is whether we fix it while we have this window of \ntime, when we are still able to borrow the massive sums that we are \nborrowing, or will we wait until we have a full blown crisis, the bond \nmarket shuts us down, and then we have sudden Draconian and very \ndisruptive and painful decisions to make.\n  I would rather do this while we have this moment, change the course \nwe are on, and establish a sustainable fiscal path. So I have submitted \na budget for the second consecutive year that puts us on a path to \nbalance. My budget balances within the 10-year historical window of the \nbudget resolutions. It actually balances in the eighth year and runs a \nvery modest budget surplus in the ninth year.\n  I do that in part by reducing the total level of spending relative to \nGDP as compared to the alternative budgets, specifically the \nPresident's alternative or CBO's. I cannot compare it to the Senate's \nDemocratic alternative budget because that does not exist. We have no \nidea what the Senate Democratic proposal is, but I have one.\n  So I will elaborate on that a little bit. My proposal is that we get \nspending down to about 18.3 percent of GDP. That is about the same \nlevel revenue has been historically, which thereby brings our budget \ninto balance. Some of my colleagues have suggested there are Draconian \nspending cuts that will get us there. Well, let me be very specific \nabout what spending cuts are necessary to achieve this.\n  In 2013, spending in my budget is 2.9 percent below what it is in \n2012, which means the Federal Government will spend--under my budget, \nit would spend 97.1 percent of everything it spent the previous year. \nPeople can decide whether that constitutes Draconian cuts.\n  Now, here is the amazing thing. After that, on average, over the 10-\nyear window, my budget calls for Federal spending to increase--in fact, \nto increase at about a rate of 3 percent per year nominally. See, this \nis my point. This is a solvable problem. All we need to do is cut out \nsome of the excess, restructure certain programs, and allow the \ngovernment spending to grow. It just cannot grow quite as rapidly as it \nis currently projected to do.\n  If we get that under control, we can put ourselves on a sustainable \npath.\n  Another part of this is to have policies that maximize economic \ngrowth. I mean that is an important goal in and of itself, but it is \nalso a path to restoring balance because stronger growth generates more \nrevenue for the Treasury.\n  Well, my budget would do that without raising taxes. What I would do \nis have progrowth tax reform. That is comparable in spirit and in the \nright direction. It goes to all of the bipartisan commissions that have \nlooked at this, whether it is Simpson-Bowles or Rivlin-Domenici or any \nof the others. I know there is broad bipartisan consensus on the \nprinciple that we would have stronger economic growth if we simplified \nthe code, broaden the base on which we apply taxes, and then apply \nthose taxes but at lower marginal rates. That is what my budget calls \nfor. It should not be all that controversial to move in this direction \nof tax simplification, lowering marginal rates, and offsetting the lost \nrevenue by reducing the value of deductions and loopholes and \nwriteoffs. That is what my budget asks for.\n  There are a couple of areas that I think are important where there is \nbipartisan support for elements within my budget. One is, the President \nof the United States suggested in his budget that very wealthy senior \ncitizens contribute a little bit more for the Medicare benefits that \nthey obtain. Some means testing already occurs within Medicare. But I \nhappen to agree with the President that it is reasonable, especially \nunder these circumstances, to ask the wealthiest members of our society \nto pay a little more for the benefits they are getting from the \ngovernment.\n  So my budget adopts the President's proposal of expanding means \ntesting, expanding the contribution we would ask from the wealthiest \nAmericans for their Medicare benefits.\n  I also include in my budget long-term reform for Medicare that makes \nit more viable. This has been much maligned despite the fact that one \nof our Democratic colleagues, Senator Wyden, supports this approach as \nwell.\n  I wish to emphasize that this is a different plan than what it was \nlast year. Last year there was a criticism that any premium support \nmodel that establishes the amount of money given to seniors to purchase \nhealth care at a fixed dollar amount was a flawed approach because what \nif health care costs rose more rapidly than that amount could afford to \npay for? That is a valid concern.\n  There is a different dynamic, a different mechanism in the House-\npassed budget, and in my budget, and I think it is part of the reason a \nDemocratic Senator has embraced this, and Alice Rivlin, a former senior \nmember of the Clinton administration, supports this. You set the \npremium based on the second lowest bid for the health care services we \nwant to provide, thereby ensuring that a senior citizen would have \nenough money to purchase that plan. Not only that but we go further and \ninclude the traditional fee-for-service Medicare system to which \nseniors are currently accustomed--we include that as one of the plans \nthat could bid. So it is absolutely the case that any senior citizen \nwho wanted to stay with the traditional fee-for-service Medicare \nProgram could do so under the reform plan.\n  I happen to believe that in an innovative marketplace, there will be \nmore attractive options. I happen to know that under this system, a lot \nof seniors--my parents included--have to wait forever to see a doctor, \nand part of the problem is the dysfunctional system we have now. It is \nalready costing us access and quality in health care.\n  I think this reform will make Medicare a better program for the \npeople who need it. Yes, we will ask the wealthy to pay a little more \nfor it. That is reasonable. Those seniors who want to stay in \ntraditional Medicare can do that too. In the process, you can put this \non a sustainable path. It has some bipartisan support. Mr. President, \nwe don't really know the extent of that because our Democratic \ncolleagues refuse to put a budget or mark up a budget in committee, \npresent one on the floor.\n  I will close with this request, which is to vote for the motion to \nproceed.\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\nLet's get on to my budget and have a debate about this, and let's see \nwhere people are. I don't know how we are ever going to reach the \ncompromise we need to reach to put us on a sustainable path if one \nparty is consistently putting out a whole range of ideas and the other \nparty refuses. How do you negotiate with somebody who doesn't have a \nposition? How do you have that discussion?\n  I don't know how many of my Democratic colleagues agree with the \nPresident of the United States and my own thought that we ought to ask \nwealthy seniors to pay a little more for Medicare benefits. If we get \non the bill, we could have a debate and have amendments. I think this \nis too big and too important an issue not to address. The way to \naddress it is to vote yes on the motion to proceed to get on a budget \nresolution, and then let's have that discussion and let the American \npeople see it. Let's take their ideas and all of the ideas we have and \nsee if we can make some progress.\n  There is an unambiguous fact that I want to underscore. There is one \nparty showing up at this debate--the three Republican Senators who are \nproposing budget resolutions, comprehensive documents that address the \nentitlement reform we need, the discretionary spending limit we need, \nand the tax reform that will help grow this economy and generate the \nrevenue we need. We have done that. As I say, it is perfectly fair and \nlegitimate to criticize any aspect of any of that, but I think there is \nan obligation especially of the majority to offer its view, its \nalternative.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion to proceed and \nallow us to get on with addressing the single most pressing problem \nfacing our country, which is restoring a fiscally viable path that \nallows us to have strong economic growth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think we allocated 8 minutes to Senator \nWhitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That was part of a unanimous consent agreement so that we \ncould manage the time on the floor better. We have, I say to the \nSenator, 60 minutes left on our side. I think they have 100 minutes \nleft on their side. We have seven Senators left.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Eight minutes just about works, from the math.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the chairman, Senator Conrad, for his \nleadership on this important issue.\n  I would note for the record that with the conclusion of Senator \nToomey's remarks, following Senator Reed, I think for the first time in \nthe history of the Senate we had back-to-back presentations by two \nseparate Senators who were graduates of LaSalle Academy in Providence, \nRI--noteworthy, perhaps, in Rhode Island.\n  I did note in his remarks his references to the magnitude of this \nchallenge, to the full-blown crisis he perceives, to the completely \nunsustainable nature of our outward debt, that this is too big and too \nimportant not to address, and that this is the single most pressing \nproblem our country faces--all of which might lead one to conclude that \nthis would be the most important thing they would pursue. Yet we know \nit is less important to them to address our debt problem than it is to \nprotect oil and gas subsidies for Big Oil at a time when their profits \nare unprecedented; it is less important than protecting tax loopholes \nthat allow high-income individuals to incorporate themselves and avoid \npaying FICA taxes; it is less important to them than protecting special \ntax rates that allow people making $100 million a year to pay a lower \ntax rate than a family making $100,000 a year. So it seems that when \nyou actually look at practice--what their priorities are--this isn't \nquite the priority they claim it is.\n  I agree there are other priorities we face as a country. This July, \nunless we move quickly, student loan interest rates will double, which \nwill hurt our economy, our growth, and it will hit families across this \ncountry. We brought forward a plan to keep those rates down, but our \ncolleagues filibustered it. Our Nation's highway program will expire \nnext month, jeopardizing millions of jobs. We voted overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan basis to reauthorize the highway bill and move forward on \nit, only to have our bipartisan highway bill stalled by House \nRepublicans. Republicans may talk about jobs, but they are busily \nstalling the most important jobs bill we have. That stalling and delay \nwill cost jobs because of the summer building season in so many of our \nStates.\n\n  One thing that has not been urgent has been to pass a budget. Why is \nthat? Well, it is because we already have one. This whole exercise \ntoday rests on a false premise. The false premise is that we have no \nbudget. Last summer Congress passed and the President signed into law \nthe bipartisan Budget Control Act, which sets binding discretionary \nspending levels for a decade and establishes budget levels for the \ncurrent fiscal year and next, which our appropriations committees are \nnow working under--Republicans and Democrats together. But you would \nnot know this when listening to Senate Republicans. Instead of focusing \non real issues, where real jobs are at stake, they are wasting a day of \nfloor time on extremist tea party budgets. They also plan to force a \nvote on what they describe as the ``Obama budget.''\n  I plan to vote against all of the motions to proceed for the simple \nreason that we already have a budget in place that we voted on and \nagreed to for next year. Today's votes are nothing more than a \nRepublican attempt to promote a radical and unwelcome agenda of \nslashing middle-class programs while protecting and enlarging tax \ngiveaways for the ultrarich.\n  Let's make no mistake about what this would do to middle-class \nfamilies. The House Republican budget would start by cutting taxes for \nbig corporations and the ultrarich, adding $4.6 trillion to our \nnational debt. To pay for these extra tax cuts, the Republicans would \ndecimate programs on which regular American families at some point in \ntheir lives come to rely. They start by ending Medicare as we know it. \nBeginning for workers who retire in 2023, the House Republican budget \nwould make it a voucher system, which, according to the nonpartisan \nCBO, will add an estimated $6,000 in annual out-of-pocket costs for \neach retiree by 2050. In Rhode Island, the average annual Social \nSecurity benefit is about $13,600. It is hard to imagine how future \nseniors living on a fixed Social Security income will be able to \nmaintain health care coverage with that kind of extra cost dropped on \nthem individually. At the same time that they would slash Medicare, the \nHouse Republican budget gives those making over $1 million per year an \naverage tax cut of over $150,000.\n  If you are getting older or you are a working family and you are \ngoing to need Medicare one day, you will get an end to Medicare as we \nknow it. If you are making over $1 million, you get an average tax cut \nof over $150,000. Those are not real priorities for the people I \nrepresent in Rhode Island.\n  It doesn't stop there. They repeal the affordable care act, which \nwould reopen the doughnut hole. The affordable care act has helped \nnearly 15,000 Rhode Islanders save an average of $554 each last year \njust by closing the doughnut hole partway, and soon it will be all the \nway. That made a difference to people such as Olive in Woonsocket, \nwhose husband fell into the doughnut hole last July. Thanks to the new \nlaw, they saved $2,400. Under the House Republican budget, they would \nbe stuck paying that $2,400 as an out-of-pocket cost to the big drug \ncompanies.\n  The radical House budget would slash funding for Pell grants, and it \nwould increase interest on student loans. We have all heard people say \nhere that they don't want to encourage the increase in student loan \nrates we are facing. But while they say that, they, of course, are \nfilibustering our effort to do that. In their budget, they build in the \nincrease in the interest rate. So they speak from two notions.\n  The House budget requires only $1 trillion in additional and \nunspecified cuts, and that will be Draconian. Senator Paul's budget, \nwhich we may take up today, would also slash middle-class programs, \nincluding Social Security. He includes an eventual 39 percent cut to \nSocial Security benefits and would end Medicare for all seniors in \n2014. If you want to put an end to Medicare in 2014, the Paul budget \nlooks like a really great opportunity for you. But that is not what I \nthink anybody really\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\nwants in this country. I think almost every American wants to see \nMedicare strengthened and supported.\n  We should move on from this unnecessary budget messaging exercise and \nresume our work to keep student loan rates down and support good-paying \nhighway jobs--bills that are being delayed that we need action on now. \nWhen we turn to a real debate about deficit reduction, I hope my \ncolleagues will unshackle themselves from the tea party and put forward \na budget that doesn't put Big Oil subsidies ahead in priority of taking \ncare of our real budget problems. They have to get over putting the \npriorities first of protecting Big Oil subsidies.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. I thank him for \nhis contributions on the Budget Committee. I don't think there has been \nany stronger voice for fundamental health care reform along the lines \nof dealing with the system we currently have that, by most accounts, is \ncosting us hundreds of billions of dollars and not adding to the \nquality of health care. Nobody has been a stronger voice on the Budget \nCommittee or off of it on that subject. I appreciate the Senator's \nleadership.\n  We have Senator Wicker next. Does the Senator have an estimate as to \nhow much time he may consume?\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I have been told I have 10 minutes \nallocated, and I shall use probably less than that allocation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Very well. Senator Wicker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Chair for recognizing me and I appreciate the \ntime.\n  I want to agree with my friend from Rhode Island to this extent: He \nsaid this debate is based on a false premise. And I agree with him in \nthis respect. This is not a reality debate about a budget resolution. \nThese are show votes. These are messaging votes we have today.\n  One can argue all he or she wants that we have a budget in place that \nwe voted on last year, but there is no getting around 2 U.S.C. 631, \nwhich is the budget law of the United States of America, passed back in \n1974. That budget law requires Congress each year to pass a budget \nresolution. As a matter of fact, it says on or before April 15 of each \nyear, Congress completes action on a concurrent resolution on the \nbudget.\n  The last time this Senate did that was in 2009. We missed the April \n15 deadline in 2010, the leadership of this body missed that deadline \nin 2011, and they missed it again this year. It has been that long \nsince this body, under the leadership of my friends across the aisle, \nhave complied with the explicit terms of the Federal statute and \nbrought a budget to full consideration on the floor.\n  What we will have today is debate on five concepts. I am happy to \nvote for some of them, and will certainly vote against others, but make \nno mistake about it, this is not the process called for by the Federal \nstatute and it doesn't comply with the law and doesn't serve the \npurposes of advancing public policy in the United States of America. We \nare long overdue for a real budget debate that puts something in place.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, we have passed the 3-year mark now--\n1,100 days--since Senate Democrats fulfilled one of their basic \nobligations, as I mentioned, laid out in Federal statute. A recent \ncolumn in the Washington Times pointed out that the iPad had not yet \neven been introduced when the last budget was passed on the floor of \nthis Senate. But since that time, in 3 years, Federal spending has \ntopped a staggering $10 trillion.\n  Every day our country's debt grows closer to $16 trillion. This is \nmoney my generation will not be able to pay. We have our pages here on \nthe floor. Even their generation will not be able to pay off this $16 \ntrillion in debt. It will be left to their children and grandchildren. \nAnnual deficits continue to soar, adding to that debt--over $1 trillion \neach year during President Obama's time in office--even though the \nPresident promised in 2009 he would cut the deficit in half during his \nfirst term, a promise that certainly has not been fulfilled. Instead, \nhis latest budget relies more on spending, new taxes, and accounting \ngimmicks, and it leaves insolvent entitlement programs without \nmeaningful reform.\n  I noticed the previous speaker stated he would not be voting for \nPresident Obama's budget proposal. I think it is because it is such a \nfalse and weak proposal. I expect the Obama budget today would get the \nsame response it got on the floor of the Senate during these messaging \nvotes last year when it failed to get a single vote. As I understand \nit, it failed to get a single vote in the House of Representatives. Not \none Republican or Democrat in the House of Representatives earlier this \nyear was willing to step forward and embrace the Obama budget proposal, \nand it got a big fat zero when it was put to a messaging vote in the \nHouse of Representatives. So we are watching a disastrous trajectory \nand we need to change it now.\n  Families, businesses, and organizations in my home State of \nMississippi, and in every State across the country, know the importance \nof having a sensible budget and living within that budget; likewise, \ntaxpayers deserve to see a blueprint of where their money is going and \nhow much will be spent. Washington must be held accountable.\n  We heard talk on the other side of the aisle about priorities that \nour Democratic friends wish to see enacted. The Democratic majority in \nthe Budget Committee needs to bring those priorities forward. They need \nto wrap them up in a budget resolution and bring them to the floor. \nThat is the one thing we are not seeing today--a proposal by the \nDemocratic majority.\n  It only takes 51 votes to pass a budget. There is no two-thirds rule \non a budget resolution. There is no filibuster on a budget resolution. \nMy Democratic colleagues, many of whom are dear friends of mine, have \n53 Members in this caucus. They have the votes. We know a budget is \nrequired every year. Yet with a 53-vote majority, and with only 51 \nvotes required, they do not bring a budget to the floor for us to \nconsider so we can know what their budget priorities are.\n  There are plenty of excuses from across the aisle for not complying \nwith the clear mandate, but there is no excuse. It is inexcusable that \nthe majority party in this Chamber refuses to fulfill this statutory \nresponsibility when the warning signs of fiscal calamity are at our \ndoorstep.\n  You know, it is no wonder our popularity rating as a Congress is down \naround 10 or 11 percent when this Federal statute explicitly requires \nus to do this by April of each year and we do not do it. It is no \nwonder we are held in such low regard by the public. Inaction \nultimately bequeaths a burden of debt to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  We certainly cannot blame the inaction on an absence of ideas. As has \nbeen stated by my friend from Rhode Island, we have five proposals \nbefore us today. President Obama's will probably get zero votes. The \nHouse Republican blueprint will be considered, and budgets from \nSenators Lee, Paul, and Toomey. Yet the Senate Democrats, regrettably, \nstay on the sidelines. They have the votes, but we do not have their \nproposal on the floor--one they are willing to put forward and tell the \nAmerican people they own.\n  My friend the budget chairman has suggested the upcoming election \nstands in the way. In April he said:\n\n       This is the wrong time to vote in committee. This is the \n     wrong time to vote on the floor. I don't think we will be \n     prepared to vote before the election.\n\n  I want to make it clear, I have the highest affection and regard for \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, but I do believe what he is \nsaying, in other words, is that we have a job to do, we have a law to \ncomply with, but we are not going to bring it up at this time because \nof political concerns. I think political concerns are keeping our \nfriends on the other side from saying where they stand on the budget \nissues. I think political concerns are keeping them from making the \nhard choices.\n\n  I can imagine the American taxpayer would like to know when will be \nthe right time for the Senate to begin complying with Federal law and \nthe right time for a budget that takes fiscal responsibility seriously. \nThey know kicking the can down the road will not make the debt problem \ngo away.\n  I noticed recently our Commander in Chief told a Russian leader that \nafter\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nthe election he would have more flexibility on a national security \nissue--the issue of national military defense. He said, I need to have \nsome time, because after the election I will have more flexibility. \nPlease pass that along to Vladimir. I suppose my friends on the other \nside of the aisle believe they will have more flexibility on spending \nissues and budget issues and taxation issues after the election.\n  The truth is Republicans and Democrats have differences on a number \nof issues, but that should not deter a concentrated effort to lower the \ndeficit and curb runaway spending. I hope this week we can focus on \nconstructive dialogue. I would have hoped we would have an honest \nprocess and do what is right and necessary to put this country's fiscal \nhouse back in order.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I may, if the Senator could do his presentation in \nabout 8 minutes, we have six speakers left and we have 50 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I will be happy to do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in listening to the presentation of my \nfriend from Mississippi, I am reminded of the words of Harry Truman \nwhen he said something to the effect: The only thing new in the world \nis the history we forgot or never learned.\n  I want to go back in history. I want to go back about 15 years. We \nhad gone from 1968 to 1997 and never balanced a budget. All those \nyears--almost 30 years. Then President Clinton said to Erskine Bowles, \nhis Chief of Staff, figure out a way to maybe negotiate a balanced \nbudget deal with Republicans in the House and in the Senate and see \nwhat kind of deal you can get. So Erskine went out and negotiated and \ncame up with a deal. It was the deficit reduction deal that lead to not \none but three balanced budgets by the end of that decade. Interestingly \nenough, half of the debt reduction was on the spending side and half \nthe debt reduction was on the revenue side.\n  Now fast forward to 2001, a new President, a change in \nadministration, and as far as the eye could see not just balanced \nbudgets but plenty of black ink--surpluses as far as the eye could see. \nEight years later, we had another change in administration, and a new \nPresident was handed over a $1 trillion deficit, the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression, and we are still trying to dig our way out \nof that. When we tried to pass legislation here to create a deficit \ncommission a couple of years ago and failed--we were short of votes, \nand our Republican friends who had cosponsored that measure, as I \nrecall, ended up not voting for it--this President used his own \nexecutive powers to say we are going to have a deficit commission and \nhe asked Erskine Bowles to head it up, along with Alan Simpson, a \nformer Senator and deficit hawk from Wyoming.\n  There were 18 good people, including some from this Chamber, who went \nto work on a real deficit reduction plan--Democrats and Republicans--\nand 11 out of the 18 ended up voting for this kind of plan. It was not \na 50 50 deal on deficit reduction, but $3 on the spending side for \nevery $1 on the revenue side, with $4 trillion to $5 trillion in \ndeficit reduction over a 10-year period of time.\n  As my friend mentioned, we are seeing a lot of different ideas. We \nhave a bunch here on the floor. The administration submitted their \nbudget as well, and, frankly, none of them come close to being as good \nas Bowles-Simpson. Alice Rivlin has done good work. Pete Domenici, our \nformer colleague here in the Senate from New Mexico, has done a good \none. But in the end, they all come back to pretty much the same place. \nBowles-Simpson says we are going to raise $1 in revenue for every $3 on \nthe spending side.\n  The grand compromise was Democrats agreeing to entitlement programs \nreform--not to get rid of them but make sure they are going to be \naround for our children and grandchildren. And on the revenue side, we \nactually raise revenues by reducing the rates on the individual side \nand the corporate side, and we eliminated by half the so-called ``tax \nexpenditures'' in the Tax Code--tax credits, tax reductions, tax \nloopholes, tax breaks. We got rid of about half of them.\n  So the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission plan enjoys the support of \nalmost half the Senate--almost half the Senate. Pretty much an equal \nnumber of Democrats and Republicans. We have a budget in place right \nnow. We have a budget in place for 2012. We have a budget that is going \nto be effective for 2013. Right now, we are seeing a deficit reduction \nof $600 billion in defense spending implemented over a 10-year period \nof time. Right now, we are seeing a deficit reduction of $600 billion \nin domestic discretionary spending implemented over a 10-year period of \ntime. And if we don't come up with an agreement, such as Bowles-\nSimpson, we will see $600 billion more of deficit reduction on the \ndefense side, another $600 billion on the nondefense side, and some \nentitlement program changes as well.\n  A much better plan than doing that--even though that adds up to about \n$2 trillion worth of deficit reduction for this year and the coming \nfiscal year--is the kind of comprehensive balanced plan we have been \ngiven by the deficit commission. My hope is, at the end of the day, \nwhen we have the opportunity to debate here--later this year, when the \nelections are behind us--people will actually turn around and say, \nlet's try to figure out the right thing to do, and then do it. This is \nthe right thing to do. In the meantime, let's not waste the next 6, 7, \nor 8 months.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues to join the bipartisan efforts of \npeople such as Tom Coburn and myself and others, Senator Conrad and \nSenator Grassley and others, and to join us in going to work on a to-do \nlist provided to us by GAO, the Government Accountability Office. That \nto-do list is just full of ways to avoid wasting money, and it includes \nways to save money by reducing improper payments. We are down from $119 \nbillion last year to $115 billion this year, finally heading in the \nright direction, reducing fraud in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Some very good stuff is being done there to help reduce the fraud \nlosses. We have all this surplus property, a lot of which we don't \nneed. The idea is to get rid of that, and we are beginning to do that. \nWe have too many bad information technology projects and too many \ninformation processing centers. We are getting rid of a bunch of those \nwe don't need. There is actually some good work that is beginning to be \ndone. We can do more, and we ought to do more.\n  Lastly, I would suggest we ought to consider making the President's \nrescission powers real. Senator McCain and I and about 40, almost 45, \nDemocrats and Republicans have proposed that we make the President's \nrescission powers real. The President could sign an appropriations bill \nunder current law, send us proposals to rescind or reduce spending \nwithin that appropriations bill that he has just signed into law, and \nwe don't even have to vote on the rescission. We don't even have to \ntake it up or look at it. For the most part, we don't. What John McCain \nand I and almost half the Senate, Democratic and Republican, have said \nis, when a President signs an appropriations bill into law and sends it \nto us, he can send us a rescission message as well that we have to vote \non, we actually have to vote on it. And it doesn't affect taxes. It is \nnot a deal that affects entitlement programs but on appropriations, and \nwe would try this for 4 years.\n  With a simple majority, we literally vote on the President's \nproposal. If it doesn't get a simple majority in the Senate--51 votes--\nor a simple majority in the House--218 votes--then it goes away. But at \nleast we have to take responsibility to be held accountable to vote on \nit. The President would perhaps have some extra responsibility and the \nopportunity to make meaningful reductions.\n  Mr. President, how am I doing on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. I want to close and say to my friend, Senator Conrad, I \nknow the Senator, as much as I, favors Bowles-Simpson, and I want to \nthank the Senator for the work he is doing in bringing attention to it \nagain and saying this is still the best plan in the room. I think it is \nstill the best plan out there.\n  So the idea is when we get to the day or the week after the election, \nwe will be ready to move and to take it up and,\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\nhopefully, to embrace and endorse large parts of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and I thank him for \nhis leadership on these issues. Nobody has been more serious about \ngetting deficits and debt under control than the Senator from Delaware, \nMr. Carper.\n  Mr. President, how much time would Senator Grassley like to use?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Ten minutes or a little less.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perhaps we can ask for a unanimous consent request to \nlock in these next Senators so people know who is waiting.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am not prepared to speak for our side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We can do it. We have been doing this and I think it \nworks out well.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that Senator Grassley be recognized for 10 \nminutes, followed by Senator Cardin for 8, followed by Senator Crapo \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, adopting a budget for the country is one \nof the most basic responsibilities and fundamental functions of the \nCongress.\n  The Budget Act of 1974 requires Congress to adopt a budget by April \n15 each year. It is a requirement that this Senate majority has ignored \ntime and again. In fact, the Senate hasn't adopted a budget since April \n29, 2009.\n  More than 3 years have passed since the Senate last adopted a budget. \nDuring that time, more than $4 trillion has been added to our Nation's \ndebt. In President Obama's Presidency, we have added $5 trillion to the \nnational debt.\n  So we are in the midst of the fourth consecutive year of $1 trillion \ndeficits. All the while, the Senate Democratic majority has failed to \npropose a budget blueprint that would lay out their priorities for \ndeficit reduction, economic growth, and a path to balance. It is no \nwonder, then, our Nation is driving toward a fiscal cliff of deficits \nand debt. There is no one in the Democratic leadership willing to take \nhold of the wheel of this vehicle.\n  In February, President Obama released his budget. The President's \n2013 budget would expand the scope of government by spending more \nmoney, increasing taxes on job creators, and continue on the path of \nenormous deficit and record debt.\n  While President Obama claims his budget will create an America built \nto last, the only thing his budget builds, it seems to me, is higher \ndeficits and debt--a bigger and more intrusive government and economic \ndecline for future generations.\n  During the past 60 years spending has averaged about 21 percent of \nGDP. Over the 10-year window of President Obama's budget, spending \nnever gets below 22 percent. In dollar terms, spending goes up from the \npresent $3.8 trillion to $5.8 trillion in the year 2022. So it is very \nclear President Obama is built to spend.\n  President Obama's budget is also harmful to our fragile economy \nbecause it would impose a $1.9 trillion tax increase. Maybe the \nPresident's purpose in imposing this huge tax increase is an effort to \nreduce the Nation's debt. Unfortunately, that is not what he has \nplanned in his budget. He wants to spend every dollar.\n  His budget runs deficits totaling $6.4 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. Debt held by the public increases from 74.2 percent of our \neconomy today to 76.33 percent in 2022. Of course, we need to remember \nthat the historical average since World War II has been about 43 \npercent of the economy.\n  If people believe President Obama is putting us on a path to fiscal \nsustainability, I would suggest that they look at the annual deficits \nover the next 10 years. They never drop below $575 billion, and they \nactually go up at the end of his budget, rising to $704 billion in \n2022. President Obama's budget puts America on the course of deficits \nand debt as far as the eye can see into the future.\n  The President also took a pass on proposing any real changes to our \nentitlement programs, which are a real driver of future deficits and \ndebt. Again, he is absent from the discussion. He has no solution. He \nhas chosen not to lead. But where is the leadership from the Senate \nmajority? Where is their budget? Why have they not proposed a budget in \nmore than 3 years?\n  The budget chairman has said repeatedly that we already have a budget \nin place for this year and even for next year. The chairman and \nmajority leader believe the Budget Control Act was a budget resolution. \nThe Budget Control Act is not a budget. President Obama clearly agreed \nwhen he proposed his budget. House Republicans and Democrats alike \nagreed when they voted on seven budget resolutions offered by both \nRepublicans and Democrats. The Democratic leadership in the Senate \nstands alone in their belief that the Budget Control Act was a budget \nresolution. Is it because they have no ideas on how to balance the \nbudget, contain out-of-control spending, grow the economy, or create \njobs?\n\n  If the Democratic majority can't muster the will to present their own \nbudget, why don't they offer President Obama's budget?\n  I am sure we will hear the argument that the resolution our side is \noffering is not a fair depiction of President Obama's budget. That is \nthe rhetoric we will likely hear so that they can vote against it. The \nfact is they are going to vote against it for one reason, just like a \nyear ago; that is, because it is President Obama's budget. They don't \nwant to be on record voting for any budget. That will be the most \nremarkable outcome of today's exercise.\n  We are going to vote on five different budget proposals. Three are \nbeing offered by Senate Republicans, one is Budget Chairman Ryan's \nbudget, and the final resolution is President Obama's budget. Not only \nhave Senate Democrats failed to even propose a budget, they will likely \nvote in lockstep against each of the five budget proposals.\n  We are likely to see Senate Democrats come to the floor one by one \nand cast roughly 265 votes against the consideration of any budget. Is \nthat leadership? Is that conviction? They are in the majority. When it \ncomes to proposing and supporting a budget, they are the party of no \nand the party of obstruction. Democrats are the party filibustering \nconsideration of budget blueprints. My friend, the budget chairman, was \nquoted recently as saying:\n\n       This is the wrong time to vote in committee. This is the \n     wrong time to vote on the floor. I don't think we will be \n     prepared to vote before the election.\n\n  How many more trillions do we need to add to the national debt before \nit is time to vote on a budget resolution? If now is not the time to \nlead, propose bold solutions and take action, when is?\n  The American people are going to pay a heavy price for the \nunwillingness and inability of the Senate majority to lead and to offer \nsolutions. Once again, the Senate majority and its leadership and \nPresident Obama are content to be absent from the discussion. Three \nyears without this sort of debate is proof of that. There are no \nsolutions; there is no leadership. There is only failure and punting \nuntil after the next election.\n  We have a moral obligation to offer serious solutions for today--most \nimportantly for future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the budget document is a very important \ndocument.\n  It speaks to the priorities of our Nation, and it gives instructions \nto our committees to report out legislation consistent with that of the \nbudget resolution. It gives instructions to the Appropriations \nCommittee to pass appropriations bills and to other committees as it \nmay affect revenues or mandatory spending.\n  We have that budget document for the fiscal year that begins October \n1 of this year. That was included in the Budget Control Act which \npassed this body by 74 votes. It has the force and effect of law.\n  So our appropriations committees know the numbers for the \nappropriations bills for the year that begins October 1, and the other \ncommittees know what the requirements will be. The question is whether \nwe should have a longer term commitment on dealing with our budget \nproblems.\n  We do need a bipartisan, credible program that involves not only the \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Senate,\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nbut also the Democrats and Republicans in the House, and the President \nof the United States. We need to avoid sequestration, and we need the \npredictability for our economy and for those who act upon our actions \nto know what the rules will be. We need to have a responsible plan to \ndeal with the long-term deficit that is balanced and fair, that \ninvolves more revenue and spending cuts, that allows our recovery to \ncontinue, and is bipartisan.\n  I compliment Senator Conrad for his leadership in giving us an \nopportunity to move in that direction. I think Senator Conrad showed \ntremendous leadership on behalf of the Democratic members of the Budget \nCommittee to forgo bringing forward a partisan budget and instead said: \nLet's take a look at a long-term budget that can get bipartisan \nsupport, that has been tested, that has been out there, and that is \ncalled Bowles-Simpson.\n  We are talking about the broad outline. A budget document gives broad \ninstructions to the committee. It is the so-called macro numbers. I \nthink the chairman has provided us the leadership on that issue. But do \nnot get confused, we have a budget for the fiscal year that begins \nOctober 1. We have it earlier than we have ever had it, and it has the \nforce and effect of law.\n  Each of the four Republican plans that we will be voting on moves us \nin the wrong direction to accomplishing those goals. They use almost \nall of the spending cuts that are included in these budgets for \nadditional tax cuts. It benefits primarily those who do not need an \nadditional tax cut. The House Republican budget would provide $1 \ntrillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, giving millionaires \nan average tax cut of $150,000. At the same time, that budget would ask \nour college students to pay more by allowing interest rates on their \nloans to increase, and they would ask our seniors to pay more by paying \nmore for their Medicare benefits.\n  They have it backward. Those who have sacrificed the most during \nthese economic times under Republican budgets would be asked to pay \nmore. Those who have benefited the most during that period of time \nwould get additional tax cuts. That is not what we should be doing. It \nwould hurt our economic recovery.\n  It is irresponsible to make the types of cuts that are in the \nRepublican budget that deal with American innovation. Take a look what \nit would do for basic research in this country, which I hope we all \nagree is necessary for America to continue to lead the world in \ninnovation. In my own State of Maryland I look at the jobs we created \nin the biotech field, through cybersecurity. Basic research is \ncritically important to advance those job opportunities and economic \nopportunities for America. It would reduce our commitments to building \nour infrastructure--our transit systems, our roads, our energy grids. \nIf we are going to be competitive, we need to rebuild America to meet \nthe global challenges.\n  It would reduce our commitments in education. An educated workforce \nis America's future. Investing in our children is what we should be \ndoing. The quality of K 12 would suffer, even pre-K--what they do with \nHead Start--and I already mentioned the cost of student loans in \npostsecondary education would go up. For our seniors, they would be \nthrown into a voucher program in Medicare at the mercy of private \ninsurance companies and asked to pay more when they are already \noverburdened by the costs of their health care.\n  Under the Toomey budget, they would block-grant Medicaid, throwing \nthat burden onto our States. Our children and families would suffer.\n  Under the Paul budget, Social Security benefits would be reduced on \naverage by 39 percent. Social Security is a vital lifeline for the \npeople of this country. Turning it into a program that becomes a \npolitical football is not what we need for this country. For our \nstudents, the cost of a college education would be increased.\n  We need to put forward a credible plan to reduce the deficit. We need \nto do this--and we have done it before. When Bill Clinton was President \nof the United States and I was serving in the House of Representatives, \nwe passed a plan that balanced our Federal budget and actually created \na surplus. How did we do it? We did it through a balanced approach. We \ndid it through cutting spending and raising the revenues so we paid our \nbills. What were the results? Our economy took off, creating millions \nof jobs. That is what we need to do again.\n  How do we get this done? Let's get working together. Let's have \nDemocrats and Republicans work together in order to come up with a \nbalanced approach that has spending cuts and those who can afford to \npay more should be paying more because it is not fair to future \ngenerations for us to spend money today and ask our children and \ngrandchildren to pay for it tomorrow.\n  Let us protect the programs that are important for economic growth, \nfor the dignity of our seniors, and for the welfare of our children. It \nstarts with rejecting the extreme partisan budgets that our Republican \ncolleagues are offering on the floor. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthose budget resolutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts by our Republican \nleader, Mitch McConnell, and by the ranking member of our Senate Budget \nCommittee, Jeff Sessions, to give the Senate a chance today to do its \njob. It has been more than 3 years since the Senate has passed a \nbudget, almost 1,100 days, $4 trillion in increased debt since we last \nhad a budget. Yet it seems as if the current majority are the only ones \nwho do not think passing a budget is part of our job.\n  I have to stop here for a moment and commend the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, Senator Conrad. I know he has fought mightily \nto get a budget to this floor. But the politics he faces have not \nallowed him to do so. As of today, for 1,100 days we have not been able \nto see a budget proposal reach the Senate floor from our committee.\n  I have worked with Senator Conrad long and hard and will continue to \ndo so, trying to get a broad, bipartisan solution brought forward. But \ntoday we need to take action on the Senate floor. Everyone else has a \nbudget. The President has offered a budget. The House Republicans have \noffered a budget. The House Democrats have offered a budget. The Senate \nRepublicans have introduced several budgets, which we will vote on here \ntoday.\n  Every American family and every American business has to develop a \nbudget. Previous Congresses, including those that enacted the \nCongressional Budget Act last year, clearly saw the importance of \nCongress enacting a budget every year. In fact, it was that \ncongressional budget act that we were able to get in place last year \nthat put into effect the mechanism we are employing today which says if \nthe majority party leadership fails to bring a budget forward by the \nstatutory deadline, then any Senator has the right to call for \nconsideration of any budget on the Senate Calendar.\n  Let's look at the budgets we will be voting on today. First we have \nthe President's budget. At a time when our national debt is more than \n$15.6 trillion, well more than 100 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct, the President's budget seemingly makes no acknowledgment of \nthe dramatic and predictable fiscal crisis we face. Instead of \nembracing the comprehensive work of his own fiscal commission, the \nBowles-Simpson commission on which I served, or any of the other key \nbipartisan proposals that are available such as the Ryan-Wyden proposal \nor the Domenici-Rivlin plan or even coming up with a true reform plan \nof his own, the President's budget regrettably remains within the old \ndiscredited framework of trying to tax and spend our way into \nprosperity.\n  The President's budget would raise taxes by $2 trillion. This is in \naddition to the $1.2 trillion of tax increases in the health care law \nwhich are just beginning to take effect and will continue to roll out \nover the next few years. Perhaps even more remarkable, the President's \nbudget actually increases spending by $1.2 trillion more than current \nlaw. So another $1.2 trillion in new spending, another $2 to $3 \ntrillion in new taxes, no structural entitlement reform, and no \ndiscretionary spending reform.\n\n  Even though it is widely acknowledged that the current paths of our \nentitlement programs are unsustainable\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\nand even though they are on track to soon become insolvent, the \nPresident's budget has no comprehensive reforms to our entitlement \nprograms--none. The modest amount of health care savings he does \npropose would not even be enough to offset the extension of the doc fix \nor the other increases in the health care spending he proposes.\n  This is a dangerous approach, and it should be noted that this budget \nfailed by a vote of 0 to 414 in the House. Yet we have no other pending \nproposal from the other side to consider.\n  Today the Senate will also have an opportunity to reject the \nPresident's approach to the Federal budget, and I expect it will do so, \njust as it did last time. Because the Democratic majority here in the \nSenate has failed to produce their own budget, we will also have the \nopportunity to vote on some important budget proposals offered by the \nHouse Budget Committee chairman and by our own colleagues here in the \nSenate, Senators Toomey, Paul, and Lee. Each of these proposals would \ninclude true comprehensive reforms to our entitlement programs to \nprevent the impending insolvency and to protect the programs for \ncurrent and future generations, and would put us on a sustained pathway \nto balancing our Federal budget.\n  These budgets also call for comprehensive tax reform which takes us \nout of the old paradigm of Congress debating whether to raise or cut \ntaxes and, instead, these proposals would each in their own way \ndramatically streamline the Tax Code, reduce the tax rates, and unleash \nsignificant economic growth in our economy. A byproduct of this robust \neconomic growth would be an increase in revenues to help us deal with \nour pending debt crisis.\n  I again commend the chairman, Senator Conrad, for his effort to bring \nforward a comprehensive plan, a solution--one that originated with \nBowles-Simpson on which he and I sat and one which has then been worked \non by the so-called Gang of Six for a significant amount of time now to \nimprove and bring forward, and one which the chairman is prepared to \nmove when the opportunity is available. I have encouraged him to do it \nnow. I believe we ought to have it on the floor today for this debate. \nBut whenever the time becomes available, it is a proposal such as this \nthat we need to be dealing with. We need to develop the bipartisan \nsupport that is necessary to pass it.\n  What is it? First of all, as we worked on the Bowles-Simpson \ncommission, we made some basic decisions. We concluded that spending \nwas the major problem--that is where the major part of the solution \nshould be--but that revenue was also critical to the solution and that \ngrowing our economy was an important part of anything Congress should \ndo. We first discussed putting together a strong approach to \nentitlement reform, structural entitlement reform. We put strong \nspending caps in place and we made clear that our spending patterns in \nthe Federal budget would be brought under control. In addition, \nrecognizing the importance and need for strong growth, we concluded \nthat our Tax Code must be reformed and not on the traditional \nbattleground of whether to raise taxes on one group or lowering taxes \non another but in a complete paradigm shift to focus on the reforming \nof both our corporate and individual tax codes.\n  If you went about trying to create a Tax Code that was more unfair, \nmore complex, more expensive to comply with, and more anticompetitive \nto our own American business interests, you would be hard pressed to do \nit different or worse than we have done with our own Tax Code. We \nconcluded that we ought to reform that code to develop a strong, \ndynamic tax code for America to go forward with. That is why we \nproposed broadening the base, reducing the rates, and reforming the way \nwe tax in America by simplifying our Tax Code and making America a \nstrong, powerful, and robust economy as it historically has been.\n  Then we put together what is critical for any plan to succeed, and \nthat is an enforcement mechanism. Congress has a perfect record of \nviolating its own budgets. Congress has a record of ignoring the \nbudgets, simply getting 60 votes to waive the Budget Act whenever \nCongress wants to spend in excess of a budget. Literally in every \nbudget for the last two decades or more, Congress has done so; \nRepublican or Democratic, the Congresses have done so. What we put \ntogether in our negotiations was an enforcement plan that would keep \nCongress within the walls of the budget we adopt. It would have a \nseries of points of order to protect against the declaration of \nemergencies unjustifiably and would then force even emergency spending, \nthat usually is conducted outside the budget, to be done in the face of \na sequestration backed up by 67-vote points of order on the floor of \nthe Senate. This kind of strong enforcement is also critical to what we \nmust do to protect our Nation.\n  We need a comprehensive plan, we need to have entitlement reform, we \nhave to have discretionary spending reform, and we need to have budget \nenforcement that is solid. We need to strengthen our revenue stream and \nenforce our Tax Code by lowering taxes. That gives American businesses \nthe opportunity to compete aggressively across the globe.\n  If we do so, we will see a strong revenue component to our reform \nmeasures, and we will see strong growth coming out of the fact that we \nput together effective spending controls. But we have to get there. We \nhave to do it.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to work with Senator Conrad as we try to \nput this kind of broad, comprehensive reform package together and build \nbipartisan support for it. But I am very discouraged still that we \ncannot get a budget proposal onto the floor of the Senate that we can \nwork on.\n  I also appreciate the leadership of Senator McConnell and Senator \nSessions, who have given the Senate the opportunity today to debate \nthis issue and have votes, at least, on meaningful proposals that move \nus down the path I have discussed, and put us onto a pathway for \neconomic prosperity and growth for all.\n  America is at a terrible crisis point. Our national debt is now \nexceeding over 100 percent of our GDP and threatens our economy. We \nmust take action. We cannot let another year go by without adopting a \nbudget on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would say to Senator Boxer the situation we find \nourselves in is we only have 34 minutes left on our side. I will yield \n7 minutes to Senator Boxer.\n  Senator Murray is here now.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will wait.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have a situation in which our time is rapidly \nfleeting. They have much more time left on their side than we do on \nours.\n  Could the Senator do her presentation in 7 minutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will attempt to do my best.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurray be allowed to speak for 7 minutes followed by Senator Boxer for \n7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Conrad for his \nleadership on this issue. At the end of last week, the Republicans in \nthe House of Representatives passed legislation that continues their \nmad dash away from the bipartisan Budget Control Act and reflects the \nupside-down priorities that are guiding their party and stands \nabsolutely no chance of passage in the Senate.\n  I think it would be very helpful at this point to remind my \ncolleagues of the recent history that has brought us to this point.\n  In August of last year Democrats and Republicans came together, and \nwe agreed to the Budget Control Act to cut spending and put in place a \nprocess for additional deficit reduction. The purpose of that \nbipartisan agreement was to move toward serious deficit reduction and \nto give some consistency to the Federal budget so the American people \nwould not be threatened with a government shutdown every few months. \nThat bipartisan deal sets the levels for next year's discretionary \nspending, which allows Congress to do its jobs and work to allocate \nFederal resources toward investments in jobs, infrastructure, \ninnovation, maintaining our commitment to our servicemembers and their \nfamilies, and protecting and supporting the middle-class families and \nso much more.\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\n  That was the agreement we came to. Speaker Boehner shook on it, \nMinority Leader McConnell shook on it, Majority Leader Reid signed it, \njoined many of my colleagues in voting for it, and then President Obama \nsigned it into law. It became the law of the land. I would add it is \nbinding and replaces and carries more weight than a budget resolution. \nIt makes the budget resolutions we are debating today nothing more than \npolitical theater.\n  Senate Democrats fully intend to honor our word and stick to the \nbipartisan budget levels for next year, and Senate Republicans in our \nAppropriations Committee, including the minority leader, recently voted \nto stick to those levels as well. I was disappointed that less than 9 \nmonths after we shook hands on that deal House Republicans turned right \naround and broke it. They put appeasing their extreme base ahead of the \nword they gave to us and the American people. They demonstrated clearly \nthat a deal with them isn't worth the paper it is printed on.\n  Despite House Republicans reneging on the deal, the Budget Control \nAct is the law. It is signed, and we have so many challenges ahead of \nus as a nation we cannot afford to relitigate bipartisan deals every \ntime members of the extreme end of the Republican Party make some noise \nin a meeting. House Republicans are not only trying to relitigate that \nBudget Control Act, they want to pretend it never happened.\n  As part of that deal, in addition to the $1 trillion in discretionary \nspending cuts, a joint select committee on deficit reduction was formed \nto reduce the deficit by at least an additional $1.2 trillion. In fact, \nif they couldn't come to an agreement, the bipartisan Budget Control \nAct put in place automatic spending cuts, or sequestration, which \nspread evenly across defense and nondefense spending.\n  We all knew at the time the sequestration was not the ideal way to \nreduce spending, but we wanted to have that in place so that painful \ncuts were prominent and would help both sides to come to a bipartisan \ncompromise.\n  I was called on by the majority leader to cochair that committee with \nRepublican Representative Jeb Hensarling, and I am proud of that \ncommittee's hard work. I was extremely disappointed in the end that \ncommittee was not able to come up with a bipartisan deal.\n  I want to be clear--because this is very relevant today--we weren't \nable to get a deal because Republicans refused to even consider tax \nincreases on the wealthiest Americans. The talks fell apart around that \nissue and that issue alone.\n  I came to the table with many of my colleagues with proposals for \nserious compromises on spending and a willingness to move forward with \nsmart changes to strengthen entitlements. We knew many of these \ncompromises would be painful, but we were willing to put them forward \nto get to a bipartisan deal and a balanced deal. But as much as we \noffered, we couldn't get our Republican colleagues to give an inch when \nit came to taxes on the wealthiest Americans and the biggest \ncorporations even though the rich are paying the lowest tax rates today \nin generations. They were fundamentally opposed to any plan that would \ncall on the wealthy to pay a penny more in taxes.\n  In poll after poll Americans overwhelmingly say they want to see a \nbalanced approach to tackling the deficit and debt that puts everything \non the table, including revenue. Every single bipartisan group that has \ncome together to tackle this--from Simpson-Bowles, Domenici-Rivlin, \nGang of 6--has included a balanced approach that reduces spending and \nraises revenues. That is the only real and fair way to tackle this \nchallenge, and it simply doesn't make any sense to solve this problem \nwith cuts alone.\n  So as we watch House Republicans rolling back the automatic cut they \ndon't like and acting as though the bipartisan Budget Control Act never \nhappened, I say to them today what I said to the Republicans in the \njoint select committee: We will not allow the debt and deficit to be \nreduced on the backs of our middle-class and most vulnerable Americans \nwithout calling on the wealthiest to contribute as well. It is not \nfair, it is not what the American people want, and it is not going to \nhappen. We are facing these automatic cuts because Republicans continue \nto protect the rich above all else. Unless that changes before the end \nof the year, our country is going to have to face the consequences of \nintransigence.\n\n  Republicans in the House of Representatives are not only acting as \nthough the BCA never happened, they are highlighting the moral and \nintellectual bankruptcy of a party that allows itself only to think in \nterms of cutting, shrinking, eliminating, and never in terms of \ninvesting and growing and fairness. The legislation they passed would \nroll back sequestration for next year by simply taking funding from \nprograms middle-class families and the most vulnerable Americans count \non and shifting it to defense. They want all of the deficit reduction \nfrom the Budget Control Act without any bipartisan compromise or shared \nsacrifice.\n  Since they refuse to consider raising taxes on the wealthy, the only \nway they can increase spending on defense is by absolutely devastating \ncritical government investments in our families and in our future.\n  According to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, the House legislation would not only roll back \nsequestration on the defense side, it would increase overall defense \nspending by over $8 billion.\n  And while they may say they are rolling back the automatic cuts on \nnon-defense spending too, this report shows House Republicans are \nslashing these programs almost three-quarters of the way to what would \nbe cut under sequestration.\n  Since they need to find a way to pay to undo the automatic cuts they \ndon't like, their bill cuts even deeper into programs millions of \nfamilies across America count on.\n  According to that same CBPP report, the Republican legislation would \ncut food assistance to the most vulnerable families, Medicaid, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and block grants for States to run \nprograms to help families and workers get back on their feet.\n  So House Republicans are actually increasing defense spending, \nprotecting the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations, and \nthrowing the entire burden on the backs of middle class families and \nthe most vulnerable Americans.\n  That's not just bad policy, it is simply wrong.\n  If Democrats were willing to accept a wildly imbalanced deficit \nreduction plan to avoid the automatic cuts, we would have done that in \nthe Joint Select Committee. But we didn't then, and we won't now.\n\n  Any bipartisan deficit reduction plan, whether the goal is to reduce \nthe deficit in a better way than the sequesters or to put our country \non sound fiscal footing over the long term, has to be balanced. It has \nto be fair. And it has to work for middle class families across \nAmerica. That means responsibly cutting spending. It means making sure \nentitlement programs that seniors and the most vulnerable families \ndepend on are strengthened and secured for the next generation. It \nmeans examining where we can save money on the defense side. And it \nmeans raising revenue from the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations who are paying close to the lowest levels in generations.\n  Because budgets aren't just numbers on a page. They aren't just about \ncharts and formulas and trajectories. Those are important but budgets \nare also about real people, with real lives. They are about investments \nin our families, our communities, and our economy. They are about the \nkind of country we want to be now and in the our future. And above all, \nbudgets are about the choices and priorities of a nation.\n  Democrats are willing to make compromises. We are willing to have \nthose tough conversations and come to the difficult agreements we know \nare necessary. We are willing to put everything on the table.\n  And I truly hope Republicans decide they are ready to do the same and \nend their commitment to protecting the rich from paying a penny more in \ntaxes. Because while so many families continue to struggle, I think \nit's more than fair to ask the richest Americans to pay their fair \nshare.\n  While we scour programs that so many middle class families rely on \nfor\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nfat to trim, I think it makes sense to scour the tax code in just the \nsame way and eliminate the egregious loopholes that the wealthiest \nAmericans and biggest corporations take advantage of.\n  And while oil and gas companies are making record profits, I think it \njust makes sense to end the handouts they get every year from U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n  So Democrats stand ready to work with Republicans on this. But what \nHouse Republicans did last week has moved us in the wrong direction, \nand makes it even harder to get to the bipartisan deficit reduction \ndeal they say they want.\n  So I urge them to end this partisanship.\n  Stop allowing a small and extreme minority of members to dictate \npolicy for an entire chamber of Congress. Stop protecting the \nwealthiest Americans from sharing in the sacrifices so many Americans \nare making every day, and to truly work with us to get this done for \nthe American people.\n  As soon as that happens, Democrats stand ready to get to a balanced \nand bipartisan deal.\n  The choices we make as a body in the coming months will affect every \nsingle American. As we have said from the start, we will put everything \non the table, but that word is ``everything.'' We cannot come to a \nsolution in America unless everybody contributes and there is shared \nsacrifice. That is the principle we have been fighting for, it is the \none we will continue to fight for, and that is what the American people \nwant. I am proud to stand with my party to continue to fight for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to say that it is stunning to see \nthe Republican Party running away from a bill they supported and a deal \nthey cut. The deficit reduction deal was led by Senator Conrad. The \nBudget Control Act is the law of the land. Instead they are offering up \na series of budgets that I believe will destroy this country.\n  Why do I say that? Because they destroy the middle class and they \ngive to the millionaires and the billionaires. That is a recipe for a \nthird world nation, the haves and the have-nots. I hope the American \npeople wake up and pay attention because a budget is a statement of who \nwe are as a people.\n  I was proud to serve on the Budget Committee. I wish I was still on \nthere, but I had other options for my State. I decided to leave the \nBudget Committee and go on the Commerce Committee. That is one tough \ncommittee, and we are going to miss Senator Conrad. His leadership is \nexemplary, and he has explained why the replacement budgets the \nRepublicans have offered are unworkable. Some of them don't even make \nany sense.\n  This is serious business because one of them did pass the House. Not \nonly did it pass the House, but then they passed another law, and we \ncall it reconciliation, which is dangerous in what they did. They stood \nwith all of their heart, with all of their soul, with all of their \npower and their fervor to fight for the 1 percent. They are fighting \nfor the millionaires, the multimillionaires, the billionaires, and the \ntrillionaires; that is who they are fighting for. They are giving them \nback an average of $150,000 a year. Over the 10-year period that \naverage millionaire can write a big kiss to the Republicans if this \never becomes law because they would get back $1.5 million over the 10-\nyear period.\n  How do they pay for this largess? How do they pay for this warm, \nfuzzy hug to the people who have everything? They cut the heart out of \nthe middle class. I will give some examples. They would allow student \nloan rates to double so students would have to pay not a 3-percentage \npoint interest rate on their student loans but over 6 percent.\n  They will cut the heart and soul out of America's infrastructure. Did \nyou ever look at the construction industry lately? Well, there are 1.4 \nmillion unemployed construction workers. We need to make sure they are \nbuilding the roads, highways, and the 70,000 bridges that are \ndeficient. Half of our roads don't meet the standards. We need to \nrebuild America, as the President said--not Afghanistan, not Pakistan. \nThank you very much. Iraq? The blood of our people is on the ground \nover there. It is time to spend that money here as our President has \nsaid.\n  They continue all that war spending, they add to that war spending, \nand they expect everybody else to stand back and quietly accept a \ndoubling of their student loan rate and a cut in the transportation \nprogram.\n  They end Medicare, period. They are going to turn it into a voucher \nsystem, and our elderly are going to have to negotiate to try and find \na way to pay for health insurance, and it will cost them thousands of \ndollars more.\n  One of these budgets actually cuts Social Security by 39 percent. \nImagine a Social Security recipient living on $18,000 getting a cut of \nalmost 40 percent.\n  So this is what they are doing, I say to my colleagues. They \neliminate the Department of Education. They eliminate the ability for \nmany people to pay for their energy assistance in the winters. They \nwalk away from alternative energy, which is going to free us from \nforeign oil and make us safer. That is what they do, and they do it all \nin the name of tax breaks for the people in America who--I am very \nproud of them. They made it. In my State, a lot of those folks who have \nmade it have written to me and said: Senator, we want everybody to have \nthe chance we had.\n  The only passion of Republicans is for those who have. They practice \nRobin Hood in reverse. In one of the budgets, they even--I think it is \nthe Ryan budget--tax the poorest people. They tax the poorest people. \nThey raise taxes on the poorest people, and they cut taxes on the \nrichest people. Robin Hood in reverse. Isn't that sweet? Isn't that \nkind? Not. So they bring America to its knees. They walk away from the \nBudget Control Act. Do we know why they don't like it? Because it \nforces spending cuts across the board. I don't like that, but we are \nserious about deficit reduction.\n  In my closing remarks I will say this: In the last 40 years, one \nparty balanced the budget. In the last 40 years, one party created a \nsurplus. That happens to be the Democratic Party and a Democratic \nPresident named Bill Clinton. How did we do it? We met each other \nhalfway. We said that when we are faced with a crisis, we have to put \neverything on the table and everybody makes a little bit of a \nsacrifice. It is no big deal. We ask the people who have the most to do \na little more, and we find ways to cut spending. That is what we did in \nthe Clinton years. Do we know what happened? We created I think 23 \nmillion new jobs. We created 23 million new jobs. We balanced the \nbudget, we created a surplus, and now we have to listen to the \ndemagogues over there lecture us about how to balance the budget. \nWrong. We know how to do it. They don't know how to do it. All they \nknow how to do is stand up and attack our President when our President \ninherited this terrible deficit from George W. Bush, who took a \nsurplus--Bush did--and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can \nsee. And we were losing--I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We were losing how many jobs a month? We were losing \n800,000 jobs a month when our President took over. The country was \nfalling apart.\n  He saved the auto industry--it is back on top--when others said: Let \nthem go bankrupt. He started the job creation. It is not good enough, \nbut I will tell my colleagues one thing: If we are going to make it \nbetter, we better start working together.\n  Let's live by the Budget Control Act that is the law of the land, and \nlet's use that time to find a long-term solution, as we did in the \nClinton years.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to make a reference to the Budget \nControl Act. One of my colleagues said we are running away from the \nBudget Control Act. I would suggest that is not accurate. In truth, the \nBudget Control Act was a cap on spending, and the Republicans have \nproposed that we spend less than that, as any economist would tell us \nwe need to do because it wasn't sufficient.\n  The difficulty arises, however, when we consider what President Obama \nproposed with regard to the Budget Control Act. It is amazing. In \nAugust President Obama signed the Budget\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\nControl Act as an agreement to raise the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion \nin exchange for reducing spending by $2.1 trillion. He signed that, it \nwent into effect, and it is the current law today. But when he proposed \nhis budget in January of this year that we will vote on later today--\nand I expect it will not get a single vote, and it should not--\nPresident Obama's budget wiped out half of those savings. So $1 \ntrillion of those savings were wiped out, and he replaced it with \nalmost--he added more spending in addition--Mr. President, I am having \na little trouble thinking here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senate will \nsuspend for a moment.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So I think the dramatic event that has gone \nunappreciated is that the President's budget eviscerates the Budget \nControl Act and puts us back on full speed tax and spend.\n  I see my colleague Senator Enzi is here, a senior member of the \nBudget Committee who has been involved in so many important issues. He \nis an accountant, a small businessman, and he understands the real \nworld and the value of a dollar. I yield to Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the committee \nfor all of his work on this issue and the suggestions he has as to the \nimportance of what we are doing today.\n  I rise today to discuss our Nation's budget situation and the budget \nproposals we will vote on later today. While I am pleased that my \ncolleagues have put forth a number of good ideas, this debate is long \noverdue.\n  The Congressional Budget Act sets a statutory deadline of April 1 for \nthe Senate Budget Committee to report a budget resolution and a \ndeadline of April 15 for completion of a congressional budget. Despite \nthese statutory deadlines, it has been more than 3 years since the \nSenate passed a budget, and the majority party once again refuses to \ndebate this important topic through the normal budget process. We did \nnot mark up a budget in the Senate Budget Committee, and we have not \nbeen given the opportunity to offer amendments to any of the budgets \nthat are before us on the Senate floor. That is disappointing.\n  With a national debt approaching $16 trillion, and it is hard for me \nto even say $16 trillion--I saw a kid with a t-shirt that said, \n``Please don't tell him what comes after $1 trillion.'' With $16 \ntrillion in debt, we cannot afford to continue operating without a \nbudget that is a blueprint to put the country on a sustainable path in \nboth the short term as well as the long term, and we better be looking \nat that long term as well.\n  We cannot continue to simply spend money we don't have without a plan \nto get our spending under control. We are so bad on spending that we \nare taking 10 years' worth of revenue to pay for 2 years' worth of \nprojects, and those are projects that will continue after that. I don't \nknow what we do after the 2 years. How far out can we borrow money that \nmay not even come in because it might not even be budgeted? A budget is \nsupposed to do just that--it is supposed to put spending under control. \nBut instead, for the third year in a row, it looks as if the Senate \nmajority will refuse to pass a plan to help fix the fiscal crisis we \nface.\n\n  In the 3 years since the Senate majority passed a budget, our country \nhas spent approximately $10.4 trillion. We have accumulated around $4.5 \ntrillion in gross debt, which translates to an additional $15,000 for \nevery man, woman, and child--$15,000 for every man, woman, and child--\nwhich brings it up to about $49,000 total for every man, woman, and \nchild. Since we last adopted a budget, we have spent more than $626 \nbillion on net interest payments to service the debt alone. These are \nunsustainable levels of spending. Yet the majority continues to ignore \nthe problem and refuses to take these numbers seriously and consider, \nmuch less pass, a budget.\n  The majority argues that we have a budget in place because of the \npassage of the Budget Control Act, which also governed our spending in \nfiscal year 2011. But if that truly governed what we are doing, why did \nthe President even submit a budget to us? If that was the budget, he \nshouldn't have gone to all the effort to put his own budget together. \nBut he felt he needed to put a budget together.\n  In fiscal year 2011, the government brought in slightly more than \n$2.3 trillion in revenue. At the same time we collected $2.3 trillion, \nwe spent $3.6 trillion. In other words, we overspent by $1.3 trillion. \nThat is more than 50 percent of the revenue we were expecting. We are \non pace for another $1 trillion deficit this year. The Budget Control \nAct may include some spending limits, but with record trillion-dollar \ndeficits, the Budget Control Act cannot replace an actual budget that \nputs in place long-term spending cuts and helps get our country back on \nthe path to balance. Again, if that Budget Control Act really took care \nof everything, the President would not have needed to submit a budget. \nHe did.\n  I applaud the President for appointing a deficit commission. We tried \nto pass that as a bill. It came close, but it didn't make it. He saw \nthere was a need, and he appointed a commission. The commission was \ncochaired by Erskine Bowles and Senator Alan Simpson. They painted a \npretty bleak picture for our country. More than a year and a half has \ngone by since they painted that bleak picture, and it has gotten worse, \nnot better. I really expected at the State of the Union that year that \nthe President would have painted the same bleak picture he had been \nhanded by the deficit commission. It was scary. It is now scarier. But \nhe didn't. Instead, he gave us another stimulus budget. I think if he \nhad painted the bleak picture in the State of the Union that was handed \nto him by the deficit commission, if he had painted that same picture \nand not placed a solution out there but painted the picture so America \nwould understand where we are with the debt and the deficit--if he had \ndone that, he could have come out with a budget that was parallel to \nwhat Simpson-Bowles had, and I think we would have had a solution over \na year ago.\n  We have a nearly $16 trillion debt that keeps growing. It is \nunaffordable, and we need to make a change. What will happen if we \ndon't act and if we don't cut spending? We won't be able to afford the \nmilitary we need. People will have drastically reduced Social Security \nchecks. Roads won't be fixed. All of our money will go toward paying \ninterest on the debt.\n  People shouldn't doubt that this is real. There were riots in the \nstreets in Greece when their government was forced to deal with the \nrealities of debt. In the United States, we owe $49,000 for every man, \nwoman, and child. In Greece, they only owe $39,000 and had to make \ndrastic cuts, and they had riots in the streets. Now they have stepped \nback with the recent elections and are trying to turn away from the \nreality of their debt. Does that sound familiar?\n  I have news for my colleagues. Our debt per person, as I mentioned, \nis more than Greece's debt per person. It is more than Italy's debt per \nperson. In fact, the United States owes more than all of the Euro \ncountries and the United Kingdom put together.\n  My Republican colleagues and I have put forth a series of budgets \nthat would help to improve the fiscal situation. I drafted legislation \nthat would reduce spending by 1 percent per year until we reach \nbalance. By reducing spending by 1 percent, we can achieve balance by \nfiscal year 2017. That is a 1-percent reduction per year to 2017, and \nmost of the people I have talked to--and I have talked to a lot of \npeople in Wyoming and some other places around the country--have said 1 \npercent is not bad. One percent is definitely not bad if we compare it \nto the possibility of a 19-percent cut when we step off the cliff.\n  The House of Representatives passed a budget last year that cut \nspending by $5.8 trillion. This year the House passed a second budget \nthat would reduce the deficit by $4.4 trillion, in comparison to the \nPresident's budget over the next decade, which does nothing to improve \nthe short- or long-term economic outlook of the country. In fact, \nPresident Obama's budget would make things worse.\n  Senator Toomey has put together a detailed budget plan that would \nbalance the budget within 8 years. It would enact corporate tax reform, \nand it would adopt important changes to\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\nthe entitlement programs that are the drivers of the Nation's \nunsustainable debt.\n  Senator Paul has put forth a budget that would balance within 5 \nyears. Of course, it eliminates four departments and reduces spending \nby $8 trillion over the next 10 years. It seems radical, but we are \nfacing a cliff, and he is willing to put a budget out there.\n  Senator Lee has also introduced a budget that balances our budget by \nfiscal year 2017 by cutting spending by $7.1 trillion over the next 10 \nyears, and it, too, reforms Medicare and Social Security.\n  Why do we have to reform Medicare? Well, in the health care reform \nbill we took $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare. It was already going \nbroke but, don't worry, we put in a special panel that will tell where \ncuts can come from each and every year, and if we don't suggest \ndifferent cuts, those go into effect without a vote of the U.S. Senate. \nThe only places they can cut are doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, \nhome health care, and other providers. If you do not have a doctor, I \ndo not think you have much medical care.\n\n  There are going to have to be reforms in Medicare. We have already \nforced that. For Social Security, there are not as many people working \nnow as will soon be on Social Security, and that creates problems. I do \nnot agree with everything that is included in these budgets I have \nmentioned, but I want to commend my Republican colleagues for making \ntough choices and putting forth solutions.\n  While they have been doing that, President Obama and the Senate \nmajority have ignored the problem and refused to acknowledge the need \nto cut spending. They have demonized Republicans and suggested it is \nour intention to harm seniors, poor people, and children. One \nadvertisement showed a picture of House Budget Chairman Ryan pushing an \nelderly woman off a cliff. That kind of rhetoric does not help \nanything, that rhetoric is over the top, while their solutions have \nbeen nonexistent.\n  Last year, President Obama's budget was such an empty proposal that \nit failed by a vote of 0 to 97 in the Senate. In the House this year, \nhis latest budget failed by a vote of 0 to 414. I suspect it may face \nthe same fate when it is considered later today--the same one they \nvoted on. Not a single Member of either party was willing to support \nthe President's budget proposal. How is that for leadership?\n  In some of the countries that have a parliamentary form of \ngovernment, they have heard about these votes and are terribly shocked \nbecause in their country it would call for a special election and a new \nPrime Minister.\n  We will be voting on five budgets later today--four from Republican \nMembers and President Obama's budget. Absent from the discussion is a \nbudget produced by the Senate majority that is shirking their \nresponsibility to govern.\n  We are in too serious a situation to continue ignoring the budget \nproblems we face. At a time when the national debt breaks down to more \nthan $49,000 for every person in Wyoming and across this country, we \ncannot afford to continue business as usual. We cannot continue punting \nthe tough decisions simply because the tough decisions might impact our \nreelection campaigns. The decisions that are painful today will be even \nmore painful in the future.\n  We talk about pay-fors here when people want to do a new program or \ncontinue an old program with additional expenses, but we better start \nincluding the debt. Our debt is greater than the value of everything we \nproduce in this country in a year. That is the gross national product. \nThe debt is greater than the gross national product. There are a lot of \nstories about what happens when your debt gets greater than the gross \nnational product, and none of them is good.\n  I have heard from a lot of people in Wyoming about the national debt \nand the lack of a budget for more than 3 years. While they have \ndiffering viewpoints on the best solution, they have one common \nmessage: Do something. Do something, and do it as soon as possible. I \nam concerned that, after votes, we will end up in the same place we \nstarted--without a budget and without a fiscal plan to get our Nation's \ndebt and deficit in check. I do not know about you, but it is keeping \nme up nights.\n  Some of my colleagues have offered plans to make that happen. Those \nwho control the Senate appear content to sit on the sidelines and \ncriticize. While that happens, we continue to add trillions of dollars \nto our national debt. I would encourage my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to think about what that means to future generations and \njoin us in finding a plan to fix our fiscal woes.\n  I know that is what they are thinking about because I have been in \nmeetings off of the Hill where they have talked about this same thing. \nBut we have to solve it; we cannot just talk about it. We cannot give \nit lip service when we are off of the floor and excuse it when we are \non the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, before Senator Enzi leaves the floor, he \nmade reference to the fact that in the European parliamentary system, \nwhen a Prime Minister proposes a budget that fails, that would be cause \nfor collapse of the government and a new election.\n  He also correctly recalled how the deficit commission that was \nappointed by President Obama came back with a number of recommendations \nthat would have gone far farther than the President's budget in dealing \nwith our debt course.\n  But I would ask the Senator about that moment he mentioned, after the \ndebt commission reported, when the President came before the joint \nsession of Congress to give the State of the Union. Was the Senator \nsurprised and disappointed that the President virtually ignored the \ndebt commission and did not take the opportunity to explain to the \nwhole audience of the American people that we are on an unsustainable \ncourse that could lead to financial catastrophe?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I was both surprised and disappointed. I \nthought he had a unique opportunity, and it had been handed to him on a \nplatter that he designed. He appointed these people, and they put a lot \nof hours into it, including the Senator from North Dakota, who is here \non the floor, and came up with a plan. It was not a pleasant plan by \nanybody's imagination. It was an important plan by everybody's--well, \nevidently not everybody or we would have adopted it by now. But it had \nsome critical things in there that should be taken care of, that should \nbe considered in a budget, and should have leadership coming from the \nWhite House. That is where leadership on budgets happens.\n  I remember being in the Wyoming legislature. We have a requirement \nthat you have to balance the budget each and every year, and we do \nthat. If you find out there is going to be a deficit before the \nlegislature meets--and they only meet for 20 days in the budget year--\nif you know about it before that time, then the legislature has to make \nthose cuts. One of the things I noted was when we made the cuts, the \npeople in the administration picked out something that was painful and \nmade that cut so the constituents out there would say: Oh, that really \nhurt. Those stupid legislators picked the wrong things. Well, it was \nnot the legislators who picked the wrong things. It was the people in \ncharge of each of those trying to make sure the legislature felt pain.\n  If that deficit is noted outside of the time of the few days that the \nlegislature meets, then the Governor has to make the cuts. Virtually \neverybody in the administration worked for the Governor. So when he \nmade the cuts, they took the priorities and they chopped off the lowest \npriorities, so it was not noticeable around the State, and it works out \nwell. That is leadership. That is tough leadership because the Governor \ndoes not like to have to be the one who is held up for all the scrutiny \nof what is spent.\n  That is what the President has to do. That is the President's job, to \nget this budget back in balance. There are some examples around the \nworld where, when they put the budget on a path to balancing, the \neconomy comes up.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. ENZI. That gives people a little bit of confidence of what can \nhappen. Right now, there is not a lot of confidence around this \ncountry, so the economy is dropping. But a good budget, that follows a \nplan, that gets us in\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\nfiscal stability, would make a huge difference for this country and \nstimulate business.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I could not agree more. I do believe the debt course we \nare on, which is unsustainable--every expert and the witnesses who come \nbefore the Budget Committee on which Senator Enzi and I serve have told \nus it is unsustainable, and if we get off of it and tighten our belts \nand do things such as Governor Bentley in Alabama is doing, Governor \nChristie has had to do, Governor Brown is now facing in California--\nthey let that State go so far out of control, it is going to be \ndifficult to bring it back--but they have to make tough choices. If we \ndo that, I believe we will get some positive impact on the economy from \nthe confidence that restores.\n  I say to Senator Conrad, I see Senator Lieberman is here. I would be \nwilling to yield if you are ready to use some time now.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could I say to my colleague, we have 17 minutes left on \nthis side. We have four Senators left to speak. The Senator has, I \nthink, probably 54, 53 minutes left--something like that.\n  So I say to Senator Lieberman, if you could take about 4 minutes, if \nthat would work for you.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I was hoping for 4 \\1/4\\ minutes. OK. I will do my \nbest.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Sold.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will yield 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom our side.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He will have a flat 8 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is very generous of my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nand the Senator from Alabama.\n  I have been listening to some of the statements that are being made. \nThey are quite sincere. They are quite interesting. But I am afraid, in \nthe end, they are not going to signify very much except good \nintentions.\n  We have ourselves in a position here where we all know the country \nhas a terrible problem. We are spending a lot more than we are bringing \nin. The simplest way to explain it is, the last time I looked--I think \nI am still close on this--revenues of the Federal Government are about \n15 or 16 percent of gross domestic product and the spending of the \nFederal Government is about 25 percent of gross domestic product. There \nyou have a yawning, enormous deficit, which adds up now to a long-term \ndebt of over $15 trillion.\n  We cannot go on like this and be a great country. We cannot go on \nlike this and have any hope of economic recovery. I happen to agree--I \nshould say in gratitude for the extra time Senator Sessions has given \nme--I happen to agree with the last thing he said. I think--and I am \nnot alone; I think some people on both sides feel this--the best thing \nwe can do for our economy and economic growth is to adopt a bipartisan \nlong-term program that will reduce and hopefully eliminate our debt. \nWhy? Because it will restore confidence in the American economy.\n  We all know that jobs do not come from government. They should not \ncome from government or in government. Jobs that people want, need, \ncome from the private sector. The last time I looked, the private \nsector--American business--was sitting on somewhere between $2 trillion \nand $3 trillion of liquid assets that they are not spending. Why aren't \nthey spending it? They have very little confidence in the future--not \njust confidence about how the economy is going to be, but what we are \ngoing to do, what the government is going to do.\n  I think if we adopted a long-term bipartisan debt reduction program \nthat gave them some sense of security about what taxes and spending \npolicies were going to do for some years ahead, they would start to \ninvest that $2 trillion to $3 trillion again, and that would create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs that people desperately need, who are \ntrying so hard to get back to work.\n  Look, basically we know what we have to do to make this happen. To \nstate it bluntly, it has to be a combination of tax reform and \nentitlement reform. We have to raise revenues so they get back up to \n18, 19, 20 percent and we have to bring spending down--most of the \nspending increases are coming from entitlements--to about 18 or 19 \npercent of GDP so we can be in balance. It is not very mysterious how \nwe are going to do this. But the political will is not there now to \nmake those tough decisions.\n  Today is a classic moment. We have these budget resolutions that are \nbefore us as a matter of privilege. They are privileged matters. I have \nwanted to vote to proceed to some of them just to get on the subject \nmatter, hoping that maybe the door would be opened for direction to \nvarious committees to come back with long-term solutions, as I have \ntalked about.\n  We all know the Bowles-Simpson model is the one we are going to \neventually get to. The question is, how close do we get to the fiscal \ncliff--or has our country gone over the cliff, falling down--and, \nfinally, we rush in here and in a panic rescue it with something like \nSimpson-Bowles?\n  The closest Senate proposal that would do what we need to do is the \none my friend from North Dakota has tabled in the Budget Committee. I \nwish we could vote on it. I do not know how many votes we would get, \nbut I wish we could at least start the process.\n  I know everybody says we are going to come back after the election \nand there is going to be a burst of courage, I guess because the \nelection is over, and we are going to do the Simpson-Bowles tax reform \nand entitlement reform. What I am sort of hearing in the wind around \nhere is, do not count on it. I hope so. Senator Conrad and I, it is \ngoing to be our last couple of months on this particular stage. There \nis nothing I know he would like more to be part of, and I can tell you \nnothing I would like more to be part of, than doing a bipartisan, long-\nterm debt reduction program.\n  But I am fearful that it is asking an awful lot of the system in a \nshort period of time, and the tendency will be to protect us from \nfalling off the cliff by extending everything that is going to expire \nat the end of the year: stopping the sequestering, stopping the end of \nthe Bush tax cuts. I hope I am wrong. I know there are some bipartisan \ngroups that I have been part of that are working to get ready for that \npoint.\n  That is important work, because it cannot spring out of nowhere. But \nour country's future is at stake, the future of the greatest economy in \nthe history of the world, because of our irresponsibility is the only \nthing I can say, and we have been part of it. I take blame for part of \nit. We are not doing what the country needs us to do.\n  I am going to vote against the motions to proceed, because each of \nthem, the proposals before us do not achieve anything near what we need \nto do in terms of a balance--entitlement reform, tax reform.\n  I do want to say one other thing which I hope we can get to soon. To \nsay the obvious, but sometimes it is important to say it, the existing \nbudget process has broken down. It does not work. It is not related to \nthe reality of the economic or political times we are in. So the budget \nprocess does not work. Let me cite a couple of statistics. Not since \nearly in 2009 has the Congress managed to actually pass a real annual \nbudget resolution. I know the Budget Control Act does some of the \nthings a budget resolution would do, but not all of them, and it does \nnot do what the Budget Reform Act of 1974 called on us to do.\n  Listen to this. Only four times in the last 35 years--four times in \n35 years--have the appropriations bills been completed prior to the \nbeginning of a new fiscal year. What business or what other government \nentity could operate like that?\n  The last time Congress successfully passed all of the appropriations \nbills prior to the beginning of a new fiscal year was 1996. We know it \nbecause we have been here. Over and over again, Congress slides from \none temporary short-term appropriations bill to the next, months into \nthe fiscal year, until we finally throw it into one big hodgepodge, \nwhich is not responsible government, and a lot gets hidden in it.\n  I want to raise the question--I know my friends on the Budget \nCommittee have thought about it. I sense my time is up. I wonder \nwhether we need a commission to take a look in a short period\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\nof time, 6 months, at the budget process we are following now and make \nrecommendations for a new process that will work. Maybe it is a lack of \npolitical will and an inability to take on these tough issues now, but \nmaybe it is the process, and maybe that is something sooner than later \nwe can work together on.\n  I thank Senators Conrad and Sessions for allowing me to speak as long \nas I was able to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would share something that was in last \nweek's Wall Street Journal, because it deals with an issue that is \nimportant and not to be dismissed, and that is should we begin to make \nreductions in spending today. I think Mr. Barro provides some real \nvaluable insight to that.\n  With regard to Senator Lieberman, I do think that the budget process \ncan work. It should be able to work. But it will not work if we do not \ntry to make it work. Under certain circumstances, it is hard to get a \nbipartisan budget if you do not have everybody together. So maybe it is \nworth examining whether we can make improvements there.\n  But Mr. Barro deals with this question. He writes:\n\n       The weak economic recovery in the U.S. and the even weaker \n     performance in much of Europe have renewed calls for ending \n     budget austerity and returning to larger fiscal deficits. \n     Curiously, this plea for more fiscal expansion fails to offer \n     any proof that Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development countries that chose more budget stimulus have \n     performed better than those that opted for more austerity.\n\n  He continues. These are the developed countries in the world, OECD \ncountries.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Two interesting European cases are Germany and Sweden, each \n     of which moved toward rough budget balance between 2009 and \n     2011--\n\n  That is after the financial crisis--\n\n     while sustaining comparatively strong growth--the average \n     growth rate per year for real GDP for 2010 and 2011 was 3.6% \n     growth for Germany and 4.9% for Sweden. If austerity is so \n     terrible, how come these two countries have done so well?\n       The OECD countries most clearly in or near renewed \n     recession--Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain and perhaps Ireland \n     and the Netherlands--are among those with relatively large \n     fiscal deficits.\n\n  The deficits for these six countries for 2010 and 2011 were 7.9 \npercent of GDP. Germany and Sweden did not raise taxes but cut \nspending. He goes on to say:\n\n       Every time heightened fiscal deficits fail to produce \n     desirable outcomes, the policy advice is to choose still \n     larger deficits--\n\n  Borrow, tax, and spend. He goes on to say:\n\n       If, as I believe to be true, fiscal deficits have only a \n     short-run expansionary impact on growth and then become \n     negative, the results from following this policy are \n     persistently low economic growth and an exploding ratio of \n     debt to GDP.\n\n  Japan, he goes on to note, ``once a comparatively low public-debt \nnation, apparently bought into the Keynesian message many years ago.'' \nThat is the ``spend'' message. ``The consequences for today is a ratio \nof government debt to GDP around 210 percent, the largest in the \nworld.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record \nbecause I think it helps give us some guidance that at some point \nbringing spending under control and tightening our deficit clearly \nwould achieve more financial benefit than continuing to borrow and \nspend or create new taxes that depress the economy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 9, 2012]\n\nStimulus Spending Keeps Failing--If Austerity Is so Terrible, How Come \n                 Germany and Sweden Have Done so Well?\n\n                          (By Robert J. Barro)\n\n       The weak economic recovery in the U.S. and the even weaker \n     performance in much of Europe have renewed calls for ending \n     budget austerity and returning to larger fiscal deficits. \n     Curiously, this plea for more fiscal expansion fails to offer \n     any proof that Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development (OECD) countries that chose more budget stimulus \n     have performed better than those that opted for more \n     austerity. Similarly, in the American context, no evidence is \n     offered that past U.S. budget deficits (averaging 9% of GDP \n     between 2009 and 2011) helped to promote the economic \n     recovery.\n       Two interesting European cases are Germany and Sweden, each \n     of which moved toward rough budget balance between 2009 and \n     2011 while sustaining comparatively strong growth--the \n     average growth rate per year of real GDP for 2010 and 2011 \n     was 3.6% for Germany and 4.9% for Sweden. If austerity is so \n     terrible, how come these two countries have done so well?\n       The OECD countries most clearly in or near renewed \n     recession--Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain and perhaps Ireland \n     and the Netherlands--are among those with relatively large \n     fiscal deficits. The median of fiscal deficits for these six \n     countries for 2010 and 2011 was 7.9% of GDP. Of course, part \n     of this pattern reflects a positive effect of weak economic \n     growth on deficits, rather than the reverse. But there is \n     nothing in the overall OECD data since 2009 that supports the \n     Keynesian view that fiscal expansion has promoted economic \n     growth.\n       For the U.S., my view is that the large fiscal deficits had \n     a moderately positive effect on GDP growth in 2009, but this \n     effect faded quickly and most likely became negative for 2011 \n     and 2012. Yet many Keynesian economists look at the weak U.S. \n     recovery and conclude that the problem was that the \n     government lacked sufficient commitment to fiscal expansion; \n     it should have been even larger and pursued over an extended \n     period.\n       This new point is dangerously unstable. Every time \n     heightened fiscal deficits fail to produce desirable \n     outcomes, the policy advice is to choose still larger \n     deficits. If, as I believe to be true, fiscal deficits have \n     only a short-run expansionary impact on growth and then \n     become negative, the results from following this policy \n     advice are persistently low economic growth and an exploding \n     ratio of public debt to GDP.\n       The last conclusion is not just academic, because it fits \n     with the behavior of Japan over the past two decades. Once a \n     comparatively low public-debt nation, Japan apparently bought \n     the Keynesian message many years ago. The consequence for \n     today is a ratio of government debt to GDP around 210%--the \n     largest in the world.\n       This vast fiscal expansion didn't avoid two decades of \n     sluggish GDP growth, which averaged less than 1% per year \n     from 1991 to 2011. No doubt, a committed Keynesian would say \n     that Japanese growth would have been even lower without the \n     extraordinary fiscal stimulus--but a little evidence would be \n     nice.\n       Despite the lack of evidence, it is remarkable how much \n     allegiance the Keynesian approach receives from policy makers \n     and economists. I think it's because the Keynesian model \n     addresses important macroeconomic policy issues and is \n     pedagogically beautiful, no doubt reflecting the genius of \n     Keynes. The basic model--government steps in to spend when \n     others won't--can be presented readily to one's mother, who \n     is then likely to buy the conclusions.\n       Keynes worshipers' faith in this model has actually been \n     strengthened by the Great Recession and the associated \n     financial crisis. Yet the empirical support for all this is \n     astonishingly thin. The Keynesian model asks one to turn \n     economic common sense on its head in many ways. For instance, \n     more saving is bad because of the resultant drop in consumer \n     demand, and higher productivity is bad because the increased \n     supply of goods tends to lower the price level, thereby \n     raising the real value of debt. Meanwhile, transfer payments \n     that subsidize unemployment are supposed to lower \n     unemployment, and more government spending is good even if it \n     goes to wasteful projects.\n       Looking forward, there is a lot to say on economic grounds \n     for strengthening fiscal austerity in OECD countries. From a \n     political perspective, however, the movement toward austerity \n     may be difficult to sustain in some countries, notably in \n     France and Greece where leftists and other anti-austerity \n     groups just won elections.\n       Consequently, there is likely to be increasing diversity \n     across countries in fiscal policies, and this divergence will \n     likely make it increasingly hard to sustain the euro as a \n     common currency. On the plus side, the differing policies \n     will provide better data to analyze the economic consequences \n     of austerity.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would share a few thoughts in general \nabout where we are. Our colleagues on the Democratic side have said \nthey want more taxes. They have not told us what taxes, how much, and \nwhere they would be. But they have told us that. Senator Conrad has \nsaid that.\n  He has also been open and bold about the need to cut spending. So he \nwants more tax increases than I would like and he wants substantial \nspending cuts, but that is his view. He stated it publicly. But I will \nhave to say, that is not the position of the Democratic majority in the \nSenate because they have refused to put it on paper.\n  Senator Conrad was going to have a Budget Committee mark up. We were \ngoing to mark up a budget. He was going to lay out a plan. I guess it \nwould be somewhat ``Simpson-Bowlesish.'' But it was not offered because \nthe leadership and I suppose the members of the Democratic Conference \nagreed that they do not want to be on record. They would rather do like \nlast year. And what happened last year?\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nThey voted against the Toomey budget; they voted against the Ryan \nbudget; they voted against the Rand Paul budget; and voted against the \nPresident's budget.\n  They wiped their hands. They did not vote for anything to cause any \npain to anybody. And presumably they thought that was better than \nactually being engaged in leading and telling the American people what \nthey planned to do to change the debt course we are on. That is the \ndeal.\n  Well, I would say a couple of things. If I were talking to a group of \nAmerican citizens today, I would say this: Do not send one more dime to \nWashington, DC until they show you a budget, how they are going to \nspend it. I mean, why should they? We get in trouble; we overspend; we \nplace the Nation at risk. And all we want to say is: Send more money. \nYou cannot cut, we are going to throw people into the streets, and push \nolder people off the cliff in a wheelchair.\n  No, I do not think so. I think the American people need to hold this \nCongress, this government, to account. They need to say, we are not \nsending you any more money until you get your house in order. And we \nare not paying for hot tubs in Las Vegas. We are not throwing away $500 \nmillion on a Solyndra loan project that never had a chance to succeed \nand was benefiting cronies of the White House. We are not going to pay \nfor the TSA to have warehouses filled with millions of dollars in \nequipment not being used.\n  You do not have your act together. We want you to get your act \ntogether. We want to see some management. We want to see some \nleadership. Who is the top manager in America? It is not the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, or the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nit is the Chief Executive. The President heads the executive branch. \nEvery Cabinet member, subcabinet member, sub-sub-sub cabinet member \nworks for the President.\n  We had a situation where it has become clear that for over a year, \npeople illegally in the country earning money are filing income tax \nreturns and gaining as much as $4 billion a year in child tax credit \nmoney, a direct payment from the United States for children who do not \neven live in the country.\n  The Inspector General for the U.S. Treasury Department said this \nshould have been ended, and the IRS is not ending it. Congress ought to \npass a law about it. The House has done so. This Senate has not acted. \nThose are the kinds of things that are happening. I would think the \nPresident of the United States, as soon as he learned that, would say: \nStop it today. If you care about the money of the American people, if \nyou care about the fact that we are now spending about $3.6 trillion \ndollars a year, taking in $2.3 trillion a year, so a deficit of $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  Oh, they say that President Bush increased the deficit. And he did. \nBut the highest deficit he ever had was about $450-some-odd billion. \nThe last 3 years under President Obama, the deficits have averaged over \n$1.3 trillion a year. Next year, beginning September 30, the next \nfiscal year, it is projected to be over $1 trillion again.\n  This is an unsustainable course. We are looking here for some reality \nand leadership. I think it is a stunning, amazing development when we \nhave the President of the United States at a time of financial systemic \ncrisis and danger who has the opportunity to lead, who does not lead, \nwho has an opportunity to tell the American people why we need to \nchange the course we are on, the fact that it is going to take some \nbelt tightening and some pain and some sacrifice--not so much, but \nsome.\n  We are going to have to do it. And if we do it, the country will be \non a good path. We can save this country. We can avoid a debt crisis \nthat could happen to us, because indeed our debt per person in America \nis higher than that of Greece, higher than that of any other country in \nEurope. We are in a dangerous area. We need to get off of it. I am \namazed the President has not led.\n  I think it is a development of the most stunning nature that he \nwould, as the law requires, submit the budget he submitted. It is \nirresponsible. It did not get a single vote in the Senate last year. It \nwent down 97 to 0. It was voted down 414 to 0 in the House this year. I \nsuspect in an hour or so it will go down again on the floor of the \nSenate by unanimous vote. That speaks a lot. That says a lot, indicates \nthe sad state of affairs which we are in.\n  It is deeply disappointing.\n  I see Senator Lee from Utah here, who is a new Member of the Senate. \nIf Senator Conrad doesn't have an objection, I will yield to him and \nnote that Senator Lee campaigned throughout his State. He talked to \nthousands of people. He was elected in this last cycle. He felt the \nmood of the people of his State and America, their concern about the \ndebt course we are on. He has worked extremely hard and has laid out a \nproposal that he would like to explain and ask us to support.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership and his commitment and his \nhard work since he has been in the Senate.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I inquire of Senator Lee, how much time would the \nSenator require?\n  Mr. LEE. Ten or twelve minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can we have an agreement for 15 minutes? Is that \nreasonable?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And if the Senator completes his statement before then, \nhe can yield back--either way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the true greatness of our Nation lies in the \npower and promise of the American dream. Unfortunately, for many \nindividuals and families, this dream has become a national nightmare. \nWithout the clear priorities and accountability of a budget, we \ncontinue to careen toward the economic cliff, with our massive debt and \ntrillion-dollar deficits threatening the prosperity of Americans from \nevery walk of life. To put it simply, we must change course.\n  Restoring the American dream will require more than clever bumper \nsticker slogans. While optimism is an important part of the American \ndream, hope simply is not a strategy for the kind of course correction \nour country desperately needs.\n  Doing nothing is no longer an option, although this President and \nthis Congress have attempted, by not having a budget, to convince the \nAmerican people that doing nothing is somehow the only option. Ignoring \nour broken entitlement programs, maintaining our complex Tax Code, and \npretending we don't have a spending problem ensures that our economy \nwill never truly recover and that the American dream will not be \nrestored.\n  The good news for Americans is that many of us do have solutions to \nconfront and correct the country's most pressing challenges. In today's \ndebate and discussion, the Nation has seen that changing course and \nbalancing our budget doesn't have to take 30 years, nor does it have to \nrequire the kinds of drastic cuts that could devastate America's most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  As we conclude this debate, I remind my colleagues of the old adage \nthat ``you can make excuses or you can make progress, but you cannot \nmake both.'' Given the gravity of our current situation, we should also \nrecognize that our present path is unsustainable. A course correction \nis coming; the question we will be held accountable for answering is \nwhether that correction comes by choice or as a consequence of making \nexcuses and doing nothing.\n  The Saving the American Dream Plan, which I have proposed, puts us on \na sustainable and affordable path toward economic growth. It reforms \nour Tax Code to make paying taxes a simple, transparent, and equitable \nprocess that regular people can perform on their own. It empowers \nfamilies to save by making savings tax free, which in turn lowers their \ntax burden in a way that helps them and our economy. It establishes a \nsingle tax rate. It eliminates the payroll tax, helping all Americans--\nespecially those at the lowest income level--and it abolishes the death \ntax permanently. Under this plan, Americans will no longer be forced to \nnavigate the complex web of countless loopholes--for people who don't \nneed them--contained within a tax code that is longer than the works of \nShakespeare.\n  In addition to placing an enormous burden and imposing immense \nuncertainty on our people, such a tax system hides the true size and \ncost of government. This plan is simple, and it provides certainty for \nindividuals and for businesses.\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\n  Opponents of reform will play petty politics and prey on false fears \nabout the government's ability to help the helpless. They claim that \nany course correction in entitlement or social service spending will \ndamage the social safety net. The truth is that doing nothing will \nabsolutely and completely destroy the safety net. If we do not change \ncourse, the collapse of safety net services for our most vulnerable \nAmericans is certain, and it is certain to hurt most those who have the \nleast.\n  This plan saves Social Security by transitioning to a real insurance \nplan that provides income security for seniors and prevents sudden \npoverty as a result of unforeseen events. The affluent elderly, such as \nWarren Buffett, will see a decrease in benefits. This plan will allow \npeople like Mr. Buffett to help in a way that is actually good for our \neconomy and job creators.\n  The Saving the American Dream Plan also ends the government takeover \nof health care and puts dollars and decisions back into the hands of \nfamilies and individuals and their doctors. Just like school choice \nallows parents to make sure their kids don't get stuck in a failing \nschool system, this plan ensures families don't get stuck in a failing \nhealth care system.\n  Finally, this plan acknowledges that we have a spending problem and \nworks to reduce the size of government, eliminate waste, lower the \nfuture burden on taxpayers, encourage productive economic activity, and \nenhance individual liberty and choice. It reins in spending by a total \nof $9.6 trillion over 10 years when compared to President Obama's \nbudget and by $7.1 trillion as against the CBO baseline.\n  Supporters of the status quo will have every excuse as to why this \nbudget or that budget won't work, but now is the time to stop making \nexcuses and start making progress. Today we will vote on five budget \nproposals, but this is only the beginning of the discussion. I can say \nconfidently that Republicans have done a tremendous amount of work to \ncraft proposals to begin to change our course and move our country in \nthe right direction, in a sustainable direction.\n  The President's budget reflects the status quo: Do nothing, keep our \ncomplex Tax Code and broken entitlement programs, and ignore spending. \nAs for Senate Democrats, for 3 straight years they have refused to \nparticipate in this discussion except to criticize ideas they don't \nlike. Leadership is what leadership does. For the past 1,113 days, our \ncountry has suffered from a lack of leadership.\n  I ask my colleagues, if you cannot vote for these budget plans today, \nwill you at least do the right thing for the country and put aside \nelection-year politics, show true leadership, and work with us to \nexplore and implement real solutions? We cannot stand by the status \nquo. We cannot decide by default to do nothing. The American people \nexpect more, and they deserve better.\n  We need every American to join us in finding the solutions that will \nenable us as a nation to change course. The Saving the American Dream \nPlan is about empowering individuals to define their own dream and \nensuring they have every opportunity to make that dream reality.\n  This is the greatest civilization the world has ever known--not \nbecause government made it great but because Americans continually \nreject the status quo, choose to change course when needed, and demand \neconomic freedom, while ensuring individual liberty and the right to \npursue happiness.\n  This budget preserves the clear priorities and accountability we must \nhave to jump-start the economy, create real jobs, strengthen the safety \nnet, and restore the American dream.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I would like to echo what so many of my \ncolleagues have already explained: that voting on a budget today would \nserve no purpose. We keep hearing from our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle: ``We haven't passed a budget in a thousand days.'' While \nthis is technically true, this is a technicality without a difference, \nand ignores one essential detail: we passed something else which, for \nall intents and purposes, accomplishes exactly the same thing as a \nbudget the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n  First let's look at what a budget resolution actually is. According \nto the Congressional Research Service, a budget resolution:\n\n     sets forth aggregate levels of spending, revenue, and public \n     debt. It is not intended to establish details of spending or \n     revenue policy and does not provide levels of spending for \n     specific agencies or programs. Instead, its purpose is to \n     create enforceable parameters within which Congress can \n     consider legislation dealing with spending and revenue.\n\n  A budget resolution is a document intended to guide Congress, and \nnever goes to the President for his signature. The Budget Control Act \nactually went much further than a budget resolution--it actually set \nspending caps for the next 10 years and put them into law--a law signed \nby the President. The spending caps alone produce $900 billion of cuts. \nIn addition, the Budget Control Act created the Super Committee and, \nbecause the committee failed to produce a deficit reduction plan, the \nAct calls for automatic cuts--through a so-called ``sequestration''--of \nan additional $1.2 trillion.\n  So Congress has passed over $2 trillion in spending cuts--the biggest \npackage of spending cuts in American history. Yet some of my colleagues \nare now calling on Congress to also pass a budget resolution, despite \nthe fact that the Budget Control Act has the force of law, and has \nspending caps, whereas a budget resolution has none of that and in \nfact, the Budget Control Act states clearly that it ``shall apply in \nthe same manner as for a concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  In addition, the Budget Control Act is something that we all agreed \nto. This legislation passed the Senate and the Republican-controlled \nHouse with wide margins. And this was not a deal that we passed years \nago that we have somehow forgotten about--we passed the Budget Control \nAct less than 10 months ago. These budget resolutions diverge greatly \nfrom the deal that we all agreed on. We passed that legislation to \navoid a debt default, to give us some certainty. But here we are 10 \nmonths later, rehashing much of the same debate.\n  Going through the motions of considering a budget resolution would \nnot be a productive use of our time. Procedural rules require that we \nspend up to 50 hours on a budget resolution. And on top of that, they \nforce us into a ``vote-a-rama'' on all amendments that are offered. So \nthat means that we would lose a week or 2 on an exercise that is moot \nbecause we already have budget caps. That is time we would not have to \nfocus on things that will provide needed help to my Minnesota \nconstituents: creating jobs, helping small businesses, keeping interest \nrates low on student loans, and passing a long-term highway bill.\n  But instead, the minority is insisting that we spend precious time \ndebating whether or not we should pass a budget resolution. And so here \nwe are with five pending budget resolutions, and it is hard to tell \nwhich among them is the most detrimental to our country, because they \nare all very dangerous.\n  Senator Paul's proposal eliminates the U.S. Departments of Education, \nEnergy, Commerce, and Housing and Urban Development and turns important \nsafety net programs like child nutrition and Medicaid into block \ngrants, resulting in their funding being slashed.\n  Most of the proposals fundamentally change Medicare from a program \nthat guarantees health care to seniors to one that gives seniors some \nmoney--but not enough money--to buy health insurance in the private \nmarket. This breaks the promise we have made to Americans--that if they \nwork hard and pay into the system, their health care will be covered \nwhen they retire.\n  Yet these massive cuts to programs which benefit millions of \nAmericans seem designed to bankroll new tax cuts that benefit only the \nwealthiest few. The Urban Institute and Brookings Institution's joint \nTax Policy Center estimates that Senator Toomey's proposal gives people \nmaking more than a million dollars a year an average tax cut of \n$92,000. And that plan looks reasonable compared to Senator Paul's, \nwhich not only cuts the top tax rates in half for wealthy Americans but \nincreases taxes on working families.\n  And all the while, these plans would sacrifice programs that assist \nchildren, seniors, and the poor in favor of those tax giveaways to the \nwealthy. That is how these plans can be summarized. If there were a \nreason to vote on these proposals, which I do not think there is, then \nthey would all deserve our full-throated opposition.\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\n  But, as we have pointed out repeatedly, passing a budget resolution \nis simply not needed after we have already passed spending caps in the \nBudget Control Act. That would be about as productive as asking for \nsomeone to draft up blueprints after they already had built your house.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Nation faces enormous and worrisome \nfiscal challenges. There is no question we must reduce our budget \ndeficit in the medium-term and prepare for a longer-term future in \nwhich an aging population stresses Medicare and Social Security funds. \nAnd we face, at the beginning of January, the prospect of automatic, \nunprioritized, and unwise budget cuts that would do tremendous harm to \njust about every program in the government, from domestic programs to \nour military, and would in the process threaten our economic recovery.\n  The way to address those enormous challenges is by coming together to \naddress the sources of our budget deficit. The solutions must include \nprudent, prioritized spending cuts. They will undoubtedly include \nreforms to entitlement programs to ensure their long-term viability. \nAnd, as just about any objective observer has repeatedly pointed out, \nthe solutions must include restoration of revenues lost to the Treasury \nthrough unjustified tax cuts for the wealthiest and unjustified tax \nloopholes.\n  Democrats have repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to address these \nareas--even in painful ways that have a real impact on programs about \nwhich we feel strongly. President Obama has repeatedly reached out to \nRepublicans in trying to craft a bipartisan agreement that deals with \nspending, entitlements and revenues. Senator Conrad and many others on \nthis side of the aisle have said they will work with our Republican \ncolleagues to deal comprehensively with the deficit.\n  Rather than seeking compromise, Republicans seem determined to draw \nuncompromising lines in the sand. Today we will vote on extreme budget \nproposals that would sacrifice vital programs like education, \ntransportation and research in order to protect tax breaks for \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  The Republican proposals before us today demonstrate that our efforts \nto deal constructively with the deficit have so far fallen on deaf \nears. Rather than offer prudent, thoughtful spending cuts, these \nproposals would gut programs that Americans have repeatedly told us to \npreserve. Rather than recognize the obvious fiscal reality that revenue \nmust be part of the equation, these proposals demonstrate a continued, \nideologically motivated refusal to even consider what must obviously be \npart of any serious attempt to address the deficit. Rather than reform \nentitlement programs so we can maintain our commitment to seniors, \nthese proposals would upend that commitment.\n  Perhaps the clearest statement of all of Republican intentions is the \nbudget passed in the House, one of the proposals we will vote on today. \nThis budget eliminates the decades-long guarantee of health care for \nour seniors, replacing Medicare with a voucher program that would cause \nskyrocketing out-of-pocket costs for seniors.\n  There is more. The Ryan budget proposes to cut billions and billions \nfrom domestic programs, but gives us no specifics as to how those cuts \nwould be accomplished. It proposes almost no specific spending cuts, \nthough it promises massive savings. We can see just how devastating \nthese cuts would be if we assume, in the absence of specific proposals, \nthat they would be distributed evenly across the budget. If that were \nthe case, we would lose more than $100 billion in funding over the next \ndecade for science, including the search for new cures and other new \ntechnologies. We would have space for 2 million fewer Head Start \nstudents to get a jump on their education. More than 9 million college \nstudents would lose $1,000 in Pell grant funding to afford college.\n  This budget would slash spending to educate our children and to train \nour workers. It would cut funding to support new sources of energy and \nto protect our national parks and historic sites, and for environmental \nprotection and other natural resource programs. It would slash funding \nto pave our roads and bridges and meet other transportation needs.\n  And the Ryan plan does not address what budget experts of all \nideological stripes tell us we must address: the need for additional \nrevenues. Rather than restore revenue, this budget is premised on the \nnotion that high-income earners haven't gotten enough in tax cuts--and \nso it slashes the top tax bracket.\n  If you are not willing to address revenues, you are not serious about \naddressing the deficit. The Ryan budget and the other Republican \nproposals before us fail that test. I hope we can dispense with these \nproposals and get to the challenging work of dealing with the deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Harkin is here, and Senator Harkin \nneeds about 4 minutes; is that right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four minutes 46 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This might be a useful time to get another consent. If we \ncan have Senator Harkin for 4 minutes, how much time does Senator \nJohnson need?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Not more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. OK. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin speak for \n4 minutes and Senator Johnson for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to address these budget proposals \nin one context. First of all, we have to dismiss the so-called Sessions \nbudget that is supposedly the Obama budget--it is not. That is not even \nserious. Beyond that, we have four Republican budgets. Here is the one \nthing people have to keep in mind, especially now: Each one of those \nbudgets will double the interest rate on student loans beginning on \nJuly 1 of this year--every single one of them.\n  We were here in the last couple of weeks trying to bring up a bill to \nprevent those interest rates from going up, to keep it at 3.4 percent \nrather than going to 6.8 percent. The Republicans filibustered that. We \ncould not even bring it up for discussion, debate, and amending. But \nthe Republicans kept saying, oh, they want to keep the interest rate at \n3.4 percent. Well, quite frankly, I don't see how they can say that and \nthen vote for each one of these budgets because each one that will be \nvoted on in about an hour and a half, if it passes, will double the \ninterest rate on student loans on July 1. At the same time, they \ncontinue to filibuster our bill to even bring it on the floor. My \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are telling students across the \ncountry they don't want to see the interest rate double, but their \nbudget has it.\n  Our former colleague and now the Vice President of the United States \nJoe Biden, when he was a Senator, said something I think very savvy one \ntime: Don't tell me what you value; show me your budget, and I will \ntell you what you value.\n  Mr. President, my friends on the other side may say in public that \nthey want to prevent the student loan rate hike, but their actual \nbudget tells a very different story. Likewise, their ongoing filibuster \nof our Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act tells a different \nstory. Again, they have blocked us from proceeding to the bill. If we \nhad proceeded, we could have had a serious discussion about how we pay \nfor it. They could have offered amendments that we could have voted on. \nInstead, they chose to obstruct the entire process, and yet repeatedly \non this floor Republicans, one after the other, came up and said they \nwant to stop the increase in interest rates from going from 3.4 percent \nto 6.8 percent. Don't tell me what you value; show me your budget. I \nwill give them credit for this: They have shown us their budget, and in \nit is a doubling of the interest rate on student loans beginning July \n1.\n  I want to be clear that anybody who votes for any one of these \nbudgets is voting to double the student loan interest rate on July 1 \nregardless of what may be said, regardless of crocodile\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\ntears that may be shed on interest rates and what is happening. The \nbudgets we are voting on today tell the true story: Republicans are \nwilling--not only willing, but they are going to, if they vote for \nthese budgets, double the interest rates on student loans beginning on \nJuly 1. There is just no getting around that, and that is a shame.\n  We have to stop that interest rate hike on July 1. That is why it is \nimportant to vote down these proposed budgets this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I ask unanimous consent to speak for no \nmore than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, before I start talking a bit \nabout the budget of my friend Senator Lee, I want to respond to the \ncomments of the Senator from Iowa in terms of interest rates.\n  Instead of talking about student rates, let me talk a little about \nAmerica's average borrowing cost. Certainly, what I have done is delved \ninto the budget and taken a look at the history, and from 1970 to \n1999--over that 30-year period--the average borrowing cost in the \nUnited States was 5.3 percent. By the way, that was when America was a \nfar more creditworthy nation, when our debt-to-GDP ratio ranged from \nabout 40 percent to 67 percent. Now our debt-to-GDP ratio is over 100 \npercent.\n  Over the last 3 years our average borrowing cost has been kept \nartificially low, at 1.5 percent. So my concern is by not seriously \naddressing the problem, by not actually passing a real budget that \nstarts reining in the growth in government, we are going to go from \nthat 1.5 percent and revert back to that average mean borrowing cost of \n5.3 percent. If we do, that 3.8-percent differential would add $600 \nbillion to $700 billion per year to America's interest expense, and \nthat would crowd out 60 to 70 percent of all discretionary spending. \nThat is the interest rate that I am concerned about.\n  That is the day of reckoning I am concerned about, when global \ninvestors look at the United States and say: You know what. We are not \ngoing to loan you any more money. Or what is more likely to occur, they \nwill say: We will loan you money but at a far higher rate.\n  Having made that statement, I would like to talk a little about the \nbudget of my friend, Senator Lee, and the things I like about it. One \nof the things I like to do is take a look at history. I know a lot of \nus say we don't have a tax problem, and we don't. It is not that we tax \nthe American public too little, it is that we spend too much. And this \nis some pretty graphic proof.\n  This reflects our 10-year spending levels. From 1992 to 2000, the \nFederal Government spent a total of $16 trillion over that 10-year \nperiod. Over the last 10 years, from 2002 to 2011, the Federal \nGovernment spent $28 trillion.\n  Now, the debate moving forward is--according to the just released \nObama budget--the President would like to spend $47 trillion over the \nnext 10 years. The House budget would spend $40 trillion. I guess what \nI like about Senator Lee's budget is that he would come in and spend \nabout $37 trillion and put us on a more aggressive path toward fiscal \nsanity. While we hear about Draconian cuts all the time, one doesn't \nhave to be a math major to realize that moving to $37 trillion, $40 \ntrillion, or $47 trillion is not a cut from $28 trillion. All we are \ntrying to do is reduce the rate of growth.\n  The other thing I like about Senator Lee's budget can be illustrated \nin terms of this chart, which shows the total Federal debt. I started \nthis chart in 1987, the tail end of Ronald Reagan's administration, \nwhen our total Federal debt was $2.3 trillion. I want to point out that \nit took us 200 years to incur $2.3 trillion. Of course, last year, in \nthe debt ceiling agreement, this Congress gave the President the \nauthority to increase our debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion. We will go \nthrough that in less than 2 years. That is a problem.\n  Of course, if we take a look at President Obama's budget, we can see \nhow quickly our national debt has increased. But according to President \nObama's budget, in the year 2022 our total Federal debt would be $25.9 \ntrillion, up $10 trillion from what it is today. Senator Lee's budget \nwould result in a total debt of about $19.1 trillion. Even more \nimportantly, he stabilizes and then reduces a very important metric, \nour overall debt-to-GDP ratio. That is what investors take a look at in \nterms of our creditworthiness.\n  The other thing I like about Senator Lee's budget is by 2022 it will \nreduce Federal spending to 17.8 percent of the size of our economy. If \nyou are like me and you think the root cause of our economic problem is \nthe size, the scope, and all the rules and regulations, all of \ngovernment's intrusion into our lives and the resulting cost of \ngovernment, this is the key metric: How large is the Federal Government \nin relationship to the size of our economy?\n  Currently, the Federal Government takes 24 cents of every dollar that \nis generated by our economy. If we add in State and local governments, \ntotal government in the United States consumes 39.2 percent. Put \nanother way, 39 cents of every dollar filters through some level of \ngovernment.\n  I don't know about anyone else, but I don't find government \nparticularly effective or efficient. To put that in perspective, for \nexample, the cost of government for Norway last year--one of the \nEuropean-style socialist nations--was 40 percent. For Greece, it was 47 \npercent. Anybody hear of Greece recently? That economic model is \ncollapsing.\n  This is why Senator Lee's proposal is important. If we take a look at \nspending and revenue generation over the last 50 years, we can see \nspending from 1959 through 2008 averaged 20.2 percent. Over the last 3 \nyears we have increased that to 24 percent. Revenue generation has been \n18.1 percent over that same time period.\n  By the way, as much as our friends on the other side of the aisle \nwant to punish success and increase the top marginal tax rates, the \nproblem with that is it simply doesn't work. During my lifeline, the \ntop marginal tax rates have been 90 percent, 70 percent to 50 percent \nto 28 percent, 35 percent, 39.6 percent, and now back to 35 percent. In \nall that time period the average tax receipts--the maximum amount the \nFederal Government could extract from our economy--has averaged very \ntightly around that mean of 18.1 percent.\n  If we ever have any chance of living within our means, we better get \nFederal spending down to about that level. That is what Senator Lee's \nbudget does.\n  So, again, I thank my friend Senator Lee, as well as Senator Toomey, \nand Senator Paul for putting forward serious proposals. I thank all \nRepublicans in Congress who are actually voting for something because, \nMr. President, Republicans are proving we are willing to be held \naccountable to the American people by putting a plan on the table and \nshowing the American people what we would do to try to get our fiscal \nhouse in order.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not take more than a few minutes, as \nI have explained to the senior Senator from North Dakota. I appreciate \nhis courtesy, and I ask unanimous consent that my statement be made as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withought objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before he leaves, I want to say that the \nSenator from Vermont has done an incredible job on the Violence Against \nWomen Act. He has put together a bipartisan coalition, and I would like \nto second his words that the House pass our bill. It is a careful \ncompromise, and it is a delicately crafted compromise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend? How much time does \nthe Senator from North Dakota yield to the Senator from New York?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I give the Senator 3 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for the time.\n  Again, I want to compliment the Senator from Vermont and agree with \nhim and hope we can move the bill forward.\n  But, Mr. President, I am here to talk about the budget. All afternoon \nI have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeat over \nand over that we haven't passed a budget. As my friend from North \nDakota knows, that is clearly not the case.\n  Last August, President Obama signed a budget for this year that \nreduces the deficit by $2 trillion. It is called the Budget Control \nAct. It was passed 74 to 26, bipartisan, with many Republicans voting \nfor it on August 2, 2011.\n  Despite what we hear on the floor today, after the Budget Control Act \npassed, several Senate Republicans, including Senators Grassley, \nAlexander, and Collins, admitted it constitutes a budget. So watching \nthis debate on the Senate floor is a sort of through-the-looking-glass \nexperience. We are watching our colleagues call for something they \nacknowledge already happened and they supported. This is nothing more \nthan petty politics. We should be focused on jobs and the economy. \nInstead we are forced to spend hours debating something that already \nhappened. It doesn't make sense.\n  But let's put that aside for a moment and look at the extreme plans \nwe are voting on today. The only real differences between the four \nRepublican budgets--the only real difference between the four \nRepublican budgets--is how quickly they race to end Medicare as we know \nit. The Republican budgets all cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans \nand leave the middle class to foot the bill. They all allow student \nloan rates to double. They all provide tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires. And they all put the middle class last instead of first.\n  When I first examined the Ryan budget passed by the House GOP this \nyear, I thought it was the height of irresponsibility. But now that we \nhave seen three other Republican budgets, we know they make the Ryan \nbudget almost seem reasonable by comparison, and that is no small feat.\n  I have nothing against the wealthy. I am glad they make money. That \nis the America way. God bless them. Many are living the American dream. \nBut in order to keep that dream alive and get our country on firmer \nfiscal footing, I think we need a little shared sacrifice. The bottom \nline is any budget that jeopardizes the middle class while filling the \npockets of the wealthy with greater tax breaks is ultimately untenable \nand will never pass the Senate. While we are certainly open to \ncompromise, Democrats will not tolerate an assault on the middle class. \nIt isn't fair and it isn't right.\n  We hope the coming debate will yield a sound serious agreement. But \nif it doesn't, Democrats are happy to take this contrast of priorities \ninto November because we know we have the high ground.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield my remaining time back to my friend \nand colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Budget Control Act is not a budget, \nit is just a containment of spending. A clever attempt was made to make \nit look like a budget, but it is not a budget. If it was a budget, why \ndid the President submit a budget this year? Why did the House pass a \nbudget? Why were four budgets produced in the House by Democratic House \nMembers?\n  In today's Politico, an article quotes Senator Lieberman, who just \nspoke and who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\n       I don't think [Democrats] will offer their own budget and \n     I'm disappointed in that.\n\n  Senator Manchin of West Virginia, a Democrat, said he would have been \n``impeached'' if he had failed to produce a budget as West Virginia's \nGovernor, though he conceded there are differences with the State \nbudget process.\n\n       Sure I have a problem with [failing to offer a budget]. As \n     a former governor, my responsibility was to put a budget \n     forward and balance it, so anyone who comes from the \n     executive mindset has a problem with that. I don't care if \n     you're Democrat or Republican.\n\n  ``A problem with that'' means a problem with not having a budget.\n  Senator Mark Pryor, a Democrat from Arkansas:\n\n       The budget process is just not working around here. We've \n     had three years with President Obama where we're not able to \n     get a budget resolution passed.\n\n  That 3 years includes this one.\n  So we don't have a budget, we have a spending cap. And our Democratic \ncolleagues--bless their hearts--have been whining that the House \nproposed a budget that came below the Senate's Budget Control Act caps \nin some areas, so they say that was breaking the budget.\n  I would just advise them that when they vote on the President's \nbudget--and I assume they will all vote against it; they did last \nyear--the President's budget wipes out half the savings in the Budget \nControl Act.\n  The President signed the Budget Control Act last August to raise the \ndebt ceiling. We agreed to cut spending $2.1 trillion--not nearly \nenough, but we cut that and it was a decent step forward in the right \ndirection, and the President proposes a budget this year that takes \nhalf of it out. Give me a break. There is no sense of wanting to have a \nbudget, to adhere to one, and to contain spending. What do they want? \nMore taxes.\n  The President said, ``The Buffett rule will help stabilize the \ndebt.'' That is what the President said; that is, tax increases on the \nrich would help stabilize the debt. Well, the Buffett tax would raise \nabout $4 billion a year. This year the deficit will be $1,200 billion, \nnot $4 billion. That is not going to fix it. It will be $1,200 billion, \nand the Buffett rule would raise about $4 billion a year. What kind of \nresponsible leadership is that, for the President of the United States \nto be traveling this country at a time when we have never faced a more \nsignificant financial threat to America--we never, ever have been on a \ndebt course as dangerous as the one we are on today. It is systemic. It \nis deep. We have to make serious changes, and he goes around saying the \nBuffett rule is going to stabilize the debt? He also said his budget \nlast year would lead us to balance when the lowest single deficit year \nin 10 would be a deficit of $748 billion.\n  So I don't know what kind of leadership we are getting. It is not \ngood leadership. It is worse than no leadership because when a budget \nis prepared with great effort by Congressman Paul Ryan in the House, \nand his budget will actually change the debt course of America and \nminimize the pain we all have to suffer and create some growth and \nprosperity, the President invites him over to a conference, sits him \ndown there, and then attacks it, and he has been attacking the budget \never since. Why is this? Why will not our colleagues support any \nbudget?\n  I fully expect my Democratic colleagues to vote against all of these \nbudgets and not vote for one. Think about that. They will vote against \nfour, not vote for one. Well, because you don't have the fingerprints \non anything that results in cutting spending, nobody that benefits from \nspending is going to be mad with you. Everybody who wants more money \nand doesn't want to have a dime reduced in the take they get from the \ntaxpayers' trough and the debt we borrow--they don't have any reduction \nin that, and then they can't be mad at me. But that is not a \nresponsible course.\n  This is not a little matter. This is what Admiral Mullen, the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said just 2 years ago:\n\n       The biggest threat we have to our national security is our \n     debt.\n\n  In an important statement by 10 former Chairs of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, who served in Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, they wrote in March of 2011:\n\n       At some point, bond markets are likely to turn on the \n     United States, leading to a crisis that could dwarf 2008.\n\n  Bond markets will turn. That is what they have done on Greece.\n  The Simpson-Bowles Commission's Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, in \ntestimony to our committee, said:\n\n       This nation has never faced a more predictable financial \n     crisis.\n\n  The same thing as the Council of Economic Advisors said: You are on a \ndebt path that is unsustainable.\n  Chairman Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve--always cautious \nabout what he says--talking about the Congressional Budget Office's \nprojections of surging debt year after year, says:\n\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\n\n       The CBO projections, by design, ignore the adverse effects \n     that such high debt and deficits would likely have on our \n     economy. But if government debt and deficits were actually to \n     grow at the pace envisioned by this scenario, the economic \n     and financial effects would be severe.\n\n  And I recall at one point he said in his testimony: You see these \ndebts being projected out there year after year, surging at this high \nlevel? You are never going to get there.\n  What he meant was that we would have a financial crisis before that \nhappened.\n  I would say to my colleagues, this is a time of challenge for the \nSenate and the Congress of the United States. Will we rise to the \nchallenge and actually do something? We can talk about it. We can have \nsecret meetings and secret meetings and secret meetings. That is not \nfixing it. We can have these last-minute decisions, like last summer \nwhen the government was about to virtually shut down because the debt \nlimit had been reached, and reach some secret agreement that is brought \nup on the floor for a vote and is not very well written. Or we can do \nwhat the law requires. In the United States Code, the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974. It requires that we pass a budget. We can't \nguarantee exactly how it will all come out, but we ought to attempt to \ncomply with the law, at least. We haven't attempted to do that.\n  I am worried about our future. I am worried about where we are \nheading. And I do think the American people have a right to be upset \nwith us. They are not happy with us. They should not be happy with us. \nWhen their Congress has allowed this country to reach a state where we \nare taking in $2.3 trillion and spending $3.6 trillion, when 35, 40 \npercent of what we spend is borrowed money, the American people have a \nright to be unhappy about that. They absolutely do. We are not \nprotecting their interests, their children's interests, their future, \nor the economy.\n\n  And it is stunning to me that the leader of the free world, the \nPresident of the United States, the Chief Executive, isn't pounding \naway at the Congress to bring spending under control and to reduce the \ndebt we have. Instead, he seems to never want to talk about it. He only \ntalks about investments--more investments.\n  In fact, that budget he produced this year, what did it do to the \nspending levels we agreed to last August? Before the budget control \nagreement of last August, the U.S. Government was on path to spend $47 \ntrillion over 10 years. What it effectively did was it reduced that \nspending to $45 trillion--still substantially more each year than we \nare spending now. There is growth every year under that proposal--too \nmuch growth, too much debt. But it was a step. So this year when he \nproposed his budget, he proposed spending another $1.4 or $1.5 \ntrillion, new, on top of that. After he signed the agreement that we \nwould cap spending at $45 trillion, this would take spending up to \n$46.6 trillion again, almost $47 trillion, where we were before the \nagreement was reached. Now, that is not responsible leadership. And he \nhad a big tax increase. Tax and spend--that is what that budget is. And \nthe American people shouldn't be happy with us.\n  It was noted also that Senator Harkin said, well, this isn't the \nPresident's budget, that Senator Sessions offered some joke, or \nsomething to that matter. But it is the President's budget. It has the \nnumbers in it that the President had. They directly reflect the \nPresident's request. If any Senator wants to come forward and show any \nnumber we put in there that is different from the President's numbers \nwhen he laid out his budget, then I would like to see it. Maybe we \ncould correct it. But I don't think there is an error. I think we \nscrupulously followed the President's budget proposal request, and when \npeople vote on it, they can know they are voting exactly on what he \nproposed. I don't think anybody will dispute the numbers we have in the \nbudget.\n  Also, I note that some of our Democratic colleagues are not happy \nabout having no budget produced by the Democratic side. They feel bad \nabout it, and I understand that. But I would have thought we would have \nhad some Members come down and complain about it, to say that they \ndidn't think the Democratic leadership, the Democratic conference \nshould have blocked Senator Conrad and the Budget Committee from having \na budget, that they should be handling this differently. But we haven't \nhad that, so I guess everybody is basically happy on the Democratic \nside not to have to cast any tough votes.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as we come to a conclusion of this \ndebate, Senator Harkin said something that was pretty insightful. He \nsaid: Show me your budget, and I will show you what you value.\n  Refuse to show me your budget, I will say, and I can say you are \nrefusing to show what is important to you.\n  One of the things that has been brought up is the war costs. The war \non terror in Iraq and Afghanistan has been expensive, no doubt about \nit. Last year the total for both wars over 10 years reached $1.3 \ntrillion--10 years--both wars. That was the deficit last year alone, \n$1.3 trillion. This year the war costs are declining. The year we are \nin, we are spending $118 billion on the war. Our deficit will be $1,200 \nbillion. So eliminating all war costs would be less than 10 percent of \nthe amount of our deficit.\n  I say that so we understand what has happened. Over 50 percent of our \nspending is in mandatory entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, food stamps, retirement benefits. Those are huge and \nthey are increasing at two, three times the rate of inflation. That is \nwhat puts us on an unsustainable course.\n  The President's budget goes against everything the experts said, \nagainst the debt commission he appointed, and refuses to confront these \nsurging entitlement costs. That is a disappointment because we have \nnothing from the other side on how they would deal with them.\n  But the Members on this side have offered budgets, and Congressman \nRyan offered a budget. They do begin to deal with this painful but \ndifficult situation concerning the entitlement programs. I note the \nBudget Control Act they have been calling a budget had nothing to do \nwith over 50 percent of the budget. It did not deal with those \nexpenditures, it did not deal with the entitlements. That is another \nreason it is not a budget. It is a cap on discretionary spending. That \nis all that was. It was a step in the right direction but not a budget \nplan that would help us have a prosperous future.\n  This is an important day. I think it will cause the American people \nand all of us in Congress to confront the reality of a danger we face \nfrom debt. No matter how we vote this day, this next hour--even if we \nvote in what I think is the wrong way--hopefully this whole process \nwould have caused all of us to confront the reality of the danger to \nthe American Republic, the growing debt.\n  I would say from my experience it will be tough to deal with it, but \nI absolutely believe we can. It is not outside of the possibility and \nability of this country to reverse our course. The kind of cuts we will \nneed to have will not be such that will damage in any significant way \nthe strength and health of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would ask Senator Sessions, if I might, \nfor 2 additional minutes because of the time Senator Leahy consumed?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate that and will agree to those 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, the place we agree is we have a long-term problem for \nthis country that we must address. I attempted to lay before the Budget \nCommittee, and did lay before the Budget Committee, the Bowles-Simpson \nplan. It is the one plan that has had bipartisan support. I hope before \nthe year is over that we can go back to it because I think it holds the \ngreatest potential.\n  A key difference Senator Sessions and I have is whether we have a \nbudget for this year and next. I believe it is clear we do. The Budget \nControl Act that passed last year says that the allocations and \nspending levels set ``shall\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\napply in the Senate in the same manner as for a concurrent resolution \non the budget.'' That is for both 2012 and 2013.\n  I believe our Republican friends want to focus on that because they \ndo not want to focus on the specifics of their budget plans. Recall, \nthe last time they were in charge, when they controlled everything--the \nHouse and the Senate and the White House--the Republican policies led \nus to the brink of financial collapse. The proposals they are advancing \ntoday are a return to those failed policies. Remember what happened \nwhen they were in charge. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month and the \neconomy was shrinking at a rate of almost 9 percent a year. That is why \nthey do not want to focus on the substance of their plans.\n  Let's focus on the substance for a moment. Every Republican budget \nends Medicare as we know it. One Republican budget cuts Social Security \nbenefits by 39 percent. Every Republican budget cuts taxes for \nmillionaires by at least $150,000 a year. And every Republican budget \nprotects offshore tax havens.\n  I have shown on the floor many times a picture of this little \nbuilding in the Cayman Islands that claims to be the home of 18,857 \ncompanies. It is not their home. They are not doing business out of \nthis little five-story business in the Cayman Islands. They are doing \nmonkey business. The monkey business they are doing is avoiding the \ntaxes they owe. Every Republican budget protects this scam. That should \nnot be allowed to continue.\n  I hope my colleagues reject these proposals. I hope we will vote no, \nand then get onto the serious business of a bipartisan plan to get \nAmerica back on track, the Simpson-Bowles plan that I presented to the \nBudget Committee.\n  I yield the floor. I believe all time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The question is on the motion to proceed to S. Con. Res. 41.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have 1 minute on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the President's budget is now before us. \nLast year it failed in this body 97 to 0. It failed in the House, the \nbudget that he offered this year, 414 to 0. I expect it will receive no \nvotes today. That is a stunning development for the President of the \nUnited States in his fourth year in office, to produce a budget for the \nfuture of our country at a time of fiscal danger, great financial and \neconomic danger to our country, to not receive a single vote.\n  Maybe somebody will vote for it. Let me tell you why we should not. \nIt does not change the debt course. It violates the budget agreement \nthe President signed and Congress passed last year, by increasing \nspending over that level by $1.5 trillion. It throws off another $1.8 \ntrillion in tax increases, essentially using tax increases to offset \nnew spending programs, not to pay down the debt. It is the most \nirresponsible budget submitted. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is the budget. This is what Senator \nSessions has presented as being the President's budget. Do you see a \ndifference? This is what Senator Sessions describes as the President's \nbudget. This is the President's budget. I think it is readily apparent, \nthere is a big difference between the President's budget, which I hold \nin my hands, and what Senator Sessions has presented as being the \nPresident's budget. This is not the President's budget, so of course we \nare not going to support it. It is not what the President proposed.\n  I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, at a time when our Nation has never, \never faced a deeper, more dangerous systemic debt threat than we face \ntoday, the Republican House, under the leadership of Congressman Paul \nRyan, has produced a budget that would change the debt course of \nAmerica, create economic growth, put us on a path to financial \nstability, and do the things that a responsible budget should do. The \nPresident's budget utterly failed in that regard and has gotten no \nsupport. This budget will do the job.\n  People can disagree with this or that portion of it. I think this \nbudget is a historic step in the right direction for this great \nRepublic, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this budget plan, the House Republican \nplan, ends Medicare as we know it. All the while, it provides $1 \ntrillion of additional tax cuts to the wealthiest among us. It gives \nmillionaires, on average, an additional tax cut of $150,000 a year. In \naddition, it cuts health care by $3 trillion and increases the number \nof uninsured in our country by 30 million people.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this budget proposal.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the motion to proceed to S. Con. Res. 37.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, the vote we are about to cast is on a \nmotion to proceed to the budget I have introduced, one of the important \nfeatures of which is within the customary 10-year budget window this \nbudget would balance. It does not happen overnight. It takes 8 years to \nget there. But it does, in fact, balance, and it does it by essentially \ncontaining the rate of growth in spending. Only in the first year is \nthere a spending cut, and that is less than 3 percent. Every year \nthereafter spending grows in this budget, but it grows a little more \nslowly than the alternative. It grows at a sustainable pace so that \nwith normal economic growth we will reach a balance within 8 years and \na modest surplus thereafter.\n  It does call for some of these structural entitlement reforms we \nneed. Specifically, it would call for adopting the bipartisan Medicare \nreform plan that I would remind everyone permits senior citizens to \ncontinue to choose the traditional fee-for-service Medicare they have \nnow--if that is their choice--but it does make other options we think \nwould be more cost effective available as well.\n  It also adopts the President's recommendation by asking the \nwealthiest Americans to pay a little more for the Medicare benefits \nthey enjoy. It asks for tax reform that we all know we need to generate \neconomic growth, and it puts our budget on a sustainable path.\n  I urge Members to vote in favor of this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this is another unbalanced plan. There \nis very little in the way of revenue to reduce deficits and debt but \ndeep spending cuts in priorities such as education and energy. In fact, \nthis proposal cuts discretionary spending $1 trillion below the Budget \nControl Act, which cut $900 billion. In addition, this cuts $3 trillion \nin health care by ending Medicare as we know it and by block-granting \nMedicaid, holding hostage those who are the most vulnerable among us, \nchildren and the disabled.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist this proposal.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Toomey budget we are about to vote on increase \nstudent loan interest rates on July 1 from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It does permit that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I hope every Senator who votes on this knows, if \nthey are voting for this budget, they are voting to double student loan \ninterest rates on July 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the motion to proceed to S. Con. Res. 42 \nintroduced by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, like the previous three Republican \nbudgets, this budget is silent on student interest rates. Anyone who \nasserts otherwise for good political theatre should know that it is \nuntrue. This budget has nothing to do with student interest rates. I \nthink we should have a debate on a little higher plane.\n  We are borrowing $50,000 a second. We are borrowing $4 billion a day, \nover $1 trillion a year. While America burns through a century of \nwealth, the President fiddles. The President's friends fuss and they \nproduce no budget.\n  This budget balances in 5 years. It saves Social Security. It saves \nMedicare. It reforms and simplifies the Tax Code. I urge my colleagues \nto act now and vote for a budget that balances. Do something to save \nAmerica from this looming debt crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this plan has massive tax cuts for the \nwealthiest among us. This plan cuts discretionary spending $2 trillion \nbelow the Budget Control Act that cut $900 billion. This plan ends \nMedicare in 2 years. This plan repeals health care reform. Thirty \nmillion more people would be uninsured.\n  Perhaps most stunningly, this plan cuts Social Security benefits 39 \npercent. One can say it balances, but it balances at an extraordinary \ncost. And the cost is borne by those least able to bear the cost. I \nurge my colleagues to reject this plan.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask the same question of the \ndistinguished chairman: Would this budget have the interest rates \ndouble on student loans on July 1 from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, it is hard to see how it would not. Let me say, in \neducation, it cuts education 59 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

That is what the people want, that is \nwhat we want, and that is what we are willing to do, so I hope we can \ndo that. It is a wide-ranging bill, extremely important for the \ncountry, with relevant amendments. There are a lot of them to do, so I \nhope we can have an agreement to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the old adage that \nyou can make excuses or you can make progress but you cannot make both.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator deserves to be heard.\n  Mr. LEE. I remind my colleagues of the old adage that you can make \nexcuses or you can make progress but you cannot make both--at least not \nsimultaneously.\n  Our current course is unsustainable. Maintaining the status quo will \ninevitably impair our ability to fund everything from defense to \nentitlements. So sticking to this course isn't the solution. It can't \nbe the solution. And if followed as a solution, it will have an impact \nthat will prove devastating to America's most vulnerable populations. \nIt is for exactly that reason I have proposed this budget--a budget \nthat balances within 5 years, a budget that simplifies the Tax Code, a \nbudget that puts health care decisions back into the hands of \nindividual families, individuals themselves, and their doctors, where \nthose decisions properly belong.\n  We don't have much time. We have to get this done. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this budget proposal has the most serious \nmistakes I have seen in 26 years of dealing with budgets in this \nChamber. This budget starts with an $8 trillion mistake on the size of \nthe deficit.\n  I have put up the calculation. This budget has Federal revenues of \n$27.5 trillion, budget outlays of $37.2 trillion, for a difference of \n$9.750 trillion. But it claims deficits of $1.750 trillion. That is an \n$8 trillion mistake.\n  No. 2, it has a $5.7 trillion mistake with respect to budget \nauthority. If we add up the individual budget function totals, they are \n$5.7 trillion less than the aggregate budget authority totals in what \nis being offered by the Senator.\n  No. 3, this requires some committees to cut more spending than they \nhave available to them in their resources. For example, the HELP \nCommittee is instructed to save $2.7 trillion, and they only have $510 \nbillion available to them to cut.\n  This budget is shot full of basic fundamental mistakes. It should not \neven be considered as a budget on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. LEE.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  (The remarks of Senators Grassley and Landrieu pertaining to the \nsubmission of S. Res. 462 are printed in today's Record under \n``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Fiscal Responsibility\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, today we considered five separate budget \nproposals for the Federal Government. At first glance, that would \nappear to be the fiscally responsible thing to do. The families and \nsmall business owners I talk to back home in Kansas do that every year. \nThey operate with a budget, and we know the Federal Government needs to \ndo so as well. However, this Chamber has not passed a budget in 1,113 \ndays. That is more than 3 years.\n  In my first speech on the Senate floor as a new Member of the Senate \na little more than a year ago, I indicated to my Senate colleagues that \nmy greatest concern for our country is our Nation's out-of-control \nspending. I am here today because I still have that concern. We spend \ntoo much money, and we no longer can delay the difficult decisions \nnecessary to correct that problem.\n  Our national debt stands at more than $15 trillion. This enormous\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\namount of debt is slowing our economic recovery and threatening the \nprosperity of our future generations, who will have to pay for our \nfiscal irresponsibility.\n  Writing and passing a budget is one of the most basic \nresponsibilities of Congress. It is required by law. The budget sets \nforth priorities and guidelines for the fiscal year and begins the \nprocess of determining how much money should be spent and which \nprograms should be cut back, eliminated, or even further supported. \nWithout a budget, the annual appropriations process--and I am a member \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, and I want the appropriations \nprocess to work, but in many ways that appropriations process continues \nto be on hold. This is not the way to run our country. To put our \ncountry back on its path to fiscal responsibility, we must set the \nbudget. We set budget limits, and then we have to stick to them.\n  Any serious conversation about the budget and Federal spending must \ninclude a candid assessment of our Nation's entitlement programs. Those \nprograms include Social Security and Medicare. Mandatory spending makes \nup 56 percent of the Federal budget--if we had one. This percentage \nwill only increase in years ahead as more Americans retire and fewer \nworkers are there to replace them. Without addressing our long-term \ncommitments, our attempts to significantly change our country's fiscal \noutlook will be limited.\n  As I said, I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nwhere our appropriations process deals with about 30 percent of \nspending on an annual basis. We have done a reasonable job--I hate to \nbe overly complimentary to Congress--at holding the line on \ndiscretionary spending, that 30 percent we deal with every year. It has \nbeen pretty flatlined over the last several years, but you cannot solve \nour country's fiscal problems by only dealing with the 30 percent that \nwe include in the appropriations process. We have to deal with the \nremaining portions of our budget.\n  The challenge of not only the appropriations process to determine how \nmuch money we spend every year but the broader issues of so-called \nentitlement spending cannot be ignored any longer. Of the five budgets \nwe considered earlier today, four of them--all but President Obama's \nbudget--contained serious proposals to these entitlements. I can \ncritique every one of the four budgets that move in the right direction \nof balancing the budget. There are things I would do differently, but I \ncommend my colleagues for offering serious solutions to serious \nproblems.\n  It has bothered me greatly that when Members of the House or Members \nof the Senate offer a serious budget, they are immediately attacked \nfrom a political point of view as if we can continue to ignore the \nproblems we face and simply make sound bites out of proposals that \nMembers of the Senate and the House care very seriously about.\n  We have to work together to put forward commonsense solutions that \nwill preserve these programs for future generations. This is not about \nending those entitlement programs. In fact, the reports that recently \ncame from nonpartisan sources tell us that both Medicare and Social \nSecurity will face significant shortfalls in the near future. \nTherefore, this is about taking care of those programs to see that they \nare available for those who need them in the future. I want to be able \nto tell every young person--when they ask, will I be able to get Social \nSecurity when I retire, I want that answer to be yes. If we don't deal \nwith the issues, the answer cannot honestly be yes.\n  In Congress, we have a solemn obligation to be good stewards of \ntaxpayer dollars. Our spending debate is oftentimes seen as something \nthat is philosophical or academic or more likely just a partisan \nargument, but the truth is that out-of-control borrowing and spending \nhas a very real consequence on the daily lives of every American and \ncertainly on the economy in which we live and operate. It is about \nwhether Americans can find a job, make payments on their homes and \nautomobiles, and whether their children will have a bright future and \nthe opportunity to pursue what we all call the American dream.\n  When we continue to fail to balance the budget, when we don't put \nourselves on the path toward a balanced budget, it means increasing \ninflation, with higher interest rates and an uncertain economy, which \nresults in fewer business investments and fewer jobs.\n  The greatest opportunity we have to improve the lives of Americans is \nto erect an environment where employers feel comfortable in investing \nin the future and create jobs so people can go back to work. When they \ngo back to work, they can put food on their family's table, they can \nsave for their children's education, they can save for their own \nretirement, and most importantly, every person in America will once \nagain be able to pursue the American dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would like to address a slightly \ndifferent topic, which is the continuing conference on the highway \nbill. We passed a very good highway bill in the Senate. We passed it on \ntime for the March 31 deadline when the highway trust fund was going to \nexpire. We passed it in bipartisan fashion, with 75 Senators supporting \nit. We passed it after it came unanimously out of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee with the support of the chairman, Senator Boxer, \nand the ranking member, Senator Inhofe. We passed it after a very open \nand transparent floor process in which around 40 amendments were agreed \nto either by vote or agreement, and it has the support of everybody \nfrom the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to labor, from the pavers to the \nenvironmentalists. So it is a good piece of legislation. It was done \nright.\n  The problem is that it is running up against a time deadline. As my \ndirector of transportation tells me, if we delay this too long, he has \nto start dropping projects off of this summer's highway work period \nbecause the time is slipping away as we dawdle here in Congress on this \nbill.\n  It is not just the Rhode Island Department of Transportation saying \nthis. Standard & Poor's Global Credit Portal has a report, \n``Increasingly Unpredictable Federal Funding Could Stall U.S. \nTransportation Infrastructure Projects.''\n  It says within the report:\n\n       As the construction season begins in the northern half of \n     the country, this continuing uncertainty in funding could \n     force states to delay projects rather than risk funding \n     changes or political gridlock come July.\n\n  So we need to get this done, and I have heard at this point that the \nHouse Republican conferees intend to hold the conference on this bill \nthrough late June, and if we do that, that will cost jobs in America, \nthat will cost jobs in Rhode Island, that will cost jobs around the \ncountry because our transportation directors are going to have to take \nwork scheduled for the summer and postpone it, and that is a very \nunfortunate turn of events. It has nothing to do with the merits.\n  Unfortunately, the House was not able to pass a highway bill of any \nkind, which is unfortunate because it is not the most complicated task. \nIt is something we have been doing for decades around here. They \ncouldn't get that done, and so what they have done now is gone to \nconference on the Senate bill without a bill of their own, and this \nappears to be causing delay. So I am here to urge that we all encourage \nthe House Members of the highway conference committee to expedite their \nwork as much as they can. Apparently there is a 2-week period that the \nHouse is taking off, and if it is delayed by 2 weeks so that Members \ncan go home, I don't think that is a profitable use of our time.\n  There is a great deal of loose talk around here about jobs. We have \neven had bills that didn't relate to jobs called jobs bills because of \ngimmickry in the title. But this is a real jobs bill. This is 3.9 \nmillion jobs for the country, and it is 9,000 jobs for Rhode Island, as \ncalculated in years of work--job years. We are just wasting that if we \ndon't get this done on time.\n  So if people really want to do something about jobs, they can get the \nhighway bill moved along rapidly so that the work can be done in this \nsummer work session.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the war in \nAfghanistan. I have spoken on the Senate floor many times over the last \nnumber of years about the war. I have done so because I believe the \nAmerican people and our servicemembers in the field deserve a policy \nworthy of their efforts and their sacrifice and a thorough examination \nof the issues at hand. I have done so also because when it comes to \nmatters of war, the Senate has an important responsibility to ask tough \nquestions of any administration.\n  I believe we are entering a critical phase in our engagement in \nAfghanistan which will have implications for our eventual drawdown of \ntroops in the year 2014.\n  Earlier this month the President spoke to us from Kabul on the new \nStrategic Partnership Agreement known by the acronym SPA. Of course, \nthis is an agreement with Afghanistan. He described a transition plan \nwhich focuses on protecting and promoting shared Democratic values, \nadvancing long-term security, reinforcing regional security and \ncooperation, social and economic development, and strengthening Afghan \ninstitutions and governance.\n  I agree with the general approach laid out in the Strategic \nPartnership Agreement, but I have several outstanding questions and \nconcerns regarding U.S. engagement in Afghanistan. I wish to describe \nsome of these concerns and lay out specific steps the administration \nshould take with respect to the war to ensure that U.S. security \ninterests and the tangible security, political, and economic gains in \nAfghanistan are, in fact, protected.\n  I have participated in more than 20 hearings on Afghanistan and \nPakistan with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. I have \npersonally chaired four hearings on aspects of our engagements in the \nregion. I have visited Afghanistan and Pakistan three times, most \nrecently in August 2011, with the Presiding Officer, Senator Bennet, \nalong with Senator Blumenthal and Senator Whitehouse. When we were \nthere, we met with, as I have done on other visits, U.S. military and \ncivilian leaders, as well as senior government officials in both \ncountries.\n  Through this engagement, I have sought to examine U.S. goals and \nprogress in this war within three broad areas: first, the formation of \nrepresentative political institutions; second, the overall security \nenvironment; and third, the development of key sectors in Afghan \nsociety, including education, health, the economy, and the well-being \nof women and girls. In examining these factors, it is clear to me that \na responsible drawdown of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan \nmust be concurrent with not only progress on security and an increase \nin well-trained Afghan national security forces but with a strong \ncommitment to a transparent political process in Afghanistan.\n  We should work to ensure that there will not be a crumbling of \ninstitutions similar to that seen prior to Afghanistan's civil war in \nthe 1990s. In fact, without representative political institutions, I am \nconcerned that the training of the Afghan national security forces \ncould, in fact, be counterproductive and that we would end up \ndeveloping a force that answers to a dysfunctional political system.\n  Politics and governing institutions matter a great deal, and there \nare tangible steps the United States can take to support Afghanistan's \npolitical development in the short term. Let me be clear. We should be \nunder no illusions that Afghanistan's political system will, nor \nnecessarily should, reflect our Western model developed over centuries. \nBut there are universal principles that should apply in Afghanistan, \nincluding the inclusion of all key political groups and transparency in \nelections and governance. In fact, the adoption of these universal \nprinciples is perhaps the only antidote to continued decades of \nconflict.\n  First, the 2014 transition to Afghan leadership will require the \nactive participation of the constellation of ethnic groups in \nAfghanistan. They will need to have some confidence in the political \nprocess or Afghanistan could very easily again descend into civil \nconflict, similar to that seen in the aftermath of the Soviet \nwithdrawal in the 1990s. The opposition represented in what was \nformerly known as the Northern Alliance will likely be among the most \nskeptical. The United States can play an important role in bringing the \ninterested parties together for dialog to identify areas of concern and \na path forward looking toward 2014 and beyond.\n  Second, Presidential elections are scheduled to take place in 2014. \nAccording to the Constitution, President Hamid Karzai is limited to two \nterms and should step down. President Karzai has seen his country \nthrough a very difficult and historic time. Afghanistan's elections--\nthe foundational act in a democratic system--have historically not met \ninternational standards and have established the basis for an \nunresponsive government, unresponsive government officials, and, \nunfortunately, widespread corruption. A peaceful transition of power in \nAfghanistan is not only good for the country and good for its \ndemocratic institution, it is vital to our own transition out of \nAfghanistan.\n  Third, Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission needs to become \na truly independent body. Currently, the President selects the \ncommissioners, creating the suspicion that the body is biased. In \naccordance with international standards, the commissioners should be \nselected by a body that reflects the broad consensus of the Afghan \npeople, not just the President. A statutory check on executive \nauthority is needed to ensure the impartiality of the body in the years \nto come and enhance public confidence in the electoral system overall.\n  Fourth, President Karzai has issued a Presidential decree which \nallows him to nominate the 5 national and 133 provincial commissioners \nof the Electoral Complaints Commission. This body also needs to be \nindependent from the executive branch to remove any perception of bias. \nDuring the last election, there was a lack of transparency in the \nhandling of these electoral complaints. Afghan authorities need to take \nsteps now to ensure that the national and provincial commissioners are \nfair and transparent in their work. As it stands now, the political \nopposition does not trust the Electoral Complaints Commission to \nequitably deal with inevitable disputes that emerge from the process.\n\n  Throughout this process, the United States should emphasize the \nimportance of international standards in the conduct of elections and \nstand ready to support a process that is based on those universally \naccepted principles. We know at the Bonn conference in 2011 Afghanistan \npledged--pledged--to strengthen and improve its electoral process. We \nmust hold them to that commitment. The United States should condition \nits aid in support of the administration of the 2014 election based on \nthese reforms. Let's send a very clear message: We will not be a party \nto funding the administration of an election similar to those conducted \nin the years 2009 and 2010. The administration must begin to act now. \nElectoral reforms take time to adopt and implement. The clock is \nticking.\n  While political challenges abound in Afghanistan, the Parliament has \nemerged as an important check on the executive and over the past \nseveral years has begun to exercise more of a voice in governance. We \nhave seen several examples in recent years where the Parliament has \nweighed in on important issues. Moreover, 27 percent of the Afghan \nParliamentarians are women--a stunning statistic compared to where we \nwere 10 years ago. The Parliament's upward trajectory is a promising \npillar of the democratization process, but more can be done. The United \nStates can play an important role in exposing Afghan Parliamentarians \nto legislative experiences from other and different developing \ndemocracies and the opportunity to meet their counterparts in other \nParliaments.\n  During our trip to Afghanistan last August, I and Senators \nWhitehouse, Bennet, and Blumenthal had the fortunate opportunity to \ntravel to five of\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\nthe ISAF regional commands. We saw firsthand the progress made by our \nairmen, soldiers, marines, and sailors on the ground. Due to their \nefforts, the enemy has lost territory and influence. According to the \nPentagon, the number of attacks by militants dropped in 2011 for the \nfirst time in 5 years.\n  There has been undeniable progress in pushing back the Taliban, but \nthese military gains are delicate and will be short-lived without an \nAfghan force that can assume more responsibility for security. I \ndiscussed these issues with LTG William Caldwell, the former commander \nof the NATO effort to train the Afghan forces. Lieutenant General \nCaldwell has been ably replaced by LTG Daniel Bolger. We have seen \nsignificant progress in the training and deployment of the Afghan \nSpecial Forces Units which, according to the Pentagon, have made \n``impressive strides towards becoming an independent and effective \nforce.'' We have also seen growing independence of the Afghan regular \nunits. As of the end of March, 13 ANA kandaks have been designated as \nable to operate independently with advisers. In September of 2011, \nthere was only one kandak with that designation. We have gone from 1 \nunit to 13 in a rather short period of time, so we know there is \nprogress.\n  But despite this progress, however, challenges in training the Afghan \nNational Security Forces, in fact, remain.\n  First, the Afghan security forces still do not have an elite Pashtun \nofficer corps and only 6.6 percent of the enlisted recruits are \nsouthern Pashtuns. This is a significant shortfall that must be \naddressed if the security forces are going to develop the cohesion \nnecessary to ably represent the ethnic makeup of the country and \naddress ongoing security challenges in the south.\n  Second, NATO currently requires 2,774 trainers to conduct its \ntraining mission but faces a shortfall of 440 positions. While this \ncapability has improved, the training shortfall remains stubbornly high \nand has an adverse impact on NATO's ability to adequately train the \nAfghans in a timely manner. Our NATO partners can and should do more to \nhelp address this deficit.\n  Finally, I have concerns about the long-term pricetag associated with \nthe Afghan National Security Forces. While investing in these forces \nwill be a fraction--a small fraction--of the $100 billion to $120 \nbillion a year currently spent in Afghanistan by our government, we \nmust work to ensure that the force is right-sized to the security \nchallenges in the country and that there are strict accountability \nmeasures in place to ensure that the Afghan National Security Forces \nabide by all U.S. standards in terms of human rights and the Geneva \nConventions.\n  While we have made progress on the battlefield, the Taliban and \nterrorist groups like the Haqqani network remain capable of spectacular \nattacks across the country and, as we know, in Kabul, the capital. \nThirty-four percent of the attacks by militants took place in Regional \nCommand East, an area where the Haqqani network is most active. I \nbelieve that the Afghan National Security Forces will be capable by \n2014 of providing security in much of the country, but we need to \nmaintain a capability to attack and disrupt terrorist groups in the \ncountry that seek to project force outside of Afghanistan's borders and \ndo harm to U.S. interests.\n  Central to the political effort is the ongoing effort to reconcile \nwith the Taliban. I have a high degree of skepticism that this can \nwork, at least in the short term. The Taliban has shown little interest \nin compromise, and recent events show that this group is willing to \ntarget civilians and to conduct devastating terror attacks against the \nAfghan people. Ultimately, there does need to be a political end to \nthis conflict, as there is in all wars. But how we get there is \nimportant, and the administration must set clear guidelines. In the \nmeantime, I support maintaining pressure on the Taliban until it \naccepts the Afghan Constitution and agrees to peacefully participate in \nthe political process.\n  During our visit to Afghanistan last August, we also had the honor to \nmeet with several of Pennsylvania's servicemembers. Since 2001, \nPennsylvania has lost 80--80--servicemembers, and 589 have been \nwounded. These courageous individuals gave what President Lincoln \ncalled the ``last full measure of devotion'' to their country. We owe \nthem a debt of gratitude, and we owe a debt of gratitude, as well, to \ntheir families and to veterans returning from the field. I, like a lot \nof our colleagues, have visited with our wounded warriors and their \nfamilies at Bethesda, Walter Reed, and other places, and we keep them \nin our thoughts and prayers every day. The courage and commitment of \nthese young Americans is hard to describe in a speech and it is hard to \nillustrate, but it does demonstrate the best of who we are as a \ncountry, and we see that every day.\n  We know in the area of development as well, there are enormous \nchallenges across a lot of sectors in Afghanistan that will likely \nextend for years. Prior to the civil war, Afghanistan was one of the \npoorest countries in the world. After decades of war, Afghanistan's \nminimal infrastructure was destroyed. The challenges today to \nsignificant progress are indeed substantial. Government corruption \nobstructs any serious effort at rule of law and any basic respect for \ncontracts, which is a fundamental element of business growth. The \nprecarious security environment also serves to deter any international \ninvestment. Poppy growth, fueled by the heroin trade, remains rampant. \nWomen continue to be subjected to unspeakable violence and \ndiscrimination across the country.\n  Amid these daunting challenges, the United States should prioritize a \nfew key areas for developmental progress, so as to mitigate the \nchallenges leading to 2014.\n  The foundational basis for development in any society is the \neducational system. We know that in 2002 only 900,000 students were \nenrolled in school. Just 9 years later, 2011, more than 8 million \nchildren were enrolled in school, 35 percent of whom were girls. This \nwill have a long-term, long-lasting effect on Afghan society, and the \nUnited States should be proud of this element of our engagement and \nshould seek to protect those gains. I and other Senators, when we saw \nthis, were pleased to see that the partnership agreement prioritized \nthe access to, and the enhanced quality of, education.\n  We have also seen significant strides in the field of health care. In \n2002, only 9 percent of Afghans had access to basic health services. \nToday that number has grown to 64 percent of the population. More \nchildren live to see their fifth birthday than ever before in \nAfghanistan. Health care too was emphasized in the agreement that the \nPresident talked about recently, and it focused on basic health \nservices and specialized care for women and children.\n  These are real achievements, but they are very fragile.\n  Also fragile are the overall gains made for women and girls in \nAfghanistan. I was privileged, as I know Senator Bennet, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator Blumenthal were privileged, to meet with a \ngroup of Afghan women leaders during our August 2011 trip. We were all \ntremendously inspired by their determination to continue to fight for \nwomen's rights in the face of blatant oppression and violence.\n  In 2010, I cochaired a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on \nthe plight of women in Afghanistan. We must preserve the progress that \nwomen and girls have achieved in the past 10 years. Empowered women \nhave an immensely positive impact on their communities, investing \nresources in education, health care, and other basic needs. They also \ndissuade young men from turning to militancy. In 2011, Secretary \nClinton told a group of Afghan women--and I am quoting--``We will not \nabandon you, we will stand with you always.'' We as a nation have an \nobligation to stand by that commitment to the women and girls of \nAfghanistan. It is not only the right thing to do, it is in our \nnational security interest to do this as well.\n  I agreed, like many did, with the findings of a 2011 report by the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, which made three main \nrecommendations with respect to U.S. assistance to Afghanistan. First, \nit called for a multiyear civil assistance strategy for the country. \nSecond, the report called for a ``Reevaluation of the performance of \nstabilization programs in conflict zones.'' Third, it called for a \nfocus on sustainability. The report argued that all U.S. assistance \nprojects should meet three basic criteria: They should be ``necessary, \nachievable, and sustainable.'' This simple concept is critically\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\nimportant. A great deal of funding and resources has been expended in \nAfghanistan, much of it on important and necessary programs. But with \nthe withdrawal of international troops and a commensurate decrease of \nfunds going into the country, there is a distinct possibility that \nAfghanistan could experience an economic depression which could have \ndramatic security implications. There is time now to address this \nproblem by conducting a careful review of all U.S. assistance to the \ncountry. Those programs that are not sustainable should be phased out. \nWhile this may have painful short-term consequences, it will be better \nfor the long-term viability of the Afghan economy.\n  The United States and the international community should consistently \nreemphasize that while there will be a transition in 2014, this does \nnot mean the wholesale withdrawal and disengagement from Afghanistan. \nThe Strategic Partnership Agreement has helped send this message. The \nUnited States will still have significant security concerns in the \ncountry and should maintain a strong counterterrorism capability. Work \nwill still remain in providing support and assistance to the Afghan \nNational Security Forces. The international community can also continue \nto play a key role in helping Afghan society to develop.\n  All of this falls squarely within our national security interests, \nand all parties in Afghanistan and in the region should hear this \nmessage.\n  Finally, I will end with a few comments about Pakistan. I continue to \nbelieve that Pakistan is too important to U.S. interests for us to \nsever ties or significantly diminish the relationship. We know we have \nhad trouble in our relationship, but we know a couple of other things \nas well. Pakistan has lots of nuclear weapons. It is a hotbed of \nIslamic extremism. It also provides the best logistics routes for our \nsupplies headed into and out of Afghanistan, and Pakistan will play an \nessential role in ensuring the transition to a peaceful Afghanistan.\n  Despite the seemingly insurmountable challenges and at times \ndivergent strategic interests, we must continue to find a way forward \nand work together where our interests do overlap. Pakistan has made \nsignificant sacrifices in countering extremism within its borders, \nmostly against forces that represent a direct threat to the state \nitself. It has yet to go after the Haqqani network in a serious way. It \ncontinues to provide a haven for the Quetta Shura Taliban, which is the \nheadquarters of those seeking to destabilize the Afghan State.\n  Pakistan has not taken adequate measures to confront the \nproliferation and trade in illicit bombmaking materials which have \nkilled thousands of its own citizens and hundreds and hundreds of our \nU.S. troops across the border in Afghanistan. Taking all of this into \naccount, there is a significant element of Pakistani society that we \ncannot consider allies. This is why I strongly support the \nconditionality built into U.S. assistance to Pakistan, which requires \nthat the Pakistani authorities make significant progress in countering \nterrorism and attacking IED networks. If they do not take steps to \naddress these issues, this assistance will be significantly cut, and it \nshould be.\n  For more than 2 years I have worked to address this critical problem \nof improvised explosive devices, which are responsible for the majority \nof deaths and injuries among our servicemembers in Afghanistan. The \nprimary explosive ingredient in IEDs used in southern Afghanistan is \ncalcium ammonium nitrate, CAN. It is also used as a fertilizer and is \nproduced in factories in Pakistan. I have been adamant that the \nPakistani Government must significantly increase its commitment to \nregulating the bomb components and preventing them from being smuggled \nacross the border into Afghanistan.\n  In June 2010 I introduced S. Res. 570, which called for an increased \neffort by Pakistan to effectively monitor and regulate the manufacture, \nsale, transport, and use of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in order to \nprevent its entrance into Afghanistan. The resolution passed the Senate \nunanimously on June 28, 2010.\n  During our recent visit to Pakistan, I discussed this issue with \nseveral senior government officials, as did Senator Bennet, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator Blumenthal. The Pakistani leaders expressed an \ninterest in countering the proliferation of bomb components and \npresented to us an action plan for interdicting these materials. \nHowever, the proof of their commitment has yet to be seen through the \nimplementation of this plan.\n  In December of 2011, I introduced an amendment to the National \nDefense Authorization Act that would require the Secretary of Defense \nto certify that Pakistan is demonstrating a continuing commitment to \nand making significant efforts toward the implementation of a strategy \nto counter IEDs. This provision, unfortunately, was removed during the \nconference committee. The final version of the bill requires the \nSecretary of Defense to produce a report on Pakistan's efforts to \ncounter IEDs.\n  I continue to believe combating the threat posed by IEDs is one area \nwhere our interests do in fact overlap with Pakistan. At this time of \nfrayed relations, IEDs continue to kill Pakistanis, Afghans, and, of \ncourse, Americans on the battlefield. By working together against this \ncommon threat, we can begin to rebuild confidence in the relationship \nand make progress toward more vexing strategic issues that affect our \ncountries.\n  In September of 2010, I gave a speech on Afghanistan and Pakistan at \nthe Army War College in Carlisle, PA. Former Secretary of War Elihu \nRoot believed that the Army War College was established in 1903, ``not \nto promote war, but to preserve peace by intelligent and adequate \npreparation to repel aggression.''\n  That is what Secretary Root said all those years ago. As we look \nforward to 2014 and a long-term relationship with the people of \nAfghanistan, all of our support for representative political \ninstitutions, improving the security environment, and Afghan social and \neconomic development are intelligent and adequate preparation to repel \naggression.\n  The next year and a half will be very consequential. If the United \nStates works to strengthen representative institutions, bolsters the \nAfghan security forces, and maintains sustainable development \nassistance, all will pay dividends for our peace and security for years \nto come.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last month, the Senate came together and \npassed the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of \n2012. Our legislation takes some much needed steps to help the most \nvulnerable victims of domestic and sexual violence, and it was passed \nwith significant bipartisan support. The Leahy-Crapo Violence Against \nWomen Act was an example of what we accomplish when we put politics \naside and work to find real solutions to real problems facing real \nAmericans.\n  Few laws have had a greater impact on the lives of women in this \ncountry than the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). By shining a light \non the insidious crimes of domestic and sexual violence, this law(s \ninitial passage nearly 20 years ago sent a powerful message that \nviolence against women would no longer be tolerated. The days of \ndismissing these crimes with a joke or a shrug were over. The \nresources, training and law enforcement tools provided by VAWA \ntransformed the criminal justice and community-based response to abuse. \nIt gave support and protection to the victims who for generations had \nbeen blamed, humiliated and ignored.\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\n  With each reauthorization of this landmark law, Congress has \nrepeatedly shown its bipartisan commitment to ending domestic and \nsexual violence by building on the protections in the initial \nlegislation and expanding the reach of VAWA to meet the remaining unmet \nneeds of victims.\n  The bill that I introduced with Senator Crapo, and which passed the \nSenate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority just last month, is \nbased on the successful tradition of preserving and enhancing \nprotections. It is based on months of work with survivors, advocates, \nand law enforcement officers from all across the country and from \nacross the political spectrum. We purposely avoided proposals that were \nextreme or divisive and selected only those proposals that law \nenforcement and survivors and the professionals who work with crime \nvictims every day told us were essential. That is why the provisions in \nthe Senate bill have such widespread support. More than 1,000 Federal, \nstate, and local organizations have endorsed it, including service \nproviders, law enforcement, religious organizations and many, many \nmore.\n  The inclusive, open process of drafting this legislation is also why \nthe Senate bill always had strong bipartisan support. It was a \nbipartisan effort from the beginning with eight Republican Senators \ncosponsoring the bill and seven more joining Democratic and Independent \nSenators in voting to pass the bill. We were able to move able to move \nto the bill without a filibuster, to consider amendments, which were \nrejected, and to pass the bill with almost 70 votes. We adopted a bill \nof which the Senate can be proud, because it serves the interests of \nthe American people while improving support and protection for victims \nof domestic violence and sexual assault.\n  I am alarmed the other body--the House--has chosen a different path. \nInstead of building on the broad bipartisan support for the Senate-\npassed Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, Republican members \nof the House Judiciary Committee last week took up a bill, H.R.4970, \nthat they crafted in back rooms without the input of those who dedicate \ntheir lives to helping victims. This afternoon the House Republican \nleadership brought that same bill to the floor, with only minor \nmodifications that do little to respond to the urgent concerns of \nvictims, and is forcing an up or down vote while blocking any attempts \nto modify the legislation in response to the concerns raised by victims \nand service providers around the country. Their legislation not only \nfails to include the critical improvements in the Senate bill that \nwould increase protections for Native-American women, gay and lesbian \nvictims, battered immigrant women, and victims on college campuses or \nvictims in subsidized housing, it actually rolls back existing \nprotections leaving many victims more vulnerable to sexual and domestic \nabuse. Among the most troubling provisions are those that drastically \nundercut important, longstanding protections that are vital to the \nsafety and protection of battered immigrant victims.\n  As a result of this misguided effort, the House bill is strongly \nopposed by many of the leading organizations that know these issues \nbest, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the \nNational Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Alliance to \nEnd Sexual Violence, the American Bar Association, the YWCA, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and many, many more.\n  The thousands of local advocates and service providers around the \ncountry that make up the National Network to End Domestic Violence \nwarned in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee that H.R. 4970 \nwould (weaken, rather than enhance, protections for victims of domestic \nviolence.( Sue Else, the President of that organization, lamented:\n\n       This is an unprecedented departure from this effective \n     law(s original intent. Thousands of victim advocates across \n     the country recommended substantial improvements for the \n     latest reauthorization, and the U.S. Senate accepted those \n     recommendations in a bipartisan way. It is alarming that the \n     House Judiciary Committee has not done the same.\n\n  The American Bar Association has stated:\n\n       Unlike the recently passed Senate bill (S. 1925), which \n     reflects discussions with more than 2,000 advocates and \n     experts across the country, H.R. 4970 represents a retreat \n     from the fight against domestic and sexual violence. It fails \n     to add critical improvements to address the needs of \n     underserved populations, like victims who are members of \n     faith communities and those who are denied services because \n     of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and strips \n     critical protections from existing law.\n\n  The YWCA, the largest provider of services for battered women in the \ncountry, calls the House bill a ``dangerous bill that puts the lives of \nmillions of women across the nation at risk.'' These organizations \nrepresent those on the front lines against domestic and sexual \nviolence. They are motivated by their desire to see all victims get the \nhelp they need.\n  Likewise, a number of faith-based organizations, such as the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, the National Association of \nEvangelicals, and nearly 20 other religious institutions have joined a \nletter stating that they are ``deeply troubled'' by the ``many \nprovisions [in the House bill] that actually would roll back \nprotections in current law for battered non-citizens, making them more \nvulnerable and, in some cases, endangering their lives.''\n  House Republicans are headed down the wrong path. In fact, when the \nSenate rejected their alternative to our bipartisan bill last month by \na strong bipartisan vote of only 37 in favor and 62 opposed, I had \nhoped that would end the partisanship and the gamesmanship and we would \nbe able to move forward together to reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act. I was encouraged to see the lead sponsor of the Republican \nalternative, the distinguished senior Senator from Texas, do just that \nand join with us to support the bipartisan Senate bill upon final \npassage. I commended Senator Hutchison for doing so. Likewise, we were \nbuoyed by the support on final passage by the Senior Senator from \nArizona, the Senators from Tennessee, Senator Coates of Indiana, \nSenator Hoeven of North Dakota, Senator Portman of Ohio and Senator \nVitter of Louisiana.\n\n  Despite all this, House Republicans seem determined to destroy this \nbipartisan effort. As evidenced by the vote they are forcing today, \nthey are intent on proceeding with their bill to roll back victim \nprotections and insistent that it be done without the opportunity to \nconsider the better, Senate-passed bill or, for that matter, any other \namendments to their ill-conceived effort to undercut the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  The House Republican bill not only fails to protect more victims, but \nactually weakens existing protections. I fear that it puts more lives \nat risk.\n  In its Statement of Administration Policy, the Obama administration \ncorrectly opposes the House bill, H.R. 4970, as a measure that ``would \nundermine the core principles of the Violence Against Women Act.'' It \nnotes the House Republican bill ``retreats'' from the progress \nrepresented by the protections included in the bipartisan Senate-passed \nbill and ``weakens'' critical protections for victims. The House \nprovisions ``senselessly remove existing legal protections, undermine \nVAWA's core purpose of protecting victims of sexual assault and \ndomestic violence, frustrate important law enforcement objectives, and \njeopardize victims by placing them directly in harm's way.'' It \nconcludes with a threatened veto recommendation since the House measure \n``rolls back existing law and removes long-standing protections for \nvictims of domestic violence and sexual assault.'' Never before, in \neither Republican or Democratic administrations, Republican- or \nDemocrat-controlled Houses or Senates, has the Violence Against Women \nAct been used to increase the dangers to women and so consciously \ndisregard the unmet needs of our most vulnerable victims. Never before.\n  Last week the White House Advisor on Violence Against Women noted \nthat the House Republican bill ``adds burdensome, counter-productive \nrequirements that compromise the ability of service providers to reach \nvictims, fails to adequately protect Tribal victims, lacks important \nprotection and services for LGBT victims, weakens resources for victims \nliving in subsidized housing, and eliminates important improvements to \naddress dating violence and sexual assault on college campuses.'' She \nis right.\n  The closed process by which the House Republican leadership insisted\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nits ill-conceived bill be rubberstamped breaks House Republican \npromises to allow amendments and proceed by an open amendment process. \nThe House Republican bill's roll back of protections breaks the promise \nof the Violence Against Women Act to protect victims of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault. Never before has the Violence Against \nWomen Act been used to increase the dangers to women and so consciously \ndisregarded the unmet needs of our most vulnerable victims.\n  A recent New York Times editorial entitled ``Backwards on Domestic \nViolence'' had it right: ``House members on both sides of the aisle who \nare serious about combating domestic violence must work to defeat this \natrocious bill.'' That sentiment was reinforced by a recent Los Angeles \nTimes editorial which stated: ``Republicans in the House should drop \ntheir attempts to undermine the Violence Against Women Act and instead \nmove swiftly to reauthorize and strengthen the existing program, as the \nSenate has already done.''\n  Today The Washington Post reports on another study by Human Rights \nWatch documenting sexual violence and harassment of female farmworkers. \nCongress should not be turning its backs to these battered and abused \nwomen. We should be moving forward promptly to adopt the provisions of \nthe Senate-passed bill to protect the most vulnerable among us, women \nwho are doubly victimized by abusers and by the fear that they have no \nrecourse.\n  I thank Senators Murray, Menendez and Shaheen for their strong \nstatements in support of the Senate-passed Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act yesterday. I am disheartened by the decision of the \nHouse Republican leadership to try to push through their destructive \nbill over the clear objections of those very victims it is supposed to \nserve. I urge the supporters of the bipartisan Senate bill to continue \nour efforts to see that this carefully crafted legislation that meets \nthe needs of so many people is finally passed into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Statement \nof Administrative Policy, the editorials from the New York Times and \nthe Los Angeles Times, and the letters to which I have referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n     H.R. 4970--Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012\n\n          (Rep. Adams, R FL, and 40 cosponsors, May 15, 2012)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4970, a bill that \n     would undermine the core principles of the Violence Against \n     Women Act (VAWA). VAWA is a landmark piece of legislation \n     that first passed the Congress in 1994 and has twice been \n     reauthorized with overwhelming bipartisan support, each time \n     with important improvements to strengthen VAWA. The Act \n     transformed the Nation's response to violence against women \n     and brought critically needed resources to States and local \n     communities to address these crimes.\n       H.R. 4970 retreats from this forward progress by failing to \n     include several critical provisions that are part of the \n     Senate-passed VAWA reauthorization bill. For instance, H.R. \n     4970 fails to provide for concurrent special domestic \n     violence criminal jurisdiction by tribal authorities over \n     non-Indians, and omits clarification of tribal courts' full \n     civil jurisdiction regarding certain protection orders over \n     non-Indians. Given that three out of five Native American \n     women experience domestic violence in their lifetime, these \n     omissions in H.R. 4970 are unacceptable. The bill also fails \n     to include language that would prohibit discrimination \n     against LGBT victims in VAWA grant programs. No sexual \n     assault or domestic violence victim should be beaten, hurt, \n     or killed because they could not access needed support, \n     assistance, and protection. In addition, H.R. 4970 does not \n     include important improvements to the Clery Act found in the \n     Senate-passed bill that would address the high rates of \n     dating violence and sexual assault experienced by young \n     people in college and other higher education institutions. \n     The bill also weakens critical new provisions in the Senate-\n     passed bill that would improve safety for victims living in \n     subsidized housing.\n       H.R. 4970 also takes direct aim at immigrant victims of \n     domestic violence and sexual assault by removing critical \n     protections currently in law. H.R. 4970 allows abusers to be \n     notified when a victim files a VAWA self-petition for relief, \n     and it eliminates the path to citizenship for U visa \n     holders--victims of serious crimes such as torture, rape, and \n     domestic violence--who are cooperating with law enforcement \n     in the investigation or prosecution of these crimes. These \n     proposals senselessly remove existing legal protections, \n     undermine VAWA's core purpose of protecting victims of sexual \n     assault and domestic violence, frustrate important law \n     enforcement objectives, and jeopardize victims by placing \n     them directly in harm's way.\n       The Administration urges the House to find common ground \n     with the bipartisan Senate-passed bill and consider and pass \n     legislation that will protect all victims. H.R. 4970 rolls \n     back existing law and removes long-standing protections for \n     victims of domestic violence and sexual assault--crimes that \n     predominately affect women. If the President is presented \n     with H.R. 4970, his senior advisors would recommend that he \n     veto the bill.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Network To End\n\n\n                                            Domestic Violence,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2012.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     House Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Conyers,\n     Ranking Member, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers: The \n     National Network to End Domestic Violence, which represents \n     all of our nation's state and territorial domestic violence \n     and dual domestic violence-sexual assault coalitions, their \n     2,000 member programs and the millions of victims they serve \n     every year, opposes HR 4970, a bill introduced by \n     Representatives Sandy Adams (R FL) and Eric Cantor (R VA) to \n     reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).\n       VAWA was initially passed in 1994 and subsequently \n     reauthorized in 2000 and 2005 to meet the needs of victims. \n     HR 4970 fails to meet, and in fact, weakens, rather than \n     enhances, protections for victims of domestic violence. The \n     network of survivors and advocates who work on a daily basis \n     with courts, law enforcement, prosecutors, shelters, academic \n     and medical institutions need VAWA's tools--its laws and \n     programs--to help keep victims safe. All of us are alarmed \n     that HR 4970 takes the wrong direction and will be dangerous \n     for victims.\n       We are particularly concerned with provisions that erode \n     critical safety measures for immigrant victims seeking safety \n     and justice, fail to fix a jurisdictional issue for victims \n     on tribal lands who are beaten by non-tribal perpetrators \n     with near impunity, and turn a blind eye to lesbian, gay and \n     other marginalized communities. If enacted, this bill would \n     jeopardize victims' lives and embolden perpetrators of \n     violence. HR 4970 also wrongly grows bureaucracy through the \n     costly and excessive auditing of small nonprofits. Resources \n     would be better spent training and supporting those important \n     organizations that provide these lifesaving services and \n     advocacy. And finally, the emergency housing transfer section \n     in this bill, which is intended to help victims flee violent, \n     dangerous perpetrators without becoming homeless, is weakened \n     by allowing the adoption of transfer policies to be \n     ``voluntary'' by owners, managers and public housing \n     agencies.\n       The U.S. House of Representatives has the opportunity to \n     develop and pass a bipartisan VAWA that meets the needs of \n     victims. HR 4970 is not such a bill. We look forward to \n     working with the House Judiciary Committee and all Members of \n     Congress to develop a bill that is reflective of the needs of \n     all victims.

John Conyers,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers: On behalf \n     of the undersigned faith leaders and faith-based \n     organizations concerned about victims of domestic violence, \n     human trafficking, sexual assault, and other forms of \n     violence, we write to express our concerns about Title VIII \n     of H.R. 4970, legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against \n     Women Act (VAWA), which we understand the House Committee on \n     the Judiciary plans to mark up tomorrow.\n       Faith communities are on the front lines, identifying \n     victims, providing refuge, referring victims and their \n     families for services, and offering hope and healing. In \n     times of crisis, victims often turn to faith communities and \n     leaders for support and moral guidance because they see \n     places of worship as a sanctuary from the horrors they have \n     experienced. Through our ministry with victims, we have \n     learned that abusers often exploit a victim's immigration \n     status, leaving individuals extremely vulnerable and afraid \n     to report the abuse to law enforcement, assist in the \n     prosecution of crimes, and seek services.\n       Congress created VAWA in 1994, and it has voted twice since \n     then to reauthorize the law, each time with broad bipartisan \n     support. However, we are deeply troubled by Title VIII of \n     H.R. 4970, as introduced. Title VIII contains many provisions \n     that actually would roll back protections in current law for \n     battered non-citizens, making them more vulnerable and, in \n     some cases, endangering their lives. We urge you to strike \n     these provisions from the bill before the measure is brought \n     before the full House of Representatives for a vote.\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\n       VAWA is an effective tool in combatting the devastating \n     crimes of domestic violence and providing lifesaving programs \n     and services.

We urge members of the committee to \n     oppose the bill.\n       VAWA has been the single most effective federal effort to \n     respond to the epidemic of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault and stalking in this country. The \n     act has ensured that legal and social services are available \n     to survivors, and that law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, \n     attorneys and advocates are well-trained and equipped with \n     cutting-edge resources to effectively address these crimes in \n     their own communities.\n       Reauthorization of VAWA is critical, providing Congress \n     with the opportunity to amend the act in order to combat \n     domestic and sexual violence more effectively. For example, \n     in 2000, Congress created the Legal Assistance to Victims \n     grant program. It also created the U visa for immigrants who \n     are victims of serious crimes and who have cooperated with \n     authorities in the prosecution of the perpetrator, and it \n     authorized funding for increased protection of older \n     individuals and individuals with disabilities. And in 2005, \n     it became unlawful to deny an individual housing assistance \n     simply because the individual is a victim of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking. \n     Congress also created a new grant program to improve court \n     responses to these crimes.\n       H.R. 4970 does not continue this tradition of improvement. \n     Unlike the recently passed Senate bill (S. 1925), which \n     reflects discussions with more than 2,000 advocates and \n     experts across the country, H.R. 4970 represents a retreat \n     from the fight against domestic and sexual violence. It fails \n     to add critical improvements to address the needs of \n     underserved populations, like victims who are members of \n     faith communities and those who are denied services because \n     of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and strips \n     critical protections from existing law.\n       The provisions of H.R. 4970 that significantly undermine \n     protections available to vulnerable immigrant victims of \n     violence are of particular concern. Before enactment of VAWA, \n     abusive U.S. Citizens and Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) \n     were able to use the immigration laws as a mechanism to \n     further abuse and control their immigrant spouses and \n     children. Perpetrators of domestic violence routinely would \n     thwart, or threaten to thwart, the visa petitioning process. \n     In creating a special application process for battered \n     spouses and children of U.S. Citizens and LPRs, lawmakers \n     recognized that many victims of domestic abuse were \n     unwittingly victimized by the immigration system as well.\n       The current VAWA green card application process involves a \n     ``self-petition,'' so that the abuser is not involved at all \n     in the process and prohibits the government from releasing \n     information about the existence of a VAWA immigration case to \n     the abuser or others. H.R. 4970 removes those critical \n     protections. A forced choice between deportation or safety \n     from an abusive spouse or trafficker is the precise evil that \n     the original self-petitioning provisions of the VAWA were \n     intended to eliminate. H.R. 4970 creates obstacles for \n     immigrant victims seeking to report crimes and increases the \n     danger to victims by eliminating important confidentiality \n     provisions.\n       Because it fails to improve upon our nation's response to \n     domestic violence and sexual assault by ensuring that all \n     populations are protected and in fact rolls back critical \n     protections in existing law, the ABA urges you to oppose H.R. \n     4970. VAWA is a critical tool in the arsenal to address \n     domestic and sexual violence, and it must be improved during \n     this reauthorization process to address the needs of all \n     victims and hold more offenders accountable.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas M. Susman,\n     Director, Governmental Affairs Office.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 7, 2012.\n       Dear Representative: As the largest provider of battered \n     women's services in the United States, with over 1300 \n     locations in 47 states, the YWCA is deeply invested in the \n     safety and health of all women. The YWCA serves over half a \n     million women each year through its anti-violence programs, \n     providing much needed access for victims of violence to 24-\n     hour crisis hotlines, emergency shelter, counseling services, \n     legal assistance, child care, economic empowerment programs \n     and transitional housing. The YWCA strongly opposes any \n     legislation that puts victims' lives at risk, and as such, \n     opposes H.R. 4970 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women \n     Act (VAWA) introduced by Rep. Sandy Adams (R-FL).\n       For nearly 18 years, VAWA has provided a national, \n     streamlined response to address domestic violence, sexual \n     assault, dating violence and stalking. H.R. 4970 cuts back on \n     critical provisions outlined in S. 1925, passed last month, \n     that protect some of the most vulnerable women in our \n     communities, and as a result, is a dangerous bill that puts \n     the lives of millions of women across the nation at risk.\n       Under H.R. 4970, immigrant women will be required to \n     conduct interviews for U-visa petitions in person, which does \n     not take into consideration the unfortunate reality of many \n     victims of violence where their movement is strictly limited \n     or closely monitored by their abusers. In addition, H.R. 4970 \n     would eliminate key confidentially measures by allowing USCIS \n     officers to notify and interview the abusers. Not only will \n     this keep immigrant victims from reporting abuse, but it will \n     put their lives at risk if they do proceed to apply for a U-\n     visa. Studies indicate that the two most heightened periods \n     of danger for victims of abuse are when they are pregnant and \n     when they decide to leave an abusive situation--disregarding \n     the importance of confidentiality and informing the abuser of \n     the victims' intent to leave will undoubtedly lead to greater \n     danger for the very people that this bill purports to assist.\n       H.R. 4970 disregards the epidemic rates of violence in \n     Indian Country by allowing batterers to avoid prosecution on \n     Tribal lands. By doing so, the bill fails to hold \n     perpetrators of violence accountable for their actions and \n     sends a clear message to Native victims of violence to remain \n     silent and endure abuse. Without explicitly addressing the \n     issue of accountability, Native victims will continue to \n     remain fearful of reporting crimes of abuse. H.R. 4970 also \n     strips all support for LGBT victims of abuse, claiming that \n     they are not the `right' victims. The YWCA supports all women \n     and victims of abuse regardless of sexual orientation, \n     immigration status, or race, and does not stand for isolating \n     entire subsets of the community that face unique barriers to \n     accessing services. By excluding the LGBT community in the \n     bill, H.R. 4970 it prevents providers from serving ALL women, \n     and no one should be denied help based on their sexual \n     orientation.\n       H.R. 4970 fails to provide inclusive provisions that \n     address the unique needs of underserved communities, which \n     would in turn endanger the lives of millions of women across \n     the nation. The YWCA supports legislation that is trauma \n     informed, victim centered, and evidence based, and is opposed \n     to any provisions that force victims to negotiate their \n     safety when seeking assistance from abusive situations.\n       In short, we urge you to oppose H.R. 4970.\n       Please contact Desiree Hoffman, Director of Advocacy and \n     Policy at dhoffman@ywca.org or Qudsia Jafree, Field and \n     Policy Coordinator at qjafree@ywca.org should you have \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Desiree Hoffman,\n     YWCA USA, Director of Advocacy and Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                     Backward on Domestic Violence\n\n       In an all-too-rare show of bipartisanship, 15 Senate \n     Republicans joined with the Democratic majority last month to \n     reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, the landmark 1994 \n     law that is key to efforts against domestic violence, sexual \n     assault and stalking.\n       Unfortunately, the lopsided 68-to-31 Senate vote halted \n     G.O.P. opponents only temporarily. The House Judiciary \n     Committee last week approved its version of the \n     reauthorization bill, which not only omits improvements the \n     Senate bill made to the law but also removes existing \n     protections for immigrant women, putting them at greater risk \n     of domestic and sexual abuse.\n       The Senate's measure ensures that victims are not denied \n     services because they are gay or transgender. It also strives \n     to ensure that domestic violence crimes committed by non-\n     Indian men in tribal communities are prosecuted. The Senate \n     bill also would modestly\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\n     expand the availability of special U-visas for undocumented \n     immigrants who are victims of domestic violence. That move \n     was supported by law enforcement to encourage victims to come \n     forward and testify against their abusers.\n       The regressive House alternative removes these and other \n     improvements, including new protections for students on \n     college campuses. The House measure would eliminate a \n     confidentiality requirement in current law that protects the \n     identity of immigrant women who file domestic violence \n     complaints against a spouse who is a citizen or legal \n     resident and allows the women to apply for legal status on \n     their own.\n       House Republicans claim there is a big fraud problem in \n     this area, but there is no hard evidence of that. And their \n     plan to end the centralized handling of these issues by a \n     Vermont-based office would undermine the government's ability \n     to detect untruthful stories.\n       House members on both sides of the aisle who are serious \n     about combating domestic violence must work to defeat this \n     atrocious bill. If that fails, the Senate will need to insist \n     on fixing it during the reconciliation process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From latimes.com, May 15, 2012]\n\n            Partisanship and the Violence Against Women Act\n\n       The House needs to reauthorize the law, without limits, as \n     it has in the past, so Republicans can demonstrate that \n     helping battered women is more important than political \n     games.\n       The political climate in Congress is so noxious these days \n     that even a law that originally passed with overwhelming \n     bipartisan support because it provided much-needed help to \n     abused women is now a partisan issue. That's shameful. \n     Republicans in the House should drop their attempts to \n     undermine the Violence Against Women Act and instead move \n     swiftly to reauthorize and strengthen the existing program, \n     as the Senate has already done.\n       First enacted in 1994, the law has been renewed twice \n     without a fight. Last week, however, some of the same GOP \n     lawmakers who once endorsed the law retreated, voting in \n     committee to strip out provisions designed to protect \n     immigrants. Under VAWA as it has long existed, if an \n     immigrant married to a U.S. citizen or a green-card holder--\n     and therefore eligible to stay in the country permanently--\n     can show evidence of abuse, he or she may file independently \n     without having to rely on the abusive spouse. VAWA's gender-\n     neutral protections apply to legal and illegal immigrants and \n     allow the victim to file confidentially.\n       Confidentiality is crucial. As the Republican-led House \n     Judiciary Committee noted in its 2005 report to reauthorize \n     VAWA and expand protections, without such guarantees, an \n     abuser could try to derail a spouse's green-card application \n     or push to have him or her deported. A battered woman whose \n     application depends on her abusive husband certainly might \n     think twice about filing if she knew her abuser would be \n     notified that she was seeking help without him.\n       Eliminating the confidentiality provision is one of several \n     changes House Republicans would like to make to weaken the \n     law. They argue that the changes are necessary to combat \n     fraud, in which immigrants falsely claim to have been abused \n     in order to obtain visas. But where are the data and studies \n     that fraud is a problem? Immigrant victims who petition for \n     visas under VAWA are already required to supply ample \n     evidence of abuse, such as police reports or medical records. \n     And applications undergo intense scrutiny. In fiscal 2011, \n     immigration officials denied nearly a third of those \n     petitions.\n       The House reauthorization bill also seeks to undercut a \n     provision that allows undocumented immigrants who assist in \n     prosecutions of serious crime for U visas, and ultimately \n     obtain green cards. The proposed changes would allow victims \n     to obtain temporary visas only. Surely, even those lawmakers \n     who embrace anti-immigrant legislation can appreciate that U \n     visas help protect American citizens too, by encouraging \n     witnesses to step forward without fear of deportation. That's \n     why the program enjoys the backing of many law enforcement \n     groups.\n       The House will vote on Wednesday. It should reauthorize \n     VAWA without limits, as it has in the past, and demonstrate \n     that helping battered women, those who are immigrants, isn't \n     a partisan issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3230-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to highlight for my colleagues how \nCongress now has a critical opportunity to support the competitiveness \nand prosperity of American agriculture. We need to move the farm bill \nforward. It is fitting that this week marks the 150th anniversary of \nthe founding of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal \nDepartment solely dedicated to meeting the needs of America's farmers, \nranchers, and rural communities.\n  Agriculture is at the heart of Colorado's history and cultural \nfabric. It also continues to be one of our most significant economic \ndrivers. At a time when many sectors are struggling to find growth, \nColorado farmers and ranchers are more productive than ever, finding \ninnovative ways to harness growing consumer demand for agricultural \nproducts both at home and in overseas markets.\n  As evidence of this success, agriculture is the one sector of the \nU.S. economy that boasts a trade surplus. During the first 2 months of \n2012, Colorado exports of agricultural products grew by 25 percent over \nthe same period in 2011, led by an 80-percent increase in dairy \nexports. This good news comes on the heels of several consecutive years \nof double-digit increases in Colorado agriculture exports.\n  The USDA is part of this success story. Colorado farmers and ranchers \nwork closely with local USDA employees to support the productivity of \ntheir operations and to maintain the health of their land and water \nresources. It is a vital partnership. And with expiration looming on \nmany programs important to Colorado agriculture, I can think of no \nbetter way to commemorate the USDA's 150th anniversary than by \nreauthorizing the farm bill.\n  Over the last several months, the Senate and House committees on \nagriculture have come together to craft a bipartisan farm bill that not \nonly provides America's farmers, ranchers, and rural communities with \nthe tools they need to keep growing but also makes a significant \ncontribution toward important national deficit reduction goals. The \nfarm bill passed by the Senate Agriculture Committee makes very \nsignificant progress in simplification, accountability, and taxpayer \nsavings.\n  Using feedback I received from over 20 listening sessions statewide, \nI worked to secure Colorado's top farm bill priorities. In particular, \nI am encouraged by the farm bill's revamped conservation title. It \nmaintains vital authorities for land and water protection while also \nconsolidating over 20 existing conservation programs to provide \nproducers and landowners with much needed flexibility.\n  I also strongly support efforts by the Senate Agriculture Committee \nto strengthen the Federal crop insurance program. Time and time again, \nColorado farmers have told me that affordable crop insurance is the \nsingle most important risk management tool the USDA can provide to \nproducers for addressing today's economic and ecological challenges.\n  According to Colorado State University, agriculture contributes $40 \nbillion toward the State economy annually. Of course, the benefits of a \nstrong farm economy extend far beyond the farm. It means stronger \nenergy, transportation, and retail sectors. It also allows us to \nprovide food assistance to the most vulnerable populations at home and \nin countries suffering from famine due to drought and conflict.\n  In short, reauthorizing the farm bill is one the most important \nthings this Congress can do to provide farmers and ranchers with the \ncertainty they need to plan for the future. It will help to keep rural \nAmerica growing and thriving, and it will help to invigorate an economy \njust now getting back on its feet. Acting on this legislation during \nUSDA's 150th year would make the accomplishment even better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3230-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3230-S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FATHER RICHARD J. KELLEY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor \nmy friend, Father Richard J. Kelley, a Catholic priest who has devoted \ndecades of service in parishes across New Hampshire. It is my privilege \nto congratulate him as he celebrates his 40th anniversary of ordination \nto priesthood.\n  Father Kelley was born in Boston, MA, on May 10, 1943. He was raised \nin Needham and West Roxbury and graduated from Catholic Memorial High \nSchool in 1961. His seminary studies took place at the Holy Apostles \nSeminary in Cromwell, CT, and Catholic University in Washington, DC.\n  In addition to his commitment to the Catholic Church, Father Kelley \nhas always reached out to help those in need. Before his ordination to \npriesthood, he spent time performing inner-city social work in Kansas \nCity, MO. Shortly thereafter, Father Kelley was ordained to priesthood \non May 20, 1972, at the St. Joseph Cathedral in Manchester, NH.\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\n  Since offering his first Mass at St. Joseph Church in his hometown of \nNeedham, Father Kelley has spent many years serving parish churches in \ncities and towns across New Hampshire. As an associate pastor, he led \nSeacoast parishioners at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Parish in \nHampton and St. Michael Parish in Exeter. He also served at St. Joseph \nCathedral in Manchester.\n  On October 7, 1985, Father Kelley was appointed to his first \npastorate at St. Catherine Parish in Charlestown, followed by over a \ndecade of service at St. Patrick Parish in Jaffrey. So many New \nHampshire parishes have been blessed to have Father Kelley's guidance, \nand his message of faith and devotion has touched many lives.\n  Since 2000, Father Kelley has served as the Pastor of St. Christopher \nParish in my hometown of Nashua. In addition to his role as leader of \nthe parish, Father Kelley is also a familiar face to the students at \nSt. Christopher's Catholic School, where his patience, kindness, and \nhumility serve as an inspiring example.\n  The impact of Father Kelley's 40 years of service can perhaps best be \nwitnessed every Christmas. He receives hundreds of holiday cards from \nparishioners and friends he has met throughout his lifetime. He hangs \nup each one to decorate the walls and doors of his office, completely \ncovering each surface and eventually spilling into the hallways. This \nseasonal collage reflects the many valued friendships he has cultivated \nthroughout his career.\n  Father Kelley's impact continues to reach far beyond the parish \nwalls. In addition to his responsibilities at St. Christopher's, he has \nassisted other community members through his service as the Nashua \nPolice Department chaplain, as a former board member of Harbor Homes, \nand through his continued support of Catholic Memorial High School.\n  I am honored to recognize Father Richard Kelley as his many friends \nhelp him mark his 40th anniversary of ordination to priesthood. His \nloyalty and dedication to the Catholic Church and to his parishioners \nis unwavering--St. Christopher's is blessed and fortunate to have his \nguidance. I am grateful for Father Kelley's leadership and his many \nyears of service to the Catholic Church in communities across New \nHampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3231-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JUDGE ROBERT E. COYLE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Judge Robert E. Coyle, a talented jurist, a \nrespected member of the community, and a kind and gentle man. Judge \nCoyle passed away on May 7 in Fresno at age 82.\n  A Fresno native, Robert Coyle received his B.A. from Fresno State \nCollege in 1953 and his J.D. from the University of California, \nHastings College of the Law in 1956. After law school, he began his \nlegal career as a deputy district attorney in Fresno County before \nworking as an associate at Hansen, McCormick, Barstow and Sheppard from \n1958 to 1961 and as partner at McCormick, Barstow, Sheppard, Coyle and \nWayte from 1961 to 1982.\n  Judge Coyle was nominated to the Eastern District bench by President \nReagan, confirmed by the Senate on March 31, 1982, and served as chief \njudge of the district from 1990 to 1996, when he took senior status and \ncontinued to take cases until 2006.\n  Judge Coyle played an instrumental role in the construction of new \nFederal courthouses in Sacramento and Fresno. For 13 years, he led the \neffort to build the Fresno courthouse, often seen shuttling from his \nchambers to the construction site with his hard hat in hand. His \npassion for this project once prompted him to ride in a suspended \nplatform to some 300 feet above the ground to get a glimpse of the view \nthat is now enjoyed by the building's occupants and visitors. After \ntaking in the views of his beloved hometown and the breathtaking Sierra \nand beautiful Coastal Range, Judge Coyle compared his experience to \n``riding on a cloud.''\n  I am proud to have introduced legislation that led to the naming of \nthe Federal courthouse in downtown Fresno as the Robert E. Coyle United \nStates Courthouse. The nine-story building stands as a reminder to the \ncommunity and people of California of the dedicated work of Judge \nRobert E. Coyle.\n  Judge Coyle was always admired for his sharp intellect, collegiality, \nand gentlemanly ways. A giving person, he lent his time and talents to \na number of community causes, including service on the board of \ntrustees of the United Way Advocate. In his leisure time, he enjoyed \nspending time at the family cabin above Bass Lake.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife of 59 years, Faye; his son \nand daughter-in-law, Robert and Kim; and his daughter and son-in-law, \nBarbara and Michael Vellone; and his grandchildren, Hunter, Sydney, \nMorgan, and Matthew.\n  Judge Coyle will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3231-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, on April 23, 2012, Dr. Theodora J. \nKalikow gave her last lecture as president of the University of Maine \nFarmington and received a standing ovation from an overflow audience at \nthe campus's largest auditorium. In that same spirit, I rise today to \nexpress my gratitude to a great leader and good friend for 18 years of \noutstanding service to the people of Maine.\n  There are many ways to describe what Theo as she is known to \ncolleagues, students, and friends has meant to our State. One is to \nnote that in 1998, her fourth year as president, the University of \nMaine Farmington was named to U.S. News and World Report's best college \nlist for the first time. This year, UMF celebrated 15 consecutive years \nof receiving that hard-earned and well-deserved recognition.\n  Another way is to consider the deep affection alumni and people \nthroughout Maine have for this remarkable institution. As just one \nexample, in 2007 UMF opened its new Education Center that integrates \ntechnology with teaching and learning. This major expansion was made \npossible only through the generosity of countless individuals, \nbusinesses, and organizations. Over the years, this kind of \noverwhelming support has enabled this small school of just 2,000 \nstudents to keep pace with the top colleges and universities in the \ncountry.\n  Responding to the needs of an ever-changing society is one of the \nrichest traditions a college can have. The traditions Dr. Kalikow has \nupheld began a century and a half ago when the people of rural Franklin \nCounty joined together to establish Maine's first public institution of \nhigher education. When the first class of 31 students matriculated at \nthe new Farmington Normal School in 1864, they did so in a setting that \nwas described by a University of Maine historian as ``rough, crude, and \nplenty humble.''\n  Under Dr. Kalikow's leadership, UMF has upheld another noble \ntradition that of contributing to the entire region by adding to its \ncultural life, teaching in local classrooms, coaching youth athletics, \nand helping youngsters learn everything from swimming to foreign \nlanguages. From the Health and Fitness Center to the Mantor Library, \nthe doors of UMF are open to the community.\n  In her last lecture, Dr. Kalikow drew a strong connection between the \nAmerica we know today as a place of unsurpassed equality, freedom, and \nopportunity and the ``rough, crude, and plenty humble'' foundation of \npublic higher education laid in Farmington, ME, and other frontier \ncommunities across the Nation so many generations ago. These ordinary \ncitizens knew that education was a necessary condition of creating a \nsuccessful society, she said, and we today are the beneficiaries of \ntheir investment.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Theo Kalikow has increased that investment through \nan ongoing commitment to teaching and learning. On behalf of the people \nof Maine, I thank Dr. Kalikow for her contributions to our State and \nwish her all the best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3231-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3231-S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING ANGELA FOREMASTER\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a \nstudent from my home State for being recognized as one of Nevada's top \nyouth volunteers of 2012. Angela Foremaster, a senior at Legacy High \nSchool in Las Vegas, was\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\nhonored with the Prudential Spirit of Community Award for her advocacy \non behalf of foster children and homeless teens in the Greater Las \nVegas area. I am proud to recognize Ms. Foremaster for this \naccomplishment as she serves as a role model for students across the \nnation striving to make a difference in the lives of America's youth.\n  Having five adopted siblings, Ms. Foremaster understands the \nimportance of supporting organizations that find adoptive families for \nchildren who wait in foster care. She has dedicated more than 1,000 \nhours to foster organizations around Nevada to assist their efforts to \nprovide a supportive community for children. One winter, as she helped \na group prepare for the holiday season, Ms. Foremaster noticed that \nthey weren't providing children with stockings for Christmas. This \nexperience encouraged her to hang flyers, asking for donations and \nsmall gifts to help her fill stockings for adoptive children and \ndisplaced teens. Ms. Foremaster was thrilled to receive generous \ndonations that enabled her to fill 250 stockings to help bring the \nholiday spirit to kids in needs.\n  I am so appreciative that Ms. Foremaster is raising awareness of the \nneeds of our country's struggling youth. In this tough economic period, \nAmerica's children deserve our attention more than ever. Since coming \nto Congress, I have supported legislation that assists individuals who \nhave fallen on hard times, recognizing the importance of temporary \nsafety nets. It is of paramount importance in this distressed economy \nthat we keep the needs of our most vulnerable at the forefront while \nfocusing on solutions to our nation's long-term economic problems.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating a young \nNevadan for her incredible determination to assist our nation's youth. \nThe citizens of Las Vegas are fortunate to have such a generous \nvolunteer who selflessly gives back to her community and exemplifies \nthe very best America's youth has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3232-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COLONEL BRIAN DUBIE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to Col. Brian Dubie, a fifth-generation Vermonter who is \nretiring on June 2 after a long and distinguished career in the Vermont \nAir National Guard and Air Force Reserve. Brian served as Vermont's \n78th Lieutenant Governor and has devoted his life to serving his State \nand his country.\n  Upon graduating high school in Essex Junction, Brian enrolled in the \nU.S. Air Force Academy. Even though the flight he took to Colorado was \nhis first time on an airplane, Brian already knew that he loved \naviation. Growing up, his father an officer in the Vermont Guard would \nbring the family to watch the planes take off and land from Burlington. \nThose excursions made vivid and lasting impressions on young Brian.\n  When he returned home to attend the University of Vermont, Brian \njoined the Vermont Air National Guard and flew F 4s and then F 16s, \neventually rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1998, he joined \nthe U.S. Air Force Reserve where he now holds the rank of colonel and \nserves as an emergency preparedness liaison officer.\n  Brian's service has touched thousands of Americans outside of \nVermont. Following the September 11 attacks, Brian procured and \ncoordinated the distribution of badly needed cell phones and radios for \nemergency responders at Ground Zero. For his actions he was awarded a \nMeritorious Service Medal. When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in \n2005, Brian mobilized and ensured that civilian responders had the \nsupport they needed. For his achievements at the Hurricane Operations \nCenter, he earned another Meritorious Service Medal and the Air Force \nCommendation Medal.\n  Admirable as they are, Brian's achievements are not surprising \nconsidering his roots in a family who values service and duty to \ncountry. His mother Janice worked as an operating room nurse at what \nwas then the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont. His father Clem was a \ncolonel in the Vermont Guard where he served full-time as a personnel \nofficer. His brother Michael is the adjutant general of Vermont.\n  Brian is also a tireless promoter of the Vermont business community. \nHe was the motivational force behind the Vermont Aerospace and Aviation \nAssociation. He also served as the unofficial Vermont ``ambassador'' to \nQuebec a position he took on with such fervor that some Quebec \nofficials called him Mr. Ambassador.\n  I am proud of all that Brian has accomplished for Vermont and our \ncountry. While he may be retiring from the Air Force, I know that his \nservice to both State and Nation is far from over. I wish him, his wife \nPenny, and his family all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3232-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3232-S3233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING UPRIGHT FRAMEWORKS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in February, the New York Times ran \na heartbreaking story about Robert and Wilma Hartford, two elderly \nPeru, ME residents unable to pay for basic heating during the State's \nbitter cold winter, and a heating oil dealer's personal struggle to \nassist them. As a result, the outpouring of support for this couple was \nastonishing, as neighbors, generous New York Times readers across the \ncountry, and local small businesses sought to help. One such business, \nUpright Frameworks in Wilton, ME, was happy to lend a hand. This small \nfirm's assistance to the Hartfords during their time of need \nillustrates the generosity of Mainers, consistently rising to the \noccasion to help a neighbor, while demonstrating enormous potential for \ncurbing our exorbitant energy costs. Today I wish to recognize Upright \nFrameworks for their compassion and tireless efforts to improve energy \nefficient building techniques.\n  Owner and founder Josh Wojcik began Upright Frameworks in 2008, after \nmoving back home to Maine following a 9-year term in environmental \npolicy in New York. As a trained environmentalist and graduate from the \nStructural Insulated Panel, SIP, School in West Virginia, Josh is \ndedicated to ensuring that buildings take full advantage of energy \nefficiency. Josh developed the idea for Upright Frameworks while \nassisting his father, Tom Wojcik, a long-time Mainer Builder, on \nconstruction projects throughout the State. As individuals continually \ninquired about energy efficiency and going ``green,'' Josh saw an \nopportunity to utilize his skills in Maine.\n  Despite the challenging construction market, today Upright Frameworks \nemploys 12 individuals. As a new innovative construction solution, this \nsmall firm specializes in installing structural insulated panels which \nhave been on the forefront of energy efficiency. For existing \nstructures, the company performs energy audits and weatherization \nretrofits to ensure that buildings have the most cost-effective energy \nsystems in places.\n  When Josh learned of the Hartfords' struggle, he was determined to \nhelp. With an existing home such as the Hartfords, the first step was \nto evaluate the project and determine the most cost-effective method to \nreduce energy costs. For Josh, reducing the heat loss in the attic was \nparamount to addressing energy efficiency. In collaboration with \nseveral other local Maine businesses and donations from across the \ncountry, Josh was able to effectively make a difference by reducing air \nleakage in the Hartfords' home by an astonishing 63 percent. This \ndrastic reduction will allow the couple to substantially reduce their \nhome heating costs for years to come.\n  While energy costs are still a major issue facing my State, I applaud \nUpright Frameworks' ability to achieve real results with their creative \nuse of energy efficiency to alleviate the burdens of home-heating \ncosts. This company's selfless commitment to helping fellow Mainers in \nneed truly warms my heart. I am proud to extend my praise to Josh \nWojcik and everyone at Upright Frameworks for their dedication and \noffer my best wishes for their continued success in building a new \nenergy future and improving the daily lives of Mainers.\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3233-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH RESPECT TO \n BLOCKING THE PROPERTY OF PERSONS THREATENING THE PEACE, SECURITY, OR \n                       STABILITY OF YEMEN--PM 48\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.)

A bill to make technical corrections to the legal \ndescription of certain land to be held in trust for the Barona Band of \nMission Indians, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will correct an error in the Native American Technical Corrections \nAct of 2004.\n  The intent of section 121 of the 2004 law was to put a parcel on the \nnorthern edge of the Barona reservation, in San Diego County, into \ntrust for the tribe. Unfortunately the bill identified a parcel on the \nsouthern edge of the reservation and put that in trust.\n  The mistake is compounded by the fact that the land north of the \nreservation is owned by a non-Indian property owner. The landowner now \ncannot sell or modify his property without permission from the tribe \nand the Department of the Interior.\n  The Barona Band of Mission Indians Land Transfer Clarification Act \ncorrects this mistake.\n  The bill removes the private property on the northern side of the \nreservation from trust status; and the bill places the correct parcel \nin trust for the Barona tribe on the southern edge of the reservation.\n  The Barona Land Transfer Clarification Act closely follows an \nagreement brokered by Congressman Duncan Hunter and his staff. \nCongressman Hunter, and former Congressman Duncan Hunter, Sr. before \nhim, brought the Band, the County of San Diego and the neighboring \nhomeowners to the negotiating table.\n  The agreement they reached, embodied in this legislation, is a \nproduct of compromise. The end product is something that everyone \nagrees is better than the status quo. That is how compromise works.\n  The Tribe supports the legislation. The Homeowners and the County \nhave reviewed and approved the language.\n  For the County and Homeowners, the findings section is the most \nimportant part of the bill.\n  This section addresses the ongoing water dispute between the tribe \nand its neighbors.\n  The fourth finding is particularly important if--the tribe uses the \nland to bring additional water into the area, the effort is only \nauthorized if it also addresses the water needs of the neighboring off-\nreservation property.\n  Homeowners in the area have noticed diminished groundwater supplies \nin recent years, and they have looked to the tribe to help resolve the \nissue. In this arid part of the State, this is a significant concession \non the part of the Tribe, and it is the cornerstone of the entire \nagreement.\n  I am hopeful that we can quickly pass this legislation and undo this \nunfortunate mistake. By enacting the Barona Land Transfer Clarification \nAct, all parties will gain some certainty that their issue will be \nresolved.\n  Finally, I am proud that my colleague from California Senator Boxer, \nand Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Daniel Akaka have joined \nme as original cosponsors.\n  Once this legislation is sent over to the House, I know that \nCongressman Hunter and the San Diego Delegation stand ready to join our \nfight to resolve this issue.\n  This strong, bi-partisan, bi-cameral support gives me confidence that \nthis simple, straightforward piece of legislation is one that the \nSenate can pass very quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3193\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Barona Band of Mission \n     Indians Land Transfer Clarification Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the legal description of land previously taken into \n     trust by the United States for the benefit of the Barona Band \n     of Mission Indians may be interpreted to refer to private, \n     nontribal land;\n       (2) there is a continued, unresolved disagreement between \n     the Barona Band of Mission Indians and certain off-\n     reservation property owners relating to the causes of \n     diminishing native groundwater;\n       (3) Congress expresses no opinion, nor should an opinion of \n     Congress be inferred, relating to the disagreement described \n     in paragraph (2); and\n       (4) it is the intent of Congress that, if the land \n     described in section 121(b) of the Native American Technical \n     Corrections Act of 2004 (118 Stat. 544) (as amended by \n     section 3) is used to bring water to the Barona Indian \n     Reservation, the effort is authorized only if the effort also \n     addresses water availability for neighboring off-reservation \n     land located along Old Barona Road that is occupied as of the \n     date of enactment of this Act by providing guaranteed access \n     to that water supply at a mutually agreeable site on the\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\n     southwest boundary of the Barona Indian Reservation.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify the legal description of the land placed \n     into trust for the Barona Band of Mission Indians in 2004; \n     and\n       (2) to remove all doubt relating to the specific parcels of \n     land that Congress has placed into trust for the Barona Band \n     of Mission Indians.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 462\n\n       Whereas National Foster Care Month was established more \n     than 20 years ago to bring foster care issues to the \n     forefront, highlight the importance of permanency for every \n     child, and recognize the essential role that foster parents, \n     social workers, and advocates have in the lives of children \n     in foster care throughout the United States;\n       Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent \n     home;\n       Whereas the primary goal of the foster care system is to \n     ensure the safety and well-being of children while working to \n     provide a safe, loving, and permanent home for each child;\n       Whereas there are approximately 408,000 children living in \n     foster care;\n       Whereas there were approximately 254,000 youth that entered \n     the foster care system in 2010, while over 107,000 youth were \n     eligible and awaiting adoption at the end of 2010;\n       Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 \n     different placements, which often leads to disruption of \n     routines and the need to change schools and move away from \n     siblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are much more likely to face \n     educational instability with 65 percent of former foster \n     children experiencing at least 7 school changes while in \n     care;\n       Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the \n     foster care system for longer periods of time and are less \n     likely to be reunited with their biological families;\n       Whereas foster parents are the front-line caregivers for \n     children who cannot safely remain with their biological \n     parents and provide physical care, emotional support, \n     education advocacy, and are the largest single source of \n     families providing permanent homes for children leaving \n     foster care to adoption;\n       Whereas children in foster care who are placed with \n     relatives, compared to children placed with nonrelatives, \n     have more stability, including fewer changes in placements, \n     have more positive perceptions of their placements, are more \n     likely to be placed with their siblings, and demonstrate \n     fewer behavioral problems;\n       Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and \n     reunification services is necessary to reduce the number of \n     children that are forced to remain in the foster care system;\n       Whereas more than 27,900 youth ``age out'' of foster care \n     without a legal permanent connection to an adult or family;\n       Whereas children who age out of foster care may lack the \n     security or support of a biological or adoptive family and \n     frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain \n     health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary \n     placement, but children remain in the foster care system for \n     an average of 2 years;\n       Whereas volunteers, guardians, mentors, and workers in the \n     child-protective-services community play a vital role in \n     improving the safety of the most valuable youth and work hard \n     to increase permanency through reunification, adoption, and \n     guardianship;\n       Whereas due to heavy caseloads and limited resources, the \n     average tenure for a worker in child protection services is \n     just 3 years;\n       Whereas on average, 8.5 percent of the positions in child \n     protective services remain vacant;\n       Whereas States, localities, and communities should be \n     encouraged to invest resources in preventative and \n     reunification services and postpermanency programs to ensure \n     that more children in foster care are provided with safe, \n     loving, and permanent placements;\n       Whereas Federal legislation over the past 3 decades, \n     including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of \n     1980 (Public Law 96 272), the Adoption and Safe Families Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 105 89), the Fostering Connections to \n     Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110 \n     351), and the Child and Family Services Improvement and \n     Innovation Act (Public Law 112 34) provided new investments \n     and services to improve the outcomes of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas May is an appropriate month to designate as \n     National Foster Care Month to provide an opportunity to \n     acknowledge the child-welfare workforce, foster parents, \n     advocacy community, and mentors for their dedication, \n     accomplishments, and positive impact they have on the lives \n     of children; and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about the challenges faced by children in \n     the foster care system, acknowledging the dedication of \n     foster care parents, advocates, and workers, and encouraging \n     Congress to implement policy to improve the lives of children \n     in the foster care system;\n       (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the \n     lives of children in the foster care system;\n       (3) supports the designation of May as National Foster Care \n     Month;\n       (4) acknowledges the special needs of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       (5) recognizes foster youth throughout the United States \n     for their ongoing tenacity, courage, and resilience while \n     facing life challenges,\n       (6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of the foster care \n     system who serve as advocates and role models for youth who \n     remain in care;\n       (7) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals \n     who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to \n     children in the foster care system; and\n       (8) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster care system through \n     parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and other programs designed to--\n       (A) support vulnerable families;\n       (B) invest in prevention and reunification services;\n       (C) promote adoption and guardianship in cases where \n     reunification is not in the best interests of the child;\n       (D) adequately serve those children brought into the foster \n     care system; and\n       (E) facilitate the successful transition into adulthood for \n     children that ``age out'' of the foster care system.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as cofounders and cochairs of the Senate \nCaucus on Foster Youth, Senator Landrieu and I offer a resolution to \nrecognize May as National Foster Care Month.\n  The resolution is an opportunity to raise awareness about the \nchallenges faced by children in the foster care system. It is also a \ntime to acknowledge the dedication of foster care parents, advocates, \nand workers who are changing the lives of children every day.\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\n  National Foster Care Month was established more than 20 years ago to \nbring foster care issues to the forefront. Today we continue to see \nalmost a half million children who are unable to remain at home because \nof abuse or neglect or because of other family issues.\n  During this separation, foster youth face loneliness, instability, \nand grief. Unfortunately, children in foster care experience an average \nof three different placements which often lead to disruption of \nroutines. Some are required to change schools and move away from \nsiblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings. They face \neducational instability and, as a result, score lower on all academic \nmeasures than peers.\n  Foster youth have to overcome misperceptions and stigmas and deal \nwith emotional pain and trauma that comes from such separation. It \nbecomes a reality for many children every day. In 2010, about 254,000 \nchildren entered into care. While many are reunified with their \nfamilies or adopted into new ones, more than 107,000 children were \nawaiting adoption at the end of 2010.\n  The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth is providing a voice for these \nfoster young people. Senator Landrieu and I founded this caucus in 2009 \nto raise awareness of issues challenging foster youth, including \neducational stability, substance abuse, sexual exploitation, and the \noverprescription of psychotropic drugs.\n  We hear from youth about policies that affect their quality of life. \nAmong other activities, the caucus sponsors a speakers series to bring \nthe best ideas from the field to us policymakers in Washington, DC.\n  Today I invite my colleagues to join us on this caucus, to get \ninvolved and to make a difference. Senator Landrieu and I created the \nfoster care caucus in the Senate to focus on all youth in the system, \nbut we have particular focus on older children who may lack the \nsecurity or support of a biological or adoptive family. These kids tend \nto age out of the foster care system, then struggle in creating a \nstable life that many of us often take for granted. More than 27,900 \nyouth age out of foster care without a legal, permanent connection to \nan adult or family. We must focus on how to reduce this number from \nyear to year. We have made great strides over the years, and we have \ndone so in a bipartisan manner.\n  In 2006, the Senate Finance Committee held the first hearings on \nchild welfare in more than a decade. The hearings led to passage of the \nChild and Family Services Improvement Act, which improved programs \ndesigned to help troubled families, provided grants for States and \ncommunity organizations to combat methamphetamine addiction and other \nsubstance abuse, and increased case worker visits for children in \nfoster care. It also supported grants to strengthen and improve \ncollaboration between courts and child welfare agencies.\n  In 2008 I introduced the bill that became the Fostering Connection to \nSuccess and Increasing Adoption Act. This bipartisan bill made it \neasier for children to stay in their own communities and be adopted by \ntheir own relatives, including grandparents, aunts, and uncles. It \nprovided incentives for States to move children from foster care to \npermanent adoptive homes, and it made all children with special needs \neligible for Federal adoption assistance.\n  The law also broke new ground by establishing opportunities to help \nkids who age out of the foster care system at age 18 by giving States \nthe option to extend their care in helping them pursue educational and \nvocational training.\n  Last year, to try to prevent children from having to enter the foster \ncare system in the first place, I worked to reauthorize grants that \nsupport families who struggle with substance abuse and improve the \nsafety, permanency, and well-being of children who are not in their \nhomes or are likely to be removed from their homes because of substance \nabuse by parents.\n  Children in the foster care system yearn for permanency, and these \ngrants help keep families together when possible so the children are \nnot subject to the many difficulties they face in the foster care \nsystem.\n  But Congress, as you know, must be vigilant. We must always keep our \neyes on the prize; that is, a safe, loving and permanent home for every \nchild. We must always stress prevention as well as reunification and \nthe reunification services because these two key components are \nnecessary to reduce the number of children who are forced to remain in \nfoster care.\n  Finally, let me take a moment to pay tribute to many volunteers, \nguardians, mentors, and workers in the child protective service \ncommunity. Every person in this field plays a vital role in improving \nthe safety of our most vulnerable youth, and our country is better off \nfor that. They are dedicated and important to thousands of children and \ncan be very positive influences for families across the country.\n  This month of May is the time to pay tribute to the community. It is \ntime to remember these young people. More important, it is time to \nencourage others to get involved and, hence, make a difference. It is \nmy hope that this awareness will extend beyond me, and people will \nrecognize the need to step up and to fight for these vulnerable youth \non a daily basis. I encourage Members to cosponsor our resolution, and \nI especially appreciate the cooperation and working relationship I have \nhad with Senator Landrieu on this subject of adoption, foster care, \nand, in particular, for aging-out young people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the eloquent statement our \ncolleague from Iowa has put into the Record and his passionate advocacy \non behalf of this special group of children in America. From his \nposition as senior member on the Finance Committee, both serving as \nchair and as ranking member, his support has been essential to their \nwell-being. In a committee that has a lot of important issues, from tax \nreform to international trade, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, \nnever fails to keep the needs of foster care children and their \nfamilies and the support community on the front of that agenda. I could \nnot have a better partner, and I am very grateful for his partnership \non this issue and his friendship.\n  I also want to recognize some of our colleagues from the House: \nRepresentative Karen Bass, Representative Tom Marino, Representative \nMichele Bachman, and Representative Jim McDermott, who worked very \nclosely with Senator Grassley and myself. As you can see, this is \nacross party lines, across geographic lines, and across different \npolitical philosophies.\n  We want to say one thing very loud and clear to the country: Foster \nchildren are not criminals. They are not delinquents. They are children \nwho are in desperate need of love and care and support. Our foster care \nsystem in many ways works beautifully and in some ways needs, of \ncourse, to be fixed, repaired, and strengthened. But overall the foster \ncare system should, at all times, be temporary. It is a temporary place \nfor children to go to be protected and healed and nurtured until they \ncan be returned to their birth family or to their extended family with \nsibling groups intact or until they can be processed to a kinship \nadoption, which Senator Grassley has been a tremendous advocate for, or \nto a domestic adoption.\n  I cannot add anything to the very excellent and comprehensive \nstatement the Senator made. I would like to add just a few points. \nBecause of the work many of us have done--and we do not hear good news \naround here that often, so I want to share that in the last 20 years, \nbecause of the work that our group has done, and others in the \nCongress, we have doubled the amount of children being adopted out of \nthe foster care system. That is a tremendous victory because of the \nlegislation that has been passed, the focus across party lines.\n  In 1990 we only adopted 14,000 children out of foster care. In the \nlast year of record, 2010, we adopted 53,000. It is a tripling of \nadoptions out of foster care.\n  I do not have the numbers in front of me for reunifications, but \nSenator Grassley and I know that number has increased as well. We are \nmaking progress in the bills we are proposing and passing, the \nappropriations that we are investing. It has not been a lot more money \nover the last few years. It\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\nhas just been a real strategic focus which I would like to believe our \ncaucus and the adoption caucus as well, the foster care caucus, has \nhelped to produce.\n  We have had more adoptions out of foster care. We have had more \nreunifications out of foster care. We have shortened the time that \nchildren are in foster care. But we have, and in this month of May \nstill have, many challenges. That is why Senator Grassley and I urge \nour colleagues to join us in this resolution, S. Res. 462. Be a \ncosponsor. Step up and say by your cosponsorship that you care about \nthis issue, that you want to help us continue to make progress.\n\n  I want to remember our former colleague, John Chafee, who, when he \nwas in the Senate, was an extraordinary advocate for foster care \nchildren. We named the John Chafee Foster Care Independence Program in \nhis honor. As Senator Grassley said, we are making progress with \nhelping our children who age out when we failed to reunite them with \ntheir birth family, we failed to find them an adoptive home. They are \naging out, but we are trying to give them more help and support. That \nis still a challenge.\n  Some of our Members are working on foster children and school choice. \nIf children are brought into the foster care system and they are \nseparated from their families, it is quite traumatic. Of course it is \nfor their own good. Sometimes their families are being abusive. \nSometimes their families are being grossly negligent. Unfortunately, in \nthis day and age sometimes their families are deported and they are in \nthe home alone. We want to make sure the children get to stay at least \nin the school of their choice. It is one thing to be pulled from your \nfamily; it is another thing to have to lose your family 1 day and your \nschool the next day and all of your teachers, all of your friends.\n  There is legislation pending that would give foster children the \nopportunity to stay in the school they are in when they enter care, if \nthat is their choice. That would be a great reform.\n  We also want to continue to promote kinship adoption, reaching out to \nthe extended family, trying to keep children placed in their extended \nfamilies who are willing and responsible to raise them--but not placing \nchildren with kin if the kin or the relatives are not responsible and \nnot willing; that is not a solution.\n  Finally, we want to promote quality foster families. This is a \nproblem that is easily solvable. It seems like it is a lot, this \nnumber, 450-some-odd thousand children. But it represents only one-half \nof 1 percent of all children in America. This is not a big number. It \nsounds like it when we say 450,000, but the percentage, one-half of 1 \npercent--we calculated it 1 day on just the back of a napkin. If one \nfamily for every four churches in America would say yes to taking in a \nfoster child or to adopt a child out of foster care, there would be no \nmore orphans in our country.\n  Again, if one family out of every four churches stepped up for the \nchildren available for adoption, we would have no more orphans in \nAmerica. Then we could focus on recruiting quality foster families who \ncan help these children to find their way--to find their way back to \ntheir biological families with their sibling groups intact or find \ntheir way to a new family who will love them and nurture them and \nprotect them and support them forever.\n  That is what families do. We do not support our children until they \nare 18 and let them go on their merry way. We are with them until the \nlast breath. That is what parents do. We are with our children forever. \nEvery child in this world deserves a forever family.\n  Senator Grassley and I have come together. We work to strengthen our \nfoster care system. We know it is broken in places. We know it can be \nfixed. We work on fixing it every day.\n  I thank our colleagues who have joined us in just recognizing Foster \nCare Month. As Senator Grassley said in his conclusion, and I will say \nin mine, we want to thank everyone who helps on this every month of the \nyear, not just May. We want to thank the teachers who reach out \nespecially to the foster children they know are in their classrooms. We \nwant to thank the judges who process their cases quickly.\n  I particularly want to thank the CASA workers. I am a big believer in \nCASA, Court Appointed Special Advocates. I think it is a great \norganization for all the volunteers who worked to help make our foster \ncare system in America better.\n  Again, this is S. Res. 462.\n  I would like to thank our counterparts in the House.\n  It has been a real joy and pleasure to work with Senator Grassley \nthese many years on helping to promote the very best practices in the \ncountry on reforming our foster care system in America and trying to \nhelp who we can around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/16/senate-section/article/S3238-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 463--DESIGNATING MAY 19, 2012, AS ``NATIONAL KIDS TO \n                              PARKS DAY''\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Murkowski, and \nMr. Portman) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 463\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a \npretty common sense goal--getting more kids outside and engaged in the \ngreat outdoors.\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\n  In America today, I am sad to say that one in three children are \noverweight or obese. Kids between the ages of 8 and 18 spend an average \nof 7 and a half hours a day using some sort of entertainment media such \nas TVs, computers, video games, cell phones and movies. I believe this \nis a major reason why only \\1/3\\ of all children get the recommended \nlevel of physical activity every day, contributing to high obesity \nrates.\n  The grave effects of childhood obesity on our children's quality of \nlife are troubling, and the impacts on our economy distressing. But the \neffect on our national security is equally alarming. With current \nobesity rates, I have serious concerns that our military will have \ndifficulty finding soldiers physically qualified to serve in the near \nfuture.\n  A healthier Nation is a stronger Nation, and encouraging greater \nphysical activity in America's youth by getting more kids outdoors will \nhelp stop this disturbing trend.\n  That is why I am proud to submit a bipartisan resolution today which \nrecognizes May 19, 2012, as the second annual National Kids to Parks \nDay. I led this effort last year, and was extremely pleased to see the \nmany thousands of families that made it out to a national, State, or \nlocal park to enjoy the great outdoors.\n  So far, over 70,000 people across the country have signed the pledge \nto get outside on National Kids to Parks Day.\n  Enjoying the outdoors has been a lifelong passion for me. Growing up \nin the American southwest, my parents would take our family on frequent \ntrips to the nearby parks and helped inspire me to become a mountain \nguide with Outward Bound. At Outward Bound I developed a strong love \nnot just for being outdoors, but for sharing the outdoors with others.\n  In Congress, I have similarly tried to ensure that open spaces in \nboth urban and rural areas are preserved so that families in Colorado \nand across America have ample opportunity to get out and take advantage \nof our greatest natural resources, our parks, and open spaces.\n  Preserving open spaces is critical to our ability to enjoy the \noutdoors, which is essential not just to public health but to our \neconomy as well. In Colorado, a big part of our economy is dependent on \nhaving open spaces--from skiing to whitewater rafting, hiking, and \nmountain biking--protecting land for outdoor recreation keeps us and \nour economy healthy.\n  In this same spirit, on Saturday families all across the Nation will \nget outside to celebrate National Kids to Parks Day and America's \ncommitment to getting kids outdoors.\n  Getting kids outdoors won't completely solve our childhood obesity \nproblem, but it may help them get excited about being active and \nhealthy outdoors. It may help inspire the next generation of American \nstewards to enjoy and protect our Nation's special places.\n  I would like to thank Senator Bingaman, Senator Murkowski and Senator \nPortman for joining me in submitting this resolution.\n  I would like to close by asking my colleagues to support my National \nKids to Parks Day resolution.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 464\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to mark the \n70th anniversary of Ellsworth Air Force Base. For the past seven \ndecades, my home State of South Dakota has had the distinct honor of \nbeing home to Ellsworth Air Force Base. This weekend, I will gather in \nRapid City with Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz, 28th \nBomb Wing Commander Colonel Mark Weatherington, Governor Dennis \nDaugaard, Senator John Thune, Congresswoman Kristi Noem, past and \npresent Airmen, and proud South Dakotans to celebrate this anniversary.\n  A lot has changed since the Rapid City Army Air Base opened in 1942. \nAt the time, the base served as a training location for B 17 Flying \nFortress crews and thousands of pilots, navigators, radio operators, \nand gunners trained there during World War II. Over the years, the base \nhas adapted and grown to support new missions but a reminder of its \nearly days remains in the PRIDE hangar. This historic building was \ncompleted in 1949 to house the RB 36 Peacemakers and later was home to \nthe 44th Strategic Missile Wing and the 77th Bomb Squadron.\n  The 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base has been home to such \nimpressive aircraft as the B 17 Flying Fortress, B 29 Superfortress, \nthe RB 36 Peacemaker, the B 52 Stratofortress, and, for the past 25 \nyears, the B 1B Lancer. All these planes have graced the skies of \nwestern South Dakota, offering South Dakotans a visual and audial \nreminder of the power of the United States Air Force. Ellsworth has \nplayed an important role in every major conflict since World War II, \nincluding flying over 6,000 combat sorties in support of Operation \nIraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and Operation Enduring Freedom. On \nMarch 20, 2011, history was made as the first ever B 1B combat sorties \nlaunched directly from the United States to strike targets overseas \nwere launched at Ellsworth and hit targets in Libya. Ellsworth \ncontinues to evolve and as we reflect on the past, we also look to a \nbright future for the base, including the arrival later this year of \nthe MQ 9 Reaper mission.\n  Ellsworth Air Force Base is the largest employer in western South \nDakota and has had a significant economic impact on our State. The \nimpact of the base on our State goes beyond the economic, however; the \nbase and its personnel are a part of the fabric of our state. Rapid \nCity, Box Elder, and communities throughout the Black Hills have \nenjoyed a friendly and mutually beneficial relationship with the base. \nThis is something that, unfortunately, cannot be said at every military \ninstallation. This symbiotic relationship has displayed itself in \nnumerous ways, such as in 1972 when base personnel assisted in the \nrecovery and relief efforts when historic flooding struck Rapid City. \nWhen snowstorms crippled the region in 1949 and 1950, Ellsworth \npersonnel airlifted food and hay bales to stranded ranchers and \nlivestock. Today, personnel from Ellsworth contribute to many \ncharitable efforts in the community, such as helping with the United \nWay's annual Day of Caring and the Children's Miracle Network.\n  As I reflect on this anniversary, I'm reminded of all of the \ndedicated Airmen, past and present, that have served at Ellsworth Air \nForce Base. The Air Force is only as strong as its members, and \nEllsworth has seen many talented, patriotic individuals over the past \n70 years. Many former Wing Commanders have gone on to serve in top \npositions in the Air Force, including as commanders of U.S. \nTransportation Command, Air Education and Training Command, and Air \nForce Global Strike Command.\n  Mr. President, for the past 70 years Ellsworth Air Force Base has \nmade significant contributions to the State of South Dakota and the \nsecurity of the United States. I commend Ellsworth Air Force Base on \nthis occasion and know that the base, and the brave men and women who \nserve there, will continue to make invaluable contributions for decades \nto come.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 465\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am submitting a \nresolution concerning water in the State of Colorado. This resolution \nrecognizes the importance of water to the State of Colorado and the \ncontributions of many of the organizations that have innovated and \ncooperated over the past century to develop, protect and conserve this \nscarce resource. I want to thank my colleague from Colorado Senator \nBennet for cosponsoring the resolution.\n  In the arid West, water is our most precious natural resource. It is \nwoven into our history as a source of life, a source of recreation and \neven economic growth. But as a limited resource, it is also a source of \nconflict. As the old saying in the West goes, whiskey is for drinking \nand water is for fighting.\n  However, I rise today to highlight not our disagreements but our \ncooperation. Generations of Coloradans have joined together and worked \nhard to solve Colorado's water challenges, because a resource as \nvaluable as water must ultimately unite us.\n  The year 2012 is a particularly significant year for water in \nColorado, as it marks numerous anniversaries that have had an enormous \nimpact on how water is managed in my state.\n  It is the 100th anniversary of the construction of the Rio Grande \nReservoir, 90th anniversary of the Colorado River Compact of 1922, 75th \nanniversary of\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nthe creation of the Colorado Water Conservation Board, 75th anniversary \nof the creation of the Colorado River Water Conservation District, 75th \nanniversary of the creation of the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy \nDistrict and the Colorado-Big Thompson Project, 50th anniversary of the \nFryingpan-Arkansas Project, 10th anniversary of the Colorado Foundation \nfor Water Education and 10th anniversary of the Lower Arkansas Valley \nWater Conservancy District.\n  In fact, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper has designated 2012 as \nthe Year of Water in Colorado.\n  I am proud of efforts underway in the state to raise awareness about \nthe importance of water. For example, a statewide celebration named \nColorado Water 2012 will help to engage and educate Coloradans about \npast achievements and highlight the challenges we face in the future \nmanagement of water. Colorado Water 2012 will continue throughout the \nyear, and I look forward to participating in the education and \nengagement of our citizens.\n  I hope that this resolution can in some small way add to the \nappreciation of water issues in the United States Senate and to efforts \nunderway in Colorado.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolutions be \nagreed to, the preambles be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc, with no intervening action or debate, and \nany statements related to the resolutions be printed in the Record at \nthe appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 463\n\n     (Designating May 19, 2012, as ``National Kids to Parks Day'')\n\n       Whereas the second annual National Kids to Parks Day will \n     be celebrated on May 19, 2012;\n       Whereas the goal of National Kids to Parks Day is to \n     empower young people and encourage families to get outdoors \n     and visit the parks of the United States;\n       Whereas, on National Kids to Parks Day, individuals from \n     rural and urban areas of the United States can be \n     reintroduced to the splendid National Parks and State and \n     neighborhood parks that are located in their communities;\n       Whereas communities across the United States offer a \n     variety of natural resources and public land, often with free \n     access, to individuals seeking outdoor recreation;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should encourage \n     young people to lead a more active lifestyle, as too many \n     young people in the United States are overweight or obese;\n       Whereas National Kids to Parks Day is an opportunity for \n     families to take a break from their busy lives and come \n     together for a day of wholesome fun; and\n       Whereas National Kids to Parks Day aims to broaden the \n     appreciation of young people for nature and the outdoors: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 19, 2012, as ``National Kids to Parks \n     Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of outdoor recreation and the \n     preservation of open spaces to the health of the young people \n     of the United States; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                              S.
