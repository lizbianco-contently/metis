Mr. President, I was disappointed to see in the newspaper \nthis morning and hear on the news that Republicans in the House have \ndecided to not mess with our highway bill--a bill on which we spent 5 \nweeks. The highway bill is a piece of bipartisan legislation that will \nsave a great 2.8 million jobs. The House of Representatives is so \ndisorganized and in such a state of disrepair that they can't even \nextend the highway bill. I don't know what is in their minds.\n  This program was started by a radical liberal Dwight Eisenhower, who \ndecided after having brought--as a major under orders from his \ncommander--a caravan of military vehicles across the country that the \nroads were awful. So he remembered that all during his military \nservice. When he became President of the United States, he decided \nsomething needed to be done about that. The Interstate Highway System \nwas the brainchild of Dwight Eisenhower. Now the Republicans in the \nHouse are talking as if it is some socialist program that was developed \nat Harvard or some other radically liberal place. I can't imagine what \ntheir mindset is.\n  Barbara Boxer, one of the most liberal Members of this body, and Jim \nInhofe, one of the most conservative Members, came together on a bill \nthat we passed on a bipartisan basis in the Senate. The vast majority \nof the Democrats voted for it, and the vast majority of Republicans \nvoted for it. It is a good bill that will save or create 2.8 million \njobs. But over in that big dark hole we now refer to as the tea party-\ndominated House of Representatives, they couldn't do it. They couldn't \nagree on it. They couldn't agree even on their own bill. They destroyed \ntheir own bill. Now they will not even agree to take up our bill.\n  The funding for our highway system terminates at the end of this \nmonth. I am not inclined to go for the short-term extension they are \ngoing to send to us. They are going to have to feel the heat of the \nAmerican people--they meaning the tea party-driven House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The initial public offering legislation will be on the floor and \ndebated for the last time in just a short time. It will pass. The bill \nis far from perfect, but it is a good bill. It will help capital \nformation, and I am glad we are able to pass it on to the House. I am \nhopeful, with the good work done by Senator Merkley, Senator Warner, \nSenator Bennet and others, the minority will wrap their arms around \nthis and pass it. I hope they will agree to pass the\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\nReed amendment. We will soon know about that. The bill is going to be \ngone and sent to the President soon if the House agrees to pass this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1956-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1956-S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 2 years ago tomorrow President Obama signed \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law. It was the \ngreatest single step in generations toward ensuring access to \naffordable quality health care for every American, regardless of where \nthey live or how much money they make.\n  Millions and millions of Americans have already felt the benefit of \nthis law. Seniors are saving money--millions and millions of dollars--\non their prescriptions and their free checkups. The doughnut hole is \nrapidly disappearing because of this law.\n  Insurance companies can no longer set arbitrary lifetime caps on \nbenefits, putting millions of Americans one car accident or heart \nattack away from bankruptcy. People think they are in good shape; they \nhave a health insurance policy. Then they get into a car accident or \nthey get cancer or some other dread disease and they are in the process \nof being taken care of and they are told their bills are not going to \nbe paid anymore; their limit is $10,000 or $50,000 and insurance \nstopped paying the benefits.\n  Under this legislation that can no longer be done. That is why the \nPresident signed the bill. Under this legislation that is now law, \nchildren can no longer be denied insurance because they have \npreexisting conditions. The protection will soon extend to all \nAmericans, and in 2 short years--in fact, less time than that--\nvirtually every man, woman, and child in America will have access to \nthe health insurance they can afford and the vital care they need. They \nwill have the same kind of insurance the Presiding Officer and I have--\nbasically the same insurance. People rail against this plan of \nPresident Obama's. I haven't seen a single one of the Republicans rail \nagainst this law saying: We don't want our insurance because it is \ngovernment insurance.\n  Every Member of the Senate has the same insurance that we are by law \ngiving to everyone in America. So my Republican colleagues who berate \nthis bill, let them drop their government insurance. If they hate this \ncoverage so much that we are trying to give to the American people, \nthey can drop what they have because it is the same thing basically.\n  No longer will hundreds of millions of Americans live in fear of \nlosing their insurance because they lose their jobs, and no longer will \ntens of millions rely on the only care they know exists--an emergency \nroom. The most expensive care in America is an emergency room visit. \nSome people go without care because they have no insurance at all.\n  This is not just a story I have heard from other people. There are \npeople today who have no insurance just like my family had no insurance \nwhen I was growing up. We didn't go to the doctor. We had no insurance. \nThe only time I can remember going to the doctor was when I was deathly \nill--literally deathly ill.\n  My parents had no car, and I had something wrong. I had been sick for \na long time. My brother had somebody visit him, and my mother asked if \nthey would be good enough to take us over to the hospital, which was 50 \nmiles away. They did, and I had a growth on one of my intestines. I was \nvery, very sick.\n  There are many people today just like I was as a little boy; they \nhave no insurance, and they may have the same situation I had, with no \ntransportation and having a visitor take them to the nearest emergency \nroom. That is what happened to me. In my case, the emergency room was \n50 miles away.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans continue to target the rights and benefits \nguaranteed under that law. If Republicans have their way, insurance \ncompanies will once again be allowed to deny care to sick children \nbecause they have asthma or diabetes or some of the other situations \nyoung people get. In Nevada, thousands of children with preexisting \nconditions would once again be at the whim of insurance companies that \ncare more about making money than about making people better. If \nRepublicans have their way, young adults just out of college will be \nkicked off their parents' insurance plans. That is also something I \nknow exists today.\n  In the little town of Searchlight, where I have my home, a young man \nnamed Jeff wanted to go to school. He started at community college and \nwas doing pretty well when he got pain in his groin. At first it \nstarted out as a little ache, and then it got to the point that he \ncouldn't take it anymore. But because he was at an age where he was no \nlonger able to stay on his parents' insurance policy, he didn't know \nwhere to go. So he went to the so-called county hospital, indigent \nhospital. He was diagnosed with having testicular cancer. He had been \non his dad's insurance policy, but he arrived at an age where he was no \nlonger eligible. His parents certainly did not have much. His mother \nworked part time in a post office, and his dad worked at a steam-\ngenerating plant 50 miles away from Searchlight. So they begged--I am \nstretching a little bit--but they borrowed and borrowed and borrowed to \ntake care of his two surgeries, a number of hospital visitations, \nchemotherapy. They paid for that--thousands and thousands of dollars \nthat they had to find a way to pay for for their boy.\n  Under the law that is now in existence, young people can stay on \ntheir parents' insurance policy for 3 or 4 years more, allowing many \nwho are finishing college to go find a job while staying on their \nparents' insurance policy.\n  In Nevada, thousands of children with preexisting conditions would, \nonce again, as I have indicated, be without the ability to be taken \ncare of when they are sick.\n  Almost 23,000 young adults in Nevada would once again have to defer \ntheir dreams to take a job or, as I just indicated, go to college or \nrisk going without any care.\n  If Republicans have their way, our seniors will pay for more \nprescriptions and checkups. We have had about a quarter of a million \nNevada seniors who now get wellness visits, cancer screenings, and \nother preventive services. If this goes away, it will not happen \nanymore.\n  Tens of thousands of seniors who saved millions and millions of \ndollars in Nevada alone on prescription drugs last year will once again \nbe forced to choose between buying food and buying medicine. If \nRepublicans have their way, taxes will increase for small businesses. \nSo will the deficit. Repealing health care reform would add almost $1.5 \ntrillion to the Federal debt--not billion, trillion. But when Democrats \nundertook health care reform, it wasn't just about saving money, it was \nabout saving lives, and we did that.\n  While the numbers I have just discussed are very important, there is \none number that matters more than all the others: 45,000. In the year \n2011, 45,000 Americans died because they lacked health insurance. That \nis almost 1,000 a week. That doesn't include the tens of thousands more \nwho are sick or dying because they have health insurance but still \ncan't afford the care they need.\n  After the rest of the affordable care act has taken affect over the \nnext 1\\1/2\\ or 2 years, no American will have to bear what President \nLyndon Johnson called ``the injustice which denies the miracle of \nhealing to the old and to the poor.'' President Johnson knew that \nliving in a country with the best medical care in the world doesn't \nmatter if people can't access that care.\n  That is why almost 47 years ago he signed Medicare into law. On that \nday in July, President Johnson celebrated an American tradition that \n``calls upon us never to be indifferent toward despair. It commands us \nnever to turn away from helplessness. It directs us never to ignore or \nto spurn those who suffer untended in a land that is bursting with \nabundance.''\n  So we saved $500 billion in wasteful programs and other things in \nMedicare, we extended the life of it for a dozen years, and gave \nseniors the things I have talked about today: Filling the doughnut \nhole, prescription drugs, wellness checks, and all the other things \nthat are so important to them.\n  The affordable care act continues the tradition President Johnson \ncelebrated because it calls upon us never to be indifferent toward \ndespair, commands us to never turn away from helplessness, and directs \nus to never ignore or to spurn those who suffer untended in a land that \nis bursting with abundance.\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\n  The law makes certain that the richest Nation in this great world of \nours never again turns its back on the despair, helplessness, and many \ntimes hopelessness and suffering of the least among us. It guarantees \nno insurance company will ever again be putting a pricetag on human \nlife.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later today the Senate will take up and \nattempt to pass the JOBS Act. So we find ourselves once again on the \ncusp of passing a bipartisan jobs package that will make it easier for \nentrepreneurs and innovators to get the capital they need to build \nbusinesses and create jobs.\n  As I said yesterday, this bill had overwhelming bipartisan support \nover in the House. Nearly 400 Members voted for it, and the President \nhimself says it will create jobs. He supports it, and he would sign it \nwhen we get it to him.\n  Yet for some reason some in the Democratic-controlled Senate seem \nintent on slowing it down. Others want to essentially take a step \nactually backward and undermine a critical provision sponsored by \nSenators Toomey, Carper, and Hutchison included in the House bill, and \nthat was just this week, endorsed by the SEC's Forum on Small Business \nCapital Formation. The Reed amendment could subject thousands of \nbusinesses to SEC regulation unnecessarily, and the Senate should \nreject it.\n  So, once again, I ask them to reconsider. Let's put politics aside \nand pocket this important bipartisan jobs bill.\n  The JOBS Act is a great example of the type of legislation we should \nall be able to agree on, and there is simply no good reason for delay. \nLet's get this done. Let's get it to the President's desk and have him \nsign it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1957-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday I outlined a number of the \nbroken promises we have seen in connection with the new ObamaCare law: \nfrom the promise of being able to keep the plan you have and like, to \nthe promise of protecting Medicare, to the promise of lowering \npremiums, to the promise of lowering health care costs. Democrats also \nsaid taxes would not go up and existing conscience protections would be \nrespected.\n  Looking back, it seems like there was not anything our Democratic \nfriends, including the President, were not willing to promise in order \nto get the bill across the finish line. But there is another category \nof disappointments too; that is, in all the aspects of this bill \nDemocrats did not even talk about before it passed.\n  We all remember when Speaker Pelosi famously said: We have to pass \nthis bill so we can find out what is in it. One of the things Americans \nfound out about was something called the IPAB--the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board. This is an unelected, unaccountable board of \nbureaucrats empowered by this law to make additional cuts to Medicare \nbased on arbitrary cost control targets. As a result of this new board, \n15 bureaucrats would now have the power--without any accountability \nwhatsoever--to make changes to Medicare.\n  What is more, there is no judicial or administrative review of IPAB \npersonnel or recommendations. In other words, they are accountable to \nno one. IPAB is not answerable to voters, and it cannot be challenged \nin the courts.\n  Its main role, as the Wall Street Journal editorial board put it, \nwill be ``the inevitable dirty work of denying care''--``the inevitable \ndirty work of denying care.''\n  In an effort to control spending, IPAB will limit patient access to \nmedical care. It is that simple and, frankly, it is totally \nunacceptable.\n  Republicans recognize the problem with Medicare spending and the need \nfor reform. We also recognize that IPAB is not the answer.\n  This is just one more reason ObamaCare needs to be repealed and \nreplaced, and that is why even Democrats are cosponsoring a bill to \nrepeal it over in the House, calling it ``a flawed policy that will \nrisk beneficiary access to care.'' So this is not just a Republican \nissue; there is strong bipartisan opposition to this new law.\n  Look, if the President himself does not even want to talk about this \nlaw anymore, and even Democrats in the House are sponsoring repeal of \nparts of their own law, it should be pretty obvious there is a \nfundamental problem.\n  We need to reform health care. But this reform made things worse. The \nevidence and broken promises are all around us. It is time the \nPresident acknowledged it, and it is time the two parties came together \nand did something about it.\n  It is time to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with the kind of \ncommonsense reforms Americans want--reforms that actually lower costs \nand which put health care back in the hands of individuals and their \ndoctors rather than bureaucrats in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1957-5", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

They just want \nto go back to the old system where the insurance companies ran \neverything before, where people were thrown off their policies because \nthey had an illness, where because of preexisting conditions people \ncould not get health care coverage, where we had this big doughnut hole \nwhich we are now closing for the elderly?\n  The one aspect I want to focus on this morning in my brief time is an \nextraordinary element of the affordable care act that is not being \ntalked about a lot but which members of the committee I now am \nprivileged to chair, the HELP Committee, worked so hard to include in \nthe affordable care act; that is, the array of provisions that promote \nwellness, disease prevention, and public health.\n  Taken together, these provisions have begun to jump-start America's \ntransformation into a genuine wellness society. They are transforming \nour current sick care system into a true health care system. I have \nsaid this many times: We do not have a health care system in America. \nWe have a sick\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n\ncare system. If people get sick, they get care--one way or the other. \nBut there is very little out there to help people keep healthy and to \nmaintain wellness and to keep them from going to the hospital in the \nfirst place. Now, that would be a true health care system, and that is \nwhat we have begun to establish with the affordable care act, by \npreventing chronic diseases, enabling people to stay healthy, and stay \nout of hospitals in the first place.\n  Right now in the United States about 75 percent of all our health \ncare spending--75 percent of the Nation's health care spending--is on \nchronic diseases. Only 4 percent is spent for prevention. So during the \nlast year we have data for--2005--the United States spent about $2 \ntrillion on health care. Of every $1 spent, 75 cents went toward \ntreating patients with chronic diseases, many of which are preventable. \nOnly 4 cents went toward prevention. That ought to tell us something \nright there. That is the old system, and that is the system the \nRepublicans want us to go back to: Spending more and more to treat \npeople after they get sick rather than trying to put something forward \nto keep people healthy.\n  Well, in the affordable care act we have tremendous opportunities to \nagain move us to more prevention and wellness. We have made \nhistorically new investments in this area of wellness, prevention, and \npublic health. Here is one example of that, as shown on this chart.\n  Before our health care reform bill, our law, was passed, just take \nthe issue of colorectal cancer screening; we know, if people get it \nearly and detect it early, their chances of survival are tremendous. If \npeople detect it too late, then they are going to be in the hospital, \nand they are going to have cancer, they are not going to live. But we \nknow, by people getting a colorectal cancer screening early, we can \nprevent a lot of unnecessary deaths and illnesses and treatments later \non.\n  Cholesterol screening: We know if people get good cholesterol \nscreening, they can get on either a drug or a good diet, an exercise \nprogram, reducing the prevalence of heart disease.\n  Tobacco cessation: Need we keep repeating around here how much it \ncosts our society from the plague of tobacco use?\n  Well, here is where we were before health care reform, as shown on \nthis chart. About 68 percent were covered for colorectal cancer \nscreenings, about 57 percent were covered for cholesterol screenings, \nand only 4 percent were covered for tobacco cessation.\n  After health care reform, now there is 100 percent--100 percent--\ncoverage for colorectal screenings with no copays and deductibles, I \nmight add; 100 percent coverage for cholesterol screenings, and 100 \npercent coverage for tobacco cessation.\n  That is prevention, that is wellness, keeping people healthy in the \nfirst place. What do the Republicans want? They want to go back to what \nit was. We have made too much progress in prevention and wellness to go \nback to the old ways of just treating people after they get sick.\n  Now, again, we have been able to promote a lot of activities around \nthe country to promote health and wellness. For example, in Illinois, \nthe State made improvements to its sidewalks and marked crossings to \nincrease student physical activity levels. You might say: Well, big \ndeal.\n  Well, it is a big deal. Because of these improvements, the number of \nstudents who are walking to school has doubled--doubled--and it is \nexpected to save the school system about $67,000 a year just on bus \ncosts. So kids are healthier and we save money.\n  In Alabama, Mobile County is using funds from this prevention fund to \nsupport tobacco quit lines to help residents live tobacco free--again, \nunder the Tobacco Cessation Program.\n  Officials enacted a comprehensive smoke-free policy expected to \nprotect 13,000 of their residents--this is in Mobile County, AL--from \nbeing exposed to secondhand smoke. All across America, more and more is \nbeing invested in prevention. We know that, for example, a 5-percent \nreduction in the obesity rate--just a 5-percent reduction in the \nobesity rate--will yield more than $600 billion in savings on health \ncare costs over 20 years.\n  Again, our prevention fund is out there getting people the necessary \nsupport and information they need to reduce obesity. So with the \nmisguided efforts to repeal the health care reform law, again, most \nAmericans know what is at stake. They are going to lose a lot of these \nprevention activities that enable us to take charge of our own health \ncare to make sure we get our colonoscopies on time, our mammogram \nscreenings.\n  Every woman in America now over age 40 gets a free mammogram \nscreening--no copays, no deductibles. The Republicans want to take that \naway from the women of this country. Colonoscopies, as I said, without \ncopays or deductibles, Republicans want to take that away. Annual \nphysicals. We know a lot of people do not get annual physicals because \nit costs money. It costs them. Now they can get an annual physical \nfree--no copays, no deductibles. Republicans want to take that away.\n  Again, I think we have to ask the question--every time I hear the \nRepublicans talking about doing away with ObamaCare or the affordable \ncare act, we have to ask: Are we going to cut short this transformation \ninto a wellness society in preventing diseases, keeping people healthy \nin the first place? I think the answer is clear. Americans are not \ngoing to allow all these hard-earned protections and benefits in the \naffordable care act to be a taken away. We are not going to be dragged \nbackward. We are going to continue our march forward to make ourselves \nmore healthy. We are not going back to the old system, where only a \nlittle over half the people in this country got cholesterol screening, \n68 percent got colorectal cancer screening.\n  We want people to get early screening, early support services for \npreventive care so they stay healthy. Not only is it going to help our \nfamily budgets, it is going to help our Federal budget if we have \npeople healthier and not going to the hospital in the first place. This \nis one of the big aspects of the affordable care act that is not talked \nabout a lot. But to me it is one of the most important aspects of \nmoving us, again, to a society where we are not just relying on people \ngoing to the hospital and paying for high hospital bills and things \nsuch as that in the future.\n  I am going to yield the floor. I just wanted to make those comments \nabout one aspect of the affordable care act. Of course, we do know \nthere are many other benefits in the affordable care act people do not \nwant to lose. Right now, we ban lifetime limits, which helps more than \n100 million people. They want to take that away. Republicans want to \ntake that away. We cover vital preventive services, which I just went \nover; young people remaining on their parents' coverage up to age 26--\nmore than 2.5 million helped so far. Republicans want to take that \naway. They want to end all that. I do not think the American people \nwant to end it. I think the American people want to move forward with \nhealth care reform because we have made too much progress--too much \nprogress in making sure health insurance is affordable, available.\n  I guess I have just one more thing to say, if my friend from Rhode \nIsland will let me.\n  Everyone in this Senate body belongs to the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. Do you know what. We have coverage for preexisting \nconditions. We have no lifetime bans in our policies. Yet that is what \nwe did. Remember the debate? We wanted to say to the American people: \nWhatever we have, we want you to have too. We put that in the \naffordable care act.\n  The Republicans say: We are going to take that away from the American \npeople but keep it for ourselves. I do not think so. I do not think so. \nI do not think the American people want to say: You Senators and you \nCongressmen can keep all that, but you can take it away from all of us. \nWe are not going to do it. We are not going to go backward.\n  I yield the floor for my distinguished friend from Rhode Island who \nplayed such a pivotal role in getting the affordable care act through \non our committee and has been one of the more eloquent spokespersons on \nthis health care bill in the last couple years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1959-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1959-S1960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me first congratulate Chairman Harkin for his \nremarks today but more than that the work that has preceded today on \nthe health care bill. He was an ardent advocate for the prevention \nprograms that save lives and money. It was a real pleasure to work with \nhim at that time.\n  Today is the second anniversary of the passage of the affordable care \nact. I wish to describe how the law is already making a difference for \nfamilies in Rhode Island and across the country by drastically \nimproving access to higher quality care, by addressing rising health \ncare costs, and by protecting consumers.\n  Look at the changes. Children with preexisting conditions were denied \ncoverage--no longer. Lifetime limits on insurance policies left many \nAmerican families struggling to pay medial care bills on their own--no \nlonger. Insurers could cancel coverage for individuals who became \nsick--no longer.\n  In addition, the law helps kids just out of school who all too often \ncannot get that first job with health insurance. It helps them to stay \non their parents' insurance policies until age 26. For seniors, \nprescription drug costs are down as the Medicare doughnut hole begins \nto close. This is real change, and it hits home in my home State of \nRhode Island. I hear from Rhode Islanders and I listen.\n  I heard from Greg, a father in Providence, who told me about his 16-\nyear-old son Will. Will spends 2 hours every day undergoing treatment \nto keep his cystic fibrosis in check. In addition to his daily \ntreatment and prescriptions, Will sees a specialist four times a year \nto monitor the disease. Greg said he often thinks about his son Will's \nfuture and whether his son will be able to maintain health insurance \ncoverage and receive the treatment he needs.\n  Thanks to the affordable care act, Will does not have to worry about \ninsurance companies denying him coverage because he has a preexisting \ncondition or fear that he will have to go without treatment because his \nmedical bills will have pushed him over some arbitrary lifetime limit.\n\n  As many as 374,000 Rhode Islanders, including 89,000 children similar \nto Will, can now receive the treatments they need free from lifetime \nlimits on coverage. People who want to repeal ObamaCare should be ready \nto look Greg in the eye and tell him why they want to take that away \nfrom him and his son.\n  Olive, a senior from Woonsocket, shared with me that her husband \ntakes several medicines to help treat his Alzheimer's disease. A 3-\nmonth supply for two of his medications costs close to $1,000. As Olive \nsaid: Those months go by quickly. Last year, Olive and her husband fell \ninto the prescription drug doughnut hole in July. Without the \naffordable care act, they would have been responsible for paying the \nfull cost of his medications out of pocket, but because of health care \nreform, Olive and her husband received a discount on their prescription \ndrugs and saved $2,400 last year.\n  Olive and her husband are 2 of the over 14,800 Rhode Islanders who \nreceived a 50-percent discount on brand-name prescription drugs when \nthey hit the doughnut hole. This discount resulted in an average \nsavings of over $550 per person, for a total savings of more than $8.2 \nmillion for seniors in Rhode Island alone.\n  People who want to repeal ObamaCare should be ready to look Olive in \nthe eye and tell her why that $8.2 million should go back into the drug \ncompanies' pockets, why she and her husband should have to cough up an \nextra $2,400 for the drug companies.\n  Brianne, a 22-year-old graduate of the University of Rhode Island, \ncurrently works part time as a physical therapy aid in Providence. Her \njob does not offer health insurance. Brianne suffers from several \nseasonal and food allergies. She makes frequent trips to her allergist. \nBecause of the affordable care act, Brianne can stay on her mother's \nhealth insurance so she can continue to get the treatment she needs. \nWithout this coverage, Brianne said, she would be hard-pressed to \nafford the treatments necessary to address her allergies.\n  As of June of last year, Brianne was 1 of over 7,500 young adults in \nRhode Island who gained insurance coverage as a result of the reform \nlaw. People who want to repeal ObamaCare need to explain to Brianne why \nshe and those other 7,500 Rhode Island kids should be kicked off their \nparents' policy.\n  The affordable care act has also brought needed relief to employers \nthat are still the leading source of health coverage in the United \nStates. Geoff is a small business owner in Providence. He provides \nhealth care insurance for his employees because, as he said, ``It's the \nright thing to do.'' But the rising costs of his employees' health \ninsurance have placed increased pressure on his business. Geoff's \nbusiness qualified for the health care law's small business health care \ntax credit, which covers up to 35 percent of premiums paid by a small \nbusiness owners for its employees' coverage. These credits are a \nlifeline for small businesses that are struggling in today's difficult \neconomy and for the people those small businesses employ. People who \nwant to repeal ObamaCare need to look Geoff in the eye and tell him why \nthey want to take away that tax credit lifeline that lets him provide \ncoverage for his employees.\n  The affordable care act also provided support for community health \ncenters. In Rhode Island, similar to elsewhere in the country, \ncommunity health centers fill a critical gap in our health care system, \ndelivering comprehensive, preventive, and primary care to patients, \nregardless of their ability to pay.\n  Dennis Roy is the CEO of the East Bay Community Action Program in \nRhode Island. He tells me the affordable care act has provided critical \nsupport for his community health center's mission. East Bay has \nreceived $3 million through this law to construct a new community \nhealth center in Newport which, despite its international reputation, \nis one of Rhode Island's poorer cities. The new community health center \nwill triple the available patient care space for needy Newport County \nresidents.\n  To date, Rhode Island community health centers have received $14.8 \nmillion to create new health center sites in medically underserved \nareas. This is important American infrastructure, and we should not \ntear it down to make a political point or to assuage a political \nideology. These stories are just a few of many that show how the \naffordable care act is working for Rhode Island families, seniors, and \nsmall businesses.\n  Although we have made great progress, the work continues. Over the \nlast 2 years, a tremendous effort has been made by the health care \nindustry, by State and local leaders, and by the Obama administration \nto develop a better model of health care delivery, to shift from a \nsystem that is disorganized and fragmented to one that is coordinated, \nis efficient, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve.\n  Private health care providers, such as Geisinger, Intermountain, and \nthe Marshfield Clinic, are already focusing on quality rather than \nquantity, efficiency rather than volume, to better serve their patients \nand their bottom line. Because of the affordable care act, the Federal \nGovernment now has the opportunity to support and encourage their focus \nand to deliver much needed savings in the most patient-centered way, by \nimproving the quality of care and health outcomes.\n  There is tremendous potential for improved care and cost savings in \nfive key areas: payment reform, primary and preventive care, measuring \nand reporting quality, administrative simplification, and health \ninformation technology.\n  Savings, from a range of responsible viewpoints, run from $700 \nbillion to $1 trillion a year, all without compromising the quality of \ncare Americans have come to expect--indeed, likely improving the \nquality of care.\n  I will shortly release a report to Chairman Harkin and the HELP \nCommittee on the Obama administration's implementation of the delivery \nsystem reform provisions of the affordable care act. When I say \n``delivery system reform,'' I mean those provisions that\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\nimprove the quality of care, avoid medical errors, coordinate care \nbetter, reward prevention and primary care, reduce administrative \noverhead, and reward who gets the best health outcomes, not who orders \nthe most treatment procedures.\n  I worked with Senator Mikulski on this project. She authored the key \ndelivery provisions of the law and has great expertise in this area.\n  These changes will make a real difference for millions of Americans, \nand I look forward to sharing the report and its findings with my \ncolleagues next week.\n  Before I close, I would like to acknowledge Rhode Island's work on a \nState health insurance exchange provided for by the affordable care \nact. Rhode Island is leading the way as the first State to receive \nlevel two grant funding to set up the exchange. The exchanges are \ncommonsense, local, competitive marketplaces where individuals and \nsmall businesses will be able to purchase health insurance, with the \nprices and benefits out there on display. When insurance companies \ncompete for your business on a transparent, level playing field, it \nwill drive down costs. Exchanges will let individuals and small \nbusinesses use their purchasing power to drive down costs, much like \nbig businesses are able to do.\n  Progress has been made by State leaders such as our Lieutenant \nGovernor Elizabeth Roberts, who is leading this effort to get to this \npoint. They are remarkable. I urge them to keep up the good work.\n  Whether it is changing the lives of Gregg and Will or Olive or \nBrianne or Geoff and his employees or whether it is building our \ncommunity health center infrastructure or supporting the private sector \nleaders who are pivoting to a new and better and more efficient \ndelivery system or whether it is something as simple as a marketplace \nfor health insurance that is open, fair, and on the level, the \naffordable care act has made a real difference for hard-working \nfamilies in Rhode Island. I will continue to work hard alongside these \nleading health care providers, alongside the Obama administration, and \nalongside my colleagues in the Congress to see the full promise of the \naffordable care act realized for this great Nation's advantage.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are going to talk about Medicare today \nand the way the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act cuts into \nMedicare, destroys Medicare.\n  Two years ago the President wanted a health care bill in the worst \nway, and that is exactly what he got, and that is exactly what America \ngot.\n  Anybody out there on Medicare or about to be on Medicare or young \nenough that someday they will be on Medicare should be very concerned \nabout what happened under this act. All of you, I am sure, are aware of \nsomebody who is on Medicare who has already been denied a doctor; they \nare being denied because they are not being paid what they ought to be \npaid.\n  To call it the ``patient protection'' and ``affordable'' care act is \na major mistake. It neither protects Medicare patients nor makes it \nmore affordable. In fact, one of the things we will bring out today is \nthat there has been a theft of $500 billion from Medicare to fund other \nparts of the program. There is some fraud in it because it was spent, \nbut it still shows up in the account. That is how they show that this \nreally doesn't add to the debt. To solve the whole thing, they have a \nwhole new board of unelected bureaucrats to make additional cuts to \nMedicare to make it look as though it is OK. And then there is the \naccounting sleight of hand. I am one of the two accountants in the \nSenate now, and you have to pay attention to see it. It goes back to \nthe fraud because if this same sort of thing were being done in the \nprivate sector, people would go to jail.\n  There are a number of ways that we will bring out how that is not \njust budget gimmicks and sleight of hand but is actually taking \nadvantage of seniors.\n  The Chief Medicare Actuary said that Medicare will go broke in 2024. \nThat is 5 years earlier than last year's report by the Chief Medicare \nActuary. He is the guy who works for Medicare; he doesn't work for us. \nHe has to figure out each year how much in the hole it is and what \nneeds to be done to fix it.\n  My contention, of course, is that you can't steal $500 billion out of \na program that is already going broke and expect it to be fine. We \nwarned about that as we were going through the passage of this Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, which, as already mentioned, was \npassed 2 years ago tomorrow. It could have been fixed. There were three \nplans on the Republican side that would have done what is claimed to be \ndone by this act. Those ideas were largely rejected.\n  Today we are going to talk about some thefts, fraud, unelected \nbureaucrats, and accounting sleight of hand. I have some people here \nwho want to respond to some of the things that have been said.\n  Senator Coburn has listened to some comments made on the other side \ncelebrating this great day.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened very intently to the first two \nspeakers this morning. As somebody who has now been a physician for \nalmost 30 years--I practiced full time for over 25 years--I heard the \nSenator from Iowa and what his desire would be on the chart he showed. \nHe said that 100 percent screening is occurring now in three areas. \nThat isn't true. We are not screening. We hope to screen, and we hope \nto screen 100 percent, but the facts on screening that are available \nare that it is only used 5 percent by Medicare patients on the \nscreening that was already available with no cost to Medicare patients. \nSo we have to distinguish between what we desire and what is actually \ngoing to happen.\n\n  Let's take the example of colon screening. I am a colon cancer \nsurvivor. I was diagnosed, through colonoscopy, with colon cancer. \nLet's take that example, and then let's take the example of the other \naspect of the affordable care act, called the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board. What is the purpose of that Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board? Its purpose is to cut the cost of Medicare through the \ndecreasing of reimbursements--first, for the first 8 years, physicians \nand outside providers, and then, starting in 2019, hospitals. What do \nyou think the first thing to be cut will be? It is the reimbursement \nrate for a colonoscopy. So when the reimbursement rate for a \ncolonoscopy goes below the cost--and it is very close right now, by the \nway, the cost to perform a colonoscopy versus what Medicare \nreimburses--when that is cut, what do you think will happen on \nscreening?\n  The goal of changing health care is an admirable goal. We know that \n$1 in $3 doesn't help anybody get well or prevent them from getting \nsick today. But what the American people need to understand is that \nwhat is coming about is a group of 15 unelected bureaucrats, who cannot \nbe challenged in court, who cannot be challenged on the floor of the \nSenate or the House, mandating price reductions to control the cost of \nMedicare. What does that ultimately mean? They will do their job. We \nwon't be able to do anything about it. But what it means is that they \nwill reimburse at levels less than the cost to do services, and so, \nconsequently, what will happen is the services won't be there.\n  They also are going to do what is called comparative effectiveness \nresearch. We know about comparative effectiveness research. If you are \na practicing physician today, you have to do continuing medical \neducation. Part of that medical education is knowing the latest \ncomparative effectiveness research. It is as if they are reinventing\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\nsomething that already exists. But the point is that they are going to \nuse that to deny or change payments for procedures that patients need.\n  What is wrong with all of this? It is that we are inserting a \ngovernment board and government bureaucrat between the patient and the \ndoctor.\n  Think about that for a minute. When I go to my doctor, I don't want \nhim concentrating about anything except me. If he is looking over his \nshoulder about whether he met the IPAB's comparative effectiveness \nstudy on what he is doing for me, when, in fact, the art of medicine as \nwell as the science may say they are wrong, and he is going to do what \nthe government says rather than what he thinks is best for me, what am \nI getting for that?\n  I will be on Medicare next year, much to my regret, because my \nchoices will now be limited in terms of who I can see. The greatest \nthreat to the quality of care--it wasn't intended to be this way, it \nwas intended to be helpful, and I don't doubt the motives of anybody \nwho set this board up--but the greatest threat to quality of care for \nseniors in this country is the Independent Payment Advisory Board and \ntheir noncaring position. Because they are going to be looking at \nnumbers and words. They are never going to lay their hands on the \npatient, they are never going to impact a patient directly, they are \nnever going to listen to a patient, but they are going to make the \nultimate decisions based on what that patient is going to get.\n  With that, I yield back to my colleague.\n  Mr. ENZI. But that board was made essential by decisions that were \nmade in the health care bill. In the health care bill, we took $500 \nbillion--$\\1/2\\ trillion--that should have stayed with Medicare to \nsolve Medicare problems.\n  The doc fix is one of the big problems we need to solve. It is up to \nabout, I think, $230 billion that we need to do that. That would be a \npretty good chunk out of this. And unless that is done, people won't be \nable to see a doctor.\n  I keep saying, if you can't see a doctor, you really don't have \nhealth insurance, and that is what we are going to be doing to our \nseniors. We cut $135 billion from hospitals, we cut $120 billion from \nthe 11 million seniors who are on Medicare Advantage, we took $15 \nbillion from nursing homes, and we took $7 billion from hospices to \nspend on programs that have nothing to do with Medicare or those \nthings. That is fraud, and it shouldn't have happened.\n  The CBO Actuary and the Chief Medicare Actuary have acknowledged this \nreality. Incidentally, the Chief Medicare Actuary says the program is \ngoing to go broke in 2024, and CBO says it will happen in 2016. Now \n2016 is pretty short term to be fixed. I think 2024 is short term. So \nwhichever estimate you want to take, Medicare is in trouble and $500 \nbillion should not have been taken out of it. That $500 billion should \nhave been dedicated to fixing Medicare.\n  We still have to fix Medicare, and the only solution we have come up \nwith is the one Senator Coburn mentioned, which is to form this new \nboard, with surprising powers, that is going to be able to cut some \nmore in Medicare so it doesn't look as though we stole $500 billion \nfrom Medicare.\n  Senator Burr is on the committee. He has had to sit through a lot of \nthe hearings and a lot of the amendments that were never passed from \nour side that would have fixed this, and I am sure he has some \ncomments.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator from Wyoming and my colleague from \nOklahoma. We have worked on this, spent tireless hours trying to save \nnot just Medicare but health care as we know it in America today. I \nthink what my colleague has already mentioned is that we have put in \nplace mechanisms in law that will dismantle a health care system the \nAmerican people feel comfortable with and that has served them well but \nthat we agree is way too expensive. Look at the examples Dr. Coburn has \ntalked about--IPAB, the independent board that will make coverage \ndecisions and reimbursement decisions. When you cut reimbursements, you \nare going to chase doctors out of the system. As you cut \nreimbursements, you are going to defund the hospital's ability to keep \nthe doors open in rural America.\n  But let's look at the things that are not obvious. What does that \neffort by IPAB do to innovation in health care? What companies are \ngoing to go out and put $1 billion on the line for development of a new \ndrug or a device given they do not think they can recover enough \nthrough the reimbursement system to cover their research and \ndevelopment, much less the approval process of the products? It would \nbe a vastly different America if in fact all these drugs that are \nbreakthroughs and the devices that are so effective at keeping us \nliving longer are sold in Europe and South America and Asia but not in \nthe United States because we have now developed a health care system \nthat doesn't allow them the ability to recover that money. Now match \nthat with the lack of choice today.\n  In this country, we have choice. As a matter of fact, as a Federal \nemployee, I can pick from probably 30 different health care plans--the \nsame ones every Federal employee can choose from. But all of a sudden, \nin this health care bill, we have said to seniors: You know that \nMedicare Advantage which allowed you choice, where you could choose a \nprovider other than the Federal Government? Well, we are going to take \nthat away from you. Now, we didn't take it away, we just said we are \nnot going to reimburse them to the degree that allows them to offer the \nplans.\n  Let's look at what Medicare Advantage provided for seniors. It \nprovided a wider array of benefits than does traditional Medicare. It \nis good for some. They have chosen it. It won't be good for them in the \nfuture, if this health care bill is not reversed, because through the \nactions of IPAB and through the explicit language of the bill, Medicare \nAdvantage will not be an advantage anymore, and everybody will have to \ndefault to the government plan that probably won't be as expansive with \npreventive care.\n  I know the Senator from Wyoming knows that in North Carolina we sort \nof lead the country as the model of medical homes. We are on the verge \nthere of trying to put seniors into medical homes. We have already done \nit with a Medicaid population. We have saved money. But my State of \nNorth Carolina this year has a gap of about $500 million in Medicaid--\nthe people we are responsible for and the money we have allocated for \nit, even though the last 3 years we have saved almost $1 billion by \nbeing creative at how we designed our Medicaid. This health care \ninitiative, with no input from any State, will double the population of \nMedicaid beneficiaries in North Carolina. So what have we done? We have \nshifted the responsibility down to the State at the State taxpayer \nlevel.\n\n  We didn't magically change anything in health care. We are \nreallocating where we are collecting the money from, and every State is \nthe same. They underpay for reimbursements under Medicaid, doctors \nlimit the number of patients they see that are Medicaid patients. \nImagine what happens when we double the size of the Medicaid population \nin America. Hospitals don't have the ability to limit. They are under \nFederal law that says when someone shows up, they have to see them.\n  What we are going to do is probably attempt to bankrupt the \ninfrastructure that we have for health care for the simple reason that \nrather than fix health care, we came up with creative ways to pay for \nit. Or in the case of IPAB--the Independent Payment Advisory Board--we \nfigured out an external way from Congress to cut the reimbursements to \ndoctors and to hospitals and to limit the coverage of all plans where \nit doesn't have to go through a legislative process in Washington. We \nare not always the finest example of legislation becoming law, but this \nis the mechanism our Founding Fathers set up to make sure bad things \ndidn't happen.\n  I have to say this is one that slipped through, and now we have the \nresponsibility to go back and fix the pieces of it that would be \ndevastating to the future of health care in this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming for letting me share some time.\n  Mr. ENZI. I think the Senator too would be interested in the \naccounting and some of the sleight of hand involved in the prescription \nPart D. We put a prescription Part D in so people would have a little \nbetter chance of paying for their prescriptions--a very difficult \nprogram. It was very expensive.\n  I know in my State we were looking at only two people who were \nselling\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\npharmaceuticals to seniors. I thought, boy, when this program goes in, \nthere probably won't be any. But when it was opened to a wide choice, I \nfound out there were 46 companies that wanted the business in Wyoming, \nand it turned out to be a very successful program at helping people.\n  In this affordable care act, of course, they do some things with the \ndoughnut hole which are a little sleight of hand, because some of the \ncompanies that sell brandname prescription drugs agreed they would \nreimburse people for a part or up to all of their medications while \nthey went through that doughnut hole, knowing when they got out of the \ndoughnut hole they would stay with that brandname and it would cost the \nwhole program a lot more.\n  So in an area where we were saving money and could have fixed it so \nseniors had a better chance at it but not giving an advantage to the \nbrandname drug users would have actually saved some money in the \nprogram, but that didn't happen. I know since my colleague is involved \na lot in the pharmaceutical area, and has done a tremendous job at \nmaking sure we are safe from terrorist attacks and pandemic flus and \nworked with vaccinations, and is probably the foremost person at both \nends of the building at knowing how to do that, he may have some \ncomments on this prescription Part D.\n  Mr. BURR. Well, I thank my colleague for that acknowledgment, and \nthat is why the thought that innovation would leave the American health \ncare system terrifies me. Innovation is the answer to the threats, both \nnatural and intentional, that could come to this country and everywhere \nin the world. We never know what is around the corner. But our ability \nto innovate in this country has always kept us one step ahead, and I \nbelieve we are on the cusp of a new era of innovation that can only be \nthwarted if in fact this health care bill is fully implemented. Because \nthe incentive will now be gone for entrepreneurs to take risks. There \nis no longer going to be an incentive that says take a risk and there \nis an opportunity at a reward.\n  As the Senator from Wyoming pointed out very well, we created \nMedicare Part D. What a novel approach, to take a health care benefit \nthat didn't exist in the 1960s, when we created Medicare and matched it \nup with the coverage of the rest of the delivery system. What was the \nresult of creating market-based coverage? Today, Medicare Part D costs \n50 percent less than the estimate we made years ago when we created it \nin terms of what the annual premium cost was going to be. Why? It is \nbecause we created private sector competition. We didn't create \ngovernment plans. It probably would have been much easier to say, okay, \nwe are going to supply a benefit for every senior in the country. I can \nassure you, had we done that, we would have been well over what we \nprojected the annual cost to be. But we are 50 percent under because we \nhave private sector entrepreneurial companies out there competing for \nthe business, and they are smart enough to look at the types of \ncoverage needed and they are custom designing that to meet the needs of \nseniors in this country.\n  I daresay the current health care plan that is going to be \nimplemented and fully executed by 2014 was not personalized for anybody \nin this country. It looks at a 17-year-old the same way as it does a \n77-year-old. Yet the health challenges and the incomes are different \nfor both ends of the spectrum, and that is because government can't \nlook at us as individuals. They can't group us and design something \nthat addresses not just the coverage needs but the costs long term and \nthe solvency.\n  So we only have one choice, and that is to fix what is broken. It is \namazing how there is great agreement on those things that would be \ndamaged long term and those things that are actually positive and move \nthe ball in the right direction.\n  Mr. ENZI. So that prescription Part D actually drove down the cost of \nmedication, and now we are ending up in a situation where part of that \nwill be in trouble because of what has happened to Medicare, with $500 \nbillion being stolen.\n  I see we are joined by Senator Lee of Utah, and I know that Utah has \nhad a health care system that has been a model for other States and now \nis possibly in jeopardy. I don't know if the Senator would care to \ncomment on Medicare or on that, but we appreciate his coming.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank my colleague. And he is correct, Utah does indeed \nhave a health care system that functions well, and functions well \nnotwithstanding the fact it is not managed, it is not governed by the \nFederal Government.\n  This is one of the great wonders of our Federal system. When we \nbecame a country about 200-plus years ago, we did so against a backdrop \nthat is informative for us still today. We became a country, in part, \nbecause we discovered through trial and error, through our experience \nas British colonies, that local self-rule works best. People govern \nthemselves much better than a large distant government can govern them. \nThat is exactly why we became a country, because we learned that local \nself-rule works.\n  We learned also that there is great danger to our individual liberty \nwith any government, because whenever any government acts, whenever it \ndoes anything to regulate our lives, it does so at the expense of our \nindividual liberty. We become less free by degrees whenever government \ndoes just about anything.\n  But the risk to our liberty is especially great--it is at its \nhighest--when the acting government is a large one, when it is a \nnational government. National governments, as we learned in our \nexperience with our national government before we became a country--our \nnational government that was then based in London--national governments \ntend to tax us too much, they tend to regulate us too heavily, they \ntend to be inefficient, they tend to be slow to respond to our needs in \npart because they are operating so distantly from where many of the \npeople reside.\n  So when we became a country, we left most of the powers at the State \nand the local level. We eventually came up with this document, this \nalmost 225-year-old document that has fostered the development of the \ngreatest civilization the world has ever known. And in that document we \ncame up with a list of powers that a national government must have in \norder to survive, and we kept that list fairly limited. We said the \nnational government needs to have the power to provide for our national \ndefense, to regulate commerce or trade between the States and with \nforeign nations and with the Indian tribes, to protect trademarks, \ncopyrights, and patents, to establish a uniform system of weights and \nmeasures, to come up with a system of bankruptcy laws, laws governing \nimmigration and naturalization, and a few other powers. But that is \nbasically it.\n  There is no power in this document that gives our national \ngovernment, that gives us--Congress, as a national legislature--the \npower to regulate anything and everything. There is nothing in this \ndocument that gives Congress what jurists and political scientists \nrefer to as general police powers; that is, the power to come up with \nany law that Congress might deem just and good and appropriate and \nadvisable at any moment. That, again, was because of the calculated \nassessment made by the founding generation that we needed a government \npossessing only limited enumerated powers: to protect individual \nliberty, and to assure that we in America would continue to live as \nfree individuals.\n  Over time we have drifted somewhat in our understanding of what those \npowers mean. Over the last 75 years, the Supreme Court has been \napplying a deferential standard toward Congress in reviewing laws \nenacted under the commerce clause, clause 3 of article 1, section 8. \nThe Supreme Court has, since about 1937--at least since 1942--said that \nCongress may regulate without interference from the courts under the \ncommerce clause activities that, when measured in the aggregate, when \nreplicated across every State, can be said substantially to affect \ninterstate commerce. That is more or less the guideline the Court has \ngiven us. They are not necessarily saying that everything and anything \nthat fits within that is necessarily within the letter and the spirit \nof the Constitution, but that, at least so far as the courts are \nconcerned, so far as the courts have been willing to step in and \nvalidate or invalidate, that will be what guides the courts in making \nthat assessment. Beyond that, the debate has to be hammered out within \nthe Halls of Congress.\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\n  The affordable care act--also known as Obamacare--contains an \nindividual health insurance mandate that takes Congress's powers to a \nwhole new level. For the first time in American history, our national \nlegislature has required every American in every part of this country \nto purchase a particular product; not just any product but health \ninsurance; not just any health insurance but that specific kind of \nhealth insurance that Congress, in its wisdom, deemed appropriate and \nnecessary for every American to buy. This is absolutely without \nprecedent. It is also, I believe, not defensible even under the broad \ndeferential standard that has been applied by the U.S. Supreme Court \nsince the late 1930s and early 1940s.\n  Among other things, the limits that have been maintained by the \nSupreme Court, notwithstanding its deference to Congress under the \ncommerce clause, have been limited by a few principles.\n  First, the Supreme Court has continued to insist that although some \nintrastate activities will be regulated by Congress under the commerce \nclause, some activities occurring entirely within one State--activities \nthat historically would have been regarded as the exclusive domain of \nStates, activities such as labor, manufacturing, agriculture and \nmining--although some activities might be covered by Congress, those \nactivities at a minimum have to be activities that impose a substantial \nburden or obstruction on interstate commerce or on Congress's \nregulation of interstate commerce.\n  The Supreme Court has also continued to insist that the activity in \nquestion that is being regulated needs to be activity, first of all, \nand not inactivity. But it also needs to involve economic activity in \nmost circumstances, unless, of course, it is the kind of activity that, \nwhile ostensibly noneconomic, by its very nature undercuts a larger \ncomprehensive regulation of activity that is itself economic.\n  Finally, the Supreme Court has continued to insist time and time \nagain that Congress cannot, in the name of regulating interstate \ncommerce, effectively obliterate the distinction between what is \nnational and what is local.\n  The affordable care act through its individual mandate effectively \nblows past each and every one of these restrictions, restrictions that \neven under the broad deferential approach the Supreme Court has taken \ntoward the regulation of commerce by Congress over the last 75 years or \nso--even the Supreme Court, even under these broad standards, isn't \nwilling to go this far. There are very good reasons for that, and those \nreasons have to do with our individual liberty. They have to do with \nthe fact that Americans were always intended to live free, and they \nunderstood that they are more likely to be free when decisions of great \nimportance need to be hammered out at the State and local level; that \nis, unless those decisions have been specifically delegated to \nCongress, specifically designated as national responsibilities. This \none is not.\n  Decisions about where you go to the doctor and how you are going to \npay for it are not decisions that are national in nature, according to \nthe text and spirit and letter and history and understanding of the \nConstitution. They are not, and they cannot be.\n  If in this instance we say, well, this is important so we need to \nallow Congress to act--if we do that, we do so at our own peril. We \nstand to lose a great deal if all of a sudden we allow Congress to \nregulate something that is not economic activity; in fact, it is not \nactivity at all. It is inaction. It is a decision by an individual \nperson whether to purchase anything, whether to purchase health \ninsurance or, if so, what kind of health insurance to purchase. Our \nvery liberties are at stake, and that is why I find this concerning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thought I had 2 more minutes. I appreciate \nthe comments.\n  This is the 2-year anniversary of passing what is the so-called \naffordable patient care act. The Supreme Court has chosen next week to \nbegin the deliberations on it, and they are going to take three times \nas long as they do on any case so that they can divide this into \npieces, and that mandate piece will be the second one.\n  One that they probably won't be going into is this Medicare problem. \nWe are going to have seniors who are going to be without care because \nwe have taken $500 billion out of Medicare when it needed a doc fix and \nit needed a whole bunch of other things, and particularly in rural \nareas where there are critical access hospitals, rural health clinics. \nCan any reasonable person believe that you can cut $\\1/2\\ trillion from \na program and not affect its impact on patient care?\n  I wish to have more time to show that there is a theft of this $500 \nbillion, there is fraud involved, that there are bureaucrats and \naccounting sleight of hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1963-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a few hours, after votes on two \namendments that I hope we will pass, we are going to vote on final \npassage of the House of Representatives-passed bill, the so-called JOBS \nbill. I am going to vote against passage of this bill because it would \nremain far too deeply flawed even if the two amendments were passed to \njustify passage by the Senate. I am going to vote no on this bill \nbecause it will significantly weaken existing protections for investors \nagainst fraud and abuse.\n  The supporters of this bill claim it will help to create jobs. They \nhave even titled it the JOBS Act, but there is no evidence it will help \ncreate new jobs. There is not one study that its proponents have shown \nus how repealing provisions that protects us from conflicts of interest \nin the research coverage of companies with up to $1 billion in revenue \nwill create jobs; nor is there evidence that removing transparency and \ndisclosure requirements for very large companies will create jobs; nor \nis there evidence that allowing unregulated stock sales to those unable \nto assess or withstand high-risk investments will create jobs; nor is \nthere much else in this bill that will, even arguably, help create \njobs. It will, however, take the cop off the beat relative to the \nactivities of some huge banks, and it will threaten damage to the \nhonesty and integrity of our financial markets.\n  That is a mistake in its own right. We should value honesty and \nintegrity in markets, as in all things. And legislation that creates \nnew opportunities for fraud and abuse should be amended or rejected. \nBut the damage done by this bill to the integrity of our markets will \nalso work against the purported goal of this bill--the encouragement of \ninvestment to create jobs.\n  By making our financial markets less transparent, less honest, and \nless accountable, this legislation threatens to discourage investors \nfrom participating in capital markets. That damage would make it \nharder--not easier--for companies to attract the capital that they need \nand to hire new workers.\n  Our capital markets are the envy of the world, and that is in part \nbecause\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nwe recognize that efficient markets that help businesses raise capital \nand aim to match up investors in companies need transparency and they \nneed financial integrity. But this bill will allow companies to make \nfewer disclosures and will remove important investor safeguards. This \nbill will increase many types of risks to investors, including the risk \nof outright fraud. I want to focus on a few of the many serious flaws \nin this bill.\n  First, it harms investors by allowing a wide range of companies to \navoid basic requirements for disclosure and transparency. It does that \nby changing the threshold at which companies are considered large \nenough and their stock is widely enough held to trigger those \ndisclosure requirements. Today, companies are generally required to \nregister with the SEC and meet basic requirements for financial \ntransparency and accountability if they have 500 or more shareholders. \nThe bill before us would raise that exemption to 2,000 or even more \nshareholders. It would even raise the level at which banks can \nderegister from 300 to 1,200 or more shareholders regardless of the \nbank's size in terms of assets. These changes will allow even very \nlarge companies with several thousand shareholders to avoid telling \nregulators, shareholders, and potential shareholders even the most \nbasic information about their finances, and to avoid important \naccounting standards.\n  Second, this bill harms investors by allowing companies to make \nlargely unregulated private stock offerings to members of the public. \nToday, such inherently risky, unregulated offerings cannot be \nadvertised to the public and are generally limited to shareholders who \nare financially able to absorb the risks involved. But the House bill \nallows advertisement of these unregulated offerings to the general \npublic. It will allow TV ads for get-rich-quick schemes with almost no \noversight. Advertisers could pitch these risky investments in cold \ncalls to senior citizen centers. That is why groups such as AARP are \ndeeply concerned about what these changes will do to senior citizens \nwho are often the targets of financial fraud and abuse.\n  Third, this bill abandons a lesson that we learned all too painfully \nduring the dot-com crisis of the 1990s. At that time, investment banks \nseeking to underwrite initial public offerings--which is a lucrative \nline of business--engaged in brazen conflicts of interest. They sought \nthis business by promising companies about to go public that their \nresearch analysts--whom investors depend on for honest and impartial \nadvice--would give favorable coverage to their stocks in exchange for \nthe underwriting business.\n  In company after company, investors were misled about the strength of \nnew stocks by investment banks engaging in this conflict of interest. \nThis abuse helped to feed a stock bubble that, when it burst, wiped out \ninvestors, evaporated companies, and it devastated the economy. The \nNasdaq index still, to this day, has not recovered from that bubble. As \na result, regulators put up barriers designed to end these conflicts, \nbut the House bill before us knocks down those barriers. It is \nastonishing that we would forget these lessons and allow the return of \nsuch blatant conflicts of interest.\n  Fourth, this bill will allow very large companies, companies with up \nto $1 billion in annual revenue, to make initial public offerings \nwithout complying with basic disclosure and accountability standards. \nThese companies would be able to avoid compliance with accounting and \ndisclosure rules to help give investors accurate information on the \ncompany's finances. They would not have to obey standard accounting \nrules or have auditors certify that they have adequate internal \ncontrols. Many of these rules were adopted in response to high-profile \naccounting frauds, such as Enron and WorldCom. Some were recently \nenacted in the Dodd-Frank Act in the wake of the financial crisis.\n  Yet while our economy is still recovering from the damage of the most \nrecent crisis that arose, in large part, as a result of deregulation, \nwe are about to consider undoing safeguards we created in its wake. The \n$1 billion limit of the House bill will allow nearly 90 percent of the \nIPOs to avoid even the most basic disclosure standards. With these \nprovisions, we will essentially ask America's investors to place their \ncapital at risk almost blindly, with little if any reliable information \nabout the companies seeking their investment. It defies common sense to \nargue that investors will be more likely to put their money at risk and \ntherefore help to create jobs in that kind of environment.\n  This is a bad bill. Because debate was closed off and amendments \nseverely limited, we will not be able to fix nearly enough of it. But \nwe will hopefully remedy a few of its flaws in amendments we are going \nto be voting on. Change to the crowdfunding provisions of the House \nbill is welcome, and I commend Senators Merkley, Bennet, and others who \ncrafted that provision which Senators Reed, Landrieu, and I also \nincorporated in our substitute bill, which was defeated yesterday. This \namendment will give investors somewhat greater confidence in a new and \npotentially useful method in establishing capital and in support of \nSenator Reed's amendment to close important loopholes in the current \nlaw--one the House bill fails to address. With this amendment, it will \nbe harder to evade registration and disclosure requirements by using \nshareholders of record who exist only on paper but who hold shares for \nlarge numbers of actual beneficial owners. This, too, is part of our \nsubstitute, and its inclusion in the bill would represent an \nimprovement.\n  But we should not fool ourselves. These improvements, if adopted, \nthough welcome, are far from sufficient. We are about to embark upon \nthe most sweeping deregulatory effort and assault on investor \nprotection in decades. The Council of Institutional Investors warns us \nthat ``this legislation will likely create more risks to investors than \njobs.''\n  If we pass this bill, it will allow new opportunities for fraud and \nabuse in capital markets. Rather than growing our economy, we are \ncourting the next accounting scandal, the next stock bubble, the next \nfinancial crisis. If this bill passes, we will look back at our votes \ntoday with deep regret.\n  We should not adopt this bill today. We should return it to \ncommittee. We should have hearings. We should have opportunities to \namend this bill. Adopting this bill will put us in a position of the \nmost massive and mistaken deregulation of our capital markets in \ndecades.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The senior Senator from \nIowa is recognized.\n\n\n                               Stock Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, soon, around the 12:30 hour or on one of \nthe seven votes this afternoon, we are going to be voting on cloture on \nthe STOCK Act. I have 45 minutes allotted to me to speak about the \ndisappointment I have with the way this has been handled and why I \nthink the parliamentary procedure is wrong and why the whole process \nirritates me.\n  Bipartisanship happens to be alive and well in Washington, DC, where \nmost of our constituents believe it is never working. Earlier this \nweek, we had the Republican majority leader of the House and the \nDemocratic majority leader of the Senate--that is bipartisanship--work \ntogether to thwart the will of 60 Senators and 286 Members of Congress. \nThe end result is, as well-meaning as the people behind this maneuver \nmight be--the end result is that 60 Members of the Senate are going to \nbe denied an opportunity to pursue what they had previously voted for \nand 286 Members of the House of Representatives, cosponsoring the \nlanguage of my amendment, are not going to have a chance to do what 286 \nMembers of the House want to do. As I said, this is bipartisanship, but \nit is not the kind of bipartisan cooperation, intended or not, this \nNation deserves.\n  I will not ascribe motives to anyone in this body, but I know that \ntoday's action only serves the desires of obscure and powerful Wall \nStreet interests, and it undercuts the will of the overwhelming \nmajority of Congress I just described. Once again, it is an example of \nWall Street being heard in Washington and maybe the common persons \nthroughout the United States not having their will expressed.\n  With this process, they took a commonsense provision, supported by a \nmajority of both Houses of Congress, and they simply erased it. In \nother words, we have to remember, when we\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\nhave a 60-vote requirement in the Senate, we know what that 60-vote \nrequirement is meant to do; that no amendment under a 60-vote \nrequirement is ever going to be adopted. That was surely the motive \nbehind the 60-vote threshold on the amendment I got adopted when this \nbill was first up, because the Democratic leader voted against it, the \nRepublican leader voted against it, the Democratic manager spoke \nagainst it, and the Republican manager was against it. Common sense \ntells us, if we study the Senate, an amendment such as that is never \nsupposed to get adopted. But we got the 60 votes to get it adopted. \nFrankly, I was surprised we got the 60 votes to get it adopted. But \nthat is taken out of the bill we are going to be voting on this \nafternoon.\n  My amendment simply says that if someone seeks information from \nCongress or the executive branch to trade stocks, Congress, the \nexecutive branch, and the American people ought to know who they are. \nNobody is saying they cannot do it, but we ought to know who they are. \nWe do that through the process where everybody ought to know who \nlobbyists are--not that lobbying is illegal or wrong, but it ought to \nbe transparent. With transparency comes accountability. The same way \nthis amendment asks these people who are involved in seeking \ninformation to register so we know who they are. The amendment makes \nnothing illegal. But we ought to know who these people are who seek \npolitical and economic espionage. We ought to bring all that out of the \nshadow, into the public's information.\n\n  But the leadership of both parties--the majority in the House and the \nmajority in the Senate--went behind closed doors and made that \nprovision magically disappear. What they did was truly amazing because \na handful of Senators and Congressmen overrode the will of 60 Senators \nand 280-plus backers of my amendment in the other body. First, the \nmajority leader in the House said the definition of political \nintelligence was so vague he could not possibly figure out how to \ndefine it. That is the excuse given for stripping any regulation of \npolitical intelligence, my words, or political and economic espionage \nfrom the STOCK Act when it was taken up in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Let me tell you why that excuse is truly amazing to me and quite a \nsurprise. It is because the House of Representatives put in a diluted \nprovision that uses the very same definition I had in my bill of what \npolitical intelligence gathering is. Then, by taking out my language \nand putting in theirs, they got it done because it was an excuse, that \nthe language I had in my amendment was so vague. But you know what. \nThey took that very same language and put it in their amendment, \ncalling for a study of political and economic espionage and political \nintelligence and used it.\n  Let me go back to section 7, part b, and quote:\n\n       Definition--for purposes of this section, the term \n     ``political intelligence'' shall mean information that is \n     derived by a person from direct communications with an \n     executive branch employee, a Member of Congress, or an \n     employee of Congress; and provided in exchange for financial \n     compensation to a client who intends, and who is known to \n     intend, to use this information to inform investment \n     decisions.\n\n  That is the definition that they thought we don't know what political \nintelligence is, so we should not be passing this amendment, even \nthough 286 Members of the House of Representatives have sponsored a \nbill to do it and take that very same definition that they say is so \nvague and put it in a bill for the purposes of studying something. That \nseems pretty straightforward, doesn't it? That definition seems pretty \nstraightforward. Of course, now that definition will only by applied to \na study, not to legislation with real teeth--because the powerful \ninterests of Wall Street are winning out.\n  If you think that is bad, this is what happened to the STOCK Act in \nthe Senate. By now, I think just about everybody in this body knows how \nstrongly I feel about this amendment that was adopted by this body 60 \nto 40, under a rule requiring 60 votes because that kills any \namendment--but it did not kill this one because we were right. I have \nspoken many times about the dangers of unregulated political and \neconomic espionage. I have reached out to the leadership to express my \nconcern and written a letter with Senator Leahy, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, on the importance of our STOCK Act provisions. I \nsaid that I was willing, if necessary, to negotiate on the language of \nmy amendment, and that would be on the question of what is political \nintelligence. But it seems to me one doesn't need to negotiate that if \nwe pass something with that definition in it. The House already has 286 \ncosponsors with that definition in it, but they take that same \ndefinition and put it in the amendment in the other body for a study, \nnot an amendment with any real teeth.\n\n  So when I said I was willing to negotiate, what was the response? \nNothing. I was not even given the courtesy of being notified before \ncloture was filed. So it was kind of like an ambush, plain and simple. \nJust like those people who traffic in political and economic espionage, \nthis process has been cloaked in a great deal of secrecy.\n  Now the claim is made that the Senate was forced to take up the House \nbill because an unnamed Republican was threatening to object to a \nconference. However, no Republican--or any Senator, for that matter--\nhas publicly owned up to trying to stop this bill from going to \nconference. But even if we accept this fact, there are still more \nquestions. Supposedly we are taking up the House bill because the \nSenate does not have time to take two or more cloture votes. Throughout \nthis Congress, we have spent weeks in nothing but quorum calls, but \nsuddenly we have run out of time.\n  Of course, in less than 10 days we will be leaving Washington, DC, \nfor a 2-week recess. I intend to go home and have town meetings, but we \nare not going to be doing business here in Washington, DC. So I have an \nidea for people to consider. With congressional approval ratings in the \nnear single digits, why can't we spend part of that time getting the \nSTOCK Act right? And by getting it right, I see nothing wrong with the \nbasic underlying piece of legislation, but when there is a chance to \nbring transparency and accountability through the registering of people \nwho are involved in political and economic espionage, I think we ought \nto do it, and that is what I mean by getting the STOCK Act right.\n  The Washington Post said that my amendment, combined with Senator \nLeahy's political corruption amendment, ``transformed the [STOCK Act] \ninto the most sweeping ethics legislation Congress had considered since \n2007.'' Maybe you don't agree with the Washington Post all the time, \nand I don't agree with them all the time, but they are looking at \nthings on a wider scale, and they are saying that a Congress that \ndoesn't have a very good approval rating has a chance, for the first \ntime in 5 years, to do sweeping ethics legislation that we need in \norder to improve the Congress's reputation by the public.\n  So isn't it worth taking just a couple of extra votes to get it done \nright and to make Congress look better? I think so, but apparently a \nsmall handful of people in the House and the Senate who make the \ndecisions on how we are going to do business around here--not taking \ninto consideration the votes of 60 Senators supporting this--have other \nideas.\n  Well, at the end of the day, here is what will happen if we don't \nproceed. There are about 2,000 people working in the completely \nunregulated world of political intelligence or political and economic \nespionage. Right now, these people have to be celebrating because they \nare in the shadows. They want to stay in the shadows. They are \ncelebrating because they know it is business as usual. They can \ncontinue to pass along tips that they get from Members of Congress, \nSenators, and staff, and no one will be the wiser. They pass along \nthese tips to hedge funds, private equity firms, and other investors \nwho pay them top dollar. The lobbyists get rich, Wall Street traders \nget rich, but the American people lose.\n  At one time, these folks who set up these meetings for Members of \nCongress or even in the executive branch--and I have examples to show \nthat--used to charge $10,000 for just setting up a meeting. They don't \ncharge $10,000 anymore because that information got out and it was too \nembarrassing to\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\nthem. So now there is kind of a relationship built up here between the \npeople who know their way around Congress and people who want this \ninformation that if there is investment in stock as a result of this \nand there is an increase in the value of the stock, that one will do \ntheir trading through the company. That is a tragic result of this \ndecision by the leadership to leave out the amendment that was adopted \nby 60 Members of this Congress and would do nothing more--not make \nanything illegal--than let us know who these people are.\n  Through my oversight investigations, I have learned that political \nintelligence gathering for Wall Street is a growing field ripe for \nabuse. Here are two examples of the type of activity that will continue \nto be kept in the dark.\n  In the course of my investigations of a whistleblower's claim, I \nlearned that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has closed-\ndoor meetings with Wall Street firms where CMS policies are discussed. \nNo record is kept of the meetings, and employees are essentially on the \nhonor system to make sure they are not giving investors inside \ninformation. As an example, the whistleblower who came to us claimed \nthat over a dozen CMS employees spent nearly 2 hours briefing Wall \nStreet analysts and investigators on the taxpayers' dime. A member of \nthe public could not walk in and get that kind of access to that \ninformation. CMS is supposed to be working for us. Instead, we found \nout that they are working for Wall Street. If my amendment fails, we \nwon't know how many of these meetings occur throughout the government \nand who profits from these meetings.\n  Another example is an investigation I conducted into the Obama \nadministration's Department of Education. The Department of Education \nwas getting set up to issue regulations on gainful employment that \nwould affect not-for-profit colleges. Several hedge funds had bet big \nthat those new regulations would make it harder for for-profit colleges \nto do business. Then news began to leak that those regulators were not \ngoing to be as tough as was expected. Suddenly, for-profit stocks began \nto rise, and these hedge fund investors reached out to their friends in \nthe Department of Education.\n  This is from an actual e-mail my investigators uncovered. It was sent \nfrom Steve Eisman, a hedge fund investor, to David Bergeron. He was \npart of a team in charge of writing these regulations. The e-mail \nreads:\n\n       I know you cannot respond, but FYI education stocks are \n     running because people are hearing DOE is backing down on \n     gainful employment.\n\n  To translate that Wall Street jargon, the term ``running'' means that \na stock is going up.\n  Within minutes this e-mail was marked ``high importance'' and \nforwarded to senior-level political appointees. These appointees \nincluded James Kvaal, the Deputy Under Secretary, and another policy \nexpert at the Department and Phil Martin, the Secretary of Education's \nconfidential assistant. To this day we do not know why the Department's \nhigher education policy experts needed to know that a hedge fund \ninvestor was losing money. What we do know is that for-profit stock \ndropped significantly, and if you bet big that these stocks would drop, \nyou likely made a lot of money.\n\n  When the Department of Education answered my questions, they admitted \nto my staff that this e-mail was not a proper contact.\n  In addition, the Department of Education inspector general is \ninvestigating the gainful employment rulemaking process.\n  These are just two examples in government agencies where reports such \nas these are just the tip of the iceberg. The more power Washington, DC \nhas, the more it affects financial markets, and the more it affects \nfinancial markets, the more people on Wall Street want to pay for \ninformation about what is going to happen here on this island \nsurrounded by reality that we call Washington, DC.\n  Usually, the only way any sort of ethics reform gets done around here \nis if someone gets caught. With political intelligence, we have the \nopportunity to create transparency before the next scandal occurs. As \ngovernment grows, this industry is going to grow, with the potential \nfor corruption. The question is, What are we going to do about it? \nTransparency is the simplest and least intrusive solution, and if \ntransparency doesn't do the job, then you can legislate. But I have \nfound out through so many of my investigations over the last 20 years \nthat if you bring transparency to something and get it out in the open, \nit tends to correct itself--maybe not completely but to a great degree.\n  Originally, in starting investigations, you think you are going to \nhave to have a massive amount of legislation, but when you get \ntransparency involved and the accountability that goes along with it, \nyou find that you don't have to pass a lot of laws, that a lot of \npeople know that if somebody is looking over their shoulder, they are \ngoing to do what is right.\n  Now, we can commission another study, as the House of Representatives \nwants to do and we are going to be voting on when we vote on cloture \nhere, but that is kicking the can down the road for another year. We \ncan act today by defeating cloture and getting to some of these \namendments that have such widespread support in the Congress of the \nUnited States. With 60 votes in the Senate and 286 cosponsors in the \nHouse of Representatives, this is our last chance to make sure the \nSenate speaks with a unified voice against secrecy for political and \neconomic espionage people and for transparency in government. We must \nnot allow the special interests to operate in the dark. Just bring them \nout of the shadows--not that what they are doing is illegal, but we \nought to know what it is.\n  For these reasons, and to support transparency, to support open \ngovernment, and to support good government, I will oppose cloture on \nthe bill, and I hope a lot of my colleagues--in fact, I hope all 60 of \nmy colleagues who voted for the amendment in the first place--will \noppose cloture.\n  If cloture is invoked, which is likely, I intend to vote for this \nbill anyway because the underlying bill is a very necessary piece of \nlegislation, but it is not much of a victory for the American people. \nAs the Washington Post said, if it included the Leahy amendment, if it \nincluded the Grassley amendment, it would be the most sweeping ethics \nreform in the last 5 years.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this is a critical moment. The Senate is on \nthe verge of adopting legislation that could cost the American people \ndearly in the future. The House bill with respect to capital formation, \nwhich is labeled a jobs bill, but goes more to fundamentally changing \nsecurity laws, is, in effect, another regulatory race to the bottom. \nThere has not been a normal committee process in terms of weighing this \nlegislation. This is a complicated bill involving the interaction of \nmany different securities laws, interactions which have not been sorted \nout or analyzed. As a result, we are rushing to justice--or rushing to \nconclusions.\n  Hasty deregulation has repeatedly been the source of financial \ncrises--including the savings and loans crisis, the Enron-era crisis, \nthe great recession of 2008, and the list goes on. Those who are \nimpacted by those crises--those who lost their savings or dealt with \ncleaning them up, experts in this field, and many more--have come out \nin strong opposition to the House proposal: from the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, Mary Schapiro, the North American \nSecurities Administrators Association, the State officials charged with \nenforcing securities laws, auditors, financial analysts, pension fund \nmanagers, and organizations like AARP, all who have spoken out against \nthis legislation and supported my efforts to protect investors.\n  This capital formation bill is fundamentally flawed, and it should \nnot become law in its present form. It undercuts and dilutes investor \nprotections and has no real requirements to\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nprotect American jobs in order to use these new capital raising \nprocedures. That is what is so ironic. We have a jobs bill, but \nactually I see nothing in this bill that requires creating American \njobs in order to earn the benefits of this bill. I think it is, again, \nmisnomered as a jobs bill.\n  In addition to the substitute amendment I offered with Senators \nLandrieu, Levin, and others that received a majority vote earlier this \nweek, I offered an amendment that we will be voting on later today to \nclarify the shareholder trigger for Exchange Act reporting so that all \ncompanies count their actual shareholders so they cannot avoid periodic \nreporting requirements.\n  Adoption of this amendment would achieve one of the stated goals of \nthe legislation, which is ostensibly to have more companies into a \ntransparent marketplace, disclosing and/or listing on stock exchanges. \nThat was the whole essence of this IPO onramp idea: encourage more \npeople to go public so they can disclose information to shareholders, \nso the market can follow them, and so investment advisers can advise \ninvestors about purchasing the stocks on the market.\n  This proposed amendment would close one glaring loophole, but, \nfrankly, too many others remain, and I have grave concerns about the \nimpact this underlying bill will have on the middle class. Backers say \nit is needed because initial public offerings are down since the 1990s. \nThey blame regulation, ignoring evidence that the dot-com bubble \nbursting--which shook the confidence of many investors through lots of \nnew IPOs coming on the market quickly with huge multiples in their \nprices and then quickly disappearing and leaving the scene altogether--\nand the biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression, \nbeginning in 2008 and lingering with us today, have shaken the \nconfidence and, frankly, shaken the business calculation of many small \nbusinesses.\n  These small businesses are looking to expand when they see the demand \nout there for their products. If the demand is there, they will, even \nin this environment, go forward with initial public offerings. They \nalso repeatedly blame the lack of IPOs on accounting costs and all \nother compliance costs brought on by Sarbanes-Oxley and other laws. \nThey conveniently ignore that the single largest cost, by a large \nmultiple, is not the Sarbanes-Oxley audit costs or the attorney costs; \nthey are the investment bankers' fees, and there is nothing in this \nlegislation that will affect those fees whatsoever.\n  In the case of Groupon, for example, the investment bankers were paid \n28 times what the auditors were paid. If we ask the shareholders of a \ncompany's stock whether they would prefer solid auditing practices \ngoing forward to ensure their investment is being wisely used, I think \nthey would say they prefer that to paying large fees to investment \nbankers. In the case of LinkedIn, the underwriters were paid 18 times \nwhat the auditors were. Groupon paid their accountants and auditors \n$1.5 million, and their investment bankers received $42 million. So the \nnotion that these Sarbanes-Oxley auditing costs and accounting \nprocedures are what is stopping a business person from deciding to go \nahead ignores the fact that compared to the investment banking fees \nwhich they will still have to pay, these costs are somewhat \ninsignificant in comparison.\n  Theoretically, this bill is supposed to promote the flow of capital \nto emerging businesses. But in practice it will likely promote and \ncontinue to promote the flow of big fees to investment bankers and \nothers to bring these companies public. There is nothing wrong with \nthat, but there is nothing in this underlying legislation that is going \nto require discounts in the cost of an IPO because of the reductions in \naccounting costs. There is nothing in this legislation that will change \nthat dynamic. However, this legislation could give insiders more ways \nto manipulate the market while average investors are left out in the \ncold.\n  There is a difference between cutting redtape and allowing insiders \nto cut corners--undoing the commonsense safeguards that protect people \nwho play by the rules. The House bill lowers standards for taking \ncompanies public and lowers standards for protecting the public from \ninvestment fraud.\n  This so-called IPO onramp desperately needs an offramp, through more \ncareful consideration by the Senate and the House in conference so that \nwe can improve some provisions which have great merit but need \nimprovement. This bill would allow very large companies with up to $1 \nbillion in revenues per year to avoid financial transparency and \nauditing disclosure designed to ensure they are not manipulating their \nbooks while enjoying lighter regulation for up to 5 years after the \nIPO.\n  If this unbalanced bill becomes, law without these needed \nimprovements, it could weaken oversight of Wall Street--oversight that \nin the past has provided investors protections that are extremely \nimportant. Again, there is merit to the idea of giving small startup \ncompanies more financing options, but the devil is in the details, and \nthe way this bill is written and packaged could have the opposite \neffect and ultimately make it harder to raise capital.\n  It opens the spigot to general solicitation and mass marketing of \nwhat have traditionally been private securities offerings, and we could \nfully expect to have senior citizens and others--through nightly cable \nadvertisements, through billboards, cold calls by brokers, or other \nindividuals telling them about the special opportunities for investing \ntheir cash, fall for some of these tactics.\n  Retail investors can be solicited through this bill's reg A process \nto raise up to $50 million capital for small businesses. They will hear \nthe pitches to make their investment now and get rich.\n  Again, there is potential for expanding the use of regulation A--it \nis on the books already at the Securities and Exchange Commission--but \nnot without safeguards. For example, as the bill is currently drafted, \nthese solicitations can be made without audited financial statements. I \nthink as a point of departure, if someone is trying to sell a security, \nthey should at least have to provide ordered financials from the \ncompany they are soliciting on behalf of.\n  Now, the crowdfunding amendment, I hope, will be improved \ndramatically by the work of Senator Merkley and Senator Bennet and \nSenator Brown. We will be voting on that later today too. It is a \nsubstantial improvement, but I think even they themselves will admit \nthis is an experiment and perhaps could be improved even further. But I \ncommend them and salute them for what they have done, and I hope our \ncolleagues will accept the amendment and move forward.\n  Over the last few days we have spent a great deal of time talking \nabout the shortcomings in this legislation. With the exception of the \nproposals before us, many of these shortcomings still exist, and I \nthink they will lead potentially to difficulties and harm to investors.\n  People understand investing is risky. They try to make an informed \nchoice, and they win some and lose some. But most Americans would agree \nthat U.S. financial markets work best when investors have access to \ntimely, comprehensive, and accurate public information that allows \npeople to make solid investment decisions. In fact, one of the \nprinciples of the competitive market, if we refer to an economics 101 \ntextbook, is perfect information.\n  That is the assumption for competitive markets: perfect information.\n  Well, there is never perfect information. But there has to be \nadequate information. Otherwise it is not a market, it is a casino. \nThis legislation undermines some of the decades-long protections we \nhave had in place to provide at least adequate information to \ninvestors.\n  By stripping away auditing standards and giving the investing public \nless information in almost every setting, sophisticated players and \ninvestment banks will have all the advantages. The average investor \nwill be operating in much more challenged circumstances.\n  Middle-class America will be particularly affected. As USA Today \nnoted:\n\n       Banks that manage IPOs will be able to use inside access to \n     past financial results to dominate research on new companies, \n     with incentives to promote their firm's banking clients.\n\n  The American people want big banks and large companies to play fair \nand comply with the basic rules and responsibilities that go with being \na public company. That is not too much to ask.\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\n  I believe history will judge this misnamed bill quite harshly. \nInstead of rushing to pass this bill, we should be working together to \nprotect the interests and economic well-being of the American public. \nWe should be focused on creating jobs and helping working families. In \nmy estimate, this bill does not do that and, indeed, ironically, it \ncould harm our constituents by shattering their faith--and it has been \ntested quite recently by the financial crisis and other crises--in the \nmarket, rather than reinforcing their confidence that they will be \nprotected against fraud and manipulation.\n  I believe we are capable of writing better legislation without \nsacrificing important investor protections. I hope we can go forward. I \nam disappointed the substitute amendment, authored by myself and \nSenator Landrieu and Senator Levin, was not accepted. As such, I would \nurge, when we get to final passage, people think very seriously about \nthe consequences of the bill. Despite the efforts of Senator Merkley \nand Senator Bennet, Senator Brown of Massachusetts and others, despite \nmy efforts, I am afraid the final version of this legislation will not \nprotect investors as it should and, therefore, should be rejected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time remaining in \nquorum calls be equally divided between my Republican colleagues and my \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself 5 minutes to \ndiscuss the JOBS Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I think we are on the verge of doing \nsomething very constructive in this body, something very constructive \nfor our economy, for the American people, for economic growth, and for \njob creation. After being in a Congress that has thus far been a little \nfrustrating for the lack of progress we have made on this front, today \nis a very big day.\n  We have a chance to pass a bill that has passed the House \noverwhelmingly with a huge bipartisan majority--a bill that the \nPresident of the United States has said he will sign into law. We have \na chance to pass this, to have it signed into law, and to, thereby, \nenable small and growing businesses across America greater access to \nthe capital they need to grow, to hire new workers, to help expand this \neconomy, to really make some progress at a time when we need it badly.\n  The bill I am talking about, of course, is the JOBS Act. It has \npassed the House 390 to 23--an overwhelming majority. It consists of a \nseries of component measures I will talk about in a little bit in some \ndetail--each of which has either passed the full House almost \nunanimously or at least in committee by overwhelming majorities. This \nis very broad bipartisan support.\n  It is important, however, that to get to this point we need to defeat \nthe amendment offered by my friend and colleague, whom I respect a \ngreat deal, the Senator from Rhode Island, who is offering an amendment \nthat would have devastating unintended consequences--an amendment that \ndoes not merely weaken the progress we are going to make with this bill \nbut would actually take us backwards from where we are today.\n  The way in which it would do that--and I doubt this is the intent, \nbut I am sure this is the consequence of this amendment--if it were \nenacted, this amendment would cause companies that are organized as \nprivate companies, for good and sufficient reasons--many for many \nyears; they choose to be private companies because it is what is best \nfor their business, their employees, and their customers--it would \nforce many of them to become public companies against their will.\n  Because a change in the rules, in the regulations by which we count \nthe number of shareholders--as the amendment from the Senator from \nRhode Island would do--would trigger this change in the status of these \ncompanies, having an enormously detrimental impact on many companies, \nraising their costs of compliance dramatically, making them less \nprofitable.\n  I am very concerned, for instance, among the many ways this could \nhappen--one could be through ESOPs, the employee stock ownership plans. \nI know the Senator from Rhode Island believes they would not trigger \nthis. I think it is very likely they would. Not only would this force \nprivate companies to go public against their will, but it would \ndiscourage the creation of employee ownership in companies. I think the \nlast thing we want to do is discourage a very constructive way of \ncompensating employees.\n  So if we can defeat the Reed amendment, then we can move on to--I \nthink we will have another amendment that will deal with crowdfunding. \nI do not know whether that passes. But either way we will be able to \nexpand the opportunity of small companies to raise capital through \ncrowdfunding mechanisms. Then we will have a final passage vote on what \nI think might be the most progrowth measure this body will consider \nperhaps this whole year.\n\n  Let me walk through a couple of specific items.\n  This is a chart I have in the Chamber that shows just a sampling of \nthe organizations and institutions that support this bill. It is a wide \nrange of businesses and business associations, folks who are in the \nbusiness of launching new companies, of growing small companies. It is \na long list. This is an incomplete subset of that list.\n  As shown on this next chart, this is an important point I want to \nmake; that is, there is a very vast range of investor protections that \nare completely unaddressed, completely unaffected by this legislation.\n  The legislation is actually modest in the regulations it changes, and \nthe categories it leaves in place to protect investors who are choosing \nto invest in companies--be they public or private--are quite extensive. \nA whole range of antifraud provisions that remain in full force are \nunaffected.\n  A full range of SEC disclosure and reporting obligations remain \nentirely still in full force. There are governance rules that are \nunaffected by any of this legislation--proxy statements, reporting \nobligations. We have a very extensive body of law and regulation that \nvery precisely controls all kinds of reporting and disclosure \nrequirements designed to protect investors. It all stays in place.\n  Investors remain very well protected if this legislation is enacted.\n  I want to touch on the three aspects I think I am most excited about, \nand I will acknowledge my bias. These are three bills I introduced with \nDemocratic cosponsors in the Senate, each of which has been rolled up \ninto this package, in addition to the crowdfunding piece I alluded to \nearlier and a bill introduced by Senator Thune and others that is also \npart of this package.\n  One of the pieces in this jobs package that is very constructive is a \nbill I introduced with Senator Tester. This is a bill that takes the \nexisting regulation A in the securities law, the body of law--\nregulation A allows companies to issue a security in a streamlined \nregulatory fashion. It streamlines the process. It reduces costs \nsomewhat. The problem is, the current limit is only $5 million, making \nit not very practical for the vast majority of companies. Our bill \nwould take that limit to $50 million and make this an option to raise \ncapital and grow a business that would be available to far more \ncompanies.\n  A second piece that I introduced with Senator Carper, and I am very \ngrateful to Senator Carper for his work, is to lift the permissible \nnumber of shareholders that a small privately held business can have \nwithout triggering the full, very expensive, and onerous SEC compliance \nregime. Our bill would take that from a current level of 500 up to \n2,000. There are many companies throughout Pennsylvania, across the \ncountry, that are successful. They are thriving, they are growing, but \nthey have a number of shareholders that is bumping up against their \nlimit. They are close to 500. They need to raise capital. They do not \nwant to go public, and they have plenty of people who would like to \ninvest in their successful business so they can grow. But they cannot \ndo it because they are so close to the threshold. We would lift that \nthreshold to 2,000 so they can raise more money in the private markets \nwhich is available to them.\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\n  Then, finally, what is in some ways the centerpiece of this \nlegislation in my mind is a bill I introduced with Senator Schumer, and \nI thank him for his work. This is a bill that facilitates going public. \nWhen a company reaches that point in its growth where--in order to grow \nfurther, in order to hire more workers, in order to expand--it needs to \nbecome a publicly traded company, we make it more affordable for more \ncompanies to do that, so they can do it sooner, they can grow sooner, \nthey can hire the additional workers sooner.\n  We do it with what we call an onramp. It is a process by which a \ncompany--if it has less than $1 billion in sales, less than $750 \nmillion in market flow--such a company would be able to do a public \noffering without being subject to all of the most expensive parts of \nthe SEC regulatory regime. They would be required to comply with a big \nmajority of all of the existing reporting requirements, but there would \nbe some pieces--especially section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, \nwhich is extremely complex and expensive to comply with--they would not \nhave to fully comply with that for 5 years or until they reached $1 \nbillion in sales or $750 million in market flow, whichever came first.\n  So what we are doing with this part of the JOBS Act is we are giving \nsmall and growing companies an opportunity to grow into the ability to \nafford the most expensive regulation to which they would be subject. \nNobody is exempted permanently. Everybody who goes public would be \nsubject to the full panoply of regulations within 5 years or sooner if \nthey grow faster, and it is only available to companies that have \nsales, as I said, of less than $1 billion. But that describes a great \nnumber of companies.\n  I can tell you from personal experience, when a company is \napproaching that threshold of asking themselves: Should we go public--\nwe could grow, we could use the capital, we could deploy it to hire \nmore workers, we could make constructive use of it--they also have to \nweigh the cost. The cost of compliance right now is huge, and we have \nseen a huge dropoff in the number of IPOs. We have seen a huge \nextension in the period of time between the successful launch of a \ncompany and the moment they do an IPO. We have seen that lengthen \ndramatically since we passed Sarbanes-Oxley. It is, in part, because it \nis so expensive to comply.\n  So what we will be doing, if we pass this legislation today--which I \ncertainly hope we will--is making it a little bit more affordable for \ncompanies to make that decision sooner, which means hiring workers \nsooner, which means growing sooner, which means more growth for our \neconomy, more opportunities for all of the people we represent.\n  So I am very optimistic. I am very pleased that we have been able to \npull together such broad bipartisan support--this overwhelming vote in \nthe House, the endorsement of the President of the United States, the \nsupport and cooperation with individual Democratic Senators who have \ncosponsored key pieces of this legislation.\n  I do think it is equally important we defeat the Reed amendment so we \ndo not actually go backwards in this process and have the unintended \nconsequence of forcing currently private companies to become public \nagainst their will, forcing them to incur all kinds of costs that are \nactually counterproductive. If we can do that today, then I think we \ncan pass this legislation. We know the President of the United States \nwill sign it. We should do it as soon as we can. I wish to thank all my \ncolleagues who played a role in advancing us to the point we are at \ntoday.\n\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining in the debate \non this measure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 23 minutes total; 18 minutes on the \nmajority side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I see the floor is vacant. I assume the \ntime is being taken from both sides at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the quorum call, the time is being charged \nequally. Right now, it is being charged to the majority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. I will try to fill that time with something \ninteresting. The United States has the best markets in the world. \nBecause of strong regulation and oversight by the Securities and \nExchange Commission and other agencies, our markets are transparent and \ninvestors get accurate detailed information. One hundred million \nAmericans depend on the strong regulated markets when they are making \ntheir savings for retirement or college. This is a creation that began \nback after the Great Depression, when Franklin Roosevelt said we needed \nto establish the appropriate regulatory agencies to set the economy on \nthe right track and keep it there.\n  Strong oversight has helped pension fund managers who count on safety \nand transparency so they can provide pension benefits to millions of \nAmerican retirees, and investors from around the world bring their \nmoney here because of our investor protections. Yet the Senate is \nconsidering a House-passed capital formation bill that rolls back the \nvery protections that make our markets the best in the world.\n  Supporters of this bill claim investors will jump at the opportunity \nto invest in a company as soon as we reduce disclosure, auditing, and \naccounting standards. They say this is a perfect way to create jobs. \nBut why should investors choose to invest in companies under conditions \nthat do less to protect their money? Why should investors who were \nburned during the dot-com crash put more capital in companies that are \nexempt from the same rules we put in place to ensure it would never \nhappen again? Why would investors who were left with nothing after the \nfinancial crisis because of risky behavior by executives with golden \nparachutes find companies exempt from compensation standards more \nattractive?\n  The answer is they will not. The ones who do will be more exposed to \ndeceit and fraud. The result will not be more jobs, it will be less \ntransparency, less accountability. Professor John Coats of Harvard Law \nSchool agrees. Here is what he said: ``[T]he proposals could not only \ngenerate front-page scandals, but reduce the very thing they are being \npromoted to increase: job growth.''\n  Listen to what SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner said:\n\n       The proposed legislation is a dangerous and risky \n     experiment with US capital markets. . . . I do not believe it \n     will add jobs but may certainly result in investor losses.\n\n  The House-passed bill, as written, will not create jobs, but let me \ntell you what it will do. It will exempt firms with more than $1 \nbillion in revenue--that is 90 percent of the newly public companies--\nmore than $1 billion of annual revenue exempted from the standards that \nhelp ensure audits based on facts, not on who is managing the auditor's \ncontract. These are the same internal controls we just adopted after \nEnron, after we were burned there, after investors lost their money, \nafter pension funds lost their investment, after people lost their \njobs. We set up standards and said: Let it never happen again.\n  In this euphoria, we are going to repeal the Enron standards for \nthese companies. This bill would allow companies to use billboards and \ncold calls to lure unsophisticated investors with the promise of making \na quick buck investing in new companies.\n  According to the New York Times, it will allow anyone with an idea to \npost that idea online and raise $1 million without ever providing \nfinancial statements. This is a scam. How many times have we picked up \nour cell phones to see there is a Nigerian opportunity out there? Be \nprepared after this bill passes. They will not be from Nigeria; they \nmay be from next door. We are giving them the opportunity to ask people \nall across America for their hard-earned savings on investments that \nare not backed with financial statements.\n  Last Friday, SEC Commissioner Aguilar joined the Chairman of the SEC \nMary Schapiro in raising concerns about this House-passed bill. Is that\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\nnot fair warning that we ought to least have a hearing on this bill \nbefore it passes?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Commissioner Aguilar's statement \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [From the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Mar. 16, 2012]\n\n        Investor Protection Is Needed for True Capital Formation\n\n                   (By Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar)\n\n       Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3606, \n     the ``Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.'' It is clear to \n     me that H.R. 3606 in its current form weakens or eliminates \n     many regulations designed to safeguard investors. I must \n     voice my concerns because as an SEC Commissioner, I cannot \n     sit idly by when I see potential legislation that could harm \n     investors. This bill seems to impose tremendous costs and \n     potential harm on investors with little to no corresponding \n     benefit.\n       H.R. 3606 concerns me for two important reasons. First, the \n     bill would seriously hurt investors by reducing transparency \n     and investor protection and, in turn, make securities law \n     enforcement more difficult. That is bad for ordinary \n     Americans and bad for the American economy. Investors are the \n     source of capital needed to create jobs and expand \n     businesses. True capital formation and economic growth \n     require investors to have both confidence in the capital \n     markets and access to the information needed to make good \n     investment decisions.\n       Second, I share the concerns expressed by many others that \n     the bill rests on faulty premises. Supporters claim that the \n     bill would improve capital formation in the United States by \n     reducing the regulatory burden on capital raising. However, \n     there is significant research to support the conclusion that \n     disclosure requirements and other capital markets regulations \n     enhance, rather than impede, capital formation, and that \n     regulatory compliance costs are not a principal cause of the \n     decline in IPO activity over the past decade. Moreover, \n     nothing in the bill requires or even incentivizes issuers to \n     use any capital that may be raised to expand their businesses \n     or create jobs in the U.S.\n       Professor John Coates of Harvard Law School has testified \n     that proposals of the type incorporated into H.R. 3606 could \n     actually hurt job growth:\n       ``While [the proposals] have been characterized as \n     promoting jobs and economic growth by reducing regulatory \n     burdens and costs, it is better to understand them as \n     changing . . . the balance that existing securities laws and \n     regulations have struck between the transaction costs of \n     raising capital, on the one hand, and the combined costs of \n     fraud risk and asymmetric and unverifiable information, on \n     the other hand. Importantly, fraud and asymmetric information \n     not only have effects on fraud victims, but also on the cost \n     of capital itself. Investors rationally increase the price \n     they charge for capital if they anticipate fraud risk or do \n     not have or cannot verify relevant information. Anti-fraud \n     laws and disclosure and compliance obligations coupled with \n     enforcement mechanisms reduce the cost of capital.\n       ``. . . Whether the proposals will in fact increase job \n     growth depends on how intensively they will lower offer \n     costs, how extensively new offerings will take advantage of \n     the new means of raising capital, how much more often fraud \n     can be expected to occur as a result of the changes, how \n     serious the fraud will be, and how much the reduction in \n     information verifiability will be as a result of the changes.\n       ``Thus, the proposals could not only generate front-page \n     scandals, but reduce the very thing they are being promoted \n     to increase: job growth.''\n       Similarly, Professor Jay Ritter of the University of \n     Florida has testified before the Senate banking committee \n     that such proposals could in fact reduce capital formation:\n       ``In thinking about the bills, one should keep in mind that \n     the law of unintended consequences will never be repealed. It \n     is possible that, by making it easier to raise money \n     privately, creating some liquidity without being public, \n     restricting the information that stockholders have access to, \n     restricting the ability of public market shareholders to \n     constrain managers after investors contribute capital, and \n     driving out independent research, the net effects of these \n     bills might be to reduce capital formation and/or the number \n     of small [emerging growth company] IPOs.''\n       As drafted, H.R. 3606 would have significant detrimental \n     impacts on the U.S. securities regulatory regime, including \n     the following:\n       First, the bill will reduce publicly available information \n     by exempting ``emerging growth companies'' from certain \n     disclosure and other requirements currently required under \n     the Federal securities laws. The bill's definition of \n     ``emerging growth company'' would include every issuer with \n     less than $1 billion in annual revenues (other than large \n     accelerated filers and companies that have issued over $1 \n     billion in debt over a three year period) for five years \n     after the company's first registered public offering. It is \n     estimated that this threshold would pick up 98% of IPOs and a \n     large majority of U.S. public companies for that five year \n     period.\n       An emerging growth company would only have to provide two \n     years (rather than three years) of audited financial \n     statements, and would not have to provide selected financial \n     data for any period prior to the earliest audited period \n     presented in connection with its initial public offering. It \n     would also be exempt from the requirements for ``Say-on-Pay'' \n     voting and certain compensation-related disclosure. Such \n     reduced financial disclosure may make it harder for investors \n     to evaluate companies in this category by obscuring the \n     issuer's track record and material trends.\n       ``Emerging growth companies'' would also be exempt from \n     complying with any new or revised financial accounting \n     standards (other than accounting standards that apply equally \n     to private companies), and from some new standards that may \n     be adopted by the PCAOB. Such wholesale exemptions may result \n     in inconsistent accounting rules that could damage financial \n     transparency, making it difficult for investors to compare \n     emerging companies with other companies in their industry. \n     This could harm investors and, arguably, impede access to \n     capital for emerging companies, as capital providers may not \n     be confident that they have access to all the information \n     they need to make good investment decisions about such \n     companies.\n       Second, the bill would greatly increase the number of \n     record holders a company may have, before it is required to \n     publish annual and quarterly reports. Currently, companies \n     with more than 500 shareholders of record are required to \n     register with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(g) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act and provide investors with regular \n     financial reports. H.R. 3606 would expand that threshold to \n     2000 record holders (provided that, in the case of any issuer \n     other than a community bank, the threshold would also be \n     triggered by 500 non-accredited investors). Moreover, the \n     bill would exclude from such counts any shareholders that \n     acquire securities through crowdfunding initiatives and those \n     that acquire securities as eligible employee compensation. \n     Thus, a company could have a virtually unlimited number of \n     record stockholders, without being subject to the disclosure \n     rules applicable to public companies. This effect is \n     magnified by the fact that the reporting threshold only \n     counts records holders, excluding the potentially unlimited \n     number of beneficial owners who hold their shares in ``street \n     name'' with banks and brokerage companies, and thus are not \n     considered record holders.\n       This provision of the bill raises concerns because it could \n     significantly reduce the number of companies required to file \n     financial and other information. Such information is critical \n     to investors in determining how to value securities in our \n     markets. Regular financial reporting enhances the allocation \n     of capital to productive companies in our economy.\n       Third, the bill would exempt ``emerging growth companies'' \n     from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires \n     the independent audit of a company's internal financial \n     controls. Section 404(b) currently applies only to companies \n     with a market capitalization above $75 million; companies \n     below that threshold have never been subject to the internal \n     controls audit requirement and were exempted from such \n     requirement in the Dodd-Frank Act. The internal controls \n     audit was established following the accounting scandals at \n     Enron, WorldCom and other companies, and is intended to make \n     financial reporting more reliable. Indeed, a report last year \n     by Audit Analytics noted that the larger public companies, \n     known as accelerated filers, that are subject to Section \n     404(b), experienced a 5.1% decline in financial statement \n     restatements from 2009 to 2010; while non-accelerated filers, \n     that are not subject to Section 404(b), experienced a 13.8% \n     increase in such restatements. A study by the SEC's Office of \n     the Chief Accountant recommended that existing investor \n     protections within Section 404(b) be retained for issuers \n     with a market capitalization above $75 million. With the \n     passage of H.R. 3606, an important mechanism for enhancing \n     the reliability of financial statements would be lost for \n     most public companies, during the first five years of public \n     trading.\n       Fourth, the bill would benefit Wall Street, at the expense \n     of Main Street, by overriding protections that currently \n     require a separation between research analysts and investment \n     bankers who work in the same firm and impose a quiet period \n     on analyst reports by the underwriters of an IPO. These rules \n     are designed to protect investors from potential conflicts of \n     interests. The research scandals of the dot-com era and the \n     collapse of the dot-com bubble buried the IPO market for \n     years. Investors won't return to the IPO market, if they \n     don't believe they can trust it.\n       Fifth, H.R. 3606 would fundamentally change U.S. securities \n     law, by permitting unlimited offers and sales of securities \n     under Rule 506 of Regulation D (which exempts certain non-\n     public offerings from registration under the Securities Act), \n     provided only that all purchasers are ``accredited \n     investors''. The bill would specifically permit general \n     solicitation and general advertising in connection with such \n     offerings, obliterating the distinction between public and \n     private offerings.\n       This provision may be unnecessary. A recent report by the \n     SEC's Division of Risk, Strategy and Financial Innovation \n     confirms that Regulation D has been effective in\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\n     meeting the capital formation needs of small businesses, with \n     a median offering size of $1,000,000 and at least 37,000 \n     unique offerings since 2009. Regulation D offerings surpassed \n     $900 billion in 2010. The data does not indicate that users \n     of Regulation D have been seriously hampered by the \n     prohibition on general solicitation and advertising.\n       I share the concerns expressed by many that this provision \n     of H.R. 3606 would be a boon to boiler room operators, Ponzi \n     schemers, bucket shops, and garden variety fraudsters, by \n     enabling them to cast a wider net, and making securities law \n     enforcement much more difficult. Currently, the SEC and other \n     regulators may be put on notice of potential frauds by \n     advertisements and Internet sites promoting ``investment \n     opportunities.'' H.R. 3606 would put an end to that tool. \n     Moreover, since it is easier to establish a violation of the \n     registration and prospectus requirements of the Securities \n     Act than it is to prove fraud, such scams can often be shut \n     down relatively quickly. H.R. 3606 would make it almost \n     impossible to do so before the damage has been done and the \n     money lost.\n       In addition others have noted that the current definition \n     of ``accredited investor'' may not be adequate and that the \n     requirement that purchasers be accredited investors would \n     provide limited protection. For example, an ``accredited \n     investor'' retiree with $1 million in savings, who depends on \n     that money for income in retirement, may easily fall prey for \n     a ``hot'' offering that is continually hyped via the internet \n     or late night commercials.\n       These are just a few observations regarding H.R. 3606. It \n     also includes other provisions that require substantial \n     further analysis and review, including among other things the \n     so-called crowdfunding provisions.\n       The removal of investor protections in this bill are among \n     the factors that have prompted serious concerns from the \n     Council of Institutional Investors, AARP, the North American \n     Securities Administrators Association, the Consumer \n     Federation of America, and Americans for Financial Reform, \n     among others.\n\n\n                        Questions Re: H.R. 3606\n\n       As H.R. 3606 is considered, the following is a non-\n     exhaustive list of questions that should be addressed:\n       1. The bill would define ``emerging growth company'' as any \n     company, within 5 years of its IPO, with less than $1 billion \n     in annual revenue, other than a large accelerated filer or a \n     company that has issued $1 billion in debt over a three-year \n     period.\n       What is the basis for the $1 billion revenue trigger?\n       Why is revenue the right test? Why is $1 billion the right \n     level?\n       It has been estimated that this definition would include \n     98% of all IPOs, and a large majority of all public companies \n     within the 5-year window. Was such a broad scope intended?\n       2. As provided in the bill, financial accounting standards, \n     auditing and reporting standards, disclosure requirements, \n     and the period for which historical financial statements is \n     required, could all differ as between ``emerging growth \n     companies'' and all other public companies--including all \n     companies that went public before December 8, 2011.\n       How will these differences affect the comparability of \n     financial reporting for these two classes of issuers?\n       Will reduced transparency, or lack of comparability, affect \n     the liquidity of emerging growth companies?\n       Will reduced transparency or reduced liquidity affect the \n     cost of capital for emerging growth companies? Will investors \n     demand a ``discounted price'' to offset any perceived higher \n     risk resulting from reduced disclosures and protections?\n       Will emerging growth companies be required to include risk \n     factors or other disclosure in their registration statements \n     and other filings, regarding transparency, comparability and \n     any potential effects thereof?\n       3. The bill would expand the threshold for the number of \n     shareholders an issuer may have, before it is required to \n     file annual and other reports under Section 12(g) of the \n     Exchange Act, from 500 to 2000 (of which no more than 500 may \n     be non-accredited investors, for issuers other than community \n     banks), and would exclude from such counts shareholders that \n     acquire securities through crowdfunding initiatives and those \n     that acquire securities as eligible employee compensation.\n       How was the new threshold of 2000 holders determined?\n       Is that the right threshold for determining whether the \n     public interest in such securities justifies regulatory \n     oversight?\n       How many companies would be exempted from registration and \n     reporting by the bill?\n       When shares are held in ``street name'' the number of \n     beneficial owners may greatly exceed the number of record \n     holders. How will the new threshold of 2000 record holders be \n     applied in such cases?\n       How would the exclusion of employees and crowdfunding \n     purchasers be applied, if such holders transfer their shares \n     to other investors? How would this be tracked?\n       4. To the extent the bill results in reduced transparency \n     and/or reduced liquidity for emerging growth companies, or \n     for companies exempted from Exchange Act reporting by the new \n     thresholds under Section 12(g), such results may impact \n     investment decisions by institutional investors.\n       How would mutual fund managers, pension fund \n     administrators, and other investors with fiduciary duties \n     address such reduced transparency or lack of liquidity in \n     making investment decisions?\n       Could reduced transparency or reduced liquidity impact the \n     ability of fund managers to meet applicable diversification \n     requirements?\n       Could such effects cause managers to increase concentration \n     into fewer US reporting companies? How would such \n     concentration affect market risk? Would the bill result in \n     investor funds being redirected to companies overseas?\n       5. The bill is being promoted as a jobs measure, on the \n     grounds that reducing regulation will improve access to \n     capital for small and emerging businesses, allowing them to \n     grow and add employees.\n       What is the evidence that regulatory oversight unduly \n     impedes access to capital?\n       What is the evidence that companies that are otherwise \n     prepared to grow (that is, they have the appropriate business \n     model, management team, and aspirations) are prevented from \n     growing by an inherent lack of access to potential sources of \n     capital?\n       I understand that the costs of complying with regulatory \n     requirements are a factor underpinning H.R. 3606. How do such \n     costs compare to other costs of raising capital, such as \n     investment banking fees? How do such costs compare to other \n     administrative costs? If reduced transparency, lack of \n     comparability, and other consequences of the bill result in a \n     higher cost of capital for emerging growth companies, will \n     the money saved on compliance be worth it?\n       6. Evidence shows that the public companies that are \n     currently exempt from internal controls audit requirements \n     have a higher incidence of financial reporting restatements, \n     and that companies that have restated their financial results \n     produce substantially lower returns for investors.\n       How do any perceived benefits from H.R. 3606's exemption of \n     emerging growth companies from the audit of internal controls \n     compare to the likelihood of increased restatements? Would an \n     increase in restatements hamper capital formation?\n       Will the lack of an internal controls audit result in \n     greater financial and accounting fraud?\n       7. The bill requires the Commission to revise its rules to \n     provide that the prohibition against general solicitation or \n     general advertising contained in Regulation D shall not apply \n     to offers and sales of securities pursuant to Rule 506, \n     provided that all purchasers are accredited investors.\n       Given the success of Regulation D as a capital raising \n     mechanism, including its successful use by small and emerging \n     companies, is there any evidence that general solicitation \n     and general advertising are necessary for capital formation?\n       Given the current definition of ``accredited investor'', is \n     that the right test for determining who issuers may target, \n     in offers made by general solicitation or advertising?\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       H.R. 3606 would have a significant impact on the capital \n     markets and raises many questions that have yet to be \n     satisfactorily resolved. I have yet to see credible evidence \n     that justifies the extensive costs and potential harm to \n     investors this bill may impose.\n       I urge Congress to undertake the review necessary to \n     resolve these questions, and to ensure that investors, as the \n     providers of the capital that companies need to grow and \n     create jobs, have the protections they need and deserve.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Commissioner Aguilar said he shares concerns expressed by \nmany that provisions of this bill would be a boon to boiler room \noperators, Ponzi schemers, bucket shops, and garden variety fraudsters \nby enabling them to cast a wider net and make securities law \nenforcement that much more difficult.\n  Others have raised concerns. The North American Securities \nAdministrators Association, the Consumer Federation of America, the \nAmericans for Financial Reform, the Council of Institutional Investors, \nsecurities experts such as Professor John Coffee and former SEC Chief \nAccountant Lynn Turner, the AARP, concerned that seniors will be bilked \nout of their savings with these phony solicitations for companies that \nmay not even exist.\n  I share the concerns. I believe there is a path forward to protect \ninvestors and make it easier for small firms to come up with capital. \nSeveral of my colleagues had a substitute amendment--Senator Jack Reed, \nSenator Carl Levin, Senator Mary Landrieu--which would have done just \nthat, made it easier to raise capital but kept the safeguards in place.\n  It was defeated virtually on a party-line vote. It was defeated. It \nwould have preserved the Dodd-Frank say-on-pay provisions to allow \ninvestors to weigh in if executives are getting exorbitant compensation \nand golden parachutes. The amendment would have prohibited companies \nfrom advertising and selling stock to the unsophisticated, unsuspecting \ninvestors. It would have included minimum requirements for \ncrowdfounding Web sites so investors are not blindly giving money to\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\nsomeone with a good-looking Web site that promises a good return that \nwill never ever happen.\n  In short, the amendment would have responded to investors' concerns--\nthe very same investors some of my colleagues claim the underlying bill \nwill encourage to invest.\n  That is not all we have done. The amendment also included a \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which makes loans to major \ncompanies and smaller companies too who want to export American-made \nproducts made by American workers.\n  The reauthorization increased the bank's lending cap to $140 billion. \nThis is the same Export-Import Bank that received bipartisan support in \nthe Banking Committee and was reported out on a voice vote. A similar \nreauthorization was introduced by a Republican the last time around in \n2006. It passed the Senate without even the requirement of a record \nvote.\n  However, yesterday, both the Landrieu-Reed-Levin amendment, which was \nthe substitute that included the Export-Import Bank reauthorization, \nand the Cantwell amendment failed to obtain enough votes to invoke \ncloture, mostly on a party-line vote. Two Republicans voted to extend \nthe Export-Import Bank authorization--two. This is a bank which gives \nour companies in America a fighting chance around the world to compete \nwith those companies in other countries that are subsidized by their \ngovernment. We have the Export-Import Bank to help our companies, \ncompanies in my State such as Boeing and Caterpillar. Good-paying jobs \nright here in America, sustained by exports, helped by the Export-\nImport Bank, defeated on the floor of the Senate. Only two Republican \nSenators would step up and vote for that bank, and it used to be \nnoncontroversial. We did it because we knew it was so good for our \neconomy. It turned out to be a partisan issue.\n  Too many things turn out to be partisan issues on the Senate floor \nlately. That is the latest casualty. It is clear that politics and \ntheoretical jobs created by a bill that significantly reduces investor \nprotections are more important to some of my colleagues than the real \njobs that would have been created by the Export-Import Bank.\n  The Export-Import Bank is responsible for supporting 288,000 American \njobs at more than 2,700 U.S. companies. One would think it would have \nwon more than two Republican votes. Madam President, 113 of these \ncompanies are located in my State of Illinois and 80 are small \nbusinesses.\n  One of those companies, Holland LP, in Crete, IL, employs 250 people \nand completed a major export transaction with assistance from the \nExport-Import Bank. Holland was able to sell two complete in-track \nwelding systems to a company in Brazil.\n  The CEO of Holland said: ``Without [the Export-Import Bank], this \ntransaction would not have come to life.''\n  That is how the Ex-IM Bank can help companies in my State and \ncompanies around the United States.\n  I have to say, there will be an amendment offered soon, this \nafternoon, within the hour, the Merkley-Bennet-Scott Brown amendment, \nwhich is bipartisan. It would allow small businesses to raise up to $1 \nmillion through crowdfunding Web sites but will put in protections for \ninvestors from those posing as a business and selling a lot more hope \nthan substance.\n  The amendment would require all crowdfunding Web sites to register \nwith the SEC. That is a step in the right direction. It is one of the \nmost important elements that needs to be changed in this bill out of \nabout eight elements, and it is the only one we are likely to address \nthis afternoon.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland requiring the SEC to revise the definition of ``holder of \nrecord.'' The financial industry has been working overtime to beat this \namendment. They have been on the phones calling everybody saying, \n``Stop the Reed amendment.''\n  According to John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, the \nshareholder of record concept is archaic and can be gamed.\n  State securities regulators also share that same concern. The \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association said in a recent letter \nthat it makes little sense to exclude any investor from the count of \nbeneficial holders.\n  The Reed amendment would require the SEC to update the definition of \n``holder of record'' to revise an outdated definition that may hide the \ntrue number of shareholders a company might have.\n  While I believe the bipartisan Merkley-Bennet and the Reed amendments \nwill significantly improve parts of this bill, it doesn't make this a \ngood bill. That is why I am prepared to vote no on final passage.\n  This bill, as much as any bill we have ever considered on the Senate \nfloor, should have at least had a hearing. We should have at least \nbrought in some expert witnesses. I will tell you, we will rue the day \nwe ran this thing through the House and Senate without the appropriate \noversight. I can already predict, having seen this happen time and \nagain, there will come a time, after we pass this bill, when we start \nhearing from Americans who are being lured into phony investments, \nlosing their life savings and their retirement in the process, and we \nwill step back and say: My goodness. How did that happen? Remember, on \nMarch 22, 2012, we had a chance to make a difference to slow down and \nstop this bill until there was an adequate hearing, until we could put \nsafeguards into place, which Americans deserve.\n  I am not against investment. I know there is risk associated with it. \nWe have said since the 1930s--1932--under the creation of the SEC, that \nwe owe to Americans, when they make a decision about an investment, two \nbasic elements: Make sure the salesman is telling the truth and make \nsure what he said can be backed up with audited financial statements.\n  We can all remember stories about the people who used to blow in, sit \ndown and sell penny stocks and $5 stocks and unsuspecting investors \nlosing their savings as these folks caught the next train out of town. \nWe don't need to return to that in the name of job creation. If we are \ncreating the jobs of new charlatans who are offering these investments, \nthese are not the kinds of jobs America should encourage.\n  I believe the House-passed bill should be defeated today. We should \ntake the time to get it right and listen to the Chairman of the SEC and \nput the protections in the law so we can move forward with a bill that \nall of us can be proud of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to address the amendment on \ncrowdfunding that we will be considering shortly on the floor of the \nSenate. Specifically, the goal is to create a solid foundation for \nsuccess of enabling Americans to invest in startup companies, invest in \nsmall companies through the Internet, and to do so in a fashion that \ndoes not result in predatory scams but results in capital formation \nthat helps small business thrive across our Nation.\n  The House bill, as it came over to us, has crowdfunding provisions \nthat are simply a pathway to predatory scams, a paved highway to \npredatory scams. What do I mean by that? They say basically that a \ncompany seeking to raise investment capital doesn't have to give any \nfinancial information of any kind about their company. If they do \nprovide information, they don't have to have accountability for the \naccuracy of that information. By the way, they can hire people to pump \ntheir stock, and that is OK under the law. In other words, everything \nwe associate with the worst boiler rooms, the worst pump-and-dump \nschemes, is made legal by the House legislation. That is why we need to \nfix this on the floor of the Senate.\n  We lay out a provision that says, if you raise less than $100,000, \nyou as the CEO assert the accuracy of the information you are putting \nout--simple financial statements. If you raise a larger amount of \nfunds, you proceed to have an accountant-reviewed statement that you \ncan vouch for. If you raise yet more funds, at a higher level, then you \nhave an audited financial statement. So it is adjusted in degrees and \nit streamlines it to the appropriate levels, based on the amount of \ninvestment you are asking.\n  This amendment says directors and officers should take responsibility \nfor the accuracy of that information. That\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\nwill give investors a great deal more confidence that what they are \nreading is actually and truly the case. That is a foundation for \nsuccessful investment.\n  There are many folks across the country who have looked at these \ncrowdfunding positions, different measures. I thought I would read from \nMotaavi, a crowdfunding intermediary based out of North Carolina. On \nthe House bill, they say:\n\n       The crowdfunding language in the [House bill] lacks \n     critical investor protection features. It does not require \n     offerings to be conducted through an intermediary, which \n     opens the door to fraudulent activity. . . . It also does not \n     require appropriate disclosures or inspections. The bill does \n     not require the issuer to inform investors of dilution risk \n     or capital structure.\n       Crowdfunding is premised on openness. Without disclosure, \n     investors cannot protect themselves or accurately price the \n     securities they are buying. If issuers are not willing to \n     provide information over and above what is required, the \n     [House] language does not provide investors with other \n     alternatives short of giving up on crowdfunding altogether.\n\n  They then comment on the bipartisan amendment we are presenting on \nthe floor of the Senate, and they note:\n\n       It strikes the right balance between disclosure and \n     flexibility. The language is tightly integrated with existing \n     securities laws to provide investor protection. It places \n     easily met obligations on the issuer and the intermediary to \n     ensure that investors have the information they need to make \n     sound decisions. The bill has many provisions for appropriate \n     rulemaking, and is written in a way that reflects how \n     crowdfunding actually works.\n\n  Remember, this is a crowdfunding intermediary based in North \nCarolina--one working to occupy this Internet space and wants a \nplatform, a structure, that works and makes crowdfunding a legitimate \nstrategy for capital formation.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       We think crowdfunding can be a valuable and integral part \n     of the capital formation process. The Crowd Funding Act is \n     the right bill [the amendment we are considering today] to \n     make this happen.\n\n  Launcht is a crowdfunding portal provider. They say:\n\n       For the first time, we have a Senate bill with bipartisan \n     sponsorship, a balance of state oversight and Federal \n     uniformity, industry standard investor protections, and \n     workable funding caps.\n\n  Let's turn to the startup exemption--three entrepreneurs who have led \nthe charge in our Capitol for flexible provisions for crowdfunding:\n\n       We write to suggest that if you consider the House version \n     of the bill, you consider adding the following crucial \n     components:\n       1. Crowdfunding investing intermediaries that are SEC-\n     regulated to provide appropriate oversight.\n       2. All or nothing financing so that an entrepreneur must \n     hit 100 percent of his funding target, or no funds will be \n     exchanged.\n       3. State notification, rather than state registration, so \n     the states are aware of who is crowdfunding in their states. \n     This ensures they retain their enforcement ability while \n     creating an efficient marketplace.\n\n  These provisions are in the amendment we are considering and the \namendment they have endorsed.\n  Finally, we have SoMoLend, a peer-to-peer lending site. Here is their \ncommentary, where they say this amendment is:\n\n       . . . robust enough to provide guidance to a new industry, \n     but will also benefit the crowdfunding industry in the long-\n     term, as compared to a possible race to the bottom with a \n     ``no regulatory'' approach. The disclosure and regulatory \n     requirements will provide adequate information to investors, \n     advising of risk but also deterring fraud.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       Again, this has long-term benefits to the industry as a \n     whole.\n\n  This hits at the heart of why these investor protections are so \nimportant. Not only do they deter scams and fraud, not only do they \nprotect vulnerable investors, such as seniors and others, who have \nlittle experience in the investing market, but they build a strong \ncapital formation market, a successful platform for capital formation, \na market that puts capital where citizens would like to put it--the \nwisdom of the crowd, if you will--a market that allows good ideas to \nrise to the top, a market that will create jobs now and in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 1884 to provide the \nright balance of streamlining and investor protection.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1931\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, shortly, we will be voting on my \namendment, which will maintain the House's increase in the number of \nshareholders at 2,000 in order to remain private. But what I do is \nactually ensure that the shareholders are the real shareholders; that \nthere is not an intermediary holding the stock in the name of perhaps \nliterally hundreds of shareholders, but they are the real shareholders.\n  There has been some criticism about the affect it will have on ESOPs, \nprivate funds, mutual funds, and others. We have been assured by legal \nexperts it doesn't affect any of these funds or entities.\n  In addition, the SEC has assured us that it, through rulemaking, can \nclarify that ESOPs, mutual funds, private funds, and other entities \nsimilar to these will not be affected. I believe if a company has 2,000 \nreal shareholders, those shareholders should have access to routine \ninformation on a regular basis, and that is the thrust of this \namendment.\n\n\n                         Shareholder Threshold\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, one of the six components of the \nHouse-passed JOBS Act is a measure I sponsored here in the Senate to \nfoster capital formation in the community banking industry. I \nappreciate the support of Senator Toomey and twelve additional \ncosponsors, including Senators Pryor, McCaskill and Bill Nelson. Our \nbill would update the threshold before a bank must register its \nsecurities with the Securities and Exchange Commission from 500 \nshareholders to 2,000. It is Title 6 in the JOBS Act before us today. \nMy colleague Senator Toomey has a bill contained in the JOBS Act as \nwell that would raise the shareholder threshold for all companies. \nSenator Toomey's legislation is contained in Title 5 of the JOBS Act.\n  On this point, my understanding is that Sections 501 and 601 of the \nJOBS Act address two distinct classes of issuers. One is a general \nprovision for all issuers other than banks and bank holding companies--\nand the other one applies to banks and bank holding companies. I ask \nthe Senator, is this correct?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Yes, that is my understanding. I thank Senator Hutchison \nfor all of her hard work on the bank shareholder bill, and for \nclarifying this point.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEN. Madam President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nthe JOBS Act. Supporters of this bill insist it will help small \nbusinesses looking to raise capital, but instead its primary effect \nwould be to strip away critical investor protections.\n  The House-passed bill applies to more than just small businesses. It \nalso exempts large corporations--those with annual revenues up to $1 \nbillion--from important financial reporting requirements.\n  There are many good reasons why public companies are required to \nundergo periodic examinations and disclose financial information, and \nthis bill undercuts those protections.\n  I remember the massive fraud and financial chicanery that led Enron \nto intentionally shut down powerplants in California in order to pump \nup profits. And all of us remember the lasting damage from the collapse \nof the dot-com bubble.\n  Let me go over some of the problems with the House bill.\n  It would eliminate the requirement that many companies audit their \ninternal controls, a requirement put in place specifically in response \nto the Enron debacle.\n  Companies with virtually no operating history could sell stock \ndirectly to the public over the Internet without going through any \nregistered intermediary.\n  The bill has no meaningful protections to prevent investors' savings \nfrom being wiped out on risky investments. Investors could bet 10 \npercent of their annual income on any one company, with no limit to how \nmuch income or savings they could invest in\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\nmultiple companies' stock sold over the Internet with little financial \ndisclosure.\n  The JOBS Act would reduce the number of years of audited financial \nstatements that companies must publicly disclose.\n  It would abolish shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation \nand golden parachutes.\n  And it would eliminate the disclosure requirement of CEO-to-median-\nworker salary ratio required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nAct.\n  It remains unclear why the supporters of the JOBS Act believe \ndisclosing executive compensation is an obstacle to companies going \npublic.\n  Under the JOBS Act, a fraudster could raise up to $1 million in small \nincrements from mom-and-pop investors without having to disclose any \nsignificant financial or legal disclosures. Candidly, this could lead \nto the greatest proliferation of get-rich-quick schemes in history.\n  It is a shame this process has unfolded in this manner and at this \nbreakneck speed. There are some merits to the underlying goal of the \nbill.\n  Reducing compliance costs on actual small businesses seeking to go \npublic is a laudable goal. But instead of debating the issues, we are \nrushing through this bill.\n  It is important to note that, even under the Sarbanes-Oxley law, \nfinancial game-playing by big public companies has not gone away. This \nbill would invite even more of that harmful activity, under the guise \nof being good for the public marketplace.\n  Congress's recent track record on financial deregulation isn't very \ngood. In the past decade or so Congress has eliminated the Glass-\nSteagall firewall between commercial and investment banking and \nderegulated the over-the-counter derivatives market. We are still \npaying for those mistakes.\n  I had hoped the Senate would be humbled by that experience. Instead, \nwe are rushing through changes to decades-old securities laws that \ncould have significant negative effects on investor protections.\n  I voted against the JOBS Act so we can take the time to truly \nunderstand the ramifications of this bill for the marketplace, small \nbusinesses, and investors.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to explain my opposition to H.R. \n3606, a bill that would undermine regulation of our financial markets \nand leave investors vulnerable to fraud.\n  The underlying spirit of this legislation is one that I support: \nimproving the ability of smaller companies, especially startups, to \nraise capital. Small companies are essential to our economy, and it is \ncritical that they be able to raise capital efficiently. Our financial \nregulations should be up-to-date and pragmatic, realistically \nreflecting the size of new public companies in modern times, and new \nmethods of reaching out to potential investors.\n  However, I am deeply concerned that the bill goes too far in rolling \nback investor protections. These rules were created for a reason, often \nafter hard lessons learned from scandals like Enron and WorldCom. They \nprotect ordinary people from losing their retirement savings to \ncorporate fraud and mismanagement, and help our markets function \nefficiently, ensuring that investors of all types have meaningful and \naccurate information. All companies benefit when investors have \nconfidence in the safety and fairness of the marketplace.\n  SEC Chair Mary Schapiro and SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar have raised \nconcerns that this bill will hinder securities law enforcement and \nreduce investor protection. Bloomberg News editorialized that it \n``would be dangerous for investors and could harm already fragile \nfinancial markets.'' The New York Times Editorial Board said this \nlegislation ``would undo essential investor protections, reduce market \ntransparency and distort the efficient allocation of capital.'' CalPERS \nand CalSTRS have expressed concerns, as have Americans for Financial \nReform, AARP, AFL CIO, AFCSME, Consumer Federation of America, the Main \nStreet Alliance, the Sustainable Business Council, and many other well-\nrespected organizations.\n  It is a mistake to rush this important piece of legislation when the \npossibility of a genuinely bipartisan compromise exists. The Reed-\nLandrieu-Levin amendment, which was blocked by Senate Republicans \ndespite bipartisan support from 54 Senators, would have greatly \nimproved the bill. It would have allowed smaller companies to raise \ncapital more easily, without going as far as the underlying bill in \nproviding exemptions for companies with annual gross revenue of up to \n$1 billion. I thank my colleagues for their efforts in drafting that \ncarefully balanced proposal.\n  I am pleased that the bipartisan Merkley-Bennet-Brown amendment \nbecame part of the bill. It will allow companies to reach investors \nthrough social media, but with sensible rules to reduce fraud and \nprovide meaningful regulatory oversight. Nevertheless, significant \ninvestor protection problems remain in the other sections of the bill, \nand I cannot support its passage.\n  I was also disappointed that reauthorization of the Export-Import \nBank, which was offered as an amendment by a group of bipartisan \ncosponsors, was blocked by Senate Republicans.\n  The Ex-Im Bank keeps American businesses competitive worldwide, \nespecially in countries with challenging economic and political \nconditions, and sustains American jobs in the process. The Bank's \ninvestments helped to support 290,000 export-related American jobs last \nyear, including 21,025 in California. As the economic recovery \ncontinues, now is not the time to take away this support and put our \ncompanies at a disadvantage.\n  This bill clearly was rushed; this bill is risky for investors, and \nthat is why I voted no.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I rise today to express \nmy views on the bill that is before us--H.R. 3606--the Jumpstart Our \nBusiness Startups Act. This bill is a package of measures intended to \nincrease capital formation a goal which I believe Democrats and \nRepublicans share. Banking Committee members on both sides of the \naisle, including Senators Schumer, Crapo, Tester, Vitter, Merkley, \nToomey, Bennet and Johanns, teamed up to introduce a number of \nbipartisan legislation on this issue, and I commend them for their hard \nwork.\n  Small businesses are the engine of the American economy. Start-ups \nand small businesses create a majority of new jobs, and they deserve \nevery opportunity to take an idea and turn it into an exciting, new \nventure that could lead to the next great American company.\n  Investments are often necessary resources that allow start-ups and \nsmall businesses to grow. Unfortunately, the recent trend is that fewer \nemerging growth companies are entering the U.S. capital markets though \nIPOs. According to the IPO Task Force, 92 percent of job growth \noccurred after a company's IPO, so it makes sense to consider ways to \nfacilitate more IPOs in a manner that protects investors. There are \nalso novel ideas to help start-ups raise money over the Internet, \nreaching out to their friends through social media and inviting them to \ninvest small amounts to help them grow their business.\n  So in considering these new ideas to spur job creation in a balanced \nand thoughtful way, the Banking Committee held four hearings since last \nsummer. We heard a wide range of views on how best to modernize our \nsecurities laws to allow new and growing companies to raise capital, \nbut in a way that does not undermine investor protections so that \npeople will still be willing to invest.\n  At our hearings and through our efforts to explore this subject, \nmembers of the Banking Committee heard concerns about provisions in the \nHouse bill before us from a number of experts, including the Chairman \nof the Securities and Exchange Commission. One piece of the legislation \nattempts to encourage more companies to pursue an IPO by creating a so-\ncalled ``on-ramp.'' The House bill determines that companies under $1 \nbillion in annual revenue should be exempt from disclosures for up to 5 \nyears. Witnesses at the Banking Committee's hearings raised concerns \nabout whether this threshold is appropriate and accurately reflects \nthose companies that need relief most. The House bill contains a \nprovision to restrict the independence of accounting standard-setting \nby the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For many years Congress \nhas debated whether we\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\nshould legislate accounting standards or leave it to the experts. I \nremain unconvinced that interfering with the independence of FASB would \nbe an appropriate action for Congress to take or would inspire more \npeople to invest in IPOs.\n  It is also unclear that eliminating safeguards to reduce conflicts of \ninterest between stock research analysts and firms selling stock, as \nthe House bill does, will on the whole be beneficial. The absence of \nsuch safeguards a decade ago led analysts to write conflicted stock \nrecommendations which too many Americans believed and relied upon to \ninvest, and ultimately lose, their money. Those misleading and \nfraudulent stock recommendations caused many Americans to pull out of \nthe market and lose confidence in the integrity of the financial \nsystem. We must closely monitor this area going forward.\n  Crowdfunding is a concept with potential, but I do not think that the \nHouse bill provides appropriate oversight of the online funding \nplatforms to ensure that unsuspecting investors are not ripped off by \nan online scam. Operators of online funding platforms are not required \nto register with the SEC. While there is some information these \noperators are required to share with regulators, it remains unclear if \nthis modest sharing of information will be sufficient for regulators to \nmonitor these new equity-raising platforms in the same way investments \non the stock market are monitored. The House bill needlessly limits the \ninvolvement of State securities regulators to help the SEC oversee new \ncrowdfunding operations.\n  In response to these concerns on crowdfunding, I was pleased to \nassist Senators Merkley, Bennet and others in crafting an alternative \napproach that strikes a better balance between capital formation and \ninvestor protection. The Merkley-Bennet amendment requires crowdfunding \ncompanies to provide basic disclosures, including a business plan and \nfinancial information to potential investors. It also requires \ncompanies offering stock online to either register as a broker-dealer \nwith the SEC, or pursue a ``funding portal'' registration. This will \nprovide greater oversight than the House bill. Among other key \nimprovements, the Merkley-Bennet amendment provides for stronger \nFederal-State oversight coordination, and it allows for properly scaled \ninvestment limits as well as an aggregate investment cap across all \ncrowdfunded companies, further protecting investors. For these reasons \nand more, I urge my colleagues to correct the weak House crowdfunding \ntitle and join me in supporting the Merkley-Bennet amendment.\n  Another provision in the underlying House bill modernizes the \nRegulation A threshold by raising the cap on how much money can be \nraised in the capital markets without registering with the SEC. The \nHouse bill transfers authority away from Congress by requiring the SEC \nto review and potentially raise the threshold every 2 years. This has \nthe potential to preclude a rigorous public debate about when and why \nthe Regulation A threshold should be raised again.\n  The House bill would also expand the ability of companies to \nadvertise private offerings to accredited investors, referred to as \nRegulation D. Some have raised concerns that there are not enough \nprotections for our seniors, who could be misled into investing in a \ncompany without a full appreciation of the level of risk they are \ntaking on. This will also warrant close attention moving forward to \nensure seniors are not taken advantage of.\n  Finally, while I believe the current 500 Shareholder Rule should be \nupdated, it is unclear if the House approach to dramatically raise the \nthreshold to 2,000 shareholders of record is a balanced approach. A \nmore modest increase seems more appropriate to balance investor \nprotection and transparency with capital formation.\n  Throughout this process I have sought to help address needed investor \nprotections in a thoughtful manner while helping to support \nentrepreneurs, grow small businesses, and put Americans back to work.\n  But I did not write the underlying House bill before us today, and I \nwas pleased to help support my colleagues in drafting the Senate \nsubstitute amendment. I believe the Senate substitute addresses each of \nthe concerns I raised. I am disappointed more of my colleagues did not \nsupport this alternative that would have increased protections for \ninvestors.\n  That said, no piece of legislation is perfect, and this bill contains \ninnovative new solutions that have the potential to boost the economy. \nSmall businesses and startups deserve the opportunity to test these new \nideas, but Congress has chosen to act quickly.\n  The House bill received 390 votes in the House, including most House \nDemocrats, and the President and the Majority Leader support it. So \ndespite my misgivings over a number of these provisions, I will support \nmy Leader and the President and vote for this legislation.\n  That said, we must all keep an eye on the effects of these changes as \nwe plow this new ground. As lawmakers, we seek out the appropriate \nbalance in writing laws, doing our best to promote a strong economic \nrecovery while protecting the public from abuse and fraud which would \nundermine the confidence in our financial system.\n  While I will support this underlying package today, I believe we all \nhave a shared responsibility to ensure that going forward the new \nchanges that we pass today will truly benefit, and not undermine, both \nstart-ups and investors alike.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, in Taming of the Shrew, William \nShakespeare wrote:\n\n       There is small choice in rotten apples.\n\n  I am here to talk about the choice we have this afternoon, on voting \nfor final passage of H.R. 3606.\n  Over the past week, the Senate has been debating a bill the House has \ncalled the JOBS Act. But as former Securities and Exchange Commission \nchief accountant Lynn E. Turner said recently:\n\n       It won't create jobs, but it will simplify fraud.\n\n  I fully support finding ways to help the private sector create good-\npaying jobs.\n  Last year, I worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \npass the Vets Jobs bill, cutting taxes for small businesses while \nhelping veterans get back to work. This Chamber also passed three free \ntrade agreements, setting the stage to increase American exports to \nKorea, Colombia, and Panama by an estimated $13 billion a year, \nresulting in tens of thousands of new jobs. And just last week, the \nSenate passed overwhelmingly the highway bill, which will create and \nsustain more than 14,000 American jobs per year.\n  But our choice today leaves much to be desired. While this bill \nincludes some very positive changes to enhance and encourage small \nbusiness investment, it includes several rotten apples that roll back \nimportant investor protections and put the integrity of our markets \ninto question.\n  So quickly we forget the past. Just over a decade ago, a company \ncalled Enron revealed one of the largest corporate and accounting \nscandals of our time. We all remember the stories of documents \nshredded, shell companies, exaggerated profits, and lax accounting \nrules.\n  Within 1 month, shareholders lost nearly $11 billion as Enron stock \nplummeted. Families and employees lost their entire savings in a matter \nof days. Investor confidence in the entire system evaporated.\n  Just a few years earlier, the dot-com boom hit a fever pitch. Wall \nStreet firms worked frantically to put together initial public \nofferings for fledgling Internet companies. At the same time, these \nfirms would agree to release upbeat research reports supporting the \nupcoming IPO in exchange for the company's underwriting business. \nUnassuming investors relied on this public research touting the IPOs, \nwhile firms failed to fully disclose the inherent conflicts of \ninterest.\n  Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission responded to \nthese scandals by putting investor protections in place to restore \nconfidence in the markets and ensure companies provide comprehensive \nand honest information to the public. Thanks to these protections, \ninvestors no longer have to wonder whether the accounting and auditing \ndisclosures are, in fact, independent and accurate. We can't afford to \ngo backward.\n  Still, these rules are not perfect. Congress should be looking at \nways to\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\nensure small businesses are given a level playing field.\n  I hear from Montana small businesses that rules under the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act can be costly and time-consuming for small companies which \nsimply lack capacity to handle the extra regulation. I agree we must \nalso look at what these rules may be doing to hamper growth of U.S. \nsmall businesses. But we should not forget the past. We should not \nexempt big business carte blanche without fully discerning the \nimplications.\n  There are several pieces of this legislation with which I agree. I \ncommend my colleague and friend from the State of Montana, Senator \nTester, for his tireless effort to address legitimate concerns with the \ncurrent cap on small business public offerings.\n  Senator Tester introduced his bipartisan measure after meeting and \ntalking to growing companies in Montana and elsewhere that could \nbenefit greatly from raising the cap on regulation A small public \nofferings. Rob Bargatze, founder and CEO of Ligocyte, in Bozeman, MT, \nand chairman of the Montana Bioscience Alliance, testified in the \nBanking Committee last year on ideas to improve access to capital for \nthe emerging bio industry.\n  Rob rightly points out that the current $5 million cap ``does not \nallow for a large enough capital influx for companies to justify the \ntime and expense necessary to satisfy even the relaxed offering and \ndisclosure requirements.'' Senator Tester has done extraordinary work \nto shepherd this bill forward. It received considerable support in the \nHouse, and was included in the Senate substitute amendment that I \nsupported on Tuesday.\n  However, this straightforward update to regulation A has been folded \ninto a broader House package. This package includes enough rotten \napples to spoil the whole bunch. The House fails to take heed of past \nhistory. This bill goes too far in relaxing investor protections \ncritical to preserving the integrity and transparency our markets \ndepend on to function.\n  For example, this bill includes a new IPO process to exempt companies \nfrom many SEC rules for a period of 5 years. The idea is to give small \nemerging companies time to comply with new auditing and reporting \nrequirements. However, the House bill applies to all offerings by \ncompanies with sales less than $1 billion. At this level, even the very \nlarge, well-established companies will have a free pass for 5 years \nbefore complying with the very rules put in place to protect investors \nand the markets from another Enron-type scandal.\n  Furthermore, the House creates a gaping hole in the rules set up \nafter the dot-com bubble to prevent an underwriting bank from \npublishing research reports in support of the upcoming IPO. The House \nbill would now allow underwriting banks to issue such research to \nunsuspecting investors. And it limits the company's responsibility to \nmake sure such research is accurate and comprehensive.\n  We have seen too many examples lately of what can happen when we \ndon't protect the little guys from Wall Street greed--just look at how \nMF Global took advantage of Montana ranchers, and that is when there \nwere rules in place. We can't afford to go back to the days when Enron \nwas able to swindle thousands of Americans out of their life savings.\n  I appreciate the work of my colleagues on this matter, but we owe it \nto American workers and families to see to it that this bill preserves \ninvestor confidence and integrity in our markets.\n  I simply cannot support the House package containing so many bad \napples.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The House bill, as it came to us, on crowdfunding is a \npathway to predatory scams. It requires no information to be provided \nby a company; and if the company provides information, it requires no \nresponsibility or accountability for the accuracy of that information. \nIt allows companies to hire people to pump the stocks, which is exactly \nwhat we all know, from pump-and-dump schemes, is very devastating to \nany sort of solid financial foundation for capital aggregation, capital \nformation.\n  I want to applaud my colleagues Senator Bennet, Senator Landrieu, and \nSenator Brown of Massachusetts, who have worked together to bring this \nbipartisan amendment forward. It provides the right amount of \nstreamlining for the companies, the right amount of streamlining for \nportals on the Internet, and the right set of investor protections, \ninformation, and accountability necessary to make crowdfunding fulfill \nthe exciting potential it has.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the House bill has some very promising \nconcepts about providing access to capital. What it fails to do is \nadequately protect investors.\n  We have tried, through our alternative, to protect investors. That \nalternative has been rejected on a cloture vote by the Senate. We have \nmade some improvements with the Merkley proposal, but we are not quite \nto the point yet where I think we can be confident that investors will \nbe protected.\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\nAs such, I think we should vote against this legislation, and that we \nshould in fact try again and get it right. That is why the head of the \nSecurities Exchange Commission opposes this, and the state securities \nregulators, and former heads of the Securities Exchange Commission, and \nthe Council of Institutional Investors, and many others.\n  We are opening up vast loopholes in our securities laws without \nadequate disclosure for investors. I think we will regret this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I claim the time in support of the \nlegislation.\n  I suggest that we are on the verge of doing something very \nconstructive for our economy, for small businesses, and for job growth, \nand it might be one of the most constructive things we are going to do \nthis year in that area.\n  This legislation makes it easier and more affordable for young and \ngrowing companies to go public, to raise the capital they need to grow, \nto hire more workers. It also actually makes it easier for those who \nwant to remain private and to attract more investors, and to do so \nwithout triggering the very onerous and expensive regulations attendant \nto being a public company.\n  This is going to create more jobs and more growth in the economy. \nThat is why it passed the House with a vote of 390 to 23. That is why \nthe President of the United States has endorsed this bill and said he \nwill sign it into law. That is why there are dozens and dozens of \norganizations and groups and companies and trade associations that \nsupport this legislation, so that we can do something right here, right \nnow, today, that the President will sign into law, which will help \nsmall and growing companies raise the capital they need to grow.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I urge my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to support this bipartisan and now bicameral congressional \nethics measure. This started as a response to stories and allegations \nthat Members of Congress would not be held liable for insider trading. \nIt then developed into what I think is the most significant \ncongressional ethics legislation we have adopted in at least 5 years. \nIt has been in a lot of other public disclosure and good government \nmeasures.\n  I wish to give particular thanks to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and \nScott Brown, who led the effort and took the initiative that got this \nball rolling.\n  I yield the rest of my time to Senator Gillibrand.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank the Chairman.\n  We are certainly taking a significant step forward, on behalf of the \nAmerican people, toward restoring some faith our country has in their \ngovernment. I wish to thank Leader Reid for his leadership, Chairman \nLieberman, Ranking Member Collins, Senator Brown, and all our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who worked so hard to pass this \nlegislation.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from New York, Louise Slaughter, who \nfought so hard and so long toward this effort.\n  This legislation was a rare instance where 96 Senators came together \nto deliver results for the American people. We passed a strong bill \nwith teeth that will clearly and expressly make it illegal for Members \nof Congress, their staff, and their families to gain personal profits \nfrom nonpublic information gained through their service.\n  I strongly believe we have to make it clear no one is above the law \nand that Members of Congress need to play by the exact same rules as \nevery other American. It is simply the right thing to do.\n  This is a commonsense bill and Americans can be assured our only \ninterest is in their interest. When President Obama signs the STOCK \nAct, we will have begun to restore the public's faith in Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask that I be notified after 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the STOCK \nAct, which we will be voting on very shortly. This legislation is based \non a bill that was first introduced in the Senate last fall by Senator \nScott Brown, and a similar one introduced by Senator Gillibrand. I wish \nto commend them both for their work on this legislation. As a cosponsor \nof Senator Brown's bill, I especially want to recognize his leadership \non this issue.\n  I also wish to recognize Chairman Lieberman for all the work he has \ndone in moving this important bill through our committee, through a \nrobust debate here on the Senate floor, and to final passage today.\n  Last fall, press reports on ``60 Minutes'' and elsewhere raised the \nquestion of whether lawmakers are exempt, either legally or \npractically, from the insider trading laws.\n  The STOCK Act is intended to affirm that Members of Congress are not \nexempt from our laws prohibiting insider trading. As we saw when we \nfirst considered this legislation, despite reassurances from legal \nexperts and the SEC that no so such exemption exists, there has been \npersistent disagreement about the issue. That's why we feel it is \nimportant to send a very clear message that Members of Congress are not \nexempt from the insider trading laws, and that is exactly what this \nbill does.\n  Last month the Senate passed its version of the STOCK Act by an \noverwhelming bipartisan margin of 96 to 3. That bill had, at its heart, \nthe affirmation of a duty arising from the relationship of trust and \nconfidence already owed by Members and their staff\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\nto the Congress, the U.S. Government, and the citizens we serve.\n  As I explained when we considered the Senate version, this is not a \nnew fiduciary duty, in the traditional sense, but the recognition of an \nexisting duty. The bill we passed also affirmed that the employees of \nthe executive and judicial branches owe a similar duty, and must also \ncomply with the insider trading laws.\n  There are differences, of course, between the bill we passed last \nmonth and the House version before us today. I believe we could have \nquickly resolved those differences in conference, and would have \npreferred that route. Still, this is a strong bill that has received \noverwhelming bipartisan support. It preserves the core of the bill \npassed by the Senate: to make absolutely clear that elective office is \na place for public service, not for private gain. Underscoring that \nimportant message is the chief purpose of the STOCK Act, and that is \nwhy I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Ms. COLLINS. We need to send a strong message that elective office is \nthe place for public service and not private gain.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I, again, filed a carefully drafted version \nof the bipartisan Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act as an \namendment to the STOCK Act. Despite near unanimous approval for this \namendment just a few short weeks ago, there was an objection by the \nHouse Republican leadership to the anti-corruption measure and Senate \nRepublicans objected to going to conference to restore this important \nanti-corruption provision which had been stripped out of the bill. I am \ndeeply disappointed that the Senate is taking up the House version of \nthe bill that stripped out our bipartisan anti-corruption measure \nwithout consideration or a vote.\n  My amendment reflects a bipartisan, bicameral agreement and would \nstrengthen and clarify key aspects of Federal criminal law to help \ninvestigators and prosecutors attack public corruption Nationwide. The \nHouse stripped this amendment from the STOCK Act after a flurry of \nmisinformation about what the amendment actually does. Senator Cornyn \nand I took concerns very seriously and addressed them effectively when \nwe drafted the amendment. The amendment I seek to offer includes a \nfurther belt-and-suspenders modification to address any legitimate \nconcern. It is carefully and narrowly drawn and will only reach clearly \ncorrupt conduct.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has now reported the Public Corruption \nProsecution Improvements Act with bipartisan support in three \nsuccessive Congresses and it has passed the Senate by voice vote. The \nHouse Judiciary Committee reported a companion bill unanimously. It is \npast time for Congress to act to pass serious anticorruption \nlegislation. That is what the Public Corruption Prosecution \nImprovements Act amendment would be.\n  Public corruption erodes the trust the American people have in those \nwho are given the privilege of public service. Loopholes in existing \nlaws have meant that corrupt conduct goes unchecked. The stain of \ncorruption has spread to all levels of government and victimizes every \nAmerican by chipping away at the foundations of our democracy. My \namendment would help us to take real steps to restore confidence in \ngovernment by rooting out criminal corruption.\n  In Skilling v. United States, the Supreme Court sided with a former \nexecutive from Enron and greatly narrowed the honest services fraud \nstatute, a law that had been appropriately used for decades as a \ncrucial weapon to combat public corruption and self-dealing. The \nCourt's decision leaves open the opportunity for State and Federal \npublic officials to secretly act in their own financial self-interest, \nrather than in the interest of the public. This amendment, in a precise \nmanner without ambiguity, closes this gaping hole in our anticorruption \nlaws.\n  If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct \nwe have seen too often in recent years, Congress should enact \nmeaningful legislation to give law enforcement the tools necessary to \nenforce our anticorruption law. The STOCK Act is much less meaningful \nwithout this important, substantive reform. I am deeply disappointed \nthat the Senate apparently will not take the opportunity to support \ntaking these modest steps to bring those who undermine the public trust \nto justice.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the Senate has the opportunity to \nvote in support of the STOCK Act. If we vote for the House amendment to \nthe Senate bill, we can send this legislation right to President Obama \nto be signed into law. That is exactly what we should do.\n  The lifeblood of our democratic government is the contract between \nthe people and their elected representatives, a contract that must be \nbased on trust that elected officials will act for the good of our \nNation and in the interests of their constituents, and not for personal \ngain. To ensure that we maintain that trust, our Nation has laws and \nour Congress has rules that establish clearly the responsibilities of \ngovernment officials, Members of Congress and their staffs and provide \nfor the enforcement of violations.\n  The legislation before us is, in a way, preventative maintenance to \nprotect that trust. It is a tightening up of our legal and ethical \nguidelines as part of what must be a constant effort to assure that the \ninterests of our Nation and our constituents come first. Our \nconstituents must have confidence that Members of Congress and our \nstaffs will not use our positions for our personal financial benefit.\n  To be clear, as it stands now, it is a violation of the trust our \nconstituents place in us, a violation of the democratic process, a \nviolation of the securities laws, and a violation of congressional \nethics rules for Members of Congress or their employees to engage in \ninsider trading--the use of information not available to the public to \nmake investment decisions. But questions have been raised about insider \ntrading by Members of Congress. The legislation before us today is \ndesigned to ensure that those questions are answered. It removes any \ndoubt that insider trading by Members and employees of Congress is \nagainst the law and against Congressional rules. It is important to \nremove that doubt because any appearance of a breach in trust between \nCongress and our constituents is corrosive to honest, open and \neffective government.\n  Back in December, the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, of which I am a member, held extensive discussions on the \nneed to preserve that trust, including a very productive hearing on \nDecember 1. Later in December, our committee held a markup and approved \nthe Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act. I want \nto commend our chairman, Senator Lieberman, and our ranking member, \nSenator Collins, for their leadership, and the many members of the \ncommittee, Democratic and Republican, who made contributions to that \nprocess.\n  Two things became clear during our hearings and our markup. The first \nis that there was consensus that we should remove any uncertainty about \nthe prohibition against insider trading. The second thing that became \nclear was significant bipartisan desire to avoid any unintended \nconsequences as we sought to remove any uncertainty. We reported out \nthe legislation because of widespread agreement on our goals, but there \nremained concerns about the means, and it was understood that we would \nattempt to address those concerns before the bill came to the floor.\n  And so a number of us worked in the weeks after the markup to make \nsure that our goals and our means were in concert. We met that \nobjective, and our consensus was reflected in the language of the bill \nthat passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 3. The House amendment before \nus today retains the key language from the Senate bill that Senator \nLieberman, Senator Collins and I, among others, worked so hard to get \nright. While some provisions that I supported have been removed by the \nHouse amendment, the central purpose of this bill remains the same. The \nHouse amendment, like the Senate bill it replaces, removes any \nuncertainty over the prohibition on insider trading, and it avoids \nunintended harmful consequences that concerned some of us.\n  I would now like to discuss two critical provisions in the bill \nbefore us today. The first reassures the American people that there are \nno barriers to prosecuting Members and employees\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\nof Congress for insider trading. It does so through language \nestablishing that Members and employees of Congress have a duty arising \nfrom ``a relationship of trust and confidence'' with the Congress, the \ngovernment, and most importantly, with the American people. \nEstablishing such a duty removes any doubt as to whether insider \ntrading prohibitions apply to Congress. It is also important that the \nbill's language makes clear that in offering this new language it does \nnot in any way prevent enforcement of the anti-insider trading \nprovisions contained in current law. Again, I am confident that under \ncurrent law, Members of Congress and our staffs are prohibited from \ninsider trading. This bill will ensure that the current prohibition is \nunambiguous, and thereby strengthened.\n  The second major provision of the legislation instructs the Ethics \nCommittees of both chambers to issue clear guidance to members and \nstaffs regarding the prohibition on profiting from inside information. \nThis guidance will clarify that existing rules in both chambers \nrelative to gifts and conflicts of interest also prohibit the use of \nnonpublic information gained in the conduct of official duties for \nprivate profit.\n  Let me briefly mention one other provision, unrelated to insider \ntrading but nonetheless an important step forward in terms of gaining \nthe confidence of our constituents. As one of the originators of the \nLobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, I am well aware of the value of \ntransparency in government. The bill before us improves congressional \ntransparency by requiring that personal financial disclosure filings \nrequired of members and certain staff are made available electronically \nto the public. But because this bill also significantly expands the \nnumber of officials required to file public disclosures, including law \nenforcement, military, and intelligence officers, it is critical that \nthis provision be implemented in a way that is consistent with our \nnational security interests. Care should be taken to ensure that public \nfilers are not made unnecessarily vulnerable to malicious use of \npersonal information.\n  The House amendment also removes a provision of the Senate bill that \nwould have required political intelligence consultants to register in a \nway similar to how lobbyists are required to register currently. \nInstead, the House amendment, like the version of the Senate bill that \nwas reported by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, requires the Comptroller General of the United States to \nstudy the role of political intelligence in financial markets and \nreport back to Congress. It is corrosive of open government for \npolitical intelligence consultants to sell their access to officials. \nBefore Congress acts to address this issue, we must learn more about \nit, which is why I support this study. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to address this issue once we have the benefit of the \nComptroller's report.\n  In addition to the insider trading and disclosure provisions, this \nbill contains numerous other important improvements to our ethics laws. \nI urge my colleagues to join together today, to pass this legislation \nand send it to President Obama for his signature.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement appear in the Record at the \nappropriate place before the vote on the STOCK Act.\n\n\n                Cloture Motion on the STOCK Act, S. 2038\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to support cloture on \nthe motion to concur in the House amendment to the ``Stop Trading on \nCongressional Knowledge Act,'' the ``STOCK Act''--S. 2038.\n  We have come a long way in a short time in a bipartisan fashion on \nthis bill, which does many good things.\n  I want to start by thanking my colleagues, Ranking member Collins and \nSenators Gillibrand and Brown for all their work on this bill.\n  And I want to thank Majority Leader Reid for making the STOCK Act the \nfirst bill the Senate debated after the winter recess.\n  Mr. President, this problem received a jolt of momentum late last \nyear when ``60 Minutes'' aired allegations that some Members of \nCongress and their staffs used information gained on their jobs to \nenrich themselves with time-sensitive investments in the stock market \nand nothing could be done because Congress had exempted itself from \ninsider trading laws.\n  We took the issue up at a hearing of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in December and established that the \ncharge that Congress had exempted itself from insider trading laws was \njust not true. However, it was also clear that existing laws needed to \nbe clarified.\n  At our committee hearing, several securities law experts told us that \nthere was ambiguity in the law and they could not be sure how a court \nwould rule if there was a challenge to the SEC's authority to bring an \ninsider trading case against a Member of Congress.\n  That is because, as the experts explained, a person may be found to \nhave violated the insider trading laws only if he or she breaks a \nfiduciary duty, a duty of trust and confidence owed to somebody--to the \nshareholders of the company, or to the source of the nonpublic \ninformation, for example.\n  The experts told us that it is possible that a judge looking at \nexisting case law might conclude that Members of Congress owe no duty \nto anyone with respect to the nonpublic information they receive while \ncarrying out their duties. Now, if I were a judge, I would not see it \nthat way. It seems self-evident that public office is a public trust, \nand that Members of Congress have a duty to the institution of \nCongress, to the government as a whole, and to the American people not \nto use information gained during their time in Congress--and \nunavailable to the public--to make investments for personal profit.\n  But the fact is that there are some very smart legal experts who are \nconcerned that a judge would not see it that way. And this lack of \nclarity could in fact shield a Member of Congress from prosecution for \ninsider trading.\n  The STOCK Act clarifies this ambiguity in the Security Exchange Act \nof 1934 by explicitly stating that Members of Congress and our staffs \nhave a duty of trust to the institution of Congress, to the U.S. \nGovernment, and to the American people--a duty that Members of Congress \nviolate if they trade on non-public information they gain by virtue of \ntheir position.\n  The bill also requires the Ethics Committees of both houses of \nCongress to issue guidance to clarify that Members and staff may not \nuse non-public information derived from their position in Congress to \nmake a private profit.\n  Besides these changes aimed at insider trading, the STOCK Act \nincludes other significant Congressional ethics legislation. For \nexample, it requires Members of Congress and their staffs to file \npublic reports on their purchases or sale of stocks, bonds, commodities \nfutures or other financial transactions exceeding $1,000 within 30 days \nof the transaction. Currently these trades are reported once a year. \nTimelier reporting will allow the SEC and the public to assess whether \nthere is anything suspicious about the timing of the trade.\n  The bill also contains important language that requires financial \ndisclosure forms filed by Members and staff be filed electronically \nand--perhaps even more significantly--be available online for public \nreview.\n  There really is no sensible reason to make someone come physically \ninto the House or Senate to see a copy of one of these financial \ndisclosure forms, which are public records.\n  The bill will also require the Government Accountability Office to \nstudy and report back to Congress on so-called ``political \nintelligence'' consultants who sell information derived from government \nofficials to investors.\n  The STOCK Act also contains several provisions that were added in the \nSenate or House to strengthen the bill, including language offered by \nSenator Blumenthal related to the denial of Congressional benefits to \nMembers who commit public corruption crimes; language offered by \nSenator Boxer that will, for the first time, require Members of \nCongress and senior Executive Branch officials to disclose their \nmortgages on their annual financial disclosure forms; and language \noffered by Senator McCain to prohibit executives of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac from receiving bonuses while the firms remain in federal \nconservatorship.\n  This is a very strong bill, in fact, the strongest Congressional \nethics reform\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\nbill that has been passed by Congress since we passed the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act in 2007.\n  This bill was reported as an original bill out of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs on December 13 by a vote of \n7 to 2. Then, after thorough debate on the Senate floor, including the \nconsideration of 20 amendments, the bill passed the Senate on Feb. 2 by \na vote of 96 to 3.\n  The bill was sent to the House, which moved quickly and approved the \nSTOCK Act just a week later by a lopsided majority of 417 to 2.\n  This is Congress at its best. A problem was identified that cut \ndirectly to the public's faith in this institution and we dealt with it \nquickly and on a bipartisan basis in both Houses.\n  This should not only be applauded but serve as a model as we take up \nother crucial legislation, such as Postal reform and cybersecurity. \nThis shows we can work together rather than engage in a perpetual \npartisan tug of war.\n  Mr. President, in his farewell address to the Nation, President \nWashington said that ``virtue or morality is a necessary spring of \npopular government'' and that we cannot ``look with indifference'' at \nanything that shakes that foundation.\n  The STOCK Act offers us a chance to restore trust in our elected \ngovernment and to show those who, with their votes, gave us the honor \nof representing them here, that the only business we do here is the \npeople's business.\n\n\n                            Duty Provisions\n\n  Mr. REID. There are many important issues facing our country today \nand solutions will require bipartisan cooperation. The STOCK Act has \nenjoyed overwhelmingly bipartisan support because it addresses a key \nissue, namely government accountability to the American people.\n  Members of Congress and those we employ must be held accountable to \nthe same standards and laws as the citizens we represent. We owe a duty \nof trust and loyalty to the American people to conduct our private \nlives with the highest integrity and to never abuse our office to gain \nunfair or unethical financial advantages. I am pleased that we have \nvoted overwhelmingly to pass a bill that closes any loopholes, real or \nperceived, in this regard.\n  I would note specifically that the STOCK Act requires that Members of \nCongress and their staffs abstain from profiting on any nonpublic \ninformation derived from a person's position or gained in the \nperformance of official responsibilities. The bill also makes \nabsolutely clear that Members and staff are not exempt from the insider \ntrading prohibitions arising under the securities laws, including \nsection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 \nthereunder.\n  However, and I think my distinguished colleague from Connecticut will \nagree, the STOCK Act should not be interpreted as limiting government \ntransparency in any way. Discourse with the public, whether privately \nor publicly, is vital to maintaining a healthy democratic society.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I am happy about the \nreforms that Congress has adopted, and I agree that the STOCK Act is \nnot intended to limit government transparency or hinder dissemination \nof information to interested parties regarding Congressional activities \nand deliberations.\n  In the interest of clarity for the record, I would like to state that \nthe STOCK Act does not turn information regarding Congressional \nactivities and deliberations that was previously not material, into \nmaterial information with respect to securities laws. I would also note \nthat a Member or employee of Congress who, in the course of performing \ntheir duties, has a nonpublic conversation with a citizen or \nconstituent does not automatically violate the duty imposed by Section \n4(b)(2) the STOCK Act.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his comments. With \nregard to the Chairman's last remark, I would like to point out that my \noffice has fielded concerns from multiple sources that the duty \nlanguage may be interpreted by the SEC as creating liability for public \nofficials and their staff when communicating privately with \nconstituents. There is concern that a threat of this would have a \nsignificant chilling effect on government transparency. I understand \nhowever that in conversations with my leadership staff the SEC has \nexplicitly clarified that it does not view the STOCK Act as creating \nnew limitations on the disclosure of Congressional information in \nconversations with constituents. I also understand that leadership \nstaff has been assured by the SEC that any case brought under the \ninsider trading prohibitions would still require the SEC to prove that \na Member of Congress or their staff acted with scienter, which means \nacting corruptly, knowingly, recklessly or in bad faith.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Democratic leader is correct. As the Director of \nEnforcement at the SEC, Robert Khuzami, stated in his testimony before \nthe House Financial Services Committee: ``You have to be acting with \ncorrupt intent, knowledge, or recklessness. If you act in good faith, \nyou're not going to be guilty.'' My staff had detailed conversations \nwith the SEC while drafting the duty provisions and raised these \nconcerns specifically. Our goal in drafting the duty provisions of the \nSTOCK act was to ensure that insider trading restrictions apply to \ngovernment officials no differently than they do to the rest of the \npublic, but at the same time, avoid unintended consequences that could \ncurtail interaction between Congress and the public.\n  Mr. REID. Furthermore, it is my understanding that Section 11 of this \nbill is not intended to override the authority of the President to \nexempt from public availability the financial disclosure reports of \nindividuals engaged in intelligence activities, which is contained in \nsection 105(a)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act. As to the executive \nbranch, section 105(a)(1) applies to all of the public availability \nrequirements of this bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is correct. It is not the intent of the STOCK Act \nto override the President's authority for necessary exemptions for \nintelligence activities.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Scott Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, today, we put America \nfirst and we passed a bipartisan and now bicameral bill the President \nwill sign, and we took a step to ending the deficit of trust hurting \nour democracy. I wish to thank Senator Gillibrand and the leadership of \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman for marking this up so quickly. \nToday is a good day.\n  The STOCK Act will affirm that Members of Congress are not above the \nlaw and will increase transparency by requiring Members of Congress and \nhighly compensated Federal employees to disclose all their trading \nactivity within 45 days. Today, America is a government by the people \nand for the people, and that means our elected officials must follow \nthe same laws as everybody. We have taken a step toward reestablishing \ntrust, and today we are one step closer to making every seat the \npeople's seat.\n  I encourage everybody to support this passage.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Reid motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to S. 2038, the Stop Trading on \n     Congressional Knowledge Act.\n         Harry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, Daniel K.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nominations of David Nuffer, of Utah, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Utah; Ronnie Abrams, \nof New York, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of New York; and Rudolph Contreras, of Virginia, to be United \nStates District Judge for the District of Columbia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senate is about to vote on the \nnomination of David Nuffer to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nFederal trial court for Utah. This is not a nomination that should have \nbeen filibustered or required the filing of a cloture motion in order \nto be scheduled for consideration by the Senate. This is a nomination, \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee over 5 months ago, that \nwe should have voted on and confirmed last year.\n  Today's consideration was facilitated when the majority leader and \nthe republican leader came to an understanding last week. With a \njudicial vacancies crisis that has lasted years, and nearly one in 10 \njudgeships across the Nation vacant, the Senate needs to work to reduce \njudicial vacancies significantly before the end of the year.\n  Unlike the nearly 60 district court nominees of President Bush who \nwere confirmed within a week of being reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee during President Bush's first term, qualified, consensus \nnominees to fill vacancies on our Federal courts have been needlessly \nstalled during President Obama's first term. The five-month delay in \nthe consideration of Judge Nuffer is another example of the needless \ndelays that were occasioned by Republicans' unwillingness to agree to \nschedule the nomination for a vote. The application of the ``new \nstandard'' the junior Senator from Utah conceded Republicans are \napplying to President Obama's nominees continues to hurt the America \npeople all over the country who are being forced to wait for judges to \nfill these important Federal trial court vacancies and hear their \ncases. Justice is being delayed for millions of Americans.\n  This nomination is one of the 20 circuit and district court \nnominations ready for Senate consideration and a final confirmation \nvote. They were all reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee after \nthorough review. All but a handful are by any measure consensus \nnominations, as is Judge Nuffer. There was never any good reason for \nthe Senate not to proceed to votes on these nominations. It should not \nhave taken cloture motions to get agreement to schedule votes on these \nqualified, consensus judicial nominations.\n  Judge Nuffer has been serving over the last 17 years as a magistrate \njudge for the very court to which he was nominated by the President. By \nany sensible standard he should be confirmed. No ``new standard'' \nshould be used to oppose his confirmation. Like Judge Nuffer, the other \nnominees awaiting votes by the Senate are qualified judicial nominees. \nThey are nominees whose judicial philosophy is well within the \nmainstream. These are all nominees supported by their home State \nSenators, both Republican and Democratic. The consequence of these \nmonths of delays is borne by the millions of Americans who live in \ndistricts and circuits with vacancies that could be filled as soon as \nSenate Republicans allow votes on the judicial nominations currently \nbefore the Senate awaiting their final consideration.\n  We must continue with the pattern set by last week's agreement. The \nSenate needs to make progress beyond the 14 nominations in that \nagreement and beyond the 20 nominations currently on the calendar. \nThere are another eight judicial nominees who have had hearings and are \nworking their way through the committee process. There was another \nneedless delay when Republicans boycotted the Judiciary Committee \nmeeting last week and prevented a quorum while insisting on a meeting \nto hold over nominees. We will overcome that and have those nominations \nbefore the Senate this spring.\n  I hope the committee will hold hearings on another 11 nominations in \nthe next few weeks. One of those nominees, Robert Shelby, is to fill \nthe other vacancy on the United States District Court for the District \nof Utah. Whether he is included depends in large measure on the \nSenators from Utah.\n  I have assiduously protected the rights of the minority in this \nprocess. I have only proceeded with judicial nominations supported by \nboth home State Senators. That has meant that we are not able to \nproceed on current nominees from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Florida, \nOklahoma and Utah. I even stopped proceedings on a circuit court \nnominee from Kansas when the Kansas Senators reversed themselves and \nwithdrew their support for the nominee.\n  I have been discussing with the junior Senator from Utah whether he \nwill\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\nsupport the nomination of Robert Shelby. I have yet to receive \nassurance that he will. His vote today on the Nuffer nomination may \nprovide a clue.\n  When the Judiciary Committee considered the nomination of David \nNuffer, both Republican home State Senators, Senator Hatch and Senator \nLee, strongly supported the President's nomination. This is another \nnomination on which President Obama reached out and consulted with \nRepublican home State Senators. The Senators from Utah supported this \nnomination when the President made it last year and when after hearing \nand study it was voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee. They both \nserve on the Committee. Had either of them opposed this nomination, I \nwould not have proceeded with it. They supported it. I hope this will \nnot be another occasion on which either switches his vote from yes to \nno. That is another new practice and new standard that Senate \nRepublicans have seemed to adopt.\n  By working steadily and by proceeding with the regular consideration \nof judicial nominations, I hope the Senate ensures that the Federal \ncourts have the judges they need to provide justice for all Americans \nwithout needless delay. In the two most recent presidential election \nyears, 2004 and 2008, we worked together to reduce judicial vacancies \nto the lowest levels in decades. In 1992, with a Republican President \nand a Democratic Senate majority, we confirmed 66 judicial nominees.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge hears the \ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  I went back and checked my recollection of how we considered \nconsensus Federal trial court nominees in President Bush's first term. \nNearly 60 were confirmed within a week of being voted on by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. By contrast there have only been two judicial \nnominees voted on so promptly since President Obama took office. I said \nat the time we were able to vote on the Alabama nominee supported by \nSenator Sessions, who was at that time the Committee's Ranking \nRepublican member, and on Judge Reiss of Vermont, that I hoped they \nwould become the model for regular order. Instead, they stand out as \nisolated exceptions to the months of delay Senate Republicans have \ninsisted on before considering consensus Federal trial court nominees \nof this President. Today, the Senate will vote on the nominations of \nRonnie Abrams and Rudolph Contreras to fill judicial vacancies in the \nU.S. District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the \nDistrict of Columbia. These are both nominations that were reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee over 4 months ago. They are \namong the many nominations that could and should have been voted on and \nconfirmed last year.\n\n  Today's votes are pursuant to the agreement reached by the majority \nleader and the Republican leader last week. Although I commend the step \nforward, the Senate must continue to vote on judicial nominations \nreported by the Judiciary Committee beyond the dozen encompassed by \nthat agreement, if we are to make significant progress in reducing the \nvacancies across the Nation that number nearly one in 10.\n  Just yesterday, I read an article about the crushing caseload that \nthe Federal courts in Arizona currently face. I will ask unanimous \nconsent to include a copy of the article, entitled ``Federal courts in \nArizona face crushing caseload,'' in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. In the article, the chief judge of Arizona's Federal trial \ncourt noted that they are in ``dire circumstances'' and that they are \n``under water'' from all the cases on their docket. The report notes \nthat the Federal court not having its full complement of judges \n``lessens the quality of justice for all parties involved.'' They are \nrelying on visiting judges from other courts around the country to \nassist with their court proceedings. In too many places around the \ncountry, our Federal courts have to rely on senior judges. Their \ndedication is commendable but they should not be carrying such heavy \nworkloads.\n  The needless 4-month delays in the consideration of Ronnie Abrams and \nRudolph Contreras are just more examples of the delays that have been \noccasioned by Republicans' unwillingness to agree to schedule the \nnominations for a vote. The Senate must return to the practice of \nmoving forward on consensus nominees and of ``build[ing] bridges \ninstead of burn[ing] them,'' as Senator Coburn urged.\n  The nominations today are two of the 20 circuit and district court \nnominations ready for Senate consideration and a final confirmation \nvote. They were all reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee after \nthorough review. All but a handful are by any measure consensus \nnominations, as are Ms. Abrams and Mr. Contreras. There was never any \ngood reason for the Senate not to proceed to votes on these \nnominations. It should not have taken cloture petitions to secure \nagreement to schedule votes on these qualified, consensus judicial \nnominations.\n  Ronnie Abrams is nominated to serve as a Federal trial judge on the \nSouthern District of New York. She is an experienced attorney who spent \n10 years as a Federal prosecutor in the district to which she has been \nnominated. She served as Chief of the General Crimes Unit and Deputy \nChief of the Criminal Division. Since 2008, Ms. Abrams has worked as \nSpecial Counsel for Pro Bono at the New York law firm Davis Polk & \nWardwell, where she began her legal career after clerking for Chief \nJudge Thomas Griesa in the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York.\n  Rudolph Contreras is nominated to serve as a Federal trial judge in \nthe District of Columbia. Born to Cuban immigrants, Mr. Contreras has \ndevoted his career to public service for the last 17 years. He worked \nas an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia and in \nDelaware. He has risen to be the chief of the Civil Division of the \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, where he currently \nserves. The delay in considering his nomination recalls the 4-month \nfilibuster against the nomination of Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida. \nOn that nomination, Senate Republicans delayed the vote for another 2 \ndays after cloture was invoked and the filibuster brought to an end. \nJudge Jordan was then finally confirmed as the first Cuban-American to \nserve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n  The consequences of these months of delays are borne by the nearly \n160 million Americans who live in districts and circuits with vacancies \nthat could be filled as soon as Senate Republicans agree to up or down \nvotes on the 20 judicial nominations currently before the Senate \nawaiting a confirmation vote.\n  The Senate must continue the actions allowed by last week's \nagreement. The Senate needs to make progress beyond the nominations \nincluded in that agreement, and beyond the 20 nominations currently on \nthe calendar. There are another eight judicial nominees who have had \nhearings and are working their way through the Committee process. \nSeveral of those were needlessly delayed last week when Republicans \nboycotted the Judiciary Committee meeting and prevented a quorum after \ninsisting on a meeting only to hold over nominees. There are another 11 \nnominations on which the Committee should be holding additional \nhearings during the next several weeks. By working steadily and by \ncontinuing the regular consideration of judicial nominations \nrepresented by last week's understanding between the leaders, the \nSenate can do its part to ensure that the Federal courts have the \njudges they need to provide justice for all Americans without needless \ndelay.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge\n\n[[Page S1983]]\n\nhears the case. When two small business owners disagree over a \ncontract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve \ntheir dispute.\n  Today's votes are steps in the right direction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article I referenced be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From YumaSun.com, Mar. 17, 2012]\n\n            Federal Courts in Arizona Face Crushing Caseload\n\n                          (By Victoria Pelham)\n\n       Federal courts in Arizona are still in ``dire \n     circumstances'' as an emergency declaration that was supposed \n     to help judges keep pace with a crushing caseload is set to \n     expire.\n       The judicial emergency declared last year in the wake of \n     the shooting death of Chief Judge John Roll runs out Monday, \n     but officials say the U.S. District Court for the state still \n     faces many of the same challenges.\n       ``The reason that existed last year still prevails this \n     year,'' Chief Judge Roslyn Silver said recently. ``We are \n     still in dire circumstances. We are under water.''\n       The judicial emergency more than doubled the time allowed \n     for the government to bring a case to trial, giving the court \n     some relief from a rising caseload and judicial vacancies in \n     the district.\n       Through ``lots of hard work'' and the help of visiting \n     judges, the district court has managed to stay within the \n     original 70-day time frame for cases to come to trial under \n     the Speedy Trial Act and has not had to invoke the 180-day \n     limit allowed under the emergency.\n       But that balancing act could be thrown off, Silver said, \n     without the extra help the court has been receiving.\n       ``If we don't have that, which is the fail-safe, then we're \n     in big trouble, because there's just no way we could handle \n     this caseload,'' Silver said.\n       Arizona had the highest number of per-judge felony filings \n     in the nation in fiscal 2011, at 554 criminal felony filings \n     for each district court judge, according to the U.S. District \n     Court Judicial Caseload Profile for Arizona. That load was \n     fueled in part by the large number of immigration cases \n     handled in the court, experts said.\n       The court also saw the total number of cases per judge grow \n     by 22 percent in the fiscal year, from 793 to 969, the \n     fourth-highest judicial caseload in the country, the report \n     said.\n       It came as three of the 13 district judgeships allotted to \n     the state were vacant. Two were empty last January when Roll \n     was killed in the shooting spree at a Tucson supermarket that \n     killed five others and wounded 13, including former Rep. \n     Gabrielle Giffords.\n       The judicial emergency was declared by Silver after Roll's \n     death. It was extended last February to this March by the \n     Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit, in an effort to buy \n     the district some breathing room.\n       President Barack Obama nominated two candidates in June to \n     fill the vacancies, but only one, Judge Jennifer Guerin \n     Zipps, has been appointed. The other nominee, attorney \n     Rosemary Marquez, has been stalled in the Senate.\n       Brian Karth, the clerk for the district, said filling those \n     vacancies is the minimum needed. He claimed that, according \n     to judicial standards, the district's caseload is high enough \n     to warrant 10 additional judgeships.\n       In the meantime, the district has had to rely on visiting \n     judges from other districts across the country, Karth said. \n     One to two judges come each week to assist with court \n     proceedings.\n       ``We continue to struggle to keep within standards, and \n     everybody's basically forced to work harder and try to be \n     resourceful in pulling together resources, sometimes from \n     outside our district, to perform well,'' Karth said.\n       ``There's certainly a wear and tear on anybody who has to \n     sustain that sort of a pace for lengthy periods,'' he said.\n       Walter Nash, a trial lawyer and partner with Nash & \n     Kirchner in Tucson, said the ``crushing'' caseload in the \n     district is having a serious impact on trials.\n       ``It lessens the quality of justice for all parties \n     involved,'' Nash said.\n       Prosecutors have less time to prepare arguments, while \n     victims' cases aren't resolved ``as fast as they should be.'' \n     And judges could be rushed into a decision, meaning some \n     guilty defendants may be acquitted, he said.\n       The need for new judges will be even greater when Speedy \n     Trial Act provisions are reinstated next week after the \n     emergency expires, Nash said.\n       ``You get the best result . . . if everyone has time to \n     handle a case properly,'' Nash said.\n       Silver agreed that slow trials affect all sectors of the \n     public and courts have an ``obligation to ensure justice for \n     all.'' But with limited resources, space problems in \n     courtrooms, large numbers of criminal cases and other \n     concerns, trials could suffer, with civil trials in \n     particular lagging behind or not getting the attention they \n     deserve.\n       ``So far we're OK, but it will present a problem at some \n     time,'' Silver said. ``We are required to act fairly in every \n     criminal case, but there's only so much we can do.''\n       The emergency cannot be renewed for six months after it \n     expires. Silver said that if things don't improve, officials \n     will have to consider the possibility of renewing.\n       ``There was a reason for it last year, and I expect \n     there'll be a reason for it this year,'' she said.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, again, we are moving forward under the \nregular order and procedures of the Senate. This year, we have been in \nsession for about 32 days, including today. During that time we will \nhave confirmed 12 judges. That is an average of better than 1 \nconfirmation for every 3 days. With the confirmations today, the Senate \nwill have confirmed nearly 74 percent of President Obama's Article III \njudicial nominations.\n  Today, we turn to three more judicial nominations. Ronnie Abrams is \nnominated to be United States District Judge for the Southern District \nof New York. She graduated with a B.A. from Cornell University in 1990. \nShe received her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1993. Upon law school \ngraduation, she clerked for Honorable Thomas P. Griesa of the United \nState District Court for the Southern District of New York. From 1994 \nto 1998 she worked as an associate on civil matters at David Polk and \nWardwell. In 1998, Ms. Abrams joined the United States Attorney's \nOffice for the Southern District of New York as an Assistant United \nStates Attorney in the Criminal Division. She handled a variety of \ncriminal cases, inducing ones involving the sexual exploitation of \nchildren, bank robbery, immigration, identity theft and money \nlaundering. She also served in the Narcotics, Violent Crime and Public \nCorruption Units. From 2004 to 2008, Ms. Abrams served in a supervisory \nrole at the United States Attorney's Office, as either Deputy Chief or \nChief of the Criminal Division. In 2008, Ms. Abrams returned to David \nPolk and Wardwell as Special Counsel for Pro Bono and represents those \nwithout means to represent themselves.\n  Rudolph Contreras is nominated to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of Columbia. He is a 1984 graduate from Florida State \nUniversity and received his J.D. in 1991 from the University of \nPennsylvania Law School. After graduating from law school, Mr. \nContreras joined the litigation department of the law firm Jones Day. \nIn 1994, he became an Assistant United States Attorney in the District \nof Delaware and the District of Columbia. In that capacity, he has \nrepresented the United States and its departments at both the trial \nlevel and appellate levels in civil actions. In 2003, Mr. Contreras \nbecame Chief of the Civil Division in the District of Delaware. There, \nhe supervises 40 Assistant United States Attorneys, 6 Special Assistant \nUnited States Attorneys, and 31 support staffers.\n  David Nuffer is nominated to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Utah. He received his B.S. in 1975 and his J.D. in 1978 \nfrom Brigham Young University. He began his legal career as an \nassociate at Allen Thompson & Hughes. From 1982 to 1992, Judge Nuffer \npracticed both criminal prosecution and criminal defense. From 1995 to \n2002, he represented municipalities, individuals and businesses in \ncivil litigation. He also served as a part-time United States \nMagistrate Judge during this time. In 2003, he was appointed to serve \nas a full-time magistrate judge. In 2009, he became Chief Magistrate \nJudge. He has presided over 30 cases that have gone to verdict or \njudgment. While some may complain about the time it has taken to \nconfirm Judge Nuffer, I would note that the President took over a year \nand a half--576 days--to submit this nomination, once the vacancy \noccurred.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \nconfirm U.S. Magistrate Judge David Nuffer to the U.S. District Court \nin Utah. Two of the five judicial positions on that busy court have \nbeen vacant for some time, and Judge Nuffer will be a welcome addition.\n  Judge Nuffer has been involved in virtually all aspects of the legal \ncommunity in Utah. He was in private practice for more than 20 years \nand has been an adjunct professor at Brigham Young University's J. \nReuben Clark Law School since 2001. He has chaired the Utah Judicial \nConduct Commission and served on advisory and study committees, task \nforces, and councils appointed by the Utah Supreme Court. This \ndiversity of experience and commitment to both the bar and the bench\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\nmake him well qualified to join the U.S. District Court.\n  Judge Nuffer has also worked to promote the rule of law \ninternationally, as a consultant and lecturer with the Ukraine Rule of \nLaw Project. I was pleased last year to meet with a group of judges \nfrom Ukraine who were in the United States, both Washington and in \nUtah, as part of this educational program. Our independent judicial \nsystem and commitment to the rule of law is unparalleled anywhere in \nthe world.\n  I also want to note Judge Nuffer's efforts to promote access to the \ncourts through technology. He has definitely been ahead of the curve on \nthis issue. Back in the 1990s, Judge Nuffer directed the Utah \nElectronic Law Project and served on the Utah Supreme Court's Ad Hoc \nCommittee on Access to Electronic Court Records. As Chairman of the \nSenate Republican High-Tech Task Force, I appreciate how such cutting \nedge efforts can benefit all Americans at low cost.\n  As I travel throughout Utah talking to lawyers and judges, the \nunanimous opinion is that Judge Nuffer has the experience, temperament, \nand integrity to be a great Federal judge. It was no surprise when the \nAmerican Bar Association unanimously gave him its highest rating. I \nthank my colleagues for their support of this fine nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would note, on this side, at least--I know we have to \nhave a rollcall on this first nominee. I will have no objection if \nthere are voice votes on the next two. That would be up to others. But \non the first one I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof David Nuffer, of Utah, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Utah.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, we expect this to be the last vote. I am \ntold that we have worked something out so the next judge we can do by \nvoice. This will be the last vote of the week.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I am honored to offer my strong \nsupport for the nomination of Ronnie Abrams to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. I also want to \nthank President Obama for acting on my recommendation and nominating \nanother superbly qualified woman jurist to the Federal bench.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Ms. Abrams for many years. I know \nher as a fairminded woman of great integrity. Throughout her \ndistinguished legal career, she has proven herself as an exceptional \nattorney. As Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division for the United \nStates Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, she \nsupervised hundreds of prosecutions, including violent crime, organized \ncrime, white-collar crime, public corruption, drug trafficking, and \ncrimes against children.\n  Her record shows her commitment to justice. I can tell you she has a \ndeep and sincere commitment to public service. There is no question \nthat Ms. Abrams is extremely well qualified and well suited to be a \nFederal judge.\n  I strongly believe our Nation needs more women such as her serving on \nthe Federal judiciary, an institution that I believe needs more \nexceptional women. I believe it is incredibly important that we do \nreach the point of balance in the judiciary. I recommend her most \nhighly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Ronnie Abrams, of New York, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York?\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about a disturbing \ndisclosure made recently by the National Football League. Their \ninvestigation revealed that the New Orleans Saints had allegedly been \noperating an illegal ``bounty'' program.\n  Under this bounty program, players were reportedly given significant \nsums of money in direct exchange for intentionally injuring opposing \nplayers, disabling them, and for having them carried off the field in \nan ambulance.\n  According to reports, compensation started at $1,000 for causing an \nopponent to be ``carried off'' the field. This was called a ``cart-\noff.'' The price was $1,500 for causing an opponent to be unable to \ncontinue the game. This was known as a ``knockout.'' These ``bounties'' \nreportedly reached high sums of money, as large as $10,000 and even \n$50,000.\n  What is even more troubling is that reports suggest that these bounty \nsystems might have reached far beyond the New Orleans Saints. Reports \nsurfacing as a result of the NFL's investigation have indicated that \nother teams may have also been engaged in this practice.\n  One former professional football player recently tweeted:\n\n       Why is this a big deal now? Bounties have been going on \n     forever.\n\n  Another stated:\n\n       Prices were set on Saturday nights in the team hotel. . . . \n     We laid our bounties on opposing players. We targeted big \n     names, our sights set on taking them out of the game.\n\n  Let me tell you why this is important and reprehensible. A spirit of \naggressiveness and competitiveness is an integral part of many sporting \ncontests, but bribing players to intentionally hurt their opponents \ncannot be tolerated. We have to put an end to this.\n  Just yesterday, to its credit, the NFL announced historically stiff \npenalties for those involved in the New Orleans Saints bounty program. \nThe team's head coach, general manager, former defensive coordinator, \nand assistant head coach were suspended for long periods of time. The \nteam will forfeit selections in upcoming drafts and the team was fined.\n\n  I commend the National Football League for taking swift and decisive \naction to discipline those involved in the Saints' bounty program, but \nwe need to make sure this never happens again on any team, in any team \nsport. For that reason, I will be convening a hearing of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I spoke to Senator Pat Leahy about this this \nmorning, and he has given me his permission as chairman to move \nforward. We will have a hearing and put on the record what sports \nleagues and teams at the professional and collegiate levels are doing \nto make sure there is no place in athletics for these pay-to-maim \nbounties. I want to hear the policies and practices in each of the \nmajor sports and collegiate sports that are being put in place, and I \nwant to explore whether Federal legislation is required.\n  Currently, bribery in a sporting contest is a Federal crime. It is \nillegal to carry out a scheme in interstate commerce to influence a \nsporting contest through bribery. This goes back to a law enacted \nalmost 50 years ago by Senator Kenneth Keating of New York. Here is \nwhat he said at the time about bribery that would influence the outcome \nof a sporting contest:\n\n       We must do everything we can to keep sports clean so that \n     the fans, and especially young people, can continue to have \n     complete confidence in the honesty of the players and the \n     contest. Scandals in the sporting world are big news, and can \n     have a devastating and shocking effect on the outlook of our \n     youth, to whom sports figures are heroes and idols.\n\n  As the Department of Justice stated at that time, when the Federal \nlaw making it a crime to engage in bribery to influence the outcome of \na sporting contest was enacted, Federal legislation was necessary to \ndeal with the inadequacies and jurisdictional limitations of State law.\n  Mr. President, most of us are sports fans. I would have to list my \nfavorite sports as football, with baseball a close second. I know \nfootball is a contact sport. I still have a bum knee to show from my \nfootball experience in high school. Accidents will happen and injuries \nwill happen. That is a part of the game. I knew it when I put on my \nuniform and went out on the field. But I never dreamed there would be \nsome conspiracy, some bribery involved and some other player trying to \nintentionally hurt me or take me out of the game. That goes way beyond \nsports.\n  I am heartened by the fact that many of the leaders in sports are now \nsensitized to the injuries that are being caused to players, \nparticularly in the football arena. We know concussions can be \ndevastating and ultimately take the life of a player. The National \nFootball League and others are more and more sensitive to this \nphenomena. I commend them for this. But this disclosure involving the \nNew Orleans Saints goes to an outrageous level that none of us ever \nanticipated.\n  I think it is time, whether we are talking about hockey, football, \nbaseball, basketball, or any collegiate team contest, that we have \nclear rules to make certain that what happened with the New Orleans \nSaints never, ever happens again.\n  This hearing will invite representatives and witnesses from the major\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\nsporting leagues and the NCAA. So they will have time to prepare, we \nwill call the hearing after the Easter break, but I hope to have it in \na timely fashion.\n  I want fans all across America and I want players all across America \nto know that what happened in New Orleans that led to this action by \nthe NFL is not going to be repeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1986-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1986-S1988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 MAP 21\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, you know very well, because you are such a \nleader on the issue of jobs for America, that the Senate passed a very \nimportant bill last week. It is called MAP 21, Moving Ahead for \nProgress in the 21st Century. What it did was reauthorize our \ntransportation programs as they relate to highways, our bridges, and \nour transit systems.\n  This was a very difficult bill to get done because it took a lot of \ncompromise. My friend in the chair knows this. He comes from Vermont \nwhere they have had a lot of issues with rebuilding their roads after \ndisasters, and he knows how important it is, especially in those rural \nareas, to make sure we have a good transportation system both in our \nroads, our freeways, and our mass transit.\n  We got this bill done. It was remarkable, 74 votes. Actually, it \nwould have been 75 votes. One of our colleagues was at a funeral and he \nwas for the bill. So three-quarters of the Senate supported that bill. \nWe excitedly found out some House Members were very happy with it and \nthey have introduced it and that bill, MAP 21, is sitting over in the \nHouse. There is a lot at stake, and they are not moving this bill.\n  They could take that bill off the desk and they could pass it in 15 \nminutes. I served in the House. I know the rules. It is not like the \nSenate, where we can filibuster and do amendments and all the rest. It \nis a very quick process. They have not done that. Instead, they are \ntalking about putting together a bill just with the Republican Party \nand not including Democrats in that at all. So they would have a very \npartisan bill, and they are not interested in going to the Democrats. \nThey want to turn that bill into some offshore oil drilling, drilling \nin the Arctic, drilling in the lakes, drilling, drilling, drilling, \nwhen it has nothing to do with the bill and would only add contentious, \nnongermane issues to what is a very clear statement by the Senate, in a \nbipartisan way, that in order to be a great nation and in order to have \na strong economy, we need to move goods, we need to move people.\n  This idea of a national transportation system came to us from a \nRepublican President named Dwight Eisenhower. He was a war hero and a \ngeneral. He knew logistics, and he knew that if someone is in a war \nzone and they have to move their artillery, they have to move their \nequipment and all the rest, they need to have a logistics plan. When he \nbecame President, he knew: We are moving products from one State to the \nnext. It is commerce. We had better get it right. And he started the \nhighway system.\n  Since that time, we have had bipartisan support for transportation \nlegislation. Whether it was Bill Clinton or whether it was George Bush \nor George Bush's father or it was Jimmy Carter or it was Ronald Reagan \nor it was Richard Nixon, we have had bipartisan support.\n  The American people must be really happy to hear that we were able to \ncarry out that bipartisan spirit. Senator Inhofe and I, working in our \ncommittee; Senator Hutchison and Senator Rockefeller, working in their \ncommittee--these are Republicans and Democrats working together--\nRepublicans and Democrats in Finance, Republicans and Democrats in four \ncommittees worked on this bill and voted it out.\n  We asked the House to take up the bill and pass it. So far we have \nheard nothing at all to lead us to the belief that that is what they \nare going to do. This entire program expires at the end of next week. \nIf they just send us an extension without funding, if they send us an \nextension without change in law, it is going to wreak havoc in our \nStates. We already have letters from the States saying that they are \nvery fearful because this is the construction season. You cannot enter \ninto an agreement if you only have a short-term agreement to keep the \nhighway program operating for 30 days or 90 days or 60 days. We call on \nthem to pass this bill.\n  I did a press conference today with Democrats, Leader Pelosi and \nSteny Hoyer and friends over there who work on transportation issues--\nNick Rahall, the ranking member of the committee, and Mr. Bishop, who \nhas introduced the Senate bill, and Mr. DeFazio from Oregon. We had one \nmessage, and the message was this: Speaker Boehner, do what every great \nSpeaker has done before you--reach out to the other party, come to the \ntable and get 218 votes and pass this. So far we do not hear anything \nlike that. I am very worried and I am concerned. Why?\n  Mr. President, 1.4 million construction workers are unemployed. That \nwould fill 14 football stadiums. Fourteen Super Bowl stadiums filled \nwith unemployed workers--that is what we have in construction because \nwe have had such a downturn in housing. We ask Speaker Boehner \nrespectfully, take up the bill. Put these people to work. Our bill will \nsave 1.9 million construction jobs, and it will create up to 1 million \nmore. We can take this 1.4 million, hire 1 million workers, and you \nwould bring down that unemployment rate--way, way down. It is 17.1 \npercent.\n  How about our businesses? Our businesses need help. Mr. President, \n1,075 organizations--the vast majority of them are businesses--have \nbegged us to do this bill. We say to Speaker Boehner respectfully, \nlisten to more than 1,000 organizations. Pass the bill.\n  I am going to read an amazing array of editorials. I will not read \nthem in whole, I will read them in part. The idea is that maybe Speaker \nBoehner isn't listening, maybe he is not paying attention, but the \ncountry is.\n  Here is an editorial--not from a blue State but from a bright red \nState called Oklahoma, the Tulsa World:\n\n       Bipartisanship in the Senate Moves Transportation Bill.\n\n  This is what they said:\n\n       With rare bipartisanship, the U.S. Senate on Wednesday \n     passed a much-needed and much-delayed national transportation \n     bill that could create jobs and fund road projects. . . .\n\n  They finish by saying:\n\n       House Speaker John Boehner has called for the House to \n     either take action on its bill or close it. That could clear \n     the House to consider the Senate bill.\n\n  The country's infrastructure has been ignored for too long, and it is \nin dire straits. This is an important and necessary extension of the \nTransportation bill. It will make needed improvements to our \ntransportation infrastructure and, just as important, it is a real job-\ncreator.\n  This is an editorial from Oklahoma--far from a blue State. They want \nus to finish our work, and they are calling on Speaker Boehner to do \nit.\n  Here is another red State, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram:\n\n       What an exciting thing to see the U.S. Senate pass a \n     surface transportation funding bill last week on a 74 22 \n     vote. Such bipartisan support for maintaining and improving \n     this crucial part of the national infrastructure makes it \n     almost seem like the good old days in Washington. . . .\n       At one point, [House Speaker John Boehner] said he would \n     put the Senate bill before the House. . . .\n\n  Now he says:\n\n       It's beginning to look like Boehner doesn't have a clue \n     what the House will do. . . .\n\n  If the Star-Telegram is right and Boehner doesn't have a clue as to \nwhat to do, I would like to respectfully ask him to take up the Senate \nbill and pass it.\n  We just passed a bill they sent us with 73 votes. Our bill passed \nwith 74. We did it. They should do it. In their bill that we passed, \nthere is not one estimate of how many jobs will be created by it--not \none. We are hoping there will be. It is the IPO bill. This one is 3 \nmillion jobs, unequivocal. They name a bill the ``JOBS bill,'' they \nsend\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\nit over here, and it gets 73 votes. We are going to pass it. We took it \nup. Now they should pass the bill we passed. They call it the \n``congressional follies'' if he doesn't act.\n  This is from the Oregon Register Guard. It is entitled ``A Solid \nTransportation Bill.''\n\n       By an impressively bipartisan 74 22 vote, the U.S. Senate \n     on Wednesday passed a two-year blueprint for transportation. \n     The House should pass this massive bill swiftly after setting \n     aside an outrageous Republican version that would link \n     highway, bridge and other transit spending to an expansion of \n     oil drilling from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. . . .\n\n  It praises our bill and points out that our bill is supported by \nlabor and business, and it will create 3 million jobs.\n  I am going to read a few more of these. I hope somebody in Speaker \nBoehner's office is watching, I really do, because we are showing what \nis happening in the country. Everybody is calling on Speaker Boehner to \npass the bill.\n  This is the Sacramento Bee. Who could say it better? ``Stop \ndithering, pass transportation bill.''\n\n       The Senate's two-year bill, while not ideal, would provide \n     states stability through the end of 2013. It also would give \n     lawmakers a year to work on long-term funding. . . .\n       Some House Republicans are saying they won't act on a \n     multiyear bill until . . . after the Easter break.\n\n  That is unacceptable, that is what I think.\n  They quote something I said, and I am going to repeat it because I \nthink it is important.\n\n       This was a bill that brought us together, and Lord knows, \n     it's hard to find moments when we can come together.\n\n  Isn't that true, Mr. President? It is hard to find times when we come \ntogether, when we came together, three-quarters of the Senate.\n\n  Speaker Boehner, what more do you want? You had 22 Republicans vote \naye. Take up our bill and pass it.\n  Here is another one: ``Highway bill would boost stability.'' How \nimportant is that as we climb out of this recession?\n\n       A two-year, $109 billion highway bill that passed the \n     Senate this week buoys the hope of interest groups like \n     roadbuilders and the travel industry that the House can be \n     prodded by the senators' action to pass its own bill before a \n     March 31 expiration. . . .\n       The bill has no earmarks.\n\n  This is from Mississippi, another red State.\n\n       Mississippi could derive major benefits from a part of the \n     bill called the RESTORE Act amendment, supported by Wicker \n     and Cochran. It would establish a restoration fund for \n     Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas--\n\n  Et cetera--the gulf coast--to restore the damage caused in the \ncalamitous oilspill.\n  Here we have newspaper after newspaper.\n  I will be finished in about 6 minutes.\n  Here is another Chicago Sun-Times editorial: ``For a Better Commute, \nPass Transportation Bill.''\n  How about this:\n\n       The U.S. Senate just delivered a gift to the House: a \n     bipartisan transportation bill at a time when America really \n     could use a lift. Here's hoping the House Republicans don't \n     mess it up. . . .\n\n  News for them: Right now, they are messing it up. All they have to do \nis take our bill from the desk and pass it, and, guess what, that would \nmean 3 million jobs; thousands of businesses relieved that they know \nthey can enter into contracts to build our roads and fix our bridges. \nThere are 70,000 bridges in a state of disrepair, deficient, meaning \nthey could have serious consequences. We saw bridges collapse. That is \nnot a game. And infrastructure is aging.\n  I love this editorial. Essentially, it says:\n\n       A spokesman for Speaker John Boehner tells us that ``the \n     hope is that the House can coalesce around a more \n     responsible, long-term extension'' of the transportation \n     bill.\n\n  That is a hope. That is a prayer. They tried it for more than a year. \nGuess what. They got nowhere. They will not talk to the Democrats over \nthere.\n  I served in the House for 10 years. It was a wonderful experience. \nTip O'Neill was a great Speaker. They have had a lot of great ones over \nthere, but Tip O'Neill knew that the way to get things done was to get \nto 218. He didn't care if the people voting were Democrats or \nRepublicans; if he saw a need, he got to 218. He would go to his friend \nBob Michel on the other side, like I went to Jim Inhofe, and they \nworked together the way we did.\n  Speaker Boehner, reach your hand out to Leader Pelosi. She is ready \nto go. She will work with you.\n  Here is one from Ohio. This is the State of Speaker Boehner, from the \nAkron Beacon, an editorial: ``Road to Compromise.''\n\n       On Wednesday, 74 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, \n     joined together in a real accomplishment. They approved a \n     two-year, $109 billion transportation bill. . . . The timing \n     couldn't have been better. Authorization for federal highway \n     spending ends on March 31. Without action, construction, \n     repair and maintenance will halt across the country.\n       What will the House do? It should take the cue of the \n     Senate, and quickly approve the legislation that won \n     bipartisan support. . . .\n\n  This is Speaker Boehner. You know, in Speaker Boehner's State, at a \nminimum, 55,000 jobs are at stake--at a minimum. That is without our \nnew program that leverages funds. That could be doubled, but right now \nthere are 55,000 jobs we protect and we could create about another \n40,000. In Leader Cantor's State, it is 40,000 jobs and we could create \nanother 30,000. I don't know what they are thinking about over there. I \nhonestly don't know. What are they thinking about?\n  Here is one. This is from Florida, an editorial: ``Pass This Transit \nBill.''\n  How could you get it clearer?\n\n       In an all too rare display of bipartisanship, the Senate by \n     a vote of 74 to 22 last week passed a transportation bill of \n     vital interest to South Florida and the rest of the country.\n       Unfortunately, House members apparently haven't gotten the \n     word. The Senate bill extends funding for federal highway, \n     mass transit and other surface transportation projects for \n     two years. That would save or create three million jobs. . . \n     .\n       Speaker John Boehner appears to have recognized that this \n     version favored by some GOP hard-liners in his caucus doesn't \n     stand a chance of becoming law, but there's no immediate plan \n     to go forward with a reasonable compromise.\n       This uncompromising approach is why public approval of \n     Congress stands at 10 percent or below in recent polls. Mr. \n     Boehner should urge the members of his caucus to set aside \n     their job-killing intransigence and accept the bipartisan \n     Senate version. . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       This uncompromising approach is why public approval of \n     Congress stands at 10 percent or below in recent polls. Mr. \n     Boehner should urge the members of his caucus to set aside \n     their job-killing intransigence and accept the bipartisan \n     Senate version before funding runs out.\n\n  Let's hold this here. I am going to conclude here because I know \nSenator Franken has been waiting and I so respect his right to speak. \nBut I did want to point out that this particular editorial comes from \nthe newspaper that is home to the chairman of the committee over there, \nJohn Mica, the chairman of the T and I Committee, Transportation \nInfrastructure, and this is what they say:\n\n       Congress is gridlocked again--surprise!--this time over \n     Federal transportation funding.\n       Last week a bipartisan majority in the Senate passed a $109 \n     billion measure that would maintain Federal funding for \n     highway and mass transit projects for two years. But a five-\n     year bill . . . drafted by . . . John Mica, has stalled amid \n     opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.\n       Rather than let transportation projects grind to a halt, \n     lawmakers should pass the Senate bill as the only bipartisan \n     vehicle available. Then, they should get started on fixing \n     the problems . . . [in the long run]--before the next bill \n     becomes due.\n\n  Let's put up the last one. This is from the Tampa Bay Times. This is \na part of Florida that is pretty red, so I will close with this one.\n\n       House Should Fix Partisan Potholes and Pass Transit Bill.\n       With new signs every week that the recovery is taking hold, \n     Congress should be relishing the chance to pass a \n     transportation bill. But House Republicans are more keen to \n     continue waging ideological wars in the run-up to elections \n     than to bring some much-needed relief to America's commuters \n     and to workers hard hit in the construction industry. The \n     House should follow the Senate's lead and pass a \n     transportation bill without further delay. . . .\n\n  So everybody seems to be getting the message, but I am not so sure \nSpeaker Boehner or Leader Cantor are listening, and they have to \nlisten. Because if they don't listen and as a result of their inability \nto pass this bill--or not want to pass it--what will happen is there \nwill be another jolt to this economic recovery. Because we are talking \n3 million jobs at stake. Thousands of companies are hurting, and I am \nhearing from States all over this great\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nNation that they are in chaos because they don't know what the House is \ngoing to do.\n  So we took up a House bill, we didn't play partisan games, we passed \nit in a couple days, and it got 73 votes. Our jobs bill for highways \nand transit and roads and bridges got 74 votes. I say they wanted us to \ndo this, we did it. How about they take a look at this bill. How about \nthey save 3 million jobs. How about they do the people's work before \nthey go off on their break. They owe it to the American people. \nBoehner, Cantor, Mica, all of them owe it to the American people. They \nsaid it is a priority, and they do nothing. They are dithering, as the \npapers have expressed. Today, they can stop dithering. Tomorrow, they \ncan get our bill ready for a vote. Next week, they could pass it, we \ncan go home, and we can all celebrate with our businesses and our \nconstruction workers and know we have done something great for the \nAmerican people.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe words of the Senator from California for the tremendous work she \ndid on the Transportation bill, which is a bipartisan bill that passed \noverwhelmingly in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1988-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1988-S1991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I would like to join many of my \ncolleagues who are each talking a little bit about the affordable care \nact, which celebrates its second anniversary of being signed into law \nby the President tomorrow. Even though the law will not be fully \nimplemented until 2014, millions of Americans and Minnesotans are \nalready enjoying the benefits from important provisions in the law.\n  For example, no child in Minnesota, no child in New Hampshire, and no \nchild in America can now be denied health insurance coverage because he \nor she has a preexisting condition. Parents across Minnesota and around \nthe country can sleep a little bit easier knowing that if their child \ngets sick, they will still be able to get the health care coverage they \nneed. That is a big deal.\n  Speaking of parents, young adults can now stay on their parents' \nhealth insurance until they are 26. Thanks to the affordable care act, \n32,189 young adults in Minnesota are now insured on their parents' \npolicy. Because of this law health insurance companies can no longer \nimpose lifetime limits on health care benefits.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I heard from a Minnesotan in his thirties who \nhas hemophilia. He had already hit his lifetime cap three times, but \nbecause of the health care reform law he still has insurance. No \nAmerican can ever again have their health insurance taken away from \nthem because they have reached some arbitrary lifetime limit, and I am \nproud of that.\n  Let's talk about seniors. I go to a lot of senior centers around my \nState. I know the Presiding Officer goes to senior citizen centers \naround New Hampshire. Because of the health care law more than 57,000 \nseniors in Minnesota receive a 50-percent discount on their covered \nbrand-name prescription drugs when they hit the doughnut hole, at an \naverage savings of $590 per senior. By 2020, the law will close the \ndoughnut hole entirely. You know who likes that--seniors. You know what \nelse seniors like--the fact that in 2011, 424,000 Minnesotans with \nMedicare received preventive services without copays, such as \ncolonoscopies and mammograms and free annual wellness visits with their \ndoctors. I could go on and on with what we have already gained, but I \nwish to talk a little bit about a provision I wrote with the catchy \nname ``medical loss ratio,'' which is sometimes called the 80/20 rule \nbecause of my medical loss ratio provision which I based on a Minnesota \nlaw.\n  Health insurance companies must spend 80 to 85 percent of their \npremiums on actual health care. This is 85 percent for large group \npolicies, 80 percent for small group and individual policies on actual \nhealth care, not on administrative costs, marketing, advertisements, \nCEO salaries, profits but on actual health care. We have already heard \nthe medical loss ratio provision is working. The plan is already \nlowering premiums in order for companies to comply with the law. For \nexample, Aetna in Connecticut lowered their premiums on an average of \n10 percent because of this provision in the law.\n  Another key provision in the law is the value index. The value index \nrewards doctors for the quality of the care they deliver, not the \nquantity--for the value of the care, not the volume.\n  My home State, Minnesota, is a leader--if not the leader--in \ndelivering high-value care at a relatively low cost. Traditionally, in \nMinnesota, our health care providers have been well underreimbursed for \nit. For example, Texas gets reimbursed 50 percent more per Medicare \npatient than Minnesota does. This isn't about pitting Minnesota against \nTexas or Florida, it is about rewarding those low-valued States to \nbecome more like Minnesota.\n  Imagine if we brought down Medicare expenditures by 30 percent around \nthe country while increasing its effectiveness. It will bring enormous \nbenefits not just to Minnesota but across the country because it will \nbring down the cost of health care delivery nationwide, and that is \nwhat we need to be addressing, the cost of health care delivery, \nbecause we all know bringing down the health care costs is key to \ngetting our long-term deficits in order. In fact, there is probably \nnothing more important that we can do. That is where the value index is \nso important.\n\n  I have gone over a number of the benefits from health care reform \nthat have already kicked in, but I obviously didn't mention them all. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, health care reform has already \nadded jobs to our economy. I barely touched on the great stuff that \nkicks in, in 2014, such as the exchanges which will allow individuals \nand small businesses to pool with others to get more affordable health \ninsurance that is the right fit for them. Of course, while presently no \nchild can be denied health insurance for preexisting conditions, \nstarting in 2014 no American will be denied health insurance or \npenalized for having a preexisting condition.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency of Congress, \nhas crunched the numbers and reported that the affordable care act will \ninsure 31 million additional Americans and bring down our national \ndeficit by billions of dollars in its first 10 years and by \napproximately $1 trillion in its second 10 years.\n  I ask the American people not to fall victim to disinformation. There \nare no death panels. The affordable care act cuts the deficit. Under \nthis law, businesses under 50 employees don't have to provide insurance \nfor their employees and will not suffer penalties if they don't. They \nwill not have to pay fines and they will not be dragged into prison. \nThere is so much junk out there that is just plain false, and it is \ndoing everyone in this country a giant disservice.\n  My colleagues and I disagree on many things. Can we all at least \nagree to talk about this law in a factual manner? The benefits of this \nlaw are tremendous and Americans across the country are already \nexperiencing it. I urge all my colleagues to acknowledge these benefits \nand to support the continued implementation of the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Franken pertaining to the introduction of S. 2225 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, the anniversary of any new law should \nbe a time to celebrate accomplishments and new landmarks. But the \nalmost constant flow of bad news, unfavorable reports, and broken \npromises makes the second anniversary of the health care law anything \nbut a celebration. Rather, it is something that even the White House \nseems embarrassed to mention.\n  The truth is the policy behind the bill was flawed. The truth is that \nthe law is fundamentally flawed. It raises taxes and health care costs \nfor working Americans. It puts bureaucrats between patients and their \ndoctors. It tangles our Nation's job creators in regulations and \nredtape, and it defies\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nour country's most sacred document--the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Next week, the U.S. Supreme Court begins hearings to determine \nwhether the health care law violates the Constitution. It is one of the \nmost important cases reviewed in recent history. The Court has set \naside a remarkable 6 hours for oral arguments--more time than has been \ndevoted to a case in over four decades. Its ruling will have a far-\nreaching impact on our health care system, but it doesn't stop there. \nIt will have a far-reaching impact on our economy, and fundamentally on \nthe expanse of congressional authority over the individual citizen.\n  I hope the Supreme Court will resolve the countless problems in this \nlaw for good by striking it down in its entirety.\n  The facts tell us that with the passage of time, things have not \ngotten better with this law; they have, in fact, gotten worse. Take \nlast week's report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as \none example. We learned something about the cost of this bill. Before \nthe bill was passed, many of us were saying this bill was filled with \nbudget gimmicks to make it look cheaper to the American people than it \nwas. Well, we learned that the cost of the law's coverage provisions \nalone is projected to balloon to $1.7 trillion.\n  The problem is that CBO only does 10-year projections, so the major \nprovisions of this law were delayed until 2014. Why? Well, the reason \nfor that is it was done to mask the true costs of this bill when it was \nfully implemented. When we eliminate gimmicks such as this and consider \nthe law's first 10 years of full implementation, I fully expect the \ntotal cost of this legislation will not be the $900 billion promised by \nPresident Obama, it will be $2.6 trillion. This law certainly doesn't \nbend the cost curve down.\n  CBO concludes that families buying insurance on their own will pay an \nastounding $2,100 more a year for that insurance. Yet then-Candidate \nObama promised that Americans would see their premiums decrease by \n$2,500 by the end of his first term.\n  The recent CBO report also noted that the Federal Government will \nspend $168 billion more on Medicaid compared to last year's estimate.\n  The truth keeps coming out. That means more people will be trapped in \na broken program where waiting lines will, in fact, be longer, \nemergency room visits will be more frequent, because that is the only \nplace they can find care, health care outcomes will get worse, and 40 \npercent of physicians today won't even see patients in this program.\n  This law does not deliver better quality health care either. Imposing \nMedicaid on more people is like giving someone a ticket to ride a bus \nthat has broken down hundreds of miles away but claiming they have a \nticket so, in fact, they have the opportunity for transportation. Not \nonly that, the law puts all the pressure and burden on our States to \nimplement the Medicaid Program's largest expansion since 1965, placing \n$118 billion in unfunded mandates on States, when our States are \nstruggling to figure out how they balance their budgets today. As a \nformer Governor who has balanced budgets, I believe this expansion \ndumped on our States to manage is a critical and fatal flaw of this \nlegislation.\n  CBO also recently projected that up to 20 million more working \nAmericans could lose their employer-sponsored health care coverage \nbecause of this health care law. That is an incredible shift, \nespecially when we consider that our President promised no fewer than \n47 different times: ``If you like your plan, you can keep it.''\n\n  In addition to a potential 20 million employees losing their current \ncoverage, 7 million seniors are likely to lose their Medicare Advantage \nplans. According to the Congressional Budget Office Director, more than \n3,200 Nebraskans enrolled in Medicare Advantage will, in fact, have \ntheir benefits cut in half. Families in 17 States, including Nebraska, \nno longer have access to child-only health insurance because of \nmandates in the law.\n  Wait a second. I just said in 17 States they no longer have access to \na child-only health insurance policy because of this law's effect. That \nis incredible.\n  Our Nebraska insurance commissioner called this collapse of the \nchild-only market ``an example of the unintended consequences of this \nimperfect law.''\n  Here we see the President's promise, again, flipped on its head: This \nlaw forces you to say goodbye to the coverage you like for children.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have traveled across the great State of \nNebraska hosting townhalls, roundtables, and meetings, and I am finding \nthat the more folks know about this law, the more they detest it. \nReligious schools and hospitals and charities are troubled because the \nlaw will force them to violate their deeply held beliefs. Seniors are \nconcerned that the law will limit access to care because it siphons \n$500 billion from Medicare and uses it as a piggy bank to spend on \nother government programs.\n  The administration's own Medicare Actuary has projected ``the prices \npaid by Medicare for health services are very likely to fall \nincreasingly short of the costs of providing these services.'' The CMS \nActuary continued that these Medicare cuts could result in ``severe \nproblems with beneficiary access to care.''\n  Let me translate that. That means this law will make it more \ndifficult for senior citizens to get health care because the Federal \nGovernment is not paying its way. Others wonder what the 159 new boards \nestablished by this law will mean for access to health care, and hard-\nworking Nebraskans question how the law's $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes will \naffect their families. Approximately 428,000 Nebraskan households \nmaking less than $200,000 will pay higher taxes--approximately 428,000. \nThat is based on estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Small businesses across Nebraska have shared with me that they are \nholding off on hiring because of the mandates in this legislation. At a \nroundtable last week, business men and women expressed their concerns \nabout the law's tax on health insurance companies in the fully insured \nmarket, and with good reason. The health insurance tax alone could \nimpose $87 billion in costs on businesses and their employees over the \nlaw's first 10 years alone.\n  An analysis by the National Federation of Independent Business \nindicates this law will force the private sector--will force the \nprivate sector--to cut between 124,000 and 249,000 jobs between now and \n2021. That is not just a statistic, those are families who will lose a \njob because of this health care bill.\n  It is remarkable that in the midst of our economic situation, the \nPresident's signature legislation actually reduces jobs. These are some \nof the many reasons Nebraskans are demanding louder than ever that this \nlaw be repealed.\n  Now, some of the law's supporters have taken up the mantra: Well, \ndon't repeal it, repair it. That is a nice slogan. This law, though, is \nso fatally flawed no bandaid is ever going to fix it.\n  I experienced firsthand how difficult it is to change this law when I \nworked to repeal the 1099 reporting requirement, which nearly everybody \nagreed was idiotic. It would have increased paperwork burdens on our \nNation's job creators by up to 2,000 percent.\n  The administration even agreed this pay-for in their law needed to \ngo, and, in the end, 87 Senators supported full repeal of the \nprovision. But it took 9 months and 7 votes before my efforts to repeal \na provision that everybody agreed was idiotic was finally successful. \nSo anyone who tells you we can tinker with the law to fix it might as \nwell offer you ocean-front property in the State of Nebraska.\n  The 2,700-page law is one of the largest pieces of legislation ever \npassed in this Nation's history. Its provisions are interconnected, \nill-fated, and far-reaching, and they will affect every single American \neconomically, socially, and physically. We cannot sit idly by and allow \nfor the negative consequences to continue unraveling, and they will.\n  As I said, I hope the Supreme Court strikes down this entire law. But \nif it does not, we will continue our fight to repeal it, as Nebraskans \ndemand that I do. We must protect the rights of Americans to choose \ntheir doctors, to select their insurance, to trust their care, and to \nprotect their conscience rights. We must ensure employers see reforms \nthat reduce regulations and redtape and instead increase efficiencies \nand address the underlying costs. We must give States the flexibility \nto run their Medicaid Program in\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\nthe best way that serves the needs of those vulnerable populations in \nthat State.\n  This law is misguided. It stifles job growth and does not improve \nhealth care for millions of Americans, and it should be wiped off the \nbooks. Americans are demanding it, Nebraskans are demanding it, and \nthey deserve that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2 years ago this week, President Obama \nsigned into law the affordable care act. This landmark act will extend \nhealth insurance coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans in the next \nfew years. Reform based on good-quality and affordable health \ninsurance, talked about for decades, is finally becoming a reality. \nOver 15 months, Congress debated and then passed the most sweeping and \ncomprehensive reforms to improve the everyday lives of every American \nsince Congress passed Medicare in 1965. It was an arduous process, but \nin the end this achievement proved that change is possible and that the \nvoices of so many Americans who over the years have called on their \nleaders to act have finally been heard.\n  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of \ninsurance reform. Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions \nare starting to receive help when trapped within a coverage gap known \nas the ``doughnut hole.'' The affordable care act completely closes the \ncoverage gap by 2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to \nafford prescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7000 \nVermonters received a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their \nprescription drugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year, nearly \n6800 Vermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their \ncovered brand-name prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of \n$714 per person. Since the affordable care act was signed into law, \nmore than 4000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance \ncoverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their \nparents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are \nseeing in Vermont go on and on: 81,649 Vermonters on Medicare and more \nthan 100,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and \nreceived preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay. \nThese are just a few of the dozens of consumer protections included in \nthe law that are benefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day.\n  Now that the law is in effect, many of the essential \nantidiscrimination and consumer protections of the affordable care act \nare being implemented, allowing consumers to take control of their own \nhealth care decisions. Known as the Patients' Bill of Rights, these \nrules protect consumers against the worst health insurance industry \nabuses that have prevented millions of people from receiving the health \ncare they need. Going forward, insurance plans can no longer deny \nchildren coverage because of a preexisting health condition; insurance \nplans are barred from dropping beneficiaries from coverage simply \nbecause of an illness; dozens of preventive care services must be \ncovered at no cost and with no copay; and Americans will have access to \nan easier appeals process for private medical claims that are denied.\n  Yet another major reform now protects hard-working Americans from one \nof the most egregious insurance industry practices: setting lifetime or \nannual limits on health insurance coverage. Before this change in the \nlaw, wherever I traveled in Vermont, I was often stopped in the grocery \nstore, at church, on the street, or at the gas station by Vermonters \nwho shared their personal, wrenching stories about how they could no \nlonger get medical treatment because they had met their annual or \nlifetime maximum. Many of these Vermonters were perfectly healthy \nbefore being diagnosed with cancer or diseases that can cost well \nbeyond their means for treatment. Instead of being able to focus on \ngetting healthy, patients instead had to worry about whether their next \ndoctor's visit will push them above the insurance company's arbitrary \nlimit.\n  Beginning in 2014, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to \ndeny coverage to individuals with preexisting health conditions or to \ncharge higher premiums based on health status or gender. We learned in \na report issued by the National Women's Law Center this week that until \nthese reforms are implemented, insurance companies are continuing to \ncharge women higher premiums than men. In States where this practice is \nnot prohibited, women can pay substantially more than men solely \nbecause of their gender. Those who wish to turn back the clock and \nrepeal the affordable care act threaten to return the American people \nto a broken health insurance system where women can be charged more \nthan men, children can be denied insurance coverage because they were \nborn with a health condition, and individuals risk losing their health \ninsurance solely for getting sick.\n  In addition to these improvements to our health insurance system, \nover time the affordable care act will insure 93 percent of our \npopulation and make a substantial investment in our economic vitality \nin the years ahead. I was proud to work with Senator Grassley and \nothers to include strong antifraud provisions in the law that have \nalready helped prevent and detect fraudulent activities that in the \npast have cost American taxpayers millions of dollars each year. \nDespite the specious arguments from opponents of reform, this bill is \nthe largest deficit reduction measure upon which many in Congress will \never cast a vote. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that \ncomprehensive reform will reduce the Federal deficit by $143 billion \nthrough 2019, and by more than $1 trillion in the decades to come.\n  Regrettably, opponents of the affordable care act have sought to \ncontinue their political battle by challenging the landmark legislation \nin the courts, right from the moment President Obama signed it into \nlaw. These opponents seek to achieve in the courts what they could not \nin Congress. They want judges to override legislative decisions \nproperly assigned by the Constitution to Congress, the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people.\n  In my view, the partisan legal challenges to the affordable care act \ndepend on legal theories so extreme they would not only undo the \nprogress we have made in the affordable care act for kids, families, \nand senior citizens, they would turn back the clock even farther to the \nhardships of the Great Depression. They seek to strike down principles \nthat have been settled for nearly three quarters of a century and have \nhelped us build and secure the social safety net through Social \nSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid. These challenges to Congress's \nconstitutional authority to enact the affordable care act have been \nrejected by three courts. Judges appointed by Republican Presidents and \nDemocratic Presidents have rejected these challenges, and they were \nright to do so. Now the case is before the Supreme Court, which will \nhear arguments next week.\n  I have joined congressional leaders in filing an amicus brief \ndefending the affordable care act. I did so not only because I have \nfought for decades to secure affordable health care for all Americans \nbut because I am convinced that Congress acted well within the limits \nof Article I of the Constitution in doing so. Before passing the \naffordable care act, Congress expressly considered and rejected \narguments that the law, including the requirement that individuals have \nhealth insurance, is not constitutional. I believe we must defend the \nenumerated powers given to Congress by the Constitution so that our \nability to help protect hard-working American workers, families, and \nconsumers is not wrongly curtailed by the courts.\n  What is telling about the partisan nature of these challenges is that \nmany of those who now claim that the requirement that Americans have \nhealth insurance or face a tax penalty is unconstitutional are the very \nones who proposed it. Republican Senators like Senator Hatch, the \nformer chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Grassley, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, proposed a health insurance \nrequirement as an alternative when they opposed President Clinton's \nplan to provide access for all Americans to health care. They were for \nthe individual mandate until President Obama was for it, and now they \nare against it. Their views may have changed, but the Constitution has \nnot. What they fail to mention are the consequences of removing this \nprovision. If individuals are not required to have health insurance, \nthen they will wait\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\nuntil they are sick to get coverage, driving up the costs for everyone \nelse in the meantime. This will mean that many of the consumer \nprotections in the law, such as the ban on preexisting health \nconditions, would disappear, once again leaving millions uninsured. For \nsake of the health and security of our Nation, the Supreme Court should \nnot cast aside this landmark law and Congress's time-honored ability to \nact on behalf of the American people.\n  The affordable care act is a tremendous achievement that will improve \nthe lives of Americans for generations to come. For decades, we have \nheard heartbreaking stories about the enormous challenges Americans \nface because they are uninsured or underinsured. With each year that we \nmove forward to implement the features of the affordable care act, \nthese stories are becoming fewer and fewer and are being replaced by \nstories of the success of these reforms, one family at a time, all \nacross Vermont and all across America.\n  There is still much more to accomplish, and there are still millions \nof Americans who are struggling to buy or keep adequate health \ninsurance coverage for their families or themselves. As these reforms \nare implemented over the next few years, I will continue to work with \nVermonters and the Department of Health and Human Services to help \nAmericans have the access to the quality, affordable health insurance \nthat each and every American needs and deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1991-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1991-S1992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I note in morning business that the \nbipartisan Violence Against Women Act reauthorization now has 61 \ncosponsors. I thank Senator Crapo for his leadership and commend the \nSenators from both parties who came to the floor last week to speak \nabout the importance of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.\n  I want to thank Senators Mikulski, Murray, Murkowski, Klobuchar, \nHagan, Shaheen, Feinstein and Boxer for coming to the Senate floor last \nweek to express bipartisan support for the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act and to emphasize the importance of reauthorizing \nthis landmark legislation. I hope that their statements will point the \nway for the Senate to act soon to pass this important legislation.\n  Senator Klobuchar spoke about her time as a prosecutor in Hennepin \nCounty, MN, and her efforts to put the focus on children's needs in \ndomestic violence cases. She spoke about the dangers faced by law \nenforcement and the loss of a young officer who was killed while \nresponding to a domestic violence call and who left behind a wife and \nthree young children.\n  We heard from the respected senior Senator from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski, who spoke of the message we need to send so that victims can \nhave confidence and muster the courage to leave an abusive situation. \nShe spoke about the important commitment we make against sexual assault \nand domestic violence in this legislation and our expanded efforts in \nrural communities such as the villages of rural Alaska.\n  The Senate heard last Thursday, as well, from Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Murray, Senator Hagan, Senator Shaheen, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer, the author of a House bill in 1990 that was an important \npart of this effort. Eight Senators came to the floor to remind us all \nwhy this measure is important and that the Senate should proceed to \npass it.\n  For almost 18 years, the Violence Against Women Act--VAWA--has been \nthe centerpiece of the Federal Government's commitment to combating \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The \nimpact of this landmark law has been remarkable. It has provided life \nsaving assistance to hundreds of thousands of women, men, and children, \nand the annual incidence of domestic violence has fallen by more than \n50 percent since the law was first passed.\n  Support for the Violence Against Women Act has always been \nbipartisan, and I appreciate the bipartisan support that this \nreauthorization bill has already received. Senator Crapo and I \nintroduced the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in \nNovember. With Senators Heller and Ayotte joining the bill this week, \nit is now cosponsored by 61 senators from both sides of the aisle, \nreaching a critical level of bipartisan support.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is not about partisan politics. It is \nabout saving women's lives and responding to the scourge of domestic \nand sexual violence. We should consider the bill and pass it because it \nis vitally important legislation. The legislation now before the Senate \nis informed by the experiences and needs of survivors of domestic and \nsexual violence all around the country, and by the recommendations of \nthe tireless professionals who serve them every day. It builds on the \nprogress that has been made in reducing domestic and sexual violence \nand makes vital improvements to respond to remaining, unmet needs, as \nwe have each time we have authorized and reauthorized the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  Our legislation includes key improvements that are needed to better \nserve the victims of violence. Because incidence of sexual assault \nremains high, while reporting rates, prosecution rates, and conviction \nrates remain appallingly low, this reauthorization increases VAWA's \nfocus on effective responses to sexual assault. It also encourages the \nuse of new, evidence-based methods that can be very effective in \npreventing domestic violence homicide. The provisions of the bill are \ndescribed and explained in the committee report, which was also filed \nlast week.\n  The provisions that a minority on the Judiciary Committee labeled \ncontroversial are, in fact, modest changes to meet the genuine, unmet \nneeds that service providers, who help victims every day, have told us \nthey desperately need. As every prior VAWA authorization has done, this \nbill takes steps to recognize those victims whose needs are not being \nserved and find ways to help them. This is not new or different. It \nshould not be a basis for partisan division. The provisions are not \nextreme, and they are not political.\n  This reauthorization seeks to ensure that services provided under the \nViolence Against Women Act are available for all victims, regardless of \nsexual orientation or gender identity. Research has proven that \ndomestic and sexual violence affects all communities, but victims of \ndifferent sexual orientations or gender identities have had a more \ndifficult time obtaining basic services. There is nothing radical or \nnew about saying that all victims are entitled to services. This is \nwhat the Violence Against Women Act has always done. It reaches out to \nhelp all victims. As Senator Feinstein said last week: ``[T]hese are \nimprovements. Domestic violence is domestic violence.''\n  Domestic and sexual violence against Native women continues to be a \nproblem of epidemic proportions. Just as we made strides when we \nenacted the Tribal Law and Order Act two years ago, we can take \nresponsible steps to more effectively protect Native women. Working \nwith the Indian Affairs Committee, we have included a provision to fill \na loophole in jurisdiction in order to allow tribal courts jurisdiction \nover perpetrators who have significant ties to the tribe in a very \nlimited set of domestic violence cases involving an Indian victim on \nIndian land. This provision would allow prosecution of cases that \ncurrently are simply not addressed, and it would do so in a way that \nguarantees defendants comprehensive rights.\n  The bill would allow a modest increase in the number of available U \nvisas. Law enforcement is authorized to request visas for immigrant \nvictims who are helping their investigations. These visas are key law \nenforcement tools that allow perpetrators of serious crimes to be \nbrought to justice. They were created in VAWA previously with \nbipartisan support. The Department of Homeland Security and the \nFraternal Order of Police strongly support this provision because it \nserves law enforcement purposes.\n  We all know that while the economy is now improving, these remain \ndifficult economic times, and taxpayer money must be spent responsibly. \nThat is why in our bill, we consolidate 13 programs into four in an \neffort to reduce duplication and bureaucratic barriers. The bill would \ncut the authorization level for VAWA by more than $135 million a year, \na decrease of nearly 20\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\npercent from the last reauthorization. The legislation also includes \nsignificant accountability provisions, including audit requirements, \nenforcement mechanisms, and restrictions on grantees and costs.\n  Our bipartisan bill is the product of careful consideration and has \nwidespread support. I have reached out to those who have opposed these \nprovisions to work out a time agreement to govern amendments. The \nJudiciary Committee passed this bill after considering the amendments \noffered by the minority. That is what the Senate should do. Then we \nshould move forward and pass this important measure with strong \nbipartisan support. These problems are too serious for us to delay. We \nshould reauthorize this law now.\n  This is crucial, commonsense legislation that has been endorsed by \nmore than 700 State and national organizations. Numerous religious and \nfaith-based organizations as well as our law enforcement partners have \nendorsed this VAWA reauthorization bill. The Violence Against Women Act \nshould not be a partisan matter. The last two times the Violence \nAgainst Women Act was reauthorized, it was unanimously approved by the \nSenate. Although it seems that partisan gridlock is too often the \ndefault in the Senate over the last couple of years, it remains my hope \nworking with our Republican cosponsors and if those who have voted for \nVAWA in the past come forward to support it, we can pass our VAWA \nreauthorization with a strong bipartisan majority.\n  Domestic and sexual violence knows no political party. Its victims \nare Republican and Democrat; rich and poor, young and old, male and \nfemale. Let us work together and pass strong VAWA reauthorization \nlegislation without delay. It is a law that has saved countless lives, \nand it is an example of what we can accomplish when we work together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1992-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1992-S1993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO HERBERT S. VERRILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho has made a great sacrifice to protect and defend the liberties of \nhis beloved United States, and the Republic of France as well: 2LT \nHerbert S. Verrill of Laurel County, KY. Mr. Verrill is a veteran of \nWorld War II and served a tour of duty in Europe in 1945. Today he is \n92 years old and resides on Old Whitley Road in Laurel County.\n  Mr. Verrill, or ``Herb'' as many call him, served in the U.S. Army, \nCompany E, 399th Infantry Regiment, 100th infantry division. Near \nReyersviller, France, on March 15, 1945, he commanded a small troop. He \nwas just a lieutenant, and at the time he and his men ventured into the \nmidst of an attack that day. To Herb's horror, his unit found \nthemselves trapped in a maze of barbed wire and landmines while bullets \nwhizzed around them. Herb accidentally set off one of the buried mines, \nand the explosion took off his foot in a nearly fatal wound. In a \nsuperhuman act of courage, Herb ignored the pain and forgot the wound \nhe had just received. All the 24-year-old lieutenant would think about \nwas the safety of his troop. Using the one foot he had left, Herb \ndirected his men safely out of the middle of the heated skirmish.\n  After the war, Herb returned home to Kentucky and settled down. He \nmarried, fathered three successful children, and found his way back to \ncivilian life. For the next many years Herb, like many other World War \nII veterans, kept the courage and selflessness he had shown on the \nbattlefield to himself. He sat by quietly and humbly, watching those \naround him enjoy the freedoms and liberties he and many others had made \nsuch a great sacrifice to preserve. Although Herb had done his best to \nmove on, the world would not forget the great heroism that he had \nshown.\n  Herb received a letter from the Consul General of France, based in \nChicago, IL, in July of 2011. He had been named a Knight of the Legion \nof Honor by the President of the French Republic, one of the highest \nawards one can receive in the country of France. The letter read:\n\n       My fellow countrymen will never forget your sacrifice. \n     Their children and grandchildren are as proud of your \n     courageous actions as can be your own children and \n     grandchildren. This outstanding distinction is the highest \n     honor that France can bestow upon those who have achieved \n     remarkable deeds for France. It is also a sign of gratitude \n     for your invaluable contribution to the liberation of France \n     during these difficult times in the history of our nation.\n\n  The award was authorized on July 4, 2011.\n  Herb was also recognized by the country whose flag he had worn on his \nuniform in Europe--the United States of America. He received the \nDistinguished Service Cross. The letter he received from GEN Donald \nStorm recalled the ``indomitable courage and resolution'' displayed by \nHerb during the battle in Reyersviller that ``prevented confusion and \nconsequent casualties among the men, which made possible the capture of \nthe objective.''\n  Herb's nephew, Randy Stanifer, is in awe of the great sacrifice that \nwas made by the service men and women during the Second World War. \n``The men from those wars were pre-cell phones and pre-Internet,'' he \nsays. ``They were out in the field and would go months without hearing \nfrom their families. They went through many things and when most of \nthem came home, they didn't talk about it.''\n  Randy went on to declare, ``I think we should all pause for a few \nminutes and recognize the things they had to go through and appreciate \ntheir sacrifices.''\n  Herb was extremely pleased to receive both awards. He is one of the \nfew remaining veterans of World War II; sadly, our country loses more \nevery day. He answered his country's call to serve, and he did so \nvaliantly. Herbert Verrill undoubtedly deserves every recognition.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my Senate colleagues \nto join me in commemorating the service and sacrifice made by 2LT \nHerbert S. Verrill in World War II on behalf of the United States of \nAmerica and the French Republic.\n  Recently an article appeared in the Laurel County-area publication \nthe Sentinel Echo. The article highlighted the courageous life of Mr. \nVerrill and reported on the awards bestowed upon him by the French \nRepublic and the United States in July, 2011. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel Echo, Aug. 26, 2011]\n\n               Laurel Man Receives French Military Honor\n\n                           (By Nita Johnson)\n\n       A local veteran of World War II recently received two \n     honors for his military service, one of which is the highest \n     honor bestowed by the French government.\n       Herbert Verrill of Old Whitley Road was presented with the \n     Knight of the Legion of Honor on behalf of the President of \n     the French Republic through the Consul General of France, \n     based in Chicago. He also received the Distinguished Service \n     Cross for his valor in leading his men away from harm during \n     a battle in France and for directing his company to continue \n     an attack, despite being injured himself.\n       Verrill served with the United States Army Company E, 399th \n     Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division near Reyersviller, \n     France, on March 15, 1945. Verrill, a lieutenant at the time, \n     was leading his troops through an attack by enemy forces--\n     through mines and barbed wire--when he accidentally set off \n     one of the mines. The explosion blew Verrill's foot off. In \n     spite of the pain and trauma, Verrill kept his fellow \n     comrades and their safety foremost, and ordered them away \n     from the minefield. He continued to ensure their safety and \n     defense by continuing to direct the men by hand and arm \n     signals.\n       Verrill received the letter from Graham Paul, Consul \n     General of France in Chicago, Ill., last month.\n       ``It is my pleasure . . . to inform you, on behalf of the \n     people of France, the President of the French Republic has \n     named you Knight of the Legion of Honor for your valorous \n     action during World War II,'' the citation reads. ``My fellow \n     countrymen will never forget your sacrifice. Their children \n     and grandchildren are as proud of your courageous actions as \n     can be your own children and grandchildren. This outstanding \n     distinction is the highest honor that France can bestow upon \n     those who have achieved remarkable deeds for France. It is \n     also a sign of gratitude for your invaluable contribution to \n     the liberation of France during these difficult times in the \n     history of our nation.''\n       The award was authorized through a decree from the \n     President of the French Republic on July 4, 2011.\n       Verrill was also presented with the Distinguished Service \n     Cross by the American government for his courageous acts. The \n     citation outlining Verrill's heroic act reads: ``The \n     President of the United States of America, authorized by Act \n     of Congress,\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\n     July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished \n     Service Cross to Second Lieutenant (Infantry) Herbert S. \n     Verrill, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in \n     connection with military operations against an army enemy.\n       ``The indomitable courage and resolution which he displayed \n     prevented confusion and consequent casualties among the men, \n     which made possible the capture of the objective. Second \n     Lieutenant Verrill's intrepid actions, personal bravery and \n     zealous devotion to duty exemplify the highest traditions of \n     the military forces of the United States and reflect great \n     credit upon himself, the 100th Infantry Division, and the \n     United States Army,'' reads the citation.\n       The award was recently presented by Adjunct General Donald \n     Storm, who said, ``It is an honor and privilege to give him \n     the award. Those soldiers in Afghanistan now will be the next \n     generation of heroes.''\n       Verrill is one of the few remaining veterans from World War \n     II, and although nearly bedfast now at age 92, he was pleased \n     to receive the honor. His nephew, Randy Stanifer, praised his \n     uncle for his valiant contributions to his country, not only \n     during wartime but also after returning home from the war.\n       Verrill, a mere 24 years old while doing his military \n     service in France, watched the war rage throughout Europe and \n     made his sacrifices like thousands of other servicemen and \n     women. ``Herbert came back home, married and raised three \n     children, all of whom are successful. Herbert and the men \n     from those wars were pre-cell phones and pre-Internet. They \n     were out in the field and would go months without hearing \n     from their families. They went through many things and when \n     most of them came home, they didn't talk about it,'' he said.\n       Stanifer mentioned two other local World War II veterans, \n     of whom he learned information about their wartime \n     activities.\n       ``Vernon Hedrick, who died a few years ago, escaped from a \n     German POW camp and walked over 100 miles to get away from \n     enemy lines,'' he said. ``I didn't know that until recently. \n     Bill Moore (owner of London Tire until his death) was given \n     his last rites on the battlefield. They both survived and \n     came back home, but they didn't talk about these things.''\n       ``Herb (Verrill) never talked about any of (his \n     experience),'' he continued. ``That generation has sat back \n     and watched the country do what it's doing now. I think we \n     should all pause for a few minutes and recognize the things \n     they had to go through and appreciate their sacrifices.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1993-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1993-S1994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILMER LEE BOGGS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho has not only valiantly served his country but has also been a \ndevoted husband and a loving father and grandfather, Mr. Wilmer Lee \nBoggs of Laurel County, KY. Mr. Boggs served in the U.S. Army Air Corps \nfor over 3 years, and upon returning home he contributed to the Nation \nin a different way, by serving with the U.S. Postal Service for a \nquarter of a century.\n  Wilmer was drafted into the U.S. Armed Forces in 1942. He was 21 \nyears old. Shortly after receiving glowing scores on his entrance exam, \nhe was pulled out of basic training in Ft. Thomas, KY, after only a few \ndays and transferred to the Air Corps, the Army service division from \nwhich the Air Force would later come. At the time, the Army Air Corps \nwas in need of mechanics, specifically supercharger mechanics. \nSuperchargers were built onto plane engines to provide the vehicle with \nmore power and speed. The skills displayed by the young Wilmer Boggs \nshowed that he was the man for the job.\n  Wilmer Boggs, along with the rest of his supercharger class No. 21, \ngraduated from the Aviation Institute of Technology in 1943. Based in \nEngland, Wilmer spent the next 7 months going wherever the Corps called \nhim to repair, service, stock, and fuel the airplanes.\n  Born and raised in Laurel County, Wilmer Boggs had never lived \nanywhere else. While he was in the Army Air Corps he traveled through \n19 different countries and made sure to hold onto a little piece of \nhome the entire time: his dear friend Wilma Vaughn. Mr. Boggs had \npromised Wilma, whom he had met at Sue Bennett College, that he would \nwrite to her faithfully each month, and that is exactly what he did. \nThe two kept up until the soldier returned home in January 1946.\n  Just 6 months later, in July of 1946, Wilmer went to pick Wilma up \nfrom her house with the idea of marriage in the back of his mind. The \nunsuspecting Wilma was no doubt surprised by Wilmer's request. But love \nprevailed, and later that day the two were wed, and according to \nWilmer, ``She was the best wife there ever was.''\n  Wilmer went on to become a postmaster in the U.S. Postal Service \nwhile Wilma taught elementary school. They retired together in 1981. \nSadly, his beloved Wilma passed away in 2011 but not before the two had \nseen almost the entire western part of the United States together.\n  Wilmer has spent his 89 years on Earth forging a legacy that is \nmatched by few. His character is upstanding, and he is a man driven by \nprinciple. He is deeply loved and admired by his family, and he is \ngreatly respected by those who know him. It is men like Wilmer whom we \ncan all look up to. Underneath the loyalty and service he has shown his \ncountry in its time of need, there is a deep and humble appreciation \nfor his fellow man and local community, which he has conveyed \nthroughout his lifetime.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my Senate colleagues \nto join me in commemorating Mr. Wilmer Lee Boggs for his upstanding \ncharacter and devoted service to country and community throughout his \nprosperous lifetime.\n  An article was published in the Sentinel Echo Silver Edition in the \nfall of 2011. The story observed the phenomenal life and times of \nWilmer Lee Boggs and his dedication to the U.S. Postal Service, the \nU.S. Army, and his local economy. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Sentinel Echo Silver Edition, Fall 2011]\n\n                     World War II: Taking the Lead\n\n                          (By Carrie Dillard)\n\n       After 25 years with the United States Postal Service, \n     Wilmer Lee Boggs retired as postmaster in 1981. The 89-year-\n     old has worked in banking and the family business, in farm \n     machinery and dairy. He's volunteered for more than four \n     decades with soil conservation and the Gideons.\n       With his natural leadership abilities, Boggs could've been \n     a politician like his father, Boyd Boggs, who served as both \n     judge and sheriff during his lifetime, but he preferred \n     tinkering with tools instead.\n       It's why his job in the U.S. Army Air Corps suited him \n     perfectly. Boggs was an airplane engine mechanic, \n     specializing in superchargers.\n       ``It was pretty fortunate to get to do something I liked to \n     do.'' he said.\n       Boggs was drafted into the military in 1924. He was 21 \n     years old.\n       ``I got a notice to go into London to the draft board. I \n     was expecting in,'' he said.\n       Although Boggs was drafted into the Army, his entrance exam \n     quickly showed an aptitude for more, and he was chosen for \n     the Air Corps, a predecessor to the Air Force.\n       He was supposed to do his basic training at Fort Thomas, \n     Kentucky, but after just a couple of days there, he was \n     selected to go to mechanics school.\n       ``I took a test,'' he said, ``and they pulled me out it. \n     They was needing people to go to mechanics school.''\n       Boggs was then selected to specialize in superchargers, \n     which gave the airplane engine more power, and became a \n     graduating member of supercharger class No. 21 from the \n     Aviation Institute of Technology in 1943.\n       During the war, Boggs's home base was England. Boggs has \n     lived his whole life in Laurel County, except for his time in \n     the service when he traveled to 19 countries, including \n     Scotland, Casablanca, Algeria, and Russia.\n       ``It was my first time away from home,'' he said. He \n     remembers the damp cold of Ireland, the beauty of \n     Switzerland, and being bombed out in Russia.\n       Supercharger mechanics were scarce. Boggs said he'd be \n     moved from base to base as needed. ``Our job was to service \n     the planes, put bombs in them, fuel them up and repair \n     them,'' he said.\n       At his highest rank, he was a sergeant. ``That's the \n     highest I wanted to go,'' Boggs said. ``If you went any \n     higher, you had more responsibility.''\n       In total, Boggs was in the Air Corps for 38 months, \n     spending seven months overseas.\n       During his time across the ocean, he'd write home to family \n     and to an ``acquaintance,'' Wilma Vaughn.\n       Boggs met Wilma, who would later become his wife, while he \n     was attending Sue Bennett College, but the first time he saw \n     her was at Lily High School. Boggs went to school at Lily for \n     15 weeks before transferring to Hazel Green, but he would \n     remember Wilma.\n       ``I don't think I even spoke to her then,'' he said, ``but \n     that was the first time I saw her.''\n       Although they were not dating at the time, Boggs said he \n     would write her faithfully once a month.\n       ``I couldn't tell (her) much about what I was doing,'' he \n     said. Although Boggs went overseas on a ship--the Queen \n     Mary--he came back in a boat one-third of the size.\n       ``I was seasick,'' he said. After their departure, they \n     encountered a storm and were\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\n     forced to wait it out. ``For 17 days, we didn't move, just \n     rocked. Everyone was sick.''\n       Upon leaving military service, he made short work about \n     marrying Wilma Vaughn.\n       ``I came home in January 1946. We were married in July \n     1946.''\n       On the day that would end up being his wedding day, Boggs \n     asked to borrow his father's Chevy. He didn't have a car at \n     the time. He drove over to Wilma's house and picked her up.\n       ``She didn't know we was going to get married until I \n     picked her up,'' Boggs said. ``She was the best wife there \n     ever was. A real Christian woman.''\n       The couple's first car was a '36 Ford they bought in 1947. \n     They'd been married for six months and needed a car because \n     Wilma was teaching school.\n       Boggs said it seems odd by today's standard that you'd have \n     to buy a nearly decade-old car, but that's the way it was \n     back then.\n       ``You couldn't get a car back then, new or used. We were \n     lucky to get that one,'' he said.\n       While at Sublimity Elementary, Wilma retired from teaching \n     in 1981, the same year Boggs retired from the post office, in \n     order to travel. Before Wilma's passing earlier this year, \n     the two had seen most of the western United States together.\n       Boggs enjoys woodworking, having built his home in the \n     Sublimity area. He keeps his family close, as a majority live \n     just a stone's throw away, including his daughter, Libby \n     Smallwood.\n       He has three grandchildren and two great-granddaughters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1994-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ``CHIP'' JAENICHEN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncongratulating Senator Barbara Mikulski from Maryland on becoming the \nlongest-serving woman in the history of Congress. Senator Mikulski has \nthus reinforced her distinctive mark on this institution and her \nunmistakable place in our Nation's history.\n  Those who have worked beside Senator Mikulski know her to be a \ndynamic force of nature. While she is not the tallest senator, she \nreaches the greatest heights with her strong principles, indomitable \nspirit, and steely resolve.\n  From the neighborhoods of east Baltimore to the Halls of Congress, \nshe has spent her career in the political trenches fighting for \nothers--for women, for working Americans, and for her beloved Maryland. \nSenator Mikulski has been a practical leader for better women's health \ncare. She fought to have women included in clinical trials and medical \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health and helped establish \nfederal standards for mammograms.\n  Her impact is not only felt in the lives of those she serves, but \nalso in her relationships with those she serves with. At this time in \nour politics when the partisanship pulls us apart, when tribal \ninstincts have coarsened our discourse and weakened our bonds, Senator \nMikulski is a unifying force of comity in the Senate. She brings a \nsense of civility and a sense of humor to this institution at a time \nwhen both are sorely needed.\n  Women senators fondly know Senator Mikulski as their Dean. She hosts \nregular bipartisan dinners for them and is a trusted mentor. She \nunderstands that while many of us come to Congress with competing \ngoals, at the end of the day, we are colleagues. We have to work \ntogether. Unless we can affirm our bonds as colleagues and fellow \nhumans, the work we are tasked with by the American people will not get \ndone, and the public interest will suffer as a result.\n  Senator Mikulski's remarkable career continues to inspire women \nacross our country on the nobility of public service and the ability \nfor one person to bring about positive change in the lives of others. \nIt is a pleasure to serve beside her, and I wish her my very best for \nmany more productive years here in the Senate.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, today I want to honor Senator Barbara \nMikulski, who has represented the people of Maryland for more than 35 \nyears, and who earlier this week became the longest-serving female \nMember of Congress. Senator Mikulski is a fighter, a fearless leader \nand a role model for women and young girls everywhere, including my \nthree daughters, Caroline, Halina and Anne.\n  During the course of her distinguished career, Senator Mikulski has \nbeen an incredibly effective advocate, and in particular has taken a \nleadership role in mentoring other women as they follow in her \nfootsteps to the halls of Congress. She has represented Maryland \nexceptionally well--on issues ranging from civil rights and the \nenvironment, to issues affecting working families and our criminal \njustice system.\n  Tracking Senator Mikulski's career is also a good way to follow the \nprogress of women in our country. When first elected to Congress for \nMaryland's 3rd district in 1976, Senator Mikulski was one of 21 women \nserving in Congress. Today there are 92 women serving, thanks in large \npart to the trailblazing efforts of Senator Mikulski.\n  Through her work in an array of roles, from the women's amendment in \nthe Affordable Care Act to her leadership on the Senate Subcommittee on \nChildren and Families, Senator Mikulski is known as a coalition \nbuilder. This role has led her to cultivate personal and professional \npartnerships among the members of the Senate. Likely some of the \ncountry's most important work is done during the bipartisan dinners she \nfrequently hosts for her female Senate colleagues.\n  I am proud that my first vote as a Senator in January 2009 was in \nfavor of one of Senator Mikulski's bills, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct, which guarantees women equal pay for equal work. And I have \nthoroughly enjoyed\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nworking with her in the Senate HELP Committee on Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act reauthorization and passage of the Affordable \nCare Act. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Mikulski on \nthese and other important issues in the Senate.\n  March is Women's History Month, and I can think of no better time to \nhonor and reflect on what Senator Mikulski's work has meant to the \nUnited States Senate and to her constituents in Maryland. Let us follow \nthe leadership of Senator Barbara Mikulski and continue to fight for a \nbetter America.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I want to join my colleagues in today's \nwell-deserved accolades for my friend, Barbara Mikulski.\n  The other day, as often happens to most of us here, I found myself \ntemporarily waylaid by an informal scrum of reporters in one of the \nCapitol hallways. And, unknown to me, I was blocking Senator Mikulski's \npath. She made me aware of that fact in her distinctive and typically \nendearing way: ``Hey, Tall and Lanky--make way for Short and Stocky!'' \nshe said.\n  But it is not just that humor and good nature that makes Barbara \nMikulski such a great colleague and friend. As a resident and colleague \nfrom an adjoining State, I respect all she has done at the local level, \nin the U.S. House and now in the Senate, to move the National Capital \nRegion forward in terms of the regional ties that join together this \nspecial region where we live and work.\n  You see, Virginia and Maryland share more than just a common border. \nOur two States are home to hundreds of thousands of hard-working and \nunder-appreciated Federal workers and retirees. Our States share safety \nand funding concerns related to Metro. We each have a shared \nresponsibility in our stewardship of the Chesapeake Bay. Maryland and \nVirginia also share world-class NASA facilities on the Eastern Shore.\n  As a friend, I appreciate her leadership role in helping this first-\ntime legislator--and recovering former Governor--make the sometimes \ndifficult adjustment to this body. As the father of three daughters, I \nam grateful for the doors Senator Mikulski has opened--and sometimes \nkicked-open--for young women.\n  Senator Mikulski truly is a force of nature. She is tough, focused \nand extremely effective. And as these testimonials demonstrate, Senator \nMikulski is widely respected and loved by current and former members of \nthis body.\n  I am pleased to join these colleagues in thanking Senator Mikulski \nfor her service, her leadership and her friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1995-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INTENT TO OBJECT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I write to notify you that I am putting \n     a hold on S. 1789, the Postal Reform bill, dated March 20, \n     2012. I will submit a copy of this notice to the Legislative \n     Clerk and the Congressional Record within 2 session days and \n     I give my permission to the objecting Senator to object in my \n     name.\n       While I absolutely agree that the United States Postal \n     Service (USPS) must be reformed to meet the country's needs \n     in the 21st Century, I must object to moving forward on \n     consideration of this legislation while the USPS continues a \n     rushed study to close a needed mail processing center on the \n     Eastern Shore of Maryland. Making matters worse, USPS plans \n     no public hearings and no opportunity for written comment in \n     this study process. This is totally unacceptable.\n       The half a million residents who live on the Eastern Shore \n     and rely on the mail service must have a voice in this \n     process. These residents include farmers, small businesses \n     and a significant rural and elderly population that relies \n     heavily on mail delivery for life saving medications, daily \n     newspapers, and important business documents.\n       The Easton area mail processing center is the only mail \n     processing center on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and its \n     ongoing operation is critically important to the economy of \n     the shore. Relaxing delivery standards by moving mail \n     processing from Easton to Delaware is simply not a practical \n     or sustainable option.\n       My constituents have a right to be heard, they have a right \n     to maintain the standard of delivery service that they \n     currently receive, and they deserve a fair and transparent \n     process for decisions about the Easton area mail processing \n     center.\n       I'm grateful for your leadership, and I look forward to \n     working with you to ensure that the Postal Service remains \n     financially solvent and ready for the 21st Century.

Madam President, I would like to discuss the votes that \nwe have taken over the last few days. Tuesday, along with 54 of my \ncolleagues, I voted in support of the INVEST In America Act as a \nsubstitute for H.R. 3606. In fact, I was an original cosponsor of the \nINVEST In America Act because it strikes the right balance between \npromoting entrepreneurship and protecting investors.\n  But before I go into a long explanation, I would like to begin with a \nstory. Bemidji is a town of about 14,000 people in northern Minnesota \nand might not be the first place you would think of as being a hotbed \nfor start-up investment. But you would be wrong. Three entrepreneurs \nthere, Tina, Bud and Tim, harnessed the power of the Internet and the \ncrowd-sourcing website Kickstarter to raise over $17,000. With that \nmoney, they are opening a micro-brewery--the Bemidji Brewing Company.\n  Two hundred and fifty individuals contributed to their efforts--about \nhalf of them were friends and family, and half of them were strangers. \nMany contributors gave $20--and in return, Bemidji Brewing is sending \nthem a bottle opener and decal, and will carve their name into the \nwalls of the future brewery. Bemidji Brewing hopes to have batches out \nto local establishments this summer.\n  This is an amazing story. And there are thousands of others just like \nit. I support efforts to promote these types of crowd-sourced \nendeavors. But we don't need H.R. 3606 to produce more success stories \nlike Bemidji Brewing. Instead, we need a balanced approach--one that \nlimits investor risk and keeps our markets transparent and stable. When \nthe public has the opportunity to contribute to start-up businesses, \nthey should be aware of the risks--what are they getting in return for \ntheir money? Investing in securities comes with risks, but those risks \nare balanced with SEC requirements to provide full information and \ninvestor disclosure.\n  H.R. 3606 just has too many problems. H.R. 3606 opens the door for \nlarge companies to more easily cook their books. It lets companies with \ntens of thousands of shareholders evade SEC oversight. It eliminates \nprovisions to prevent conflicts of interest in company research that \ncontributed to the dot com bubble. There are so many downsides and \ndangers to H.R. 3606 that it will destroy more jobs than it creates.\n  The INVEST In America Act, however, promotes the same ideas contained \nin H.R. 3606--providing for investment opportunities for small business \nstart-ups, easing the regulatory burden for emerging companies--but \ndoes so in a way that protects investors and our markets.\n  Don't take it from me--take it from securities law experts. I have \nheard from Richard Painter, a professor of corporate law at the \nUniversity of Minnesota, a former Associate Counsel to President George \nW. Bush, and Chief White House Ethics Lawyer from 2005 to 2007. Here is \nwhat he said about this debate:\n\n       I strongly support these amendments to the JOBS Act. \n     Reckless and fraudulent conduct in connection with the offer \n     and sale of securities is a large part of what got us into \n     our present economic difficulties. Lowering the bar for the \n     offer and sale of risky securities to the public is no way to \n     get us out. If Congress changes the securities laws at all in \n     this Act, these amendments should be included.\n\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\n\n  The current Chairman of the SEC, Mary Schapiro, has said that one \ncomponent of H.R. 3606 is ``so broad that it would eliminate important \nprotections for investors in even very large companies.'' Former SEC \nChairman Arthur Levitt went much further, calling H.R. 3606 ``a \ndisgrace'' and the ``most investor-unfriendly bill that I have \nexperienced in the past two decades.'' Lynn Turner, former Chief \nAccountant at the SEC said, ``It won't create jobs, but it will \nsimplify fraud.''\n  And this is what Mike Rothman, the Commissioner of Minnesota's \nDepartment of Commerce, had to say:\n\n       Too many Minnesotans have suffered too long from \n     unemployment. With nearly 170,000 Minnesotans out of work, \n     our State's highest priorities are supporting economic and \n     business growth and creating jobs. The Jobs bill passed \n     recently by the U.S. House of Representatives strives to \n     achieve much-needed job growth, but contains unwarranted \n     reduction in significant investor protections.\n       The Minnesota Department of Commerce works to prevent \n     securities fraud. Last year, the Commerce Department \n     registered over 7,000 new licenses to broker dealers, agents, \n     and investment advisers and has over 125,000 individuals and \n     entities currently licensed. Through our State registration \n     process, we work to ensure that those selling securities and \n     advising consumers about securities are both knowledgeable \n     and capable. This essential level of oversight helps ensure \n     basic protection of Minnesota investors and consumers.\n       The House version of the Jobs bill threatens to unravel \n     what years of experience teaches us is required to protect \n     investors by curtailing state oversight and, in the interest \n     of protecting our State's capital market, I urge you to \n     support the substitute amendment. Working together, we can \n     make every reasonable effort to create jobs while \n     safeguarding the need for basic and essential measures of \n     consumer protection.\n\n  That is from Minnesota's Department of Commerce, the primary watchdog \nfor securities in the state of Minnesota.\n  Minnesota's AARP State President, Dr. Lowery Johnson, summarized the \nissues this way:\n\n       Older Americans who have saved their entire lives by \n     accumulating savings and investments are disproportionately \n     represented among the victims of investment fraud. This \n     legislation before the Senate undermines vital investor \n     protections and threatens market integrity. Older Minnesotans \n     deserve safeguards that ensure proper oversight and investor \n     protection.\n       We must not repeat the kind of penny stock and other frauds \n     that ensnared vulnerable investors in the past. The absence \n     of adequate regulation in the past has undermined the \n     integrity of the markets and damaged investor confidence \n     while having no positive impact on job creation. Please \n     preserve essential regulations that protect older investors \n     from fraud and abuse, promote the transparency, and ensure a \n     fair and efficient marketplace. We believe the amendment to \n     be offered by Senators Reed, Landrieu and Levin moves closer \n     to achieving this balance and deserves your support.\n\n  I have also heard from other consumer groups from around the country. \nThe Consumer Federation of America supports the INVEST In America Act, \nand cautions against H.R. 3606, noting that it would ``undermine market \ntransparency, roll back important investor protections, and, if \ninvestors behave rationally, drive up the cost of capital for the small \ncompanies it purports to benefit.''\n  All of these voices--from Minnesota and across the country--shaped my \nposition on these bills. That is why I supported the INVEST In America \nAct. That is why 55 Senators voted in favor of it. The INVEST In \nAmerica Act also included reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, \nwhich has supported almost $1.2 billion in export sales in Minnesota \nover the last 5 years, and well over half of those exporters are small \nbusinesses. That is a lot of jobs in Minnesota.\n  We have made some improvements to this bill. The amendment passed in \nthe Senate is better than the language in the House bill. But it still \nleaves too many opportunities for harm. Here is the bottom line: I \nstrongly support entrepreneurs, I support innovation, and I support job \ncreation. The INVEST In America Act struck the right balance between \npromoting jobs and entrepreneurship while preserving the integrity that \nour markets have historically enjoyed.\n  American public companies have benefited from the lowest cost of \ncapital in the world, and this is because of the low risks associated \nwith investing in transparent, well-regulated markets. America is a \ngreat place to invest because the entire world has confidence in our \nmarkets. If H.R. 3606 increases fraud, or even just investment losses, \nthis bill runs the risk of backfiring completely--decreasing investor \nconfidence and ultimately increasing the cost of doing business. And \nthis will ultimately destroy jobs, not create them.\n  In the end, I couldn't support H.R. 3606 for all those reasons. It is \na bill that is going to enable fraud, a bill that turns our securities \nmarket into a lottery game, and a bill that will lead to many \nMinnesotans, especially seniors, losing their hard-earned savings and \ninvestments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1996-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1996-S1997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, in defending the Constitution and arguing \nfor its ratification, Alexander Hamilton stated plainly in the first of \nthe Federalist Papers the challenge and the promise of American \ndemocracy.\n  He explained:\n\n       It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been \n     reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and \n     example, to decide the important question, whether societies \n     of men are really capable or not of establishing good \n     government from reflection and choice, or whether they are \n     forever destined to depend for their political constitutions \n     on accident and force.\n\n  The challenge identified by Hamilton and our Founding Fathers remains \nwith us today.\n  Will American citizens and will our political institutions maintain \nour Constitution and adhere to the rule of law or will we succumb to \nforce and the whims of the moment?\n  Will the law be supreme and will the Constitution endure or will \npolitics prevail?\n  This is a choice that Americans and public officials face every day.\n  But some moments present this choice in bolder terms. And the legal \nchallenge to the President's health care law is one of those moments \nthat present a stark choice.\n  Will we support the Constitution or will we throw in with the passing \nwishes of temporary majorities?\n  That is the choice that we as Americans face and that the Supreme \nCourt will face when it hears oral arguments on this case next week.\n  There are a number of issues before the Court, but at the top of the \nlist is the constitutionality of the individual mandate.\n  Like many critical constitutional questions that come before the \nAmerican people, particularly those of first impression, it often takes \nsome time for a consensus to emerge.\n  The answer is not always immediately clear. But through public \ndialogue and argument, the constitutionality of these actions comes \ninto greater focus.\n  That is what happened with ObamaCare's individual mandate. As the \nimplications of this sweeping exercise of Federal power became clear, \nthe American people's initial hesitation about this provision \nsolidified into an enduring bipartisan consensus that this mandate \nviolates our constitutional commitment to limited government.\n  The American people came to understand that if the individual mandate \nis permissible, then anything is permissible.\n  If the individual mandate is allowed to stand, then there are no \neffective limits on the Federal Government.\n  And if there are no limits on the Federal Government, then our \nconstitutional liberties are in jeopardy.\n  The American people came to understand that the question about the \nindividual mandate runs far deeper than any debate about health care. \nThey understand that the mandate presents us with a pivotal question.\n  Will we maintain the Constitution as our supreme law, one which puts \neffective limits on the powers of the Federal Government, or will we \nabandon the Constitution bequeathed to us by our Founding Fathers and, \ninstead, accept a new constitutional order where the only restraints on \nthe Federal Government are those it deigns to place on itself?\n  The American people--and certainly the people of Utah--have made \nclear at every opportunity their deep skepticism about the individual \nmandate.\n  Presidential candidate Barack Obama understood these concerns about \nthe individual mandate. The media noted during the Presidential\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\ncampaign that while then-Senator Hillary Clinton's plan would require \nall Americans to purchase health insurance, then-Senator Obama declined \nto go down that road.\n  One writer predicted that an economic mandate requiring Americans to \npurchase a particular product ``would give the inevitable conservative \nopposition a nice fat target to rally around.''\n  That nice fat target was an historically unprecedented expansion of \nFederal power in violation of the Constitution's commitment to limited \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama put the politics of health care reform \nover any concerns about the constitutionality of the individual \nmandate.\n  This is how the journalist Ron Suskind explained the President's \nconversion:\n\n       Obama, never much for the mandate, was concerned about \n     legal challenges to it but was impressed by DeParle's \n     coverage numbers. Without the mandate, the still-sketchy \n     Obama plan would leave twenty-eight million Americans \n     uninsured; with the mandate, the estimates of the number left \n     uninsured were well below ten million.\n\n  And so he made his decision.\n  The President of the United States takes an oath to support and \ndefend the Constitution. As a candidate, and as President, it appears \nthat President Obama was aware of the constitutional concerns with the \nindividual mandate.\n  But like his progressive forebears, he put his policy desires before \nthe long-term integrity of our Constitution.\n  Fortunately, the American people were not so quick to put the \nConstitution second.\n  Along with a number of my colleagues here in the Senate, I made the \ncase for the mandate's unconstitutionality a priority.\n  On the first day of the Senate Finance Committee's markup of what \nwould become ObamaCare, I raised doubts about the constitutionality of \nthe individual mandate.\n  Those doubts were dismissed.\n  I offered an amendment that would have provided for expedited \njudicial review of any constitutional challenges to the legislation.\n  That amendment was ruled out of order.\n  But the constitutional concerns with this mandate would not be \nburied.\n  The people of this country would get their say on this sweeping \nassertion of Federal power, one far in excess of anything the Founders \ncontemplated.\n  My State of Utah helped to lead the way, signing on as an original \nplaintiff in the litigation that is now before the Supreme Court. And I \nwas honored to work with the Republican leader, my friend and \ncolleague, Senator McConnell, in developing friend-of-the-court briefs \nfiled at the trial level, at the initial appellate level, and now \nbefore the Supreme Court.\n  Putting aside all of the precedents, this really is a matter of \nsimple logic and common sense.\n  Our Constitution is one of limited powers. The powers of Congress are \nfew and enumerated. Yet if this mandate is allowed to stand, then there \nare effectively no limits on the Constitution any longer.\n  Something has to give.\n  Either this mandate will stand or our Constitution will stand.\n  But both cannot survive this litigation.\n  The Eleventh Circuit got it right in its analysis of this law. This \nis what they concluded:\n\n       Economic mandates such as the one contained in the Act are \n     so unprecedented, however, that the government has been \n     unable, either in its briefs or at oral argument, to point \n     this Court to Supreme Court precedent that addresses their \n     constitutionality. Nor does out independent review reveal \n     such a precedent.\n\n  The partisan supporters of ObamaCare will say that this is just the \nopinion of a conservative court.\n  But it is also the opinion voiced by the liberal writer Timothy Noah \nas far back as 2007.\n  And there is some evidence that it was the opinion of Senator Obama \nwhen he declined to endorse a sweeping individual mandate when running \nfor President.\n  But once elected, President Obama put politics first. In the interest \nof supercharging the welfare state and passing his signature \nlegislative initiative, he put aside any concerns with the individual \nmandate and endorsed this unprecedented regulation of individual \ndecisionmaking.\n  The President should have stuck with his original position.\n  Those who defend the constitutionality of the individual mandate make \nan astounding claim--that the decision not to buy something, in the \naggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. Those who defend \nthis position stand for the proposition that the Federal Government can \nregulate your decision not to do something, that it can regulate not \njust economic activity but economic inactivity, and that Congress can \nregulate not just physical activity but mental activity.\n  If Congress can do these things, Congress has no limits.\n  A Constitution that creates a limited Federal Government has been \ntransformed into a Constitution that gives plenary, and unconstrained, \npower to the Federal Government.\n  This is not only something that the American Founders worked hard to \nprevent, but it is something that contemporary Americans continue to \nreject.\n  There are many reasons to oppose ObamaCare. Today, the \nadministration's allies are touting the benefits of the law for small \nbusiness. This is laughable.\n  The administration promised that ObamaCare's small business credit \nwould help more than 4 million small businesses. This was a pretty \npaltry concession to the businesses that would be harmed by the \nemployer mandate, new regulations, and half a trillion dollars in taxes \nand penalties imposed by ObamaCare.\n  And as could be expected from such a top-down, Washington-centered \napproach, businesses have been less than eager to take up this complex \ncredit. The administration claimed that 4 million small businesses \nwould use this credit. Yet according to a report from the Treasury \nInspector General, after 2 years, only 309,000 taxpayers, or 7 percent \nof qualified entities, have claimed this credit.\n  But as bad as ObamaCare's policies are--confusing benefits, \nheavyhanded mandates, and enormous economic costs for families and \nbusinesses--it is the profound unconstitutionality of the law that \nremains paramount in the minds of most Americans.\n  Next week, almost 2 years to the day after ObamaCare became law, the \nSupreme Court will consider arguments in this historic case.\n  I am confident that when the dust settles, our Constitution will \nemerge standing and strong.\n  And I am equally confident that the American people will have the \nlast word on those politicians who chose to look the other way, rather \nthan acknowledge the deep constitutional shortcomings of this \nunprecedented intrusion on the liberty of America's citizens and \ntaxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1997-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1997-S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate George \nMoses of Pittsburgh, PA, on his selection by the National Low Income \nHousing Coalition for the Cushing Niles Dolbeare Lifetime Service \nAward. Mr. Moses has dedicated his life to helping others and this \naward serves as recognition of a lifetime of service to those in need.\n  Mr. Moses' life has been one of service, perseverance, and \nleadership. He served his country as a soldier in the United States \nArmy from 1963 until his honorable discharge in 1965. He then returned \nto work in Pittsburgh, including as a laborer in the city's steel \nmills. In 1990, his life underwent a significant change. Following a \nmajor surgery, he was unable to climb stairs and as a result moved into \nan apartment in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh. Mr. Moses took \na leadership role, working to help his fellow residents, and together \nwith them founding an organization called the Federal American \nCoalition of Tenants, which focused on educating residents to fight for \nfair and equal housing practices.\n  Mr. Moses has continued his work on behalf of low-income residents to \nthis day. His leadership and advocacy were instrumental in assisting \nhundreds of people who lived in Pittsburgh's Northside avoid eviction. \nWhen a HUD-Assisted rental housing development tried to evict many of \nits residents, Mr. Moses stepped in and helped to organize the \nNorthside Coalition for Fair Housing. The Northside Coalition's actions \nwere successful in helping keep many of the residents in their homes, \nand to this day, the Northside Coalition helps to manage the properties \nand provide social services to the residents.\n  For the past 12 years, Mr. Moses has been a strong advocate for \naffordable housing at the national level, serving on the Board of \nDirectors of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. For the last 6 \nyears he has served as Chairman of that board. The Lifetime Service \nAward being given to him by the Coalition is a fitting tribute to the \nleadership and service he has devoted to it. I thank him for his \nservice to Pennsylvania and the Nation, and offer him my warmest \ncongratulations on this well-deserved award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S1998-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO LTC DAREN S.

Sorenson, an extraordinary American, whose heroic acts to \ndefend his country and fellow servicemembers has earned him a second \nDistinguished Flying Cross, DFC. The State of Nevada and the U.S. Air \nForce are proud to commend Lieutenent Colonel Sorenson for all of his \naccomplishments.\n  I am grateful and humbled to honor Lieutenant Colonel Sorenson for \nhis dedication and sacrifice to this Nation. He has been deployed seven \ntimes and served as the deputy mission commander during the first \npreemptive strike on the inaugural night of Operation Iraqi Freedom in \n2003. During this combat operation, Lieutenant Colonel Sorenson earned \nhis first DFC for targeting and assisting the destruction of an armored \nunit of the Iraqi Republican Guard. Not only has Lieutenant Colonel \nSorenson been recognized for this prestigious award once, but he \nreceived his second DFC during his deployment to Afghanistan for air \nsupport in Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  On May 25, 2011, during an operation in Eastern Afghanistan, \nLieutenant Colonel Sorenson implemented techniques and strategies \nlearned at Nevada's Nellis Air Force Base to defend and save the lives \nof nearly 50 coalition members. Lieutenant Colonel Sorenson's valiant \naeronautic techniques drew away opposing fire and enabled air \ncontrollers and ground forces to locate combatants and defeat the \nenemy. His devotion to duty in the face of perilous flying conditions \nis admirable and maintains the highest standards and traditions of the \nU.S. Air Force.\n  As America's oldest military aviation award, the DFC was created by \nCongress more than 85 years ago to award individuals for acts of \nheroism or achievement in aeronautics. I applaud Lieutenant Colonel \nSorenson for earning this prestigious award twice during his service. \nHis continuous acts of bravery are a testament to his commitment to the \nUnited States.\n  Today, we commend Lieutenant Colonel Sorenson's acts of valor and the \ncontinuous sacrifices made by all of our servicemembers to ensure the \nsafety and security of our Nation. We owe them and their families a \ngreat deal of gratitude for their personal sacrifices. I am proud to \njoin the citizens of Nevada in recognizing Lieutenant Colonel \nSorenson's accomplishments.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 to reauthorize and improve the Rural Energy for America \nprogram; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I rise to introduce the Rural Energy for America Program \nReauthorization Act, along with my friend Senator Harkin from Iowa.\n  Farmers and rural businesses form the backbone of this country, and \nrural communities are particularly crucial to Minnesota's culture and \neconomy. In fact, in my State, one out of every five jobs is related to \nthe agricultural economy.\n  We all rely on farmers for our food. It is thanks to farmers that \nwhen we go to the grocery store there is an abundance of fresh food at \ncheaper prices than in many other countries. While family farmers and \nrural businesses work hard to keep our shelves stocked, they do so \nunder difficult conditions. Weather and disease can wipe out a crop, \nprofit margins can be small, and fluctuating market prices for their \nproducts can be devastating to a family farmer.\n  Farm work is also very energy intensive, so when energy and gas \nprices rise, farmers have to make tough choices. High energy prices \nmean laying off farm workers, increasing crop prices, if they can, and \nsqueezed budgets all around. To make matters worse, many of our \ngovernment programs that help manage rising energy prices are under \nattack and on the budget chopping block.\n  REAP, or the Rural Energy for America Program, can help farmers \nmanage the cost of energy. The bill I am introducing today will \nreauthorize this important farm bill program that will help farmers and \nrural small businesses continue to cut energy bills and generate \nelectricity on site.\n  Let me go through a few examples of what REAP projects can look like. \nIt is putting solar panels on barns. It is wind turbines in fields. \nThere are wind turbines all over Minnesota. It is anaerobic digesters \non dairy farms which actually use waste to create methane gas and \nelectricity. It means energy efficiency improvements in poultry houses \nand geothermal pumps in factories. It means agricultural producers and \nbusinesses can reduce their costs and generate an additional stream of \nincome. It means rural America can make high-tech investments, create \njobs, and lead the world in producing clean energy. I know in the \nPresiding Officer's State of New Hampshire there is tremendous biomass \nand potential for energy biomass and the low carbon footprint that \nrepresents.\n  The Rural Energy for America Program is a modest program, but it is a \nwise investment that effectively leverages private funds. Since it was\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\ncreated in 2002, this program has helped almost 6,000 farmers and small \nbusinesses across the Nation invest in alternative energy projects. The \nprogram has generated or saved enough energy to power about 600,000 \nhomes a year. By providing just $192 million in grants and $165 million \nin loan guarantees, the program has brought in $800 million in private \nand State investments. Plus, the Rural Energy for America Program helps \ncreate demand for new jobs in rural economies. These are jobs in \ninstallation and operations and maintenance work--good jobs that rural \nAmerica needs. It also bolsters American energy independence and \nfosters homegrown energy sources such as wind and solar and biomass and \ngeothermal instead of foreign oil.\n  Shirley Hovda's rural wood finishing and coating business, Quality \nDecorating, in Roseau, MN, is one of the 6,000 that benefited from the \nRural Energy for America Program over the years. Roseau, in northern \nMinnesota, is cold in the winter and in the fall and in the early \nspring. When Shirley's heating bills spiked, she decided it was time to \ninvest in a geothermal heating and cooling system to reduce costs in \nher newly constructed 6,000 square foot facility.\n  With the help of a $7,920 grant from the Rural Energy for America \nProgram, she was able to purchase and install the geothermal system in \n2008. Over the past 5 years, Shirley has seen her energy bills reduced \nby 40 percent, saving thousands of dollars she has invested in more \nproductive parts of her business.\n  The bill we are introducing today reauthorizes the Rural Energy for \nAmerica Program to continue helping farmers and small business owners \nsuch as Shirley to make smart investments in renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency. It makes improvements to the program too. While the \nprogram has had a fantastic impact on the country's rural economy, \nfarmers tell me they are facing challenges accessing it. So our bill \nremoves barriers while ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.\n  First, our bill simplifies the application process, making it easier \nfor farmers and small businesses to access the program's grants and \nloans. The new application process matches the complexity of the \napplication to the size of the project. That way, farmers and the USDA \ncan avoid unnecessary and costly paperwork if the project doesn't \nwarrant it.\n  Second, my bill removes a regulation that currently requires farmers \nto use the program's funding to install a second electric meter that \ncurrently goes unread. In these tight fiscal times, I think it is \nimportant that every taxpayer dollar is well spent, so the bill will \neliminate this redundancy and remove an unnecessary burden on program \nparticipants.\n  Third, our bill requires the USDA to include stronger health and \nenvironmental criteria when evaluating potential projects, and it \nexpands startup support and funds for feasibility studies so that \nfarmers and businesses can start projects with sound planning.\n  We are very grateful for the strong support from the agricultural \ncommunity, including the National Farmers Union, the Minnesota Farmers \nUnion, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, the National \nSustainable Agriculture Coalition, the Agriculture Energy Association, \nthe Distributed Wind Alliance, the Minnesota Corn Growers, and the \nMinnesota Soybean Growers.\n  With the Chair's indulgence, I have about 30 seconds left. I have an \ninner clock. I think I am up against my 2 minutes, so I wish to say I \nam proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Harkin, who is a \ntrue champion to farmers here in the Senate. Going forward, I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle to pass this reauthorization as part of the farm bill.\n  I see Senator Johanns, the former Secretary of Agriculture, on the \nfloor, whom I hope to work with on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 39. A joint resolution removing the deadline for the \nratification of the equal rights amendment, to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a joint resolution \nwhich would remove the deadline for the states' ratification of the \nequal rights amendment, ERA. I thank Senators Boxer, Durbin, \nGillibrand, Harkin, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Menendez, and Mikulski for \njoining me as original cosponsors.\n  When Congress passed the ERA in 1972, it provided that the measure \nhad to be ratified by \\3/4\\ of the States, 38 States, within 7 years. \nThis deadline was later extended to 10 years by a joint resolution \nenacted by Congress,\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\nbut ultimately only 35 out of 38 States had ratified the ERA when the \ndeadline expired in 1982.\n  Congress can and should give the States another chance. In 1992, the \n27th Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting immediate Congressional \npay raises was ratified after 203 years. Article V of the Constitution \ncontains no time limits for ratification of constitutional amendments, \nand the ERA time limit was contained in a joint resolution, not the \nactual text of the amendment.\n  The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution requires ``equal \nprotection of the laws,'' and the Supreme Court has so far held that \nmost sex or gender classifications are subject to only ``intermediate \nscrutiny'' when analyzing laws that may have a discriminatory impact. \nIn 2011 Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia gave an interview in which \nhe stated that ``certainly the Constitution does not require \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it \nprohibits it. It doesn't.'' Ratification of the ERA by state \nlegislatures would provide the courts with clearer guidance in holding \ngender or sex classifications to the ``strict scrutiny'' standard.\n  The ERA is a simple and straightforward constitutional amendment. It \nreads: ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or \nabridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.'' The \namendment gives power to Congress to enforce its provisions by \nappropriate legislation, and the amendment would take effect two years \nafter ratification by the States.\n  March is Women's History Month. And today is the 40th anniversary of \npassage by the Senate of the joint resolution to extend the ERA \nratification timeline on March 22, 1972. Today, nearly half of the \nStates have a version of the ERA written into their State constitution. \nMy own State of Maryland's constitution reads that ``Equality of rights \nunder the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.''\n  I am therefore pleased to introduce this joint resolution today, \nwhich is endorsed by a wide variety of groups, including United 4 \nEquality, the National Council of Women's Organizations, the National \nOrganization for Women, and the American Association of University \nWomen. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S2004-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 404--RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND WORK OF WAR \n  CORRESPONDENT MARIE COLVIN AND OTHER COURAGEOUS JOURNALISTS IN WAR \n                                 ZONES\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. \nWyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 404\n\n       Whereas The Sunday Times reporter Marie Colvin was killed \n     during the shelling of a makeshift media center in the Baba \n     Amr neighborhood of the besieged Syrian city of Homs on \n     February 22, 2012, along with French photographer Remi \n     Ochlik;\n       Whereas Ms. Colvin leaves behind a beloved family where she \n     grew up in the State of New York, was educated and began her \n     journalistic career in the United States, and throughout her \n     career as one of the foremost war correspondents of her \n     generation exemplified American values of humanity, \n     accountability, decency, transparency, and courage;\n       Whereas Ms. Colvin worked with relentless bravery to report \n     on the recent uprising in Syria and to expose crimes against \n     humanity, human-rights violations, and the ravages of war in \n     conflict zones throughout the world, including the Balkans, \n     the Chechen Republic, Libya, and Sri Lanka, where she was \n     seriously wounded and lost vision in 1 eye;\n       Whereas Ms. Colvin shed light on human-rights violations \n     through her courageous reporting on how these conflicts \n     affected the lives of individuals;\n       Whereas the actions of Ms. Colvin in Timor-Leste are widely \n     credited with averting a massacre;\n       Whereas Ms. Colvin said, ``Covering a war means going to \n     places torn by chaos, destruction, and death, and trying to \n     bear witness. It means trying to find the truth in a \n     sandstorm of propaganda when armies, tribes or terrorists \n     clash. And yes, it means taking risks, not just for yourself \n     but often for the people who work closely with you.'';\n       Whereas the work of Ms. Colvin exemplifies the best \n     qualities of journalism;\n       Whereas Ms. Colvin was awarded the 2000 Courage in \n     Journalism Award from the International Women's Media \n     Foundation for behind-the-lines action in Kosovo and the \n     Chechen Republic, twice named Foreign Reporter of the Year at \n     the British Press Awards, named the Journalist of the Year by \n     the Foreign Press Association in 2000, and named Woman \n     Journalist of the Year by the Foreign Press Association in \n     2010; and\n       Whereas Ms. Colvin and brave journalists have lost their \n     lives serving as the conscience of the world: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends its sympathy to the families of Ms. Colvin and \n     other reporters who have died reporting from conflict zones;\n       (2) recognizes the bravery of Ms. Colvin and other \n     correspondents and photographers who have lost their lives \n     while exposing the truth;\n       (3) calls on the world community to honor the memories of \n     Ms. Colvin and other reporters; and\n       (4) calls on the government of Syria to halt the brutal \n     attacks against the people of Syria and to respect their \n     human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/22/senate-section/article/S2007-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AUTHORIZING SENATE CHAMBER PHOTOGRAPH\n\n  Mr. REID.
