Madam President, the Senate is now considering the motion \nto proceed to S. 1925, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\n  The Republicans will control the first half hour, and the majority \nwill control the second half hour this morning. The Republicans will \nalso control the time from 11:30 to 12:30 today. The majority will \ncontrol the time from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m.\n  At 2 p.m. the Senate will resume consideration of the postal reform \nbill. There will be several rollcall votes--six to eight votes--at that \ntime in order to complete action on the bill.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  I am very gratified about the work that has been done over the last \nmany months, which will culminate today in the passing of this postal \nbill. It has been extremely difficult. Lots of people have worked on \nthis bill, and it has been a bipartisan effort. It is going to send a \nmessage to the House that we can do big things.\n  It is an important piece of legislation--one of the biggest and most \ncomplicated we have dealt with in a long time. As I said, I am \ngratified, and I congratulate and applaud Senators Lieberman, Collins, \nand others on our side--especially Senator Tom Carper, who worked hard \nwith the chairman and ranking member and many others who were \nstalwarts. We saw that yesterday when there was an effort to bring the \nbill down. That was the first vote we took. Senators stood at their \ndesks in the Chamber on a bipartisan basis and indicated how important \nthis legislation is. It was a very important day for the American \npeople.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  We will be on this legislation I announced dealing with violence \nagainst women. Each year about 5 million Americans are victims of \nviolence by their spouses or partners. Every single day 3 women are \nkilled at the hands of their abusers, and every day 9 or 10 are beaten \nvery badly. They are hospitalized, and some have permanent injuries \nfrom their abusers. We authorize and ensure in this law that the police \nhave the tools to more effectively stop this and prosecute those people \nwho are the abusers.\n  As I said yesterday, I held hearings many years ago on this subject, \nand the one issue that was pronounced so clearly is that in many \ninstances the only thing that helps these abusers is to send them to \njail. It works better than counseling, better than threats, and people \nshould realize we need law enforcement to have better ways of \napproaching these calls they get all the time.\n  I also mentioned yesterday that in Las Vegas one of our prized police \nofficers, a sergeant on the police force for\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\nmany years, was called to a scene along with one of the junior police \nofficers, and he was killed as soon as he walked in the door. This is \nan important piece of legislation. It has 61 cosponsors, and we should \npass it.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Madam President, the Senate has a long list of things to do. One of \nthe things we have to do is stop the raising of interest rates on \nstudents who borrow money to go to school. We were fortunate to reduce \nthis rate from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. We cut it in half. We did \nthis in 2007. We had just obtained a majority in the Senate, and we \nworked on this very hard. It went to President Bush, he signed the law, \nand rightfully so.\n  Everyone should understand this is a bill that was signed by \nPresident Bush. We need to go back to what he signed. We cannot have \nthese rates go up. If we don't act by July 1, more than 7 million \nstudents will be forced to pay an average of $1,000 more each year for \nthese student loans. College is already unaffordable for too many \npeople. I hope we can get this done.\n  I am going to stop my comments because I was, of course, impressed by \nthe remarks of the guest Chaplain. Many years ago I went to the \nArmenian Church, and it was a wonderful experience. I say to my friend \nfrom Rhode Island, to whom I will yield in a second, we went to Armenia \nafter that very brutal winter when the Turks had cut off the oil to \nArmenia. The Armenians cut down a lot of trees, and they survived. Most \nsaid they could not. It was a brutal winter. Peace Corps volunteers \nwere there and not one left Armenia, even though they suffered along \nwith the Armenian people.\n  So I have fond memories of my visit to Armenia. I understand the \nresiliency of the people of Armenia, and I remember visiting that \nchurch.\n  I yield to my friend, the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the leader for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2664-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I am honored to be here today to welcome \nHis Eminence Archbishop Oshagan Choloyan. Archbishop Choloyan serves as \nthe Prelate of the Eastern Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of \nAmerica. He has led the Eastern Prelacy since 1998, and he plays a \nsignificant role as the spiritual shepherd for several thousand \nArmenian Americans from Maine to Florida and west to Texas.\n  In Rhode Island, we are extremely blessed to have the Archbishop as \nsuch a strong spiritual and community leader. We continue to benefit \nfrom his wisdom, his compassion, and his generous spirit. It is an \nhonor to have him here today as we not only listen to his moving and \nthoughtful words, but also as we commemorate the 97th anniversary of \nthe Armenian genocide.\n  Ninety-seven years ago, on April 24, 1915, the Young Turk leaders of \nthe Ottoman Empire summoned and executed over 200 Armenian community \nleaders and intellectuals, beginning an 8-year campaign of oppression \nand massacre. By 1923, nearly 1\\1/2\\ million Armenians were killed, and \nover a half million survivors were exiled. These atrocities affected \nthe lives of every Armenian living in Asia Minor and, indeed, \nthroughout the world.\n  The survivors of the Armenian genocide, however, persevered due to \ntheir unbreakable spirit, their steadfast resolve, and their deep \ncommitment to their faith and their families. They went on to enrich \ntheir countries of emigration, including the United States, with their \ncenturies-old customs, their culture, and their innate decency.\n  In fact, not only were the Ottomans unable to destroy the Armenian \nEmpire, they strengthened it. And the participation of Armenians \nworldwide has made this world a much better place. Indeed, my home \nState is a much better place. That is why today we not only commemorate \nthis grave tragedy but celebrate the traditions, the contributions, and \nthe extraordinary hard work and decency of the Armenian Americans and \nArmenians throughout the world.\n  This year I once again join my colleagues in encouraging the United \nStates to officially recognize the Armenian genocide. Denial of this \nhistory is not consistent with our country's sensitivity to human \nrights and our dedication to the highest and noblest principles that \nshould govern the world. We must continue to educate our young people \nagainst this type of hatred and oppression so we can seek to prevent \nsuch crimes against humanity in the future. It was indeed an honor to \nbe here to listen to the wise words of the Archbishop, to hear his \nprayer, his reflection, and to go forth knowing that he is a powerful \nforce in our country for tolerance and decency. I thank him for being \nhere today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2664-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1925, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 1925, a bill to reauthorize the \n     Violence Against Women Act of 1994.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 2 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first \n30 minutes and the majority controlling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act.\n  I am glad the Senate is finally considering this important \nlegislation, and I am proud to be the crucial 60th cosponsor of the \nbill. I commend Chairman Leahy for producing a bill that enjoys broad \nbipartisan support, and I look forward to swift passage of the VAWA \nreauthorization.\n  Violence in all its forms is unacceptable, but it is particularly \nhorrifying when it takes place in the home, which should be a sanctuary \nfor all who live there. Yet a recent CDC report found that nearly half \nof all women living in my home State of Nevada at the time of the \nsurvey experienced domestic violence at some point in their lifetime. \nThis statistic is sickening and unacceptable. Women and children often \nfeel powerless to escape abusive or dangerous situations, which too \noften end in tragedy.\n  My home State knows this sad reality all too well. Nevada is ranked \nfirst in the Nation for women murdered by men in domestic violence. \nSadly, our State has appeared in the top three States in this horrific \ncategory in the last 7 years. Thankfully, organizations throughout the \nState of Nevada work tirelessly to help those jeopardized by domestic \nviolence. While these groups have faced significant challenges due to \nfunding cuts in recent years, they are doing their best with what they \nhave to provide assistance to families who need it most.\n  According to last year's Nevada Census of Domestic Violence Services, \nnearly 500 Nevadans received crisis assistance through Nevada's \ndomestic violence programs on a single day; 272 found refuge in \nemergency shelters or temporary housing; 204 received nonresidential \nassistance. Staff and volunteers fielded an average of six hotline \ncalls every hour. Despite the best efforts of our State's domestic \nviolence programs, 25 cases of unmet requests for services were \nreported on a single day due to shortage of funds and staff. That means \nthousands of Nevadans could not access the services they needed last \nyear.\n  Nevada's struggling economy has limited State resources to help those \nwho are affected by domestic violence. Reauthorization of VAWA will \nprovide greater certainty for organizations that work hard every day to \nprevent and address domestic violence. I trust this bill will ensure \nand enable domestic violence programs to plan for the future and serve \neven more Americans in need. Importantly, this bill will also\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\nfurther prevention efforts that, hopefully, will result in reducing \ndomestic violence and help our Nation's most vulnerable.\n\n  I am also pleased this legislation reauthorizes programs vital to the \nNational Council of Family and Juvenile Court Judges. The National \nCouncil has made a strong impact in courts throughout the Nation by \nteaching judges innovative strategies that equip them to appropriately \nassist families and young people who face significant hardships. I \ncannot be more proud of the positive changes the National Council is \neffecting in courtrooms and communities in Nevada and nationwide, and I \nam glad this bill will further their efforts.\n  As a fiscal conservative, I am also glad this bill was written with \nfull awareness of the fiscal crisis our Nation is facing. This \nlegislation repeals duplicative provisions and programs, creating a \nmore efficient system. I encourage my colleagues to use this bill as a \nmodel when considering additional reauthorizations this year. We must \nnot forget the need to implement commonsense budgetary practices across \nthe board in order to put our Nation on a path to long-term fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  While not perfect, I am pleased the Senate is proceeding with this \nbill and trust it will further the important goal of reducing violence \nin all its forms. This bipartisan effort is an example of how Members \nof Congress should be working together to solve the problems facing our \nNation and protecting those who have no voice. I look forward to the \npassage of the VAWA reauthorization measure and believe it will truly \nmake a difference in the lives of countless women in Nevada and \nthroughout the United States.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                         National Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, as certainly every Kansan and all \nAmericans know, our gas prices are on the rise and the U.S. economy \ncontinues to struggle. I believe one of the most important things \nCongress can do now is to facilitate the production of affordable \nenergy in this country. In Kansas, we have the third highest number of \nhighway miles in any State in the country, so higher fuel prices are \nparticularly difficult for Kansans who drive long distances each day \nfor work and school. When business owners pay more for fuel, they have \nless to invest in their businesses and fewer resources to use to hire \nnew employees.\n  In our State, higher fuel prices increase operating costs for farmers \nand ranchers who produce much of our Nation's food supply. One Kansas \nfarmer feeds 155 people. The global food supply is threatened when food \nproducers have to pay high costs to plant, harvest, and transport their \nproduction.\n  Higher gas prices don't just affect the farmer or rancher filling \ntheir equipment; they also affect every American as they shop at their \ngrocery store. While producers have to pay higher fuel costs, so do the \nfolks who transport the goods to market. So that increased cost gets \npassed on to the consumer. We all are paying more.\n  For the United States to remain competitive in this global economy, \nCongress must develop a comprehensive national energy policy. No single \nform of energy can provide all the answers. High fuel prices and an \nuncertain energy supply will continue until we take serious steps \ntoward increasing the development of our own natural resources.\n  Our country has some of the most plentiful, affordable, and reliable \nenergy sources available. Our own Congressional Research Service has \nreported the United States has greater energy resources than China, \nSaudi Arabia, and Canada combined. Unfortunately, access to those \nresources continues to be restricted.\n  Technological advances have made the exploration, extraction, and \ntransportation of oil and gas safer and more efficient. Yet the Obama \nadministration has repeatedly blocked efforts to expand energy \nproduction. In the President's State of the Union Address, he claimed \noil and gas production has increased under his leadership. While \nprivate lands are being further developed, and energy production is \nbeing increased on those private lands, energy production on Federal \nlands has actually decreased. According to the Department of the \nInterior, oil production on Federal property fell by 14 percent and \nnatural gas production fell by 11 percent last year.\n  The failure to explore and develop our vast natural resources on \nFederal lands hit an unfortunate milestone last week. Ten years ago, \nthe Senate failed to open a fractional portion of the Arctic National \nWildlife Reserve for responsible resource development. Those opposed to \ndeveloping that small portion of that vast area claimed the resources \navailable in ANWR would not reach the market for 10 years. Well, here \nwe are, 10 years later, no closer than we were in 2002 to gaining our \nenergy independence.\n  American businesses involved in the oil and gas industry can bring \nthese resources to market and send a strong signal to the world that \nthe United States is serious about energy security. Yet rather than \nallowing these companies to deploy their expertise and increase \nproduction, there are those who say oil and gas companies deserve even \nmore taxes--a tax increase. Raising taxes on the very businesses tasked \nwith locating, extracting, and distributing the fuel to power our \neconomy would do nothing to lower costs and reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. In fact, it would do exactly the opposite.\n  When the Congressional Research Service analyzed President Obama's \nfiscal year 2012 budget proposal last year to raise taxes on the oil \nand gas companies, they concluded those efforts would have the effect \nof ``decreasing exploration, development and production while \nincreasing prices and increasing the nation's foreign oil dependence.'' \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service says these taxes would \nreduce domestic supply and hurt consumers.\n  To increase domestic production, I have sponsored the 3 D Act, which \nwould require the administration to reverse their cancellation of \ndozens of oil and gas leases, open areas previously restricted to \nresponsible oil and gas development, such as the Arctic National \nWildlife Reserve, and streamline the environmental review process that \ncontinually ties up worthy projects in costly bureaucracy and \nlitigation.\n  The administration is also delaying projects that will improve our \nenergy's infrastructure. The President's denial of TransCanada's \nKeystone XL Pipeline permit delayed an important project that would \ncreate thousands of jobs and bring billions to the U.S. economy. This \nprivate investment in energy infrastructure is exactly the type of \ninvestment the President should be encouraging. Construction projects \ncreate jobs and boost local economies.\n\n  For example, back home in Kansas, Clay County is a small, lowly \npopulated county. Their utility sales to TransCanada could quadruple \ntheir overall sales and add more than $\\1/2\\ million to the local \neconomy every year. This would be a significant boost to the county's \neconomic development.\n  President Obama's own Jobs Council cited the pipeline construction as \na way to boost the economy in their year-end report released January of \nthis year, stating:\n\n       Policies that facilitate safe, thoughtful and timely \n     development of pipeline, transmission and distribution \n     projects are necessary to facilitate the delivery of \n     America's fuel and electricity and maintain the reliability \n     of our nation's energy system.\n\n  But TransCanada's project has been stalled as the company works to \nseek a new route through the State of Nebraska, to our north. But \ninstead of putting the entire project on hold, we would be much better \noff if we would allow construction to begin in areas not subject to \nthis rerouting so jobs could be created and our Nation could have \ngreater access to more reliable energy. S. 2041, which I have \nsponsored, would do that.\n  Renewable energy must also play a role in supplying our energy needs \nas new technologies allow for the increased commercialization of \nrenewable fuels. Kansas is a leader in wind production and second only \nto Texas in wind resource potential. Innovation in biofuel production \nhas also increased our ability to develop additional energy from \nrenewable sources available in my home State of Kansas.\n  Nuclear energy is a necessary component that will help us supply our \ncountry's future energy needs and allow our country to be less reliant \non energy\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nfrom other nations. I will continue to support initiatives to spur \ngrowth in the nuclear energy industry, including initiatives to \nstreamline regulatory compliance.\n  Energy exploration must be accompanied by energy conservation. When \nAmericans drive more efficient vehicles and occupy energy-conserving \nbuildings, they not only consume less energy, they save money. At a \ntime when gas prices continue to climb, we need to be looking for more \ninnovative ways to help consumers save money on energy bills.\n  Congress must develop a comprehensive national energy policy--a \npolicy based upon the free market principles that say we can find the \nresources necessary to meet our country's needs. We must develop our \ndomestic sources of oil, natural gas, and coal, encourage the \ndevelopment of renewable energy sources, and promote conservation.\n  Not only would the development of our Nation's resources reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy, it would also provide our economy can \nwith a reliable, affordable fuel supply. If future generations of \nAmericans are to experience the quality of life we enjoy today, the \ntime to address our energy needs is now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know we have not yet concluded the \npostal reform bill, but I come to the floor to speak on an amendment I \nintend to offer on the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct. The amendment I intend to offer is one that enjoys bipartisan \nsupport, and I hope as more Senators learn about the content of this \namendment and how it will strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, \nthey will join me and Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, Senator Bennet of \nColorado, as well as Senator Vitter from Louisiana. I believe it will \nstrengthen the Violence Against Women Act we will vote on, presumably \nlater today, but probably tomorrow.\n  I am also happy to have the support of the Rape Abuse and Incest \nNational Network--RAINN--PROTECT, and the Texas Association Against \nSexual Assault, as well as Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed, \nwhose office is in San Antonio, TX. She has worked with us on this \namendment, and we have benefited from her counsel and that of her \nstaff. We have the support as well of San Antonio Police Chief William \nMcManus.\n  At its core, this amendment would help end the nationwide rape kit \nbacklog while improving law enforcement tools to crack down on violent \ncriminals who target women and children for sexual assault.\n  To give a little context, in the course of an investigation, law \nenforcement officials will collect DNA evidence in something called a \nrape kit. These are generally bodily fluids that can be tested, because \nof their DNA signature, against a bank of DNA evidence for a match. In \nfact, this is a very powerful tool for law enforcement because it will \nliterally identify someone from this DNA match in a way nothing else \ncan. This DNA evidence can also, for those who care, as we all do, \nabout making sure the innocent are not held in suspicion or convicted \nfor crimes they didn't commit, be so powerful as to literally exclude, \nin some instances, suspects of criminal conduct.\n  The nationwide rape kit backlog is a national scandal--one that many \npeople don't know very much about--and it has serious consequences for \nsexual assault victims. The truth is we don't know about the full scope \nof the problem, but one estimate is there are as many as 400,000 \nuntested rape kits currently sitting in labs and on police station \nshelves across the Nation, each one of them holding within itself the \npotential to help solve a serious crime and, in the process, take a \nrapist off the streets and provide a victim with the justice they \ndeserve.\n  Take, for example, the case of Carol Bart. Carol is from Dallas, TX. \nIn 1984, Ms. Bart was kidnapped and raped at knife point outside her \nDallas apartment. Although she submitted herself for rape kit testing \nimmediately following the crime, her kit was not tested until 2008--24 \nyears later. When it was tested 24 years after the rape kit specimens \nwere collected, it yielded a match for a serial sex offender who had \nattempted to rape another woman only 4 months later after he raped Ms. \nBart.\n  This is one of the most important reasons why this evidence is \nimportant, because the fact is people who commit sexual assaults are \nnot one-time offenders. They do it many times, and often they do it \nuntil they are caught. But because the rape kit in Ms. Bart's case was \nnot tested for 24 years after the crime, the statute of limitations had \nrun, meaning that her attacker could not be brought to justice for that \nparticular crime.\n\n  Statutes of limitations serve a worthwhile purpose under ordinary \ncircumstances. They are designed to make sure charges are brought on a \ntimely basis, while witnesses' memories are fresh and they can identify \nthe perpetrator and the like. But in this instance, what it concealed \nwas an injustice because, in fact, this late testing--24 years after \nthe fact--meant her attacker could not be brought to justice for that \nparticular crime.\n  Take also the case of Helena Lazaro, who was raped outside of Los \nAngeles in 1996 when she was just a teenager. Ms. Lazaro's rape kit sat \nuntested for more than 13 years after her assault. When it was finally \ntested in 2009, it yielded a match to a repeat offender who had raped \nseveral women at knifepoint in Indiana and Ohio.\n  There are countless, I am sorry to say, examples of similar tragedies \nacross the country, only a handful of which are actually reported on \nthe front pages of our major newspapers. And some of these victims, of \ncourse, have merely suffered in silence in towns and communities across \nour country.\n  One thing is clear: While DNA evidence is powerful evidence, we have \nnot yet adapted our administration of testing nor the capacity to \ninventory these kits in a way to make sure they are tested on a timely \nbasis, and we have not kept up with that. But that is what this \namendment hopes to do.\n  According to a 2011 report by the National Institute of Justice:\n\n       [c]urrent Federal programs to reduce backlogs in crime \n     laboratories are not designed to address untested evidence \n     stored in law enforcement agencies.\n\n  As a matter of fact, one of the problems in requiring an inventory of \nthese untested rape kits is often the National Institute of Justice and \nlaw enforcement personnel don't even categorize a rape kit as untested \nuntil it actually is in the hands of the laboratory. So many of them \nsit in evidence lockers, never making their way to the labs, and are \nnot identified as backlogged. So there are two distinct types of rape \nkit backlogs: the well-known backlog of untested rape kits that have \nalready been submitted for testing and the hidden backlog of kits in \nlaw enforcement storage that have not been submitted for testing, as \nyou can see, sometimes over a span of 13 years in one case and 24 years \nin the next. This amendment would help us learn more about this hidden \nbacklog and ultimately help State and local law enforcement officials \nto end it.\n  One of my experiences during the 4 years I was attorney general of \nTexas was that many local jurisdictions simply did not have the \nexpertise or experience or the knowledge to deal with new technology, \nwhether it is Internet crimes or whether it is this new, powerful DNA \ntool. It is not so new now, and in urban areas it is not as big of a \nproblem. In New York City, for example, I am sure they are quite \nsophisticated when dealing with this sort of evidence but less so in \nsmaller towns and communities across the country.\n  The justice for victims amendment would reserve 7 percent of existing \nDebbie Smith Act grant funding for the purpose of helping State and \nlocal governments to conduct audits of their rape kit backlogs. In my \nhometown of San Antonio, the police department recently conducted such \nan audit of their evidence storage facilities using similar grant \nfunding from the State of Texas. They identified more than 5,000--and \nthat is just in San Antonio alone--untested sexual assault kits, of \nwhich 2,000 they determined should be submitted promptly for testing. \nMy amendment would use existing appropriations to encourage more audits \nlike this.\n  The amendment would also add accountability to the audit process by \nrequiring grantees of these funds to upload critical information about \nthe\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nsize, scope, and status of their backlog into a new sexual assault \nevidence forensic registry. This valuable information would also help \nthe National Institute of Justice better target the approximately $100 \nmillion of existing appropriations already available for this type of \ntesting. In the spirit of open government, the amendment would also \nrequire the Department of Justice to publish aggregate, non-personally \nidentifying information about the rape kit backlog on an appropriate \nInternet Web site.\n  To ensure that these audit grants do not take resources away from \nactual testing, my amendment would increase the amount of Debbie Smith \nAct appropriations required to be spent directly on laboratory testing \nfrom the 40 percent currently in the underlying Leahy bill, which will \nbe the base bill, to 75 percent. So what it will do is it will actually \ntake more of the funding that Congress intended be used to process rape \nkits and do actual testing and return it to that core function.\n  A comprehensive approach to crime prevention and victims' rights also \nrequires updated tools for Federal law enforcement officials to target \nfugitives and repeat offenders. My amendment addresses this need by \nincluding bipartisan language authored by Senator Jeff Sessions that \nwould authorize the U.S. Marshals Service to issue administrative \nsubpoenas for the purpose of investigating unregistered sex offenders \nand would actually be limited to that narrow purpose. This provision \nwould allow the Marshals Service to swiftly obtain time-sensitive \ntracking information, such as rent records and credit card statements, \nwithout having to go through the grand jury process, which may or may \nnot be necessary depending on the circumstances. Such authority is \nurgently needed given the long and complicated paper trail that \nfugitive sex offender investigations often entail.\n  My amendment would also guarantee that we hand down tough \npunishments--appropriately so--to some of the worst crimes against \nwomen and children. For example, it includes enhanced sentencing \nprovisions for aggravated domestic violence resulting in death or life-\nthreatening bodily injury to the victim, aggravated sexual abuse, and \nchild sex trafficking. I think preventing these horrible crimes is at \nthe heart of the purpose of the Violence Against Women Act, and we \nshould take the opportunity to improve the underlying bill by adopting \nthis amendment and send a message to would-be perpetrators and child \nsex traffickers. If you commit some of the worst crimes imaginable in \nthe United States, you should have the certain knowledge that you will \nbe tracked down and that you will receive tough and appropriate \npunishment.\n  Finally, thanks to the great work of Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, \nmy amendment would further shed light on one of the greatest scourges \nof our time; that is, child prostitution and the trafficking that goes \nalong with it.\n\n  The so-called adult entertainment section of the popular online \nclassified Web site backpage.com is nothing more than a front for pimps \nand child sex traffickers. A lot has been written in the New York Times \non this topic. On this Web site, young children and coerced women are \nopenly advertised for sale in the sex trade. In fact, this Web site has \nbeen affirmatively linked to dozens of cases of child sex trafficking. \nLet me give a few recent examples.\n  Last month, Ronnie Leon Tramble was sentenced to 15 years in prison \nfor interstate sex trafficking through force, fraud, and coercion. \nTramble forced more than five young women and minors into prostitution \nover a period of at least 5 years throughout the State of Washington. \nHe repeatedly subjected his victims to brutal physical and emotional \nabuse during this time, while using backpage.com to facilitate their \nprostitution.\n  In February of this year, Leighton Martin Curtis was sentenced to 30 \nyears in prison for sex trafficking of a minor and production of child \npornography. Curtis pimped a 15-year-old girl throughout Florida, \nGeorgia, and North Carolina. He prostituted the girl to approximately \n20 to 35 customers per week for more than a year and used backpage.com \nto facilitate these crimes.\n  According to human trafficking experts, a casual review of the \nbackpage.com adult entertainment Web site reveals literally hundreds of \nchildren being sold for sex every day. This is absolutely sickening and \nshould be stopped with all the tools available to us. We should no \nlonger stand idle while thousands of children and trafficked women are \nraped, abused, and sold like chattel in modern-day slavery on the \nInternet. My amendment would therefore join all 50 State attorneys \ngeneral in calling on backpage.com to remove the adult entertainment \nsection of its Web site. Again, I would like to thank Senator Kirk for \nhis leadership on this issue. Every case of sex trafficking or forced \nprostitution is modern-day slavery--nothing more, nothing less--and we \nshould do everything in our power to ensure this practice is eradicated \nin the United States of America.\n  I believe the justice for victims amendment would reduce the rape kit \nbacklog, take serial perpetrators off the street, and ultimately reduce \nthe number of victims of sex violence. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin considering this amendment, which already enjoys bipartisan support, \nand I hope it will get much broader bipartisan support. I hope my \ncolleagues will join with me in strengthening the reauthorization of \nthe Violence Against Women Act by cosponsoring and supporting this \namendment. Our constituents and victims of these heinous crimes deserve \nnothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, before the Senator from Texas leaves \nthe floor, I was going to ask that I be added as a cosponsor to his \nvery worthwhile amendment.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, one of the most heartbreaking yet \nunderreported consequences of the Obama economy is the extent to which \ncollege graduates today are stepping out into a world where the \npossibilities no longer seem endless. Unlike generations past, today's \ncollege graduates are more likely to end up either unemployed or back \nat home with mom and dad, saddled with student loan debt that they are \nto end up with for the rest of their lives. And they don't tend to have \nthe opportunity to get that job of their dreams.\n  For a great many of them, the excitement and the promise of President \nObama's campaign 4 years ago have long since faded as their hopes \ncollided with an economy that he has done so much to reshape. So it is \nunderstandable that the President is so busy these days trying to \npersuade these students that the struggles they face or will soon face \nhave more to do with a piece of legislation we expect to fix than with \nhis own failed promises. It is understandable that he would want to \nmake them believe the fairy tale that there are villains in Washington \nwho would rather help millionaires and billionaires than struggling \ncollege students. But that doesn't make this kind of deception any more \nacceptable.\n  Today the President will hold another rally at which he will tell \nstudents that unless Congress acts, their interest rates will go up in \nJuly. What he won't tell them is that he cared so little about this \nlegislation that created this problem 5 years ago that he didn't even \nshow up to vote for it and that once he became President, he didn't \neven bother to include a fix for this problem in his own budget.\n  Look, if the President was more interested in solving this problem \nthan in hearing the sound of his own voice or the applause of college \nstudents, all he would have to do is pick up the phone and work it out \nwith Congress. We don't want the interest rates on these loans to \ndouble in this economy. We don't want today's graduates to have to \nsuffer any more than they already are as a result of this President's \nfailure to turn the economy around after more than 3 years in office. \nReally, the only question is how to pay for it. Democrats want to pay \nfor it by raiding Social Security and Medicare and by making it even \nharder for small businesses to hire. We happen to think that at a time \nwhen millions of Americans and countless college students can't even \nfind a decent job, it makes no sense whatsoever to punish the very \nbusinesses we are counting on to hire them. It is counterproductive and \nclearly the wrong direction to take.\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\n  So let's be honest. The only reason Democrats have proposed this \nparticular solution to the problem is to get Republicans to oppose it \nand to make us cast a vote they think will make us look bad to voters \nthey need to win in the next election. Earlier this week they admitted \nto using the Senate floor as an extension of the Obama campaign. So no \none should be surprised that they opted for a political show vote over \na solution.\n  What Republicans are saying is let's end the political games and \nsolve the problem like adults. This is an easy one. The only real \nchallenge in this debate is coaxing the President off the campaign \ntrail and up to the negotiating table to get him to choose results over \nrallies. We can solve the problems we face if only he will let us do \nit.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                   Staff Sergeant Gary L. Woods, Jr.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, with great sadness I wish to report \nto my colleagues today that our Nation and my home State of Kentucky \nhave lost a brave and valiant soldier who pledged his life to \nprotecting others. SSG Gary L. Woods, Jr., of Shepherdsville, KY, was \nkilled on April 10, 2009, in Mosul, Iraq, in a terrorist suicide bomber \nattack. He was 24 years old.\n  For his service to America, Staff Sergeant Woods received several \nmedals, awards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the \nPurple Heart, two Army Commendation Medals, three Army Achievement \nMedals, two Army Good Conduct Medals, the National Defense Service \nMedal, three Iraq Campaign Medals with Bronze Service Stars, the Global \nWar on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, two Noncommissioned Officers Professional Development \nRibbons, the Army Service Ribbon, and three Overseas Service Ribbons.\n  Staff Sergeant Woods, who went by Lee, was born on June 24, 1984, on \na Sunday. ``He had very light brown hair and beautiful blue eyes,'' \nremembers Lee's mother, Becky Johnson. ``He was my first-born child and \nmy only son.''\n  Lee grew up in Shepherdsville, where he attended Roby Elementary \nSchool, Bullitt Lick Middle School, and Bullitt Central High School, \nfrom which he graduated in 2002. In school he participated in Bullitt \nCounty's Gifted and Talented Program, and was a member of the academic \nteam in both middle school and high school.\n  Lee also loved music. He played the trumpet, baritone, and trombone \nin school and sang in the concert choir. He taught himself how to play \npiano at age 6. He played the guitar, too, and took a guitar with him \non two tours in Iraq to entertain his friends. Lee also played the \ndrums.\n  ``Before returning from his second tour he ordered a set of drums and \nhad them delivered to my house,'' Becky remembers. ``When he came home \non family leave, he had to set them up the minute he got there, and \nplayed them in my basement for a full week. I would give anything to \nhear him beat on those drums again!''\n  Lee also enjoyed drawing pictures, fishing, camping, and woodworking. \nHe was obviously a talented young man. But his mother will always \nremember music as one of his greatest loves.\n  During his sophomore year at high school, Lee joined Junior ROTC. It \nwas then that he first had the idea to one day join the service. In \nJanuary 2003, Lee told his mother that he had joined the Army.\n  Becky was surprised at first, but when Lee laid out his argument, she \ncould see that he had given the opportunity serious thought and was \nexcited about the future. ``I knew at that instant that my son had \nbecome one heck of a man,'' she says. ``He had listened to me all those \nyears after all. I couldn't say anything except, `I love you and I will \nalways support you 110 percent.' ''\n  Lee entered active service in February 2003, and did his basic \ntraining at Fort Knox, in my home State of Kentucky. He graduated as a \ntank armor crewman and deployed on his first of three missions to Iraq \nfrom August 2003 to March 2004. Lee's second Iraq deployment lasted \nfrom March 2005 to February 2006.\n  After his second deployment, Lee got a reassignment to the First \nBattalion, 67th Armor Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, based in Fort \nCarson, CO. He deployed for the third and final time to Iraq in \nSeptember 2008, and received a promotion to staff sergeant soon \nafterwards in December.\n  In January 2009, one of Lee's fellow soldiers and close friends, \nDarrell Hernandez, was killed, and Lee escorted his friend back home in \nFebruary. ``Soon after returning from this, he volunteered for a \nmission that would take his own life and the lives of four other U.S. \nsoldiers,'' Becky remembers.\n  That mission put Lee in a convoy of five vehicles that on April 10, \n2009, exited the gates of Forward Operating Base Marez in Mosul, Iraq. \nShortly after leaving the base, a dump truck sped towards the convoy. \nLee was driving the fifth and last vehicle.\n  Lee drove to put his gunner in position to fire on the dump truck. \nBut tragically, that dump truck detonated with 10,000 pounds of \nexplosives, killing Staff Sergeant Gary L. Woods, Jr., and four other \nAmerican soldiers.\n  ``The FBI says [that the dump truck's] destination was [the forward \noperating base at] Marez,'' says Lee's mother Becky. ``If in fact the \nFOB was the target, these five men saved the lives of thousands of \nsoldiers on the FOB.''\n  On the same day that Lee acted heroically to save his fellow soldiers \nat the cost of his own life, half a world away Becky Johnson heard the \nknock at the door that all military families dread.\n  ``Those men in the dress-green uniforms with the highly polished \nblack shoes came to my house,'' she remembers. ``Yes, I noticed their \nshoes, because that was all I could look at while they asked me if I \nwas Becky Johnson. I told them no as my husband stood behind me shaking \nhis head yes.''\n  We are thinking of Staff Sergeant Woods's loved ones as I recount his \nstory for my colleagues today, Mr. President, including his mother and \nstepfather, Becky and Pat Johnson; his father and stepmother, Gary and \nDebbie Woods; his sister, Britteny Lynn Woods; his two half-brothers, \nCourtney and Troy Woods; his half-sister, Heather Woods; his step-\nsister, Mandy Maraman; his two step-brothers, Newman and Corey Johnson; \nhis grandmother, Nancy Ratliff; and many other beloved family members \nand friends.\n  Staff Sergeant Woods's loss in the line of duty is tragic. However, \nas small a comfort as it may be, I am pleased to report that his family \nmay take some solace in the fact that a terrorist connected to the \nsuicide bombing that caused Lee's death was arrested in Edmonton, \nCanada, and Lee's family can look forward to the prosecution of this \nterrorist and justice for Lee.\n  Becky Johnson intends to attend the trial and speak in the sentencing \nphase. May she and her family have the strength they will surely need \nto endure this process, and may they find peace in its final outcome.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in saying to the family of \nStaff Sergeant Woods that our Nation is forever grateful to them and \nrecognizes the great cost they have paid. This Nation will never forget \nthe heroism of SSG Gary L. Woods, Jr., or his great service and \nsacrifice.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Honoring Meadow Bridge High School\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the importance of \nteaching our young people to embrace their right--and responsibility--\nto participate in our democratic election process and to highlight a \nWest Virginia high school that has an outstanding record for going the \nextra mile to encourage their students to register and vote.\n  As Americans, there is no greater freedom or responsibility than our \nright to vote. Our country was born because brave men and women fought \ntirelessly and endured countless hardships to win their voting rights. \nIn fact, even young people had to fight for this right. It was West \nVirginia's own Senator Jennings Randolph, who was elected to serve with \nour beloved Robert C. Byrd, who relentlessly advocated for the 26th \namendment to the Constitution so Americans could vote starting at age \n18. In 1971, the measure finally passed. What few people know is he \nworked on that for over 20 years.\n  Senator Randolph believed, as I do, that every vote counts, and as \nimportant, I believe every voter has the right and responsibility to \ntake an active\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nrole in our electoral process. I tell young people all the time they \ncannot just sit on the sidelines and watch life happen; they have to \nget in the game and get active. Voting not only gives us the \nopportunity to have our voices heard but also to have a real impact on \nsetting the priorities for America's future.\n  As secretary of state from 2000 to 2004, in which position I was \nproud to serve in my great State of West Virginia, I made it a priority \nto educate young people all over West Virginia on the electoral process \nand to encourage them to get involved. At that time very few people \nknew that if someone was 17 years of age and would turn 18 years of age \nbefore the general election, they could still vote in a primary at 17. \nSo we educated them and we went around to every school. To make the \ngoal a reality, we established a program called Sharing History and \nReaching Every Student, or the acronym SHARES, a program which was \ntremendously successful. I am proud to say, during my tenure, we \nregistered 42,000 high school students to vote. Eleven years after the \nSHARES Program began, it is my privilege to stand on the Senate floor \nand recognize a school that is truly committed to carrying on this \ntradition and passing it down to each senior class and generation that \nhas come after them. I am so pleased they have joined me in the gallery \ntoday.\n  Every year for the past 11 years, the staff members at Fayette \nCounty's Meadow Bridge High School have registered 100 percent of their \nsenior class. Think about that, 100 percent. It is truly an incredible \naccomplishment. I am unaware of any other school in our great State or \nin the entire Nation that has registered every student in their senior \nclass for 11 years. This school and this year the class gathered \ntogether in the school's cafeteria so they could register at the same \ntime. This is not only a testament to the tradition established at \nMeadow Bridge High School but also to the students and their commitment \nto their community and their civic responsibility.\n  I congratulate the Meadow Bridge High School students, their faculty \nand staff, under the leadership of their principal Al Martine, for \ntheir commitment to our democracy. I also challenge every high school, \nnot just in West Virginia but in New York and every other State, to \nfollow their example--an unbelievable example. We must work together to \nengage our young people in national issues and encourage them to \nparticipate in the democratic process by getting our young adults \ninvolved. They are not children anymore. The world is growing up so \nfast around them, and we are preparing them to be active and passionate \nleaders for the future. They cannot stand on the sidelines and we as \nAmericans cannot afford to let them stand on the sidelines. We need \nthem in the game now. They can forge the future.\n  This is not a Democratic or Republican or Independent issue but one \nall Americans can and should embrace for the future of our great \nNation. We see so many divides in this great Capitol of ours with so \nmany of our colleagues. Everyone comes here for the right reason. The \nright reason truly is sitting in the gallery today and back home, the \nchildren and young adults who are going to make the difference and lead \nthe next generation.\n  I, for one, do not intend to turn over to this generation the keys to \na country in worse shape than when we received them. I do not want to \nbe the first person in our country's history to say we did not do a \nbetter job than the previous generation. We are going to work hard. But \nthe unbelievable commitment they made, the knowledge they have about \nthe importance of voting, shows me this next generation will take us to \na new level. I am proud that West Virginians all over our State, but \nmost importantly Meadow Bridge High School, are leading that example. I \nthank them and appreciate the effort they made in setting the example \nfor all.\n\n  I yield the floor and notice the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I rise to support S. 1925, the Violence Against Women \nAct. It is not every day that we vote on a law that actually saves \nlives, but this one does. The Senate needs to send the simple and \nimportant message that America will not tolerate violence against its \nwomen, children, and families. We must do our part to reduce domestic \nviolence and sexual assault. It is time for us to step up and make sure \nthis happens now.\n  I look forward to casting my vote for the reauthorization, hopefully \nvery soon. Truly this legislation, as we continue to move forward, is \nheaded in the right direction. There is bipartisan support with 61 \nMembers in this Chamber signed on as cosponsors, and lots of good work \non this bill has been done in the Judiciary Committee. All of us have \nheard from prosecutors, victim service providers, judges, health care \nprofessionals, and victims themselves.\n  Unfortunately, the fight to protect women and families from violence \nis far from over. The Violence Against Women Act was first passed just \n18 years ago. It has not been reauthorized since 2006. The law has made \na difference. We are making progress, and we know a great deal more \nabout domestic violence than when the law was first written. Services \nfor victims has improved. More communities provide safe shelters. \nLocal, State, and Federal laws are stronger.\n  Listen to the national statistics: Since the law was first passed in \n1994, the number of women killed by an intimate partner has dropped 30 \npercent, and annual rates of domestic violence against women have \ndecreased by two-thirds. The VAWA law saves lives and works. Yet there \nare too many awful stories and inexcusable numbers, especially in my \nhome State.\n  Alaska continues to have some of the worst statistics in the country. \nThree out of every four Alaskans have or know someone who has \nexperienced domestic or sexual violence. Child sexual assault in Alaska \nis almost six times the national average. Out of every 100 adult women \nin Alaska, nearly 60 have experienced intimate partner violence, sexual \nviolence, or both. The rape rate in Alaska is nearly 2\\1/2\\ times the \nnational average, and it is even worse for Alaska Native women.\n  In Alaska's rural and native communities, domestic violence and \nsexual assault is far too common. Our numbers are often far worse than \nthe rest of the country, and clearly we have to continue to do more \nwork in this area. We are insisting that Alaskan tribes retain their \ncurrent authority to issue civil protective orders, and I am working on \na separate bill to expand resources for Alaskan tribes in their fight \nagainst violence. So one can see why I am standing here today. We need \nto do something about this--not someday, not next year, but truly \ntoday.\n  I have been around for 3 years now, and I am not shy about having my \nsay in a good political fight. But in this case, on this issue, truly, \nI have no patience. It is hard to believe we even have to debate the \nlaw that protects people from abuse and sexual violence. It is truly a \npiece of legislation we should move forward on and vote. We need fewer \nvictims, whoever they are--women, kids, White, Black, American Indian, \nAlaska Natives, immigrants, lesbian and gay people, even men.\n  As a former mayor in a city and State with a higher rate of abuse \nthan the rest of the country, I know this issue. I was responsible for \nthe municipal department that prosecuted domestic violence cases. I was \nalso responsible for the police investigating these cases and the \nagencies providing health services to victims and funding to shelters. \nWith the support of the entire community, we pooled our efforts. Using \nresources from the State and local government and businesses and \nnonprofits alike, we improved services for victims of child sexual \nabuse.\n  But intervention and better treatment is not enough--far from it. \nDomestic and sexual violence is a public health epidemic. So what we \nneed is prevention, and this reauthorization effort is just that, the \nright step in eventually stopping this epidemic.\n  In Alaska the Violence Against Women Act dollars are used in our \nbiggest cities and our smallest villages.\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nFunding goes to every corner of the State, including the Emmonak \nWomen's Shelter in remote southwest Alaska, the Aleut community of St. \nPaul in the North Pacific Ocean, the AWARE Shelter in urban Juneau, and \nmany others throughout Alaska.\n  We asked the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault \nfor their stories and examples of how VAWA is helping real families. \nHere is just one. It is uncomfortable to hear, but it is why we need to \nact now.\n  A shelter in rural Alaska helped a young woman after she suffered a \ndomestic assault by the father of their 3-year-old child. When she had \nasked the father for money for food, he choked her and threw her to the \nground in front of the child. She reported this was the third such \ninstance of violence, and she could not live there anymore. She spent \ntime in a shelter recovering from her injuries and working to find safe \nhousing in her home village. She also attended DV education groups and \nreceived a referral for legal services to assist her with her custody \norder.\n  Months later the shelter program received a call from this quiet \nyoung woman. She and her child were safe and doing well. She read all \nthe books recommended to her by the shelter to understand the cycle of \ndomestic violence. She was looking for suggestions on more reading \nmaterial to continue her education on the topic. Now it is hoped that \nthe young woman will become a leader in her community so she can help \neducate others and work to end domestic violence in Alaska.\n  There are stories of rape and murder from all over the country. Need \nwe hear more? It is time to reauthorize VAWA.\n  Before I yield the floor, I have one more bit of business. I want to \nthank the shelter staff, the police, the court system employees, the \nadvocates and everyone else, who work so hard to protect women, \nchildren, and families across this country.\n  To the victims of domestic violence, there is truly hope. We will \nwork with them to break the cycle of violence and to bring an end and a \nchange in this area.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise to speak about an issue that \naffects everybody in my community. Although it is hard to imagine right \nnow, some of the people we serve fear for their own lives, not because \nof a terrorist attack or a natural disaster; they are afraid that \nsomebody who is supposed to love them or support them will hurt or even \nkill them. This is an upsetting issue, but one we need to face head on, \nand I am glad we are addressing it today.\n  Domestic violence and sexual assault are harsh realities. They know \nno class, race, or economic limitations. Although we have made good \nprogress curbing domestic and sexual violence over the past decade, we \nstill have a lot of work to do.\n  The legislation before us takes another step toward our goal of \nending domestic and sexual violence. It might not go far enough for \nsome, but it is progress, and I am proud to support it.\n  Over the years, the Violence Against Women Act has helped reduce the \nrates of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, \nbut the numbers are still stunning. This bill gives us an opportunity \nto help victims get out of a dangerous situation. We have an obligation \nto pass this reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Unfortunately, Montana is no different from the rest of the Nation. \nThere were almost 5,000 cases of domestic violence or sexual assault in \n2011, and 10 percent of them involve Montana's kids.\n  Federal funding is crucial for Montana shelters, crisis lines, mental \nhealth services, and victim advocates. The domestic and sexual violence \nprograms in Montana rely heavily on Violence Against Women Act funding \nto keep women and children safe and to administer the important \nprograms we have operating in Montana. It will also promote changes in \nthe culture of law enforcement, pushing governments and courts to treat \nviolence against women and children as a serious violation of criminal \nlaw and to hold the offenders accountable.\n  The Violence Against Women Act helped a constituent of mine in \nBillings rebuild her life after she was the victim of domestic \nviolence. Maria Martin was beaten by her boyfriend. He threatened to \nkill her and her three daughters. Her cries for help were answered by \nthe police who rescued her from a violent attack, but it is the \nprograms supported by the Violence Against Women Act that helped Maria \nrebuild her life.\n  The Violence Against Women Act provides funding to strengthen law \nenforcement, prosecution, and victim services. Each community has \nflexibility to use these funds in ways that respond to folks most in \nneed and take into account unique cultural and geographic factors. This \nis especially important for a rural State such as Montana.\n  I am proud of my work with the Judiciary Committee to ensure that the \nset-aside of funding for sexual assault services does not disadvantage \nservice providers in Montana who often offer many services in one \nplace. I wish to thank Chairman Leahy for his efforts to address this \nimportant issue.\n  For States and cities with specialized programs, this wasn't a big \nconcern. In Montana and other rural States, we have county and regional \nservice coalitions. That means funds must be flexible enough so that we \ncan serve everyone who walks in. If rural areas had to carve out funds \nfor each type of service, people wouldn't get what they need to regain \ntheir footing. The next closest facility might be 90 miles away. That \nis not a referral; it is not help; it is another obstacle for folks who \nare already facing a life-threatening situation.\n  Domestic violence crimes also take a heavy toll on those who survive \nthe violence. The vast majority of survivors report lingering effects \nsuch as posttraumatic stress disorder, a serious injury directly from \nthe abuse, missing school or work, higher frequencies of headaches, \nchronic pain, and poor physical and mental health.\n  And while domestic violence affects every community, every race, and \nevery rung of the economic ladder, the problem is even more severe in \nMontana's Indian country. In fact, violence against Native women and \nchildren is at an epidemic level. As Montana's only member of the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee, I have had several hearings on \ndomestic and sexual violence. American Indian women suffer from violent \ncrime at a rate 3\\1/2\\ times greater than the national average. Nearly \n40 percent of all Native American women will experience domestic \nviolence. One in three will be sexually assaulted in her lifetime. \nMurder is the third leading cause of death among Indian women.\n  In response to our hearing, I was proud to join Chairman Akaka and \nmany others on the committee in introducing the Stand Against Violence \nand Empower Native Women Act, or SAVE Native Women Act, which is now \nincluded in the bill before us today.\n  We owe it to the women and children of Montana to intervene--to \nprovide resources to those programs which are on the ground, and to \nproviders who are in the trenches. They offer safe havens, including \nsupport and educational services to help survivors of sexual or \ndomestic violence break free of the cycle of violence. They help \nchildren who have lived with violence understand and make sense of what \nhas happened so that they are less likely to get entangled in future \nabusive relationships. They help survivors gain the strength and the \nknow-how to advocate for themselves in the legal system and in their \nrelationships.\n  By passing this bill now, we will continue to make progress toward \nempowering communities to protect all citizens, particularly the most \nvulnerable--women and children. As I stated before, this is not just an \nopportunity; this is an obligation that we have to improve our \ncommunities, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Student Loan Interest Rates\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, next month students all over the United \nStates will begin graduating from college. There is a lot of pride in \nthat experience. Family and friends will gather and celebrate. These \nyoung graduates are going to be filled with hope and expectation, and \ngratitude to those who helped them reach this milestone in their lives. \nBut they are also going to be graduating with debt--in some cases \nmassive amounts of debt.\n  Ninety-six percent of for-profit college students will graduate with \na debt of $33,000. Fifteen percent of them--one out of six--will \ndefault on their loans within 2 years. There is now more than $1 \ntrillion in outstanding student loan debt. As I have mentioned on the \nSenate floor several times, a little over a year ago, for the first \ntime in history, student loan debt in America surpassed credit card \ndebt.\n  One of the reasons there has been such a huge influx is that college \ncosts continue to rise at unsustainable rates. Tuition fees at 4-year \nschools have rocketed up 300 percent from 1990 through 2011. Over the \nsame period, broad inflation was just 75 percent. Even health care \ncosts rose at half the rate of the cost of higher education.\n  The average for-profit college costs $30,900 a year in tuition and \nfees. Private nonprofit institutions are not too far behind. The \naverage tuition and fees run about $26,600. Schools with larger \nendowments charge even more--upwards of $50,000 to $57,000 in total \nfees. They use their endowment to give students large financial aid \npackages, which is admirable, but it has consequences. The elevated \nsticker price for these schools provides for-profit colleges the cover \nto raise their prices to similar levels.\n  Let me remind you, for-profit schools, for-profit colleges in America \nget up to and more than 90 percent of their revenue directly from the \nFederal Government. They are 10 percent away from being Federal \nagencies.\n  Students graduating this year have one advantage: If they took out \nFederal subsidized loans, their interest rate is low. In 2007, Congress \nset interest rates on subsidized Federal student loans for the last \nseveral years. Current graduates have low, affordable interest rates on \ntheir Federal loans, ranging from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, depending \non the year they took out the loan.\n  Graduates next year may not be so lucky. The interest rate goes up to \n6.8 percent for all unless Congress acts. That is because these \ninterest rates are set to double for 740 million students across the \ncountry on July 1 and will only be changed if Congress acts. That is \ngoing to affect 365,000-plus borrowers in my State of Illinois. Each \nborrower in Illinois will save $1,000-plus over the lifetime of their \nloan if current interest rates of 3.4 percent continue. Across the \nState, borrowers will save a total of $387,000.\n  Every week in my office we hear from students who would be directly \naffected by interest rate increases. One of them is George Jacobs, a \nconstituent of mine and a graduate of the International Academy of \nDesign and Technology in Chicago, a for-profit college owned by the \nCareer Education Corporation.\n  Every day of his life, George Jacobs regrets that he ever attended \nthis school. He is 29 years old. His current private student loan \nbalance has ballooned to $107,000. The original loan was $60,000. But \nwith a variable interest rate, George has been paying anywhere from 7 \npercent to 13.9 percent. Combine that with his Federal loan balance, \nand his total outstanding student loan debt is $142,000. George is not \neven 30 years old, and he already has the debt the size of some \npeople's mortgages on their homes. Unlike a lot of his peers who attend \nfor-profit colleges, George has a job in his field of study. His annual \nsalary is $45,000, but since his lender will not let him consolidate \nhis loans, his monthly payment is $1,364. Half of his income goes to \npay his loan.\n  Unfortunately, because of high interest rates, very little of his \npayment reduces the principal. He does not know when he will possibly \npay off this loan. When asked if he has tried to work out a plan with \nhis lender, he says: They won't talk to me. They just don't care.\n  George was the first in his immediate family to attend college. He \ndid not ask people for advice on financial matters. He trusted the \nschool. George was subjected to high-pressure sales that some for-\nprofit colleges use.\n  Reflecting on that experience now, George believes the school took \nadvantage of him. He believes the school's primary focus is to identify \npeople they can make money off of. George owes about $29,000 in Federal \nloans. With low interest rates, his monthly payment is $230 a month on \nthe Federal loans--an amount he says is not a real problem.\n  He is married, and although he and his wife own a car, he does not \nthink they will ever qualify for a mortgage. He is 29 years old.\n  George is not the only one affected by the private student loans. His \nparents are in their fifties. To help George, they cosigned his private \nstudent loans. They cannot refinance the mortgage on their home because \nof George's outstanding debt.\n  There was a story in the Washington Post about 2 weeks ago of a \nwoman--a grandmother--who now has her Social Security check garnished \nbecause she was kind enough to cosign her granddaughter's college loan. \nHer granddaughter has defaulted. Her grandmother is watching her Social \nSecurity check reduced.\n  Making college affordable should not be partisan. It affects \neverybody. Just this week, during a news conference in Pennsylvania, \nGov. Mitt Romney acknowledged the tough job market new graduates face \nand expressed support for keeping interest rates low. He said:\n\n       I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate \n     on student loans . . . . temporary relief on interest rates \n     for students . . . in part because of the extraordinarily \n     poor conditions in the job market.\n\n  Higher education is not a luxury anymore. It is part of the American \ndream that many of us bought into and invested in. An educated \nworkforce will make us a stronger nation. By 2018, 63 percent of jobs \nwill require postsecondary education. Keeping debt levels low and \nmanageable for college graduates is essential.\n  George Jacobs, like so many other students I have spoken about on \nthis floor, is going to spend the rest of his young adult life paying \nfor student loans. There has always been a lot of talk around here \nabout mortgage crises--and rightly so--but think about the 17- and 18- \nand 19-year-old students signing away their income for the next 30 \nyears before they can even dream of owning a home.\n  When we get back from the break in about 10 days, we are going to \nconsider legislation on making sure student loan interest rates are \nmanageable. There is more to this issue. We have to deal with the \nreality the President raised in his State of the Union Address. This \nspiraling cost of higher education is unsustainable and unfair--\nfundamentally unfair.\n  We say to the young people: Get educated for your future.\n  They follow our advice and walk into the student loan trap. \nUnfortunately, many for-profit schools are the worst offenders. These \nschools have enrollment that has grown 225 percent over the past 10 \nyears. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the enrollment \nof for-profit colleges in my State has grown 556 percent over the last \n10 years. They enrolled 1.2 million students in 2009. In the 2008 2009 \nacademic year, the GAO found for-profit colleges took in $24 billion in \ntitle IV aid; 4-year for-profit schools an average of $27,900 a year \nbefore aid, as compared to $16,900 for public 4-year universities.\n  The chief executives at most of the for-profit schools--parent \ncompanies--make many times more than their counterparts in nonprofit \nschools. Remember, 90 percent-plus of their revenue comes directly from \nthe Federal Government. These are not great entrepreneurs; these are \nfolks who have\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\nmanaged to tap into one of the most generous Federal subsidies in the \nlaw.\n  Five years ago, we gave them a break. In the bankruptcy bill, we said \nprivate for-profit schools will be the only private loans in America \nthat are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, which means you carry them to \nthe grave. So the for-profit schools give these private loans to \nstudents, and their parents sign up for them. When it is all said and \ndone, they end up saddled with this impossible debt for a lifetime. \nThat is not even to go to the question about whether they are receiving \nany kind of valuable education in the process.\n  For-profits, incidentally, spent 21 percent-plus of their expenses on \ninstruction--21 percent on instruction. It was 29.5 percent at public \ninstitutions, 32.7 percent at private nonprofit institutions.\n  USA Today reported that for-profits educate fewer than 10 percent of \nstudents, take in 25 percent of all Federal aid to education, and \naccount for 44 percent of defaults among borrowers. Remember those \nnumbers: 10, 25, and 44. They are taking in 10 percent of the students, \ntaking in 25 percent of all the Federal aid to education, and 44 \npercent of the defaults on student loans are attributable to these for-\nprofit schools.\n  According to the Project on Student Debt, 96 percent of for-profit \ncollege students graduate with some debt, compared to 72 percent of \nprivate nonprofit grads, 62 percent of public school grads. The Project \non Student Debt also reported that borrowers who graduated from for-\nprofit 4-year programs have an average debt of $33,000, compared to \n$27,600 at private nonprofits, $20,000 at public schools.\n  Last year, the Department of Education released a report showing that \nfor-profit schools have a student loan default rate overall of 15 \npercent, compared with 7.2 percent at public schools, 4.6 percent at \nprivate nonprofit schools. If I were to stand before you and talk about \nany other business in America, heavily subsidized by the Federal \nGovernment--beyond 90 percent of all the revenues they take in--that is \nluring students and their families into unmanageable debt, I would hope \nboth sides of the aisle would stand and say that is unacceptable. How \ncan we subsidize an operation that is causing such hardship on students \nand their families--a hardship they are going to carry for a lifetime.\n  George Jacobs, at age 29, is writing off the possibility of ever \nowning a home because he signed up at one of those for-profit schools \nin my State.\n  The Senate HELP Committee also discovered that out of $640 million in \npost-9/11 GI benefits, a bill we were all proud to vote for, out of the \n$640 million that flowed to for-profit schools in the last academic \nyear, $439 million went to the largest 15 publicly traded companies. \nFor-profit colleges are receiving $1 out of every $2 in military \ntuition assistance, according to the Department of Defense, and more \nthan 60 percent of education benefits available to military spouses go \nto for-profit schools.\n  This is significant. We capped Federal aid to for-profit schools at \n90 percent of their revenue, but we created an exception for the GI \nbill. So some of them are up to 95 percent Federal subsidy and still we \nhave these terrible results and terrible indebtedness.\n  Students at for-profit colleges have lower success rates than similar \nstudents in public and nonprofit colleges, including graduation rates, \nemployment outcomes, debt levels, and loan default rates. Yet the \nDepartment of Defense is paying more to for-profit schools for the GI \nbill than public and nonprofit institutions.\n  I wish to have printed in the Record, along with my remarks, an \narticle that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, April \n18. It tells the story of Jodi Romine, who between the ages of 18 and \n22 took out $74,000 in students loans. She attended Kent State \nUniversity, a public university in Ohio. It seemed like a good \ninvestment at the time. But now it is going to delay her career, her \nmarriage, and her decision to have children.\n  Ms. Romine's $900-a-month loan payments eats up 60 percent of the \npaycheck she earns as a bank teller in South Carolina, the best job she \ncould get after graduating from college.\n  Her fiance spends 40 percent of his paycheck on student loans. They \neach work more than 60 hours a week and volunteer where they can to \nhelp the local high school's football and basketball teams. Ms. Romine \nworks a second job as a waitress, making all her loan payments on time. \nShe cannot buy a house. They cannot visit their families in Ohio as \noften as they would like or spend money to even go out.\n  Plans to marry or have children are on hold, says Ms. Romine, ``I am \njust looking for some way to manage my finances.'' This is an \nindication of a debt crisis that is coming. It is different, I would \nagree, than the mortgage debt crisis we faced. Smaller in magnitude, \nperhaps, but no less insidious and no less of a problem for us when it \ncomes to the growth of our economy.\n  I have a couple bills pending. One of them goes to a very basic \nquestion: Should any college, public, private, profit, nonprofit, be \nallowed to lure a student into a private student loan when they are \nstill eligible for government loans? In other words, should that not be \none of the causes for a discharge in bankruptcy? It is fraud. It is \nfraud to say to that student: You have to take out this private student \nloan, even though the school knows that student is still eligible for \nlow-interest rate accommodating Federal loans. They are luring them \ninto a debt that is unnecessary and a debt which is crushing, in some \ncircumstances.\n  At the very minimum, that should be considered fraud in a bankruptcy \ncourt, and that debt should be dischargeable in bankruptcy because of \nthe failure of the school to disclose that the student still has \neligibility for a Federal loan.\n  Secondly, I know I am probably crying in the wilderness, but I still \nfind it inconceivable that the only private sector business loan in \nAmerica that is not dischargeable in bankruptcy goes to these heavily \nsubsidized for-profit schools. First, we lured them with Federal \nmoney--90 percent-plus--and then we turn around and say: And we will \nprotect you. When the student who is likely to default ends up \ndefaulting, we will make sure they still have the debt, carrying it to \nthe grave. What were we thinking to give this one business this kind of \nfantastic Federal subsidy and this kind of amazing support in the \nBankruptcy Code?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, along with \nthat article from the Wall Street Journal, a recent article from \nBarron's of April 16.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 17, 2012]\n\n           To Pay Off Loans, Grads Put Off Marriage, Children\n\n                         (By Sue Shellenbarger)\n\n       Between the ages of 18 and 22, Jodi Romine took out $74,000 \n     in student loans to help finance her business-management \n     degree at Kent State University in Ohio. What seemed like a \n     good investment will delay her career, her marriage and \n     decision to have children.\n       Ms. Romine's $900-a-month loan payments eat up 60% of the \n     paycheck she earns as a bank teller in Beaufort, S.C., the \n     best job she could get after graduating in 2008. Her fiance \n     Dean Hawkins, 31, spends 40% of his paycheck on student \n     loans. They each work more than 60 hours a week. He teaches \n     as well as coaches high-school baseball and football teams, \n     studies in a full-time master's degree program, and \n     moonlights weekends as a server at a restaurant. Ms. Romine, \n     now 26, also works a second job, as a waitress. She is making \n     all her loan payments on time.\n       They can't buy a house, visit their families in Ohio as \n     often as they would like or spend money on dates. Plans to \n     marry or have children are on hold, says Ms. Romine. ``I'm \n     just looking for some way to manage my finances.''\n       High school's Class of 2012 is getting ready for college, \n     with students in their late teens and early 20s facing one of \n     the biggest financial decisions they will ever make.\n       Total U.S. student-loan debt outstanding topped $1 trillion \n     last year, according to the federal Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau, and it continues to rise as current \n     students borrow more and past students fall behind on \n     payments. Moody's Investors Service says borrowers with \n     private student loans are defaulting or falling behind on \n     payments at twice prerecession rates.\n       Most students get little help from colleges in choosing \n     loans or calculating payments. Most pre-loan counseling for \n     government loans is done online, and many students pay only \n     fleeting attention to documents from private lenders. Many \n     borrowers ``are very confused, and don't have a good sense of \n     what they've taken on,'' says Deanne Loonin, an attorney for \n     the National Consumer Law Center in Boston and head of its \n     Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project.\n       More than half of student borrowers fail to max out \n     government loans before taking out\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\n     riskier private loans, according to research by the nonprofit \n     Project on Student Debt. In 2006, Barnard College, in New \n     York, started one-on-one counseling for students applying for \n     private loans. Students borrowing from private lenders \n     dropped 74% the next year, says Nanette DiLauro, director of \n     financial aid. In 2007, Mount Holyoke College started a \n     similar program, and half the students who received \n     counseling changed their borrowing plans, says Gail W. Holt, \n     a financial-services official at the Massachusetts school. \n     San Diego State University started counseling and tracking \n     student borrowers in 2010 and has seen private loans decline.\n       The implications last a lifetime. A recent survey by the \n     National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys says \n     members are seeing a big increase in people whose student \n     loans are forcing them to delay major purchases or starting \n     families.\n       Looking back, Ms. Romine wishes she had taken only ``a bare \n     minimum'' of student loans. She paid some of her costs during \n     college by working part time as a waitress. Now, she wishes \n     she had worked even more. Given a second chance, ``I would \n     never have touched a private loan--ever,'' she says.\n       Ms. Romine hopes to solve the problem by advancing her \n     career. At the bank where she works, a former supervisor says \n     she is a hard working, highly capable employee. ``Jodi is \n     doing the best she can,'' says Michael Matthews, a Beaufort, \n     S.C., bankruptcy attorney who is familiar with Ms. Romine's \n     situation. ``But she will be behind the eight-ball for \n     years.''\n       Private student loans often carry uncapped, variable \n     interest rates and aren't required to include flexible \n     repayment options. In contrast, government loans offer fixed \n     interest rates and flexible options, such as income-based \n     repayment and deferral for hardship or public service.\n       Steep increases in college costs are to blame for the \n     student-loan debt burden, and most student loans are now made \n     by the government, says Richard Hunt, president of the \n     Consumer Bankers Association, a private lenders' industry \n     group.\n       Many private lenders encourage students to plan ahead on \n     how to finance college, so ``your eyes are open on what it's \n     going to cost you and how you will manage that,'' says a \n     spokeswoman for Sallie Mae, a Reston, Va., student-loan \n     concern. Federal rules implemented in 2009 require lenders to \n     make a series of disclosures to borrowers, so that ``you are \n     made aware multiple times before the loan is disbursed'' of \n     various lending options, the spokeswoman says.\n       Both private and government loans, however, lack ``the most \n     fundamental protections we take for granted with every other \n     type of loan,'' says Alan Collinge, founder of \n     StudentLoanJustice.org, an advocacy group. When borrowers \n     default, collection agencies can hound them for life, because \n     unlike other kinds of debt, there is no statute of \n     limitations on collections. And while other kinds of debt can \n     be discharged in bankruptcy, student loans must still be paid \n     barring ``undue hardship,'' a legal test that most courts \n     have interpreted very narrowly.\n       Deferring payments to avoid default is costly, too. \n     Danielle Jokela of Chicago earned a two-year degree and \n     worked for a while to build savings before deciding to pursue \n     a dream by enrolling at age 25 at a private, for-profit \n     college in Chicago to study interior design. The college's \n     staff helped her fill out applications for $79,000 in \n     government and private loans. ``I had no clue'' about likely \n     future earnings or the size of future payments, which \n     ballooned by her 2008 graduation to more than $100,000 after \n     interest and fees.\n       She couldn't find a job as an interior designer and twice \n     had to ask lenders to defer payments for a few months.

Laing)\n\n\n At $1 trillion and climbing, the growing student-loan debt could be a \n             burden on economic growth for decades to come.\n\n       You don't need a Ph.D. in math to know that student-loan \n     debt is compounding at an alarming rate. In the last six \n     weeks alone, two new government reports have detailed the \n     growing student debt burden, which has no doubt contributed \n     to the weak economic recovery and could remain a drag on \n     growth for decades to come. First came a report early last \n     month from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York stating that \n     the $870 billion in loans carried by some 37 million present \n     and former students exceeded the money owed by all Americans \n     for auto loans, as of the Sept. 30 end of the government's \n     2011 fiscal year. It's also greater than credit-card debt. \n     The report went on to note that delinquencies, officially \n     reported at about 10% of outstanding loans, were actually \n     more than twice that number when things like loan-payment \n     deferrals for current full-time students were properly \n     accounted for.\n       But that was just prelude for a speech in late March, when \n     an official of the new federal watchdog agency, the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Bureau, asserted that total student debt \n     outstanding actually topped $1 trillion. The Fed, it seems, \n     failed to account for much of the interest that had been \n     capitalized, or added to outstanding loan balances on \n     delinquent and defaulted loans.\n       The cause of the binge is the unfortunate concatenation of \n     steeply rising tuitions in the face of stagnating family \n     incomes, a precipitous decline in states' funding of public \n     universities and two-year colleges, and the burgeoning of \n     avaricious for-profit colleges and universities--which rely \n     on federally guaranteed student loans for practically all of \n     their revenue, in exchange for dubious course offerings.\n       Ever-rising tuitions are the biggest part of the problem. \n     As the chart nearby shows, tuition and fees at four-year \n     schools rocketed up by 300% from 1990 through 2011. Over the \n     same period, broad inflation was just 75% and health-care \n     costs rose 150%.\n       However you apportion blame, it boils down to this: Two-\n     thirds of the college seniors who graduated in 2010 had \n     student loans averaging $25,250, according to estimates in a \n     survey by the Institute for College Access & Success, an \n     independent watchdog group. For students at for-profit \n     schools, average per-student debt is even greater for \n     training in such fields as cosmetology, massage therapy, and \n     criminal justice, as well as more traditional academic \n     subjects.\n       Whether you have kids in school or they've long since \n     graduated, this is a big deal. Graduates lugging huge debt \n     loads with few job opportunities to pay them off are \n     reluctant to buy cars, purchase homes, or start families. \n     Family formations, a key bulwark to home prices, have been in \n     a seemingly inexplicable funk over the past five years or so.\n       Prospects are even more harrowing for defaulters on student \n     debt. They are virtually excluded from the credit economy, \n     unable to get mortgages, take out auto loans, or even obtain \n     credit cards. ``We are creating a zombie generation of young \n     people, larded with debt, and, in many cases dropouts without \n     any diploma,'' says Mark Zandi, the chief economist at \n     Moody's Analytics.\n       Debt taken on by students pursuing professional degrees in \n     graduate schools is even more daunting. Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Ben Bernanke turned some heads in an aside during \n     congressional testimony last month when he said that his son, \n     who is in medical school, would probably accumulate total \n     debt of $400,000 before completing his studies. Law students, \n     even at non-elite law schools, often run up debt of as much \n     as $150,000 over the course of earning their degrees. This \n     even though top-paying law jobs at major corporate law firms \n     are shrinking, consigning many graduates to lives of relative \n     penury. Many are resorting to lawsuits against their schools, \n     charging, with some justification, that the schools gilded \n     the employment opportunities that awaited graduates.\n       It's not just students who are being crushed by student-\n     debt loads. Kenneth Lin, of the credit-rating Website Credit \n     Karma, found something astounding when he examined credit \n     reports on literally millions of households nationwide. \n     Student debt borrowing by the 34-to-49 age cohort has soared \n     by more than 40% over the past three years, faster than for \n     any other age group. He attributes this in large part to bad \n     economic times that prompted many to seek more training to \n     enhance their career prospects. This is also the age group \n     that the for-profit schools mercilessly mine with late-night \n     television ads, online advertising, and aggressive cold-\n     calling to entice with their wares.\n       Also, some folks in their 30s are obviously having trouble \n     paying off student loans taken out earlier in their lives \n     because of high unemployment rates and disappointing career \n     outcomes. According to the aforementioned Fed report, the 30-\n     to-39 age group owes more than any other age decile, with a \n     per-borrower debt load of $28,500. They're followed by \n     borrowers between the ages of 40 and 49, who had outstanding \n     balances of $26,000. This is what happens to folks when loans \n     go delinquent or fall into default (nine missed payments in a \n     row), as back interest is added to principal and collection \n     costs mount.\n       Parents, too, are getting caught up in the student-loan \n     debt explosion. Loans to parents to help finance their kids' \n     post-secondary education have jumped 75% since the 2005 06 \n     school year, to an estimated $100 billion in federally backed \n     loans; this according to data compiled by Mark Kantrowitz, \n     the publisher of the authoritative student-aid Website \n     FinAid.org. That's certainly a painful burden to bear for \n     baby boomers, who are fast approaching retirement bereft of \n     much of the home equity they'd been counting on to finance \n     their golden years.\n       To be sure, student loans aren't the debt bomb that many \n     doomsayers claim, poised to destroy the U.S. financial system \n     as the residential-mortgage-market collapse nearly did. \n     Moody's Mark Zandi ticks off a number of reasons why:\n       Student loans are just one-tenth the size of the home-\n     mortgage market. Subprime mortgages, including alt-A, option \n     ARMs (adjustable-rate mortgages), and other funky constructs, \n     were bundled into $2.5 trillion worth of securitizations at \n     their peak, ensuring that the damage wrought by their \n     collapse\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\n     spread far and wide, destroying the value of U.S. families' \n     biggest asset. The impact of these mortgage securitizations \n     was only amplified by huge bets made by financial \n     institutions like insurer American International Group \n     (ticker: AIG) on the home-mortgage market in the form of \n     credit-default swaps and the like.\n       Finally, and most important, the bulk of the student debt \n     outstanding, some $870 billion of the total, is guaranteed by \n     the federal government--and ultimately taxpayers. ``Thus, the \n     damage can be contained, at least until the next recession,'' \n     Zandi asserts. ``We should worry more about more subtle \n     things like how indebtedness is causing the U.S. to fall \n     behind some . . . emerging nations in the proportion of our \n     population with college degrees than about any direct \n     financial system fallout.''\n       The eventual bill to taxpayers on defaulted student loans \n     won't be overwhelming. That's because Uncle Sam has enough \n     collection powers to make a juice-loan collector envious and \n     most debtors cry, well, ``Uncle!'' Among other things, the \n     government can garnish the wages and glom onto income-tax \n     refunds or Social Security payments of defaulters. And \n     student debts are treated like criminal judgments, alimony \n     and the like when it comes to bankruptcy. They can be \n     discharged only under the rarest of circumstances, no matter \n     how fraught the deadbeats' financial circumstances have \n     become.\n       A recent story by Bloomberg's John Hechinger describes the \n     hard-nosed tactics used by collection agencies hired by the \n     Department of Education to go after the defaulters on $67 \n     billion in loans. The collectors, operating out of boiler \n     rooms, badger their marks with all manner of threats in \n     return for bonuses, gift cards, and trips to foreign resorts \n     if they pry at least nine months of payments above a certain \n     minimum out of the defaulters. No mention is made of more \n     lenient payment plans.\n       Such strategies apparently work, tawdry though they may be. \n     The government claims it collects around 85 cents on the \n     dollar of loan defaults. By contrast, credit-card companies \n     are lucky to collect 10 cents on the dollar from borrowers in \n     default.\n       Changes in repayment plans instituted in 2009 allow some \n     student-loan borrowers in extreme hardship to pay monthly on \n     the basis of what they can afford rather than what they owe. \n     Under this ``income-based repayment plan,'' after 25 years of \n     payments based on the borrower's discretionary income, the \n     remainder of the loan will be forgiven. Thanks to the Obama \n     administration, that number will soon be just 20 years.\n       Students going into public-service jobs like teaching can \n     receive a get-out-of-debtors'-prison card after 10 years of \n     income-based payments.\n       But these programs aren't likely to add much to the \n     taxpayer tab on student-loan defaults, since the \n     participation in the programs has been light (550,000 out of \n     37 million student borrowers), and the money collected is \n     better than nothing.\n       Nor are the major players in the private, nongovernment-\n     backed student-loan market, such as SLM, formerly known as \n     Sallie Mae (SLM), Discover Financial Services (DFS), Wells \n     Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC), likely to \n     suffer much from delinquencies or defaults. Their student-\n     loan balances, at around $130 billion, are relatively \n     manageable. They also were able to slip into 2005 legislation \n     a provision prohibiting student-loan borrowers from \n     discharging that debt in bankruptcy, mimicking the \n     government's leverage over defaulters.\n       The private student-loan industry has also tightened up its \n     underwriting standards since the financial crisis, demanding \n     higher FICO, or credit, scores from borrowers and parents to \n     co-sign most education loans. However, Fitch recently warned \n     that private student-loan asset-backed securities, especially \n     bundled before the recent recession with less stringent \n     standards, are expected to continue to suffer from ``high \n     defaults and ratings pressure.'' Little surprise then that \n     JPMorgan Chase (JPM) announced last week that it would stop \n     underwriting student loans as of July 1, except to customers \n     of the bank.\n       Despite all this, some observers blame the government for \n     the debt spiral--by making subsidized loans overly available \n     to students. Without easy federal Pell grants (up to $5,550 a \n     year for full-time students at four-year colleges) and \n     federal undergraduate loans, now capped at an aggregate of \n     $57,500, there would have been no spiral in college costs.\n       But this smacks of blaming the victims--students encumbered \n     by debt and taxpayers ultimately subsidizing and guaranteeing \n     the loans.\n       The perps clearly seem to be the so-called nonprofit \n     universities and colleges that have been gunning tuition and \n     fees ever higher since 1980, vastly in excess of consumer \n     inflation, health care, and nearly any other cost index one \n     can imagine.\n       Just take a look at the chart nearby, helpfully provided by \n     the College Board in its latest 2011 ``Trends in College \n     Pricing.'' Inflation-adjusted, private four-year college \n     tuition and fees have jumped 181% on a smooth but \n     relentlessly higher glide path. Public four-year college \n     tuitions have risen by an even larger 268%, although it's \n     clearly a case of catch-up. In-state tuition this year \n     averages only $8,244, compared with the privates' $28,500 \n     average tab. Student-debt outstanding, meanwhile, is growing \n     far faster, climbing ninefold since 1997.\n       The College Board and private colleges and universities \n     obdurately defend themselves, saying the ``sticker price'' in \n     no way represents the actual price paid by families after \n     taking into account federal and state grant aid, federal-tax \n     breaks to families paying for college, and, of course, \n     scholarship money provided by the schools themselves. In fact \n     on a ``net-price'' basis, private four-year tuition costs, at \n     $12,970, were slightly lower than in the academic year five \n     years ago, the report brags.\n       That assertion is true as far as it goes. But the lower net \n     price is not the result of the munificence of schools' \n     scholarship programs, but is almost solely due to large \n     increases made under President Obama in the size of Pell \n     grants and educational tax credits. Throw in room and board--\n     ``not really part of the cost of attending college,'' the \n     report says dismissively--and college costs are indeed higher \n     this year. Room and board--$8,887 on average for in-state \n     students at public schools in the current school year and \n     $10,089 at private colleges--have long been a means for \n     colleges to make stealth price increases.\n       Ivy League schools with total sticker prices including room \n     and board of $50,000 to $57,000 in the current academic year \n     use their large endowments to give out large dollops of \n     student aid. In fact, Yale and Harvard are said to offer \n     scholarship money or assistance to families with incomes up \n     to $180,000. As a result, students graduating from elite \n     schools like Princeton, Yale, and Williams College are able \n     to graduate with total debt under $10,000, making them among \n     the lowest-debt college and universities in the country.\n       But the Ivies can't be absolved of all blame in the current \n     debt mess. They began the sticker-price arms race in the \n     early 1980s, reasoning correctly, it turns out, that they \n     could boost prices with impunity because of the scarcity \n     value, social cachet and quality of the education they offer. \n     They've led the charge ever since, even getting caught by the \n     U.S. Justice Department for colluding on tuition increases \n     and grant offers to applicants in the early '90s. They signed \n     a consent decree neither admitting to nor denying the \n     charges.\n       Don't think that state governments--which have been \n     methodically cutting appropriations to higher public \n     education for the last decade--aren't aware of the still-\n     yawning gap between the sticker prices of state and private \n     schools, which means that tuitions are likely to continue to \n     rise at break-neck speed.\n       Too, elevated sticker prices by the privates have given \n     cover to for-profit schools, including University of Phoenix, \n     owned by Apollo Group (APOL), Bridgepoint Education (BPI), \n     ITT Educational Services (ESI), Washington Post's (WPO) \n     Kaplan University, and Career Education (CECO), a capacious \n     umbrella under which to nestle. The schools live off of Pell \n     grants, federally backed student loans, and, increasingly, \n     the GI bill for veterans. Thus, they derive as much as 90% or \n     more of their revenue from such government money, so they \n     concentrate their recruiting efforts on the less affluent in \n     order to qualify for such government largess. (For a look at \n     ITT Educational's practices, see ``Clever Is as Clever \n     Does.'')\n       The industry's course content is often risible, and \n     graduation rates horrible. Students naively hoping for a big \n     jump in earnings power end up saddled with debt averaging \n     about $33,000, with little to show for their efforts. \n     Students at for-profits make up about 10% of the post-\n     secondary-school population. Yet according to congressional \n     researchers on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions Committee, which has been investigating the for-\n     profit industry, they account for between 40% and 50% of all \n     student-loan defaults.\n       The student-debt crisis is emblematic of issues bedeviling \n     the U.S. as a whole, such as income inequality and declining \n     social mobility. For as scholarship money is increasingly \n     diverted from the needy to achievers with high grade-point \n     averages and test scores, boosting institutional rankings, \n     the perhaps less-privileged applicant is thrust into the \n     position of having to take on gobs of debt, indirectly \n     subsidizing the education of more affluent classmates. The \n     race to the career top is likely over long before graduation.\n       Student debt also helps sustain many school hierarchies \n     that are virtually bereft of cost controls--the high-salaried \n     tenured professorates, million-dollar-a-year presidents and \n     provosts, huge administrative bureaucracies, and lavish \n     physical plants.\n       The debt game will continue until students and their \n     families revolt or run out of additional borrowing capacity. \n     Don't expect the educational establishment to rein in its \n     spending. Things have been too cushy for too long.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. They identified those who were offering these private \nstudent loans. The major players in the private nongovernment-backed \nstudent loan market: SLM let me translate--formerly known as Sallie \nMae, Discover Financial Services, Wells Fargo, and PNC Financial \nServices. Even with the defaults, if there are defaults on these loans, \nthese loans are protected because they continue forever.\n  I do not know if my colleagues will join me in this, but all I ask \nthem to do is go home and please talk to some of\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nthe families in their States, and they will find this student loan \ncrisis is not just something manufactured by politicians; it is real, \nand we are complicit in it. When we allow low-performing and worthless \nschools to receive Federal aid to education, students and their \nfamilies are lured into believing these are real schools.\n  Go to the Internet and put in the words ``college'' or \n``university,'' click the mouse and watch what happens. You will be \ninundated with ads from for-profit schools. Some of them will tell you: \nGo to school online. One of them ran a television ad here in \nWashington--I think they have taken it off the air now--that showed \nthis lovely young girl who was in her bedroom in her pajamas with her \nlaptop computer on the bed. The purpose of the ad was: You can graduate \nfrom college at home in your pajamas. It is a ruse. It is a farce. It \nis a fraud.\n  Many times these schools offer nothing but debt for these students. \nThe students who drop out get the worst of the circumstances. They do \nnot even get the worthless diploma from the for-profit schools; all \nthey get is the debt. That is not fair. If we have a responsibility--\nand I think we do--to families across America, for goodness' sake, on a \nbipartisan basis, we should step up and deal with the student debt \ncrisis and the for-profit schools that are exploiting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would the Chair please let me know when there is 2 \nminutes left.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I will.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I am glad I had a chance to hear my \ndistinguished friend from Illinois speak about student loans and \ncollege costs. All of us would like to make it easier for Americans to \nbe able to afford college. At another time, I will speak about some of \nthe other options available. The average tuition at 4-year public \ncolleges in America is $8,200. The average tuition for a community \ncollege is $3,000.\n  I know at the University of Tennessee, where tuition is about $7,400, \nat a very good campus in Knoxville, virtually all the freshmen show up \nwith a $4,000 Hope Scholarship, which is a State scholarship. Of \ncourse, if they are lower income students, they are also eligible for \nPell grants and other federal aid.\n  So we will continue to work, on a bipartisan basis, to make college \nan opportunity available to students. If there are abuses in the for-\nprofit sector or other sectors of higher education, we should work on \nthose together.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do not want to change the Senator's line of thought. It \nwas beautiful and I want to hear every word. Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent that after the conclusion of the remarks of the \nSenator from Tennessee, that there will be 10 minutes given to the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, and that I have the remainder of \nthe Republican time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2366 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, week after week, I have come to the \nfloor to give a doctor's second opinion about the health care law. I \ntell my colleague from Tennessee that I should have him join me on a \nweekly basis in these second opinions, because he has clearly stated a \nnumber of things in this health care law that are hurting people. He \ntalked about his experience as a Governor and the impact of Medicaid \nmandates and how that impacted his ability to provide for education \nwithin a State.\n  Just now, with the bill he will introduce, I associate myself with \nhis remarks, because he showed that one of the tricks that was used in \npassing the health care law is overcharging. This is the Obama health \ncare law overcharging young people on student loans. The Democrats all \nvoted for it and the Republicans all voted against it. It is \novercharging students for student loans to pay for the President's \nhealth care law.\n  Again, I appreciate the comments by my colleague, the Senator from \nTennessee, and his incredible leadership on this, which he continues to \nprovide every day in the Senate.\n  I come to the floor today to again give a second opinion about \nanother component of the health care law and one of the tricks that the \nadministration has tried to use in terms of making the health care law, \nin their opinion, more appealing, which essentially the Government \nAccountability Office this week called foul.\n  The President was caught and called out by the GAO, when they \nuncovered another gimmick in the President's health care law. It is a \ngimmick that tries to cover up how the President's law devastates \nseniors' ability to get the care they need from the doctor they want at \na cost they can afford.\n  The Obama administration's latest trick targets seniors on a program \ncalled Medicare Advantage. It is a program that one out of four \nseniors--people on Medicare--relies on for their health care coverage. \nAs someone who has taken care of lots of Medicare patients over the \nyears, I can tell you that one in four--about 12 million seniors--is on \nthis Medicare Advantage Program. The reason it is an advantage for them \nis that it helps with preventive medicine, with coordinating their \ncare. They like it because of eyeglasses and eye care and because of \nhearing aids.\n  Each one of those 12 million seniors knows they are on Medicare \nAdvantage because it is a choice they make to go onto the program. \nWell, as people all around the country remember, the White House and \nDemocrats, in the effort to pass the health care law, cut $500 billion \nfrom Medicare--not to strengthen Medicare or save Medicare for our \nseniors, no--to start a whole new government program for other people. \nOut of that $500 billion that the President and his administration and \nDemocrats in Congress cut from Medicare, about $145 billion of that \nmoney came from this Medicare Advantage Program--a program people \nlike. These cuts would have gone into place this year--actually, \nOctober of this year. That is the time of year when seniors are \nsupposed to register for their Medicare Advantage plans for the next \nyear. So we are talking about October of 2012, the month before the \nPresidential election, and cuts coming then would make those millions \nof American seniors who have chosen Medicare Advantage very unhappy \nwith this administration and the Democrats in Congress who shoved this \ndown the throats of the American people.\n\n  In spite of the American people saying, no, don't pass this health \ncare law, according to the President and the Democrats, too bad, we \nknow what is better for you. Democrats believe that a one-size-fits-all \nis best, that a government-centered program is better than a patient-\ncentered program.\n  The President and his folks saw this political problem developing. It \nis a real political problem for the President. And what did the \nadministration do? Well, they put in place a massive $8.3 billion--that \nis billion with a ``b''--so-called pilot program. What that will do is \ntemporarily reverse most of these Medicare Advantage cuts--not for too \nlong, just to get the President and the Democrats past the election of \n2012.\n  According to the GAO, 90 percent of the Medicare Advantage enrollees \nwill be covered by these contracts eligible for this so-called bonus in \n2012 and 2013. But this is a sham program. It is seven times larger \nthan any similar demonstration program Medicare has ever attempted, and \nMedicare has been in place now for 50 years. Take a look at this. This \nis the largest ever--seven times larger than any demonstration program \nthey have ever attempted. Even the GAO, which is supposed to be--and \nis--nonpartisan, called out the President and the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services.\n  This program wasn't actually designed to improve the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. That is why this is a\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nsham. The reality is this so-called bonus program is a political stunt \naimed at the 2012 Presidential election. The administration simply did \nnot want to face America's seniors with the truth--the truth that his \nhealth care law gutted the popular Medicare Advantage Program, reducing \nchoices and raising premiums.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial board reported yesterday that ``the \ndemonstration program turns into a pumpkin in 2013.''\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The real game here is purely political--to give a program \n     that is popular with seniors a temporary reprieve past \n     Election Day. Then if Mr. Obama is reelected, he will go \n     ahead and gut Medicare Advantage.\n\n  That has been his intention all along--to gut Medicare Advantage.\n  Investor's Business Daily yesterday described it as ``playing \npolitics with Medicare.'' They go on to report:\n\n       The entire project is so transparently political that the \n     normally reserved GAO urged the Health and Human Services \n     Department to cancel it altogether.\n\n  Isn't this the administration that claimed that accountability was \ntheir goal, that this was going to be the most accountable \nadministration in history? Then why is the government's own \naccountability office calling the President and the Democrats on the \ncarpet and saying: Cancel this program altogether.\n  An op-ed that appeared in Forbes Magazine called it the ``Obama \nCampaign's $8 Billion Taxpayer-Funded Medicare Slush Fund.'' The author \nnotes:\n\n       This development opens up a new expansion of executive-\n     branch power: the ability to spend billions of dollars on \n     politically-favored constituents, without the consent of \n     Congress.\n\n  Madam President, we wouldn't have known about the Obama \nadministration's $8 billion coverup if it weren't for my colleague, \nSenator Orrin Hatch, who insisted on the GAO investigation. I believe \nthe American people owe a debt of thanks to Senator Hatch. Thanks to \nhis leadership, we now know what the administration is doing to try to \ntrick American seniors and make it harder for them to get the care they \nneed after the Presidential election.\n  Once again, this administration claims to be for transparency, claims \nto pride itself on accountability, but is not leveling with the \nAmerican people. So today I am calling on the President to direct his \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to cancel this waste of taxpayer \ndollars that are being used to cover up the damage his health care law \nis doing to the seniors of this country who are on Medicare Advantage. \nIt is time they cancel the program and come clean about their plan for \nseniors on Medicare Advantage. This latest gimmick is just another \nreason we must repeal the President's health care law and replace it \nwith patient-centered reform.\n  So I will continue to come to the floor every week because we can \nnever forget Nancy Pelosi's quote that ``first you have to pass it \nbefore you get to find out what's in it.'' Week after week, we are \nfinding out more things in this health care law. And now, under the \ndirection and suspicion of Senator Hatch, we have the Government \nAccountability Office coming out and saying they found something new \nagain this week--an effort by this administration to hide from the \nAmerican people the real impact of the health care law and hide it \nbefore the election so the American people will not--the President \nhopes--go to the polls and vote the way, in my mind, they would have \nvoted had they seen the clear reality of all of the impacts of this \nhealth care law.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                       Domestic Energy Production\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, Madam President, let me say we are very \nfortunate to have the Senator from Wyoming, with his background, come \nand give us his second opinion. The ratings are very high on his second \nopinion, and I am very glad of that.\n  I am also very pleased we had the Senator from Tennessee talking \nabout the big issue of today. There is no one--having been the \nSecretary of Education in a previous administration--who is more \nqualified to talk about student loans than the Senator from Tennessee. \nSo I am very appreciative.\n  Ironically, we have talked about two subjects, and I am here to talk \nabout one totally unrelated that I think is equally critical--and I \nhave to be critical--of this administration. I am going to state \nsomething that hasn't been stated before. I am going to release \nsomething that hasn't been released before, and I think it is very \nsignificant that people really listen.\n  You know, this President has had a war on fossil fuels--and when we \ntalk about fossil fuels, we are talking about oil, gas, and coal--ever \nsince before he was in office. He is very clever because what he has \nattempted to do is to kill oil, gas, and coal when we had the huge \nsupply of it here and yet do it in a way that the American people won't \nbe aware over it. How many people in America, I ask the Chair, know \nwhat hydraulic fracturing is? I daresay more people know about it today \nthan knew about it a short while ago.\n\n  So today I wish to address for the first time ever the questionable \nactions recently taken by the Obama administration's Environmental \nProtection Agency to stop domestic energy production, particularly \ndoing so by using hydraulic fracturing.\n  Today I wish to draw attention to a little-known video from 2010 \nwhich shows a top EPA official, region 6 Administrator Al Armendairiz, \nusing the vivid metaphor of crucifixion to explain EPA's enforcement \ntactics over oil and gas producers.\n  This is a long quote, and I am going to ask everyone to bear with me \nbecause it is all a quote by Armendairiz. He is, as I said, the \nAdministrator of region 6, and he is instructing at this time people \nwho are working for them in what their behavior should be. So this is \nan actual quote I am going to use. It is a long quote. Bear with me.\n\n       I was in a meeting once and I gave an analogy to my staff \n     about my philosophy of enforcement, and I think it was \n     probably a little crude and maybe not appropriate for the \n     meeting but I'll go ahead and tell you what I said. It was \n     kind of like how the Romans used to conquer little villages \n     in the Mediterranean. They would go into a little Turkish \n     town somewhere, they'd find the first five guys they saw and \n     they would crucify them. And then you know that town was \n     really easy to manage for the next few years. And so you make \n     examples out of people who are in this case not compliant \n     with the law. Find people who are not compliant with the law, \n     and you hit them as hard as you can and you make examples out \n     of them, and there is a great deterrent effect there. And, \n     companies that are smart see that, they don't want to play \n     that game, and they decide at that point that it's time to \n     clean up. And, that won't happen unless you have somebody out \n     there making examples of people. So you go out, you look at \n     the industry, you find the people violating the law, you go \n     aggressively after them. And we do have some pretty effective \n     enforcement tools. Compliance can get very high, very, very \n     quickly. That's what these companies respond to, is both \n     their public image but also financial pressure. So you put \n     some financial pressure on a company, you get other people in \n     that industry to clean up very quickly. So, that's our \n     general philosophy.\n\n  Again, that is a quote from the EPA Administrator of region 6. He \nactually said: You know, it is kind of like the Romans, when they used \nto conquer little villages in the Mediterranean. They would go into a \nlittle Turkish town and find the first five guys they saw and crucify \nthem. That is how you get their attention.\n  I remember a few years ago a lumber company in my State of Oklahoma \ncalled me up and said: I am not sure what to do. The EPA is putting us \nout of business.\n  I said: What do you mean, putting you out of business?\n  This was a lumber company in Tulsa, OK--Mill Creek Lumber. The man \nwho was calling me was the president.\n  He said: We have been disposing of our used crankcase oil in the same \nlegal, licensed depository for 10 years now, and they have traced some \nof this oil to a Superfund site, and they say they are now going to \nfine me $5,000 a day for that violation. Now, that is what the letter \nsaid.\n  I said: Send the letter to me. That is a typical threat by the EPA to \ntry to make you voluntarily go out of business.\n  So he sent it to me, and sure enough that is what it said. Any \nconcerned reader would look at that and say: They are going to put us \nout of business. He said they could stay in business maybe another 30 \ndays and that would be the end.\n  Well, that was a threat. That is what they do to intimidate people. \nIt is not\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\nquite to the level of a crucifixion, but nonetheless times have changed \nand things have gotten worse over the past few years. So, yes, they \nhave the enforcement tools, and they are able to scare people, \nintimidate people. And these are the very people who are working and \nhiring people and doing what is necessary to run this machine we call \nAmerica.\n  So according to Administrator Armendairiz, EPA's general philosophy \nis to crucify and make examples of domestic energy producers so that \nother companies will fall in line with EPA's regulatory whims. His \ncomments give us a rare glimpse into the Obama administration's true \nagenda. No matter how much President Obama may pretend to be a friend \nof oil, gas, and coal, his green team constantly betrays the truth that \nthe Obama administration is fully engaged in an all-out war on \nhydraulic fracturing, thinking people won't know that if you kill \nhydraulic fracturing, you kill oil and gas production in America.\n  Not long after Armendairiz made his stunning admission, the EPA, \napparently, began to zero in on the first crucifixion victims. The \nAgency targeted U.S. natural gas producers in Pennsylvania, in Texas, \nand in Wyoming, and in all three of these cases, before these \ninvestigations were complete, EPA made headline-grabbing statements \neither insinuating or proclaiming that hydraulic fracturing was the \ncause of water contamination. But in each of these three cases, the \nEPA's comments were contrived, and despite their best efforts they have \nbeen unable to find any science to back up their accusations.\n  Of course, this administration has a propensity for making \nembarrassing announcements on days when they hope no one will notice. \nDuring the past 2-week recess, while Congress was out of town, the EPA \nreleased several late-Friday-night statements reversing their earlier \nassertions in these cases. Still, the problem is people are walking \naround believing these things are true.\n  The Agency hopes they can admit they were wrong quietly, but we are \nnot going to let that happen. We are not going to let them get away \nwith it. The American people deserve to know exactly why the EPA is \npushing ahead with such intensity to capture alarmist headlines, and \nthen, when no one is looking and when their investigation shows they \nwere wrong, quietly backing away from it.\n  The EPA, in Texas, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania, not only reversed their \nassertions but did so with a stunning lack of transparency, \nstrategically attempting to make these announcements as quietly as \npossible, at times they know Congress won't be looking. Let me quickly \nhighlight a few of these examples. In Parker County, TX, the Agency's \nmajor announcement--the withdrawal of their administrative order--was \nannounced at a time they knew Congress was adjourning for Easter \nrecess. In Dimock, PA, the EPA made two announcements, and the same \nthing happened there. In Pavillion, WY, the EPA announced their \nreversal as Congress was wrapping up that week.\n  So the same thing was happening. The EPA's general philosophy is to \ncrucify domestic energy producers. Let's look at the three of their \ncrucifixions.\n  Parker County, TX. I think this could be the most outrageous of all \nthe examples we will be talking about today. I will not have time to \nhit them all, but I will go back and make the complete statement I was \ngoing to make. Unfortunately, there isn't time to finish it now.\n  But what happened in Parker County, TX, took place in region 6, where \nmy State of Oklahoma is located. Despite Texas State regulators \nactively investigating the issue, EPA region 6 issued a December 7, \n2010, Emergency Administration Order, which determined--I use the word \n``determined'' because that is the word they used--determined that \nState and local authorities had not taken sufficient action and ordered \na company called Range Resources to provide clean drinking water to \naffected residents and begin taking steps to resolve the problem.\n  Along with this order, the EPA went on a publicity barrage in an \nattempt to publicize its premature and unjustified conclusions. The day \nof the order, EPA issued a press release in which it mentioned \nhydraulic fracturing--not once, not twice but four times--in trying to \ntie that to problems with groundwater contamination.\n  The Agency claimed they also had ``determined''--again, they used \nthat word--that natural gas drilling near the homes by Range Resources \nin Parker County, TX, had caused the contamination of at least two \nresidential drinking water wells.\n  Regional administrator Al Armendariz was quoted in a press story \nposted online, prior to him even notifying the State of Texas, that EPA \nwas making their order--and the e-mails have been obtained from the day \nthe order was released--showing him gleefully sharing information with \nrabid antifracking advocates--and this is a quote by this EPA regional \nadministrator: ``We're about to make a lot of news . . . time to Tivo \nchannel 8.'' He was rejoicing.\n  In subsequent interviews, Armendariz made comments specifically \nintending to incite fear and sway public opinion against hydraulic \nfracturing, citing multiple times a danger of fire or explosion. When \nState regulators were made aware of EPA's action, they made it clear \nthey felt the Agency was proceeding prematurely, to which Armendariz \nforwarded their reply calling it ``stunning.''\n  What was ``stunning,'' to quote Armendariz, were revelations about \nthe way in which the EPA acted in this particular case, which led me to \nsend a letter, at that time, to the EPA inspector general requesting \nhim to preserve all records of communication in connection with the \nemergency order issued by the EPA region 6 administrator.\n  Subsequent to the EPA's December 7, 2010, administrative order, on \nJanuary 18, 2011, EPA followed through on Regional Administrator \nArmendariz's promise to ``make examples of people'' and filed a \ncomplaint in Federal district court, requesting penalties against Range \nResources of $16,500 a day for each violation they alleged took place--\nfor each violation. I don't know how many violations there are. I think \nthere are three or four.\n  Again, this goes back to the same thing that happened in my State of \nOklahoma with the EPA trying to put a lumber company out of business by \nEPA, except this is a larger company so there are larger fines.\n  So $16,500 a day in order to align with Armendariz's pursuit of fines \nwhich ``can get very high very, very quickly.''\n  If these actions alone didn't create an appearance of impropriety and \ncall into serious question the ability of Regional Administrator \nArmendariz to conduct unbiased investigations and fairly enforce the \nlaw, just 7 months prior to the region's actions in Parker County, \nRegional Administrator Armendariz laid the groundwork of how he planned \nto reign over his region.\n  In a townhall meeting in Dish, TX, he ``gave an analogy'' of his \n``philosophy of enforcement.'' Again, we have already talked about that \nanalogy.\n  This is a quote I highlighted at the beginning of my speech:\n\n       It was kind of like the Romans used to conquer little \n     villages in the Mediterranean. They'd go into a little \n     Turkish town somewhere, they'd find the first five guys they \n     saw and they would crucify them. And then you know that town \n     was really easy to manage.\n\n  Let me go back and be clear about this. This is President Obama's \nappointed regional administrator for the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, \nNew Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma comparing his philosophy of enforcement \nover the oil and gas industries to Roman crucifixions, where they would \n``just grab the first five guys they saw'' in order to set the policy \nand to scare everybody else and crucify them.\n  Fast forward to late Friday afternoon, March 30 of this year, just a \nfew hours after Congress left town for the Easter recess. The Wall \nStreet Journal reported that:\n\n       EPA told a federal judge it withdrew an administrative \n     order that alleged Range Resources had polluted water wells \n     in a rural Texas county west of Fort Worth. Under an \n     agreement filed by U.S. district court in Dallas, the EPA \n     will also drop the lawsuit it filed in January 2011 against \n     Range, and Range will end its appeal of the administrative \n     order.\n\n  Listen to this. A few weeks prior to EPA's withdrawal, a judge also \nconcluded that one of the residents involved in the investigation \nworked\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\nwith environmental activists to create a ``deceptive video'' that was \n``calculated to alarm the public into believing the water was \nburning''--water that was the result of the hydraulic fracturing--when \nit appears the resident attached a hose to the water well's gas vent, \nnot the water, and of course lit it on fire.\n  I was on a TV show the other night by someone whom I will not mention \ntheir name--she happens to be one of my three favorite liberals--and \nshe mentioned: ``This water is so bad it is burning.'' That judge \nshowed what it was and of course made them cease from doing that.\n  Remember, this is only one of the three recent high-profile instances \nof backtracking on behalf of the Agency, after they have already scared \neverybody into thinking it is a serious problem.\n  Next we go into Wyoming--Pavillion, WY. Last December, EPA publicized \nand released nonpeer-reviewed draft findings which pointed to hydraulic \nfracturing as the cause of groundwater contamination. Again, the \nculprit is always hydraulic fracturing because we all know we can't get \nany large oil and gas out of tight formations without \nhydraulic fracturing.\n\n  Here again, the EPA stepped in over the actions of the State and made \na press announcement designed to capture headlines where definitive \nevidence linking the act of hydraulic fracturing to water contamination \nsimply didn't exist.\n  The announcement came in December, despite as late as November of \n2011 EPA regional administrator James Martin saying the results of the \nlast round of testing in Pavillion were not significantly different \nfrom the first two rounds of testing which showed no link between the \nhydraulic fracturing and contamination. That is three rounds of testing \nwhich showed no contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Yet only a few \nweeks later EPA announced the opposite.\n  In another reversal by the EPA in the past few weeks, the EPA stepped \nback and quietly agreed to take more water samples and postpone a peer \nreview of the findings, something the State of Wyoming had been \nrequesting for quite some time.\n  Again, the damage was done. They didn't do anything wrong. There was \nno water groundwater contamination at all. This is hydraulic \nfracturing.\n  As I have mentioned so many times before, I know a little bit about \nthis because the first hydraulic fracturing took place in my State of \nOklahoma in 1949. There has never been a documented case of groundwater \ncontamination as a result of it. Yet this administration is doing \neverything they can to destroy hydraulic fracturing.\n  Dimock, PA, is the third site of the EPA's recent backtracking of its \npublicized attempts to link hydraulic fracturing to groundwater \ncontamination. In this instance, the Pennsylvania Department of \nEnvironmental Protection had taken substantial action to and including \nworking out an agreement with an oil and gas company ensuring residents \nclean drinking water.\n  In line with the State's Department of Environmental Protection, on \nDecember 2, 2011, the EPA declared that water in Dimock was safe to \ndrink. Just over a month later, EPA reversed that position.\n  So they go back and forth. What do people remember? They remember \nthis process of hydraulic fracturing is the culprit and is creating \nserious environmental problems.\n  What is maybe more egregious was--to quote Pennsylvania DEP secretary \nMichael Krancer--EPA's ``rudimentary'' understanding of the facts and \nhistory of the region's water: Independent geologists and water \nconsultants such as Brian Oram have been puzzled by the Agency's \nrationale for their involvement in Dimock because the substances of \ngreatest concern by EPA are naturally occurring and commonly found in \nthis area of Pennsylvania. Yet EPA has chosen this area to attack \nbecause of the presence of hydraulic fracturing.\n  In other words, this has been going on for years, long before \nhydraulic fracturing.\n  By the way, I have to say they used to attack oil and gas, but it was \nalways out West in the Western States. The chair knows something about \nthat. This is different now because we have these huge reserves that \nare in places such as New York and Pennsylvania. All that time there \nhas not been hydraulic fracturing, but as soon as hydraulic fracturing \ncame in, they said this is the result of hydraulic fracturing when it \nhas been there all the time.\n  Of course, this is part of the strategy to try to convince Americans \nwe don't have the vast supply of natural resources we clearly have.\n  I was redeemed by this. I have seen saying all along that of all the \nuntruths this President has been saying, the one he says more than any \nother is that we only have 2 percent of the reserves of gas and oil and \nwe use 25 percent. It is not true. I don't want to use the ``L'' word. \nI don't want to get everybody mad, but it is just not true.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey revealed just a few days ago that \nPresident Obama's favorite talking point, that we only have 2 percent \nof the world's proven oil, is less than honest. The 2 percent the \nPresident quotes is proven reserves, but he ignores our recoverable \nreserves. This is coming from the USGS. Our recoverable reserves are \nsome of the largest in the world.\n  According to information gleaned from the USGS report, America has 26 \npercent of the world's recoverable conventional oil reserves. That \ndoesn't begin to include our enormous oil shale, tight oil and heavy \noil deposits. That is just a fraction of it. But that is 26 percent of \nthe world's recoverable oil.\n  Our problem is our politicians will not allow us--and particularly \nthe Obama administration--to drill on public lands and to be able to \ncapture that.\n  We also hold almost 30 percent of the world's technically recoverable \nconventional natural gas.\n  In other words, to put it in a way that I think is more \nunderstandable: Just from our own resources and at our own consumption \nlevel, we could run this country for 90 years on natural gas at our \ncurrent level of consumption and for 60 years on oil. That is what we \nhave. That is the answer to the problem. It is called supply and \ndemand. There is not a person listening now who would not remember back \nin the elementary school days that the supply and demand is real.\n  But we all know he remains fully committed to his cap-and-trade, \nglobal warming, green energy agenda--a plan that is to severely \nrestrict domestic development of natural gas, oil, and coal, to drive \nup the price of fossil fuels so their favorite forms of green energy \ncan compete. It is, quite simply, a war on affordable energy--and, at \nthat time, they weren't afraid to admit it.\n  Now they are backtracking a little bit--such as using hydraulic \nfracturing and not saying they are opposed to oil and gas.\n  Do you remember Steven Chu, the Secretary of Energy, President \nObama's man? He told the Wall Street Journal that ``[s]omehow we have \nto figure out a way to boost the price of gasoline to levels in \nEurope.''\n  We all know the infamous quote from President Obama. He said that, \nunder his cap-and-trade plan, ``electricity prices would necessarily \nskyrocket.''\n  The President himself has been on record supporting an increase in \ngas prices. Although, according to him, he would ``have preferred a \ngradual adjustment'' increasing the average family's pain at the pump. \nBut this isn't a plan that gets you reelected. So the gas prices have \nskyrocketed, and with the utter failure of Solyndra, President Obama's \ndream of green energy economy is in shambles. We can be sure we won't \nbe talking about this plan to raise energy costs until after the \nelection.\n  I would have to say the President's own Deputy Energy Secretary Dan \nPoneman last month made a statement, and I appreciate it, because he \nsaid we have a very strong belief that the laws of supply and demand \nare real.\n  They have been saying that the laws of supply and demand are not \nreal. Gary Becker--I quoted this the other day. He is a Nobel Prize-\nwinning economist, professor at the University of Chicago. He has said \n``supply and demand are the cause of the vast majority of large \nfluctuations in oil prices, and it is hard to believe that speculation \nhas played a major role in causing a large swing in oil prices.''\n  The President tried to say it is not supply and demand. We do not \nneed to\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\ndevelop our own resources to bring down the price of gas at the pumps. \nIt is speculation. Here is a Nobel Prize winner saying that just flat \nis not true.\n  The President's budget proposal this year alone--I want to get back \nto how he has made this attempt to tax oil and gas out of business. The \nPresident's budget proposal this year alone amounts to a $38.6 billion \ntax increase on oil and gas companies, which would hit my own State of \nOklahoma where 70,000 people are employed in oil and gas development \nespecially hard. His proposal specifically would either modify or \noutright cancel section 199--that is the manufacturers' tax deduction \nthat is something all other manufacturers would be able to enjoy--for \nthe intangible drilling costs, IDCs: percentage depreciation, tertiary \ninjections. All of these were in his budget--not just this year, not \njust last year, but every year since his budget 4 years ago--to try to \ntax the oil and gas companies out of business.\n  His actions have not slowed his rhetoric. In fact, President Obama \nhas become so desperate to run from his antifossil fuel record that he \nran all the way to Cushing, OK. That is my State. We have a major \nintersection of the pipeline down there. This President, in his attack \non fossil fuels, stopped the XL Pipeline that goes from Canada down \nthrough my State of Oklahoma. He came all the way to Oklahoma to say: I \nam in support of the pipeline that goes south out of Oklahoma into \nTexas.\n  Wait a minute, that is because he cannot stop it. He could only stop \nthe other one because it crossed the line from Canada to the United \nStates. So he came all the way to Oklahoma to say he was not going to \nstop something that he could not stop anyway.\n  President Obama is trying to take credit for the increase in oil and \ngas. I have to get this out because I think so many people do not \nunderstand this. The increase that is taking place in production is all \non private lands. It is not increasing on public lands. It is \ndecreasing on public lands, but on private lands he has no control. In \nthe report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, since \n2007, quoting now from the CRS:\n\n       About 96 percent of the [oil production] increase took \n     place on non-federal lands.\n\n  According to the Obama Energy Information Administration, total \nfossil fuel sales of production from Federal lands are down since \n2008--they are down, not up--and during a time of a natural gas boom \nthroughout the country. In other words we have gone through the biggest \nboom on private land, but he will not allow us to do it on public land, \nand that is where these tremendous reserves are. Gas sales from \nproduction on Federal lands are down 17 percent since 2008.\n  Finally, according to PFC Energy, which is a global consulting firm \nspecializing in the oil and gas industry, 93 percent of shale oil and \ngas wells in the United States are located on private and State lands, \nhardly the Federal Government triumph that the President falsely \nattempts to take credit for when you put all the pieces together.\n  President Obama's election strategy is clear: Say great things about \noil and gas, say great things about coal and the virtues of domestic \nenergy production, but under the surface try hard to manufacture \nsomething wrong with hydraulic fracturing. Remember, not 1 cubic foot \nof natural gas can be retrieved in tight shale formations without using \nhydraulic fracturing.\n  As I said before, that was started in my State of Oklahoma. We are \ngoing to make sure we are the truth squad that tells the truth about \nhow we can bring down the price of gas at the pump. It gets right back \nto supply and demand.\n  I am going to come back at a later date and give the long version of \nwhat I have just given in the last 45 minutes, but I see my friend from \nTennessee is here. So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Deficit Spending\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I \nactually learned a lot sitting here listening. I know energy production \nis very important to his State and, obviously, to our Nation. I know he \nhas a wealth of knowledge regarding this issue. I candidly enjoyed \nhearing his remarks, and I look forward to hearing the balance of them \nat another time.\n  I am going to be very brief. I came down here because I am distressed \nabout where we find ourselves. I want to thank the ranking member and \nthe chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee who is dealing with \npostal reform. I thank them for working through the committee process \nand actually bringing a bill to the floor in that manner, something we \ndo not do enough of around here. I thank them for allowing us to have \namendments, free-for-all, as it relates to matters pertinent to this \nbill. I thank them for their work. Personally, I would like to see a \nlot more reforms take place in the postal bill.\n  There is no question we are kicking the can down the road, and we are \ngoing to revisit this in another couple of years. Because of the way \nthe bill is designed, I don't think there is any question that is going \nto happen.\n  But I want to speak to the fact that the world, our Nation, and all \nof our citizens watched us last August as this country almost came to a \nhalt as we voted on a proposal to reduce the amount of deficit spending \nthat is taking place in our Nation at a time when the debt ceiling was \nbeing increased. There was a lot of drama around that. Both sides of \nthe aisle came together and established a discretionary cap on the \namount of money that we would spend in 2012 and 2013.\n  Again, the whole world and certainly most citizens in our Nation were \nglued to the television or reading newspaper accounts about what was \nhappening. In a bipartisan way, at a time when our Nation has \ntremendous deficits, we basically committed to pare down spending.\n  What is happening with this bill, and the same thing happened with \nthe highway bill that was just passed, is that people on both sides of \nthe aisle are saying: You know, the Postal Service is very popular. \nTherefore, what we are going to do is not worry about the budget caps \nwe have put in place.\n  It is hard for me to believe. I know there is a lot of accounting \naround the postal reform bill that is difficult for people to \ncomprehend. But what is happening with this bill, both the ranking and \nchair continue to talk about the fact that some money came from the \nPostal Service into the general fund and now is just being repaid. By \nthe way, I agree with that. But the problem is it still increases our \ndeficit by $11 billion, and it absolutely violates the agreement we put \nin place last August 2.\n\n  The responsible way for us to deal with this is say we understand \nthis is money that should go back to the Postal Service, but to live \nwithin the agreement we put in place we need to take $11 billion from \nsomeplace else.\n  What I fear is getting ready to happen today--and I know there was a \nbudget point of order placed against this bill. I supported that budget \npoint of order. The ranking and chair--whom, again, I respect \ntremendously--said let's go through this process and see if there are \nsome amendments that actually pare down the cost. That is not \nhappening. So what I fear is going to happen this afternoon is that in \nan overwhelmingly bipartisan way, Congress is going to say one more \ntime to the American people: You absolutely cannot trust us to deal \nwith your money because we are Western politicians--Western democracies \nare having the same problems in Europe--and basically the way we get \nreelected is we spend your money on things that you like without asking \nfor any repayment of any kind.\n  That is what has happened in this Nation for decades. That is what we \nare seeing play out right now in Europe. We are able to watch the movie \nof what is going to happen to this great Nation. We have politicians in \nthis Chamber who have agreed to what we are going to spend this year \nand already, because we have two popular bills, in a bipartisan way \npeople are saying: It doesn't matter what we agreed to. We do not care \nthat the biggest generational theft that has ever occurred in this \nNation is continuing. We are basically taking money from our children \nto keep us in elective office by not making tough choices.\n  I am afraid that is what is going to happen this afternoon on this \nbill. I am just coming down one more time to appeal to people on both \nsides of the aisle who are participating in this to say:\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\nLook, we made an agreement. We made this agreement just last August 2, \nwhere we said how much money we would spend, and we are violating it \nagain on this bill. What I would say is, if the Postal Service is so \npopular, let's take money from some other place that we do not consider \nto be the priority this is.\n  We do not do that. Instead, what we are doing is exactly what has \nhappened in Europe, what has happened here for a long time where we \nhave this deal, this arrangement between politicians of this body and \ncitizens where we continue to give them what they want, but we will not \nset priorities. We will not ask them to pay for it. And what is \nhappening is our country is on a downward spiral.\n  These young pages who are sitting in front of me are going to be \npaying for it. It is absolute generational theft. This afternoon we are \ngoing to take another step in that direction. I appeal to everyone: \nLook, if we want to pass this postal reform bill, let's cut $11 billion \nsome other place. That is what the States that we represent have to do. \nThat is what the cities that we come from have to do.\n  But we will not do that here. I am not talking about one side of the \naisle or the other. What I think is going to happen this afternoon is \nthat people on both sides of the aisle are going to break trust with \nthe American people, violate an agreement that we just put in place, \nand basically send a signal to the world that they absolutely cannot \ntrust the Senate to live within its means. We would rather do things to \nget ourselves reelected now than save this Nation for the longer term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nsupport for the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. \nSpecifically, I want to talk about how crucial the tribal provisions in \nthis bill are for Native American women. For the past 18 years, this \nhistoric legislation has helped protect women from domestic violence, \nfrom sexual assault, from stalking. It has strengthened the prosecution \nof these crimes and has provided critical support to the victims of \nthese crimes.\n  It has been a bipartisan effort. Democrats, Republicans, and law \nenforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, health professionals--all \nhave supported this Federal effort to protect women. Why? Because it \nhas worked.\n  Since its passage in 1994, domestic violence has decreased by over 50 \npercent. The victims of these crimes have been more willing to come \nforward knowing that they are not alone, knowing that they will get the \nsupport they need, knowing that crimes against women will not be \ntolerated.\n  Unfortunately, not all women have seen the benefits of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. That is why the tribal provisions in the \nreauthorization are so important. Native women are 2\\1/2\\ times more \nlikely than other U.S. women to be raped. One in three will be sexually \nassaulted in their lifetimes. It is estimated three out of five Native \nwomen will experience domestic violence in their lifetimes. Those \nnumbers are tragic. Those numbers tell a story of great human \nsuffering, of women in desperate situations, desperate for support, and \ntoo often we have failed to provide that support.\n\n  But the frequency of violence against Native women is only part of \nthe tragedy. To make matters worse, many of these crimes go \nunprosecuted and unpunished. Here is the problem: The tribes have no \nauthority to prosecute non-Indians for domestic violence crimes against \ntheir Native American spouses or partners within the boundaries of \ntheir own tribal lands. And yet over 50 percent of Native women are \nmarried to non-Indians; 76 percent of the overall population living on \ntribal lands is non-Indian. Instead, under existing law, these crimes \nfall exclusively under Federal jurisdiction. But Federal prosecutors \nhave limited resources. They may be located hours away from tribal \ncommunities. As a result, non-Indian perpetrators often go unpunished. \nThe cycle of violence continues and often escalates at the expense of \nNative American victims.\n  On some tribal lands the homicide rate for Native women is up to 10 \ntimes the national average. But this starts with small crimes, small \nacts of violence that may not rise to the attention of the Federal \nprosecutor. In 2006 and 2007, U.S. attorneys prosecuted only 45 \nmisdemeanor crimes on tribal lands.\n  For perspective, the Salt River Reservation in Arizona--which is a \nrelatively small reservation--reported more than 450 domestic violence \ncases in 2006 alone. Those numbers are appalling. Native women should \nnot be abandoned to a jurisdictional loophole. In effect, we have a \nprosecution-free zone.\n  The tribal provisions in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization \nAct provide a remedy. The bill allows tribal courts to prosecute non-\nIndians in a narrow set of cases that meet the following specific \nconditions: The crime must have occurred in Indian Country; it must be \na domestic violence or dating violence offense or a violation of a \nprotection order; and the non-Indian defendant must reside in Indian \nCountry, be employed in Indian Country, or be the spouse or intimate \npartner of a member of the prosecuting tribe.\n  This bill does not--and I emphasize does not--extend tribal \njurisdiction to include general crimes of violence by non-Indians or \ncrimes between two non-Indians or crimes between persons with no ties \nto the tribe. Nothing in this provision diminishes or alters the \njurisdiction of any Federal or State court.\n  I know some of my colleagues question if a tribal court can provide \nthe same protections to defendants that are guaranteed in a Federal or \nState court. The bill addresses this concern. It provides comprehensive \nprotections to all criminal defendants who are prosecuted in tribal \ncourts whether or not the defendant is a Native American. Defendants \nwould essentially have the same rights in tribal court as in State \ncourt. These include, among many others, right to counsel, to a speedy \ntrial, to due process, the right against unreasonable search and \nseizure, double jeopardy, and self-incrimination. In fact, a tribe that \ndoes not provide these protections cannot prosecute non-Indians under \nthis provision.\n  Some have also questioned whether Congress has the authority to \nexpand tribal criminal jurisdiction to cover non-Indians. This issue \nwas carefully considered in drafting the tribal jurisdiction provision. \nThe Indian Affairs and Judiciary Committees worked closely with the \nDepartment of Justice to ensure that the legislation is constitutional.\n  In fact, last week 50 prominent law professors sent a letter to the \nSenate and House Judiciary Committees expressing their ``full \nconfidence in the constitutionality of the legislation, and its \nnecessity to protect the safety of Native women.''\n  Their letter provides a detailed analysis of the jurisdictional \nprovision. It concludes that ``the expansion of tribal jurisdiction by \nCongress, as proposed in Section 904 of S. 1925, is constitutional.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to which I have referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Constitutionality of Tribal Government Provisions in VAWA \n                            Reauthorization\n\n                                                   April 21, 2012.\n     Sen. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Sen. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Rep. Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, House Judiciary Committee, Rayburn House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Rep. John Conyers, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: The signers of this \n     letter are all law professors, and we have reviewed Title IX \n     of S. 1925, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of \n     2012. We write in support of this legislation generally and \n     of Section 904, which deals with tribal criminal jurisdiction \n     over perpetrators of domestic violence, specifically. Our \n     understanding is that some opponents of these provisions have \n     raised questions regarding their constitutionality. We write \n     to express our full confidence in the constitutionality of \n     the legislation, and in its necessity to protect the safety \n     of Native women.\n       Violence against Native women has reached epidemic \n     proportions, and federal\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\n     laws force tribes to rely exclusively on far away federal--\n     and in some cases, state--government officials to investigate \n     and prosecute misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence \n     committed by non-Indians against Native women. As a result, \n     many cases go uninvestigated and criminals walk free to \n     continue their violence with no repercussions. Section 904 of \n     S. 1925 provides a constitutionally sound mechanism for \n     addressing this problem.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Concerns\n\n       Congress has the power to recognize the inherent \n     sovereignty of Indian tribal governments to prosecute non-\n     Indian perpetrators of domestic violence on reservations. \n     While it is true that the Supreme Court held in Oliphant v. \n     Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978), that tribal \n     governments did not have criminal jurisdiction over non-\n     Indians, that decision was rooted in common law, not the \n     Constitution, as the later Supreme Court decision in United \n     States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193 (2004), clearly indicates.\n       Since the Court's decision in Oliphant was not based on an \n     interpretation of the Constitution, Congress maintains the \n     authority to overrule the decision through legislation. The \n     Court in Oliphant said as much when it stated that tribal \n     governments do not have the authority to prosecute non-Indian \n     criminals ``except in a manner acceptable to Congress.'' 435 \n     U.S. at 204. More proof of Congress's authority to expand \n     tribal government jurisdiction lies in the more recent 2004 \n     Supreme Court decision in United States v. Lara, where the \n     Supreme Court upheld a Congressional recognition of the \n     inherent authority of tribal governments to prosecute \n     nonmember Indians.\n       In Lara, the Court analyzed the constitutionality of the \n     so-called ``Duro fix'' legislation. Congress passed the Duro \n     fix in 1991 after the Supreme Court decided Duro v. Reina, \n     495 U.S. 676 (1990), which held that a tribal court does not \n     have criminal jurisdiction over a nonmember Indian, under the \n     same reasoning as Oliphant. In response to this decision, \n     Congress passed an amendment to the Indian Civil Rights Act \n     recognizing the power of tribes to exercise criminal \n     jurisdiction within their reservations over all Indians, \n     including nonmembers. The ``Duro fix'' was upheld by the \n     Supreme Court in Lara. The first part of the Court's analysis \n     determined that in passing the Duro fix, Congress had \n     recognized the inherent powers of tribal governments, not \n     delegated federal powers. 541 U.S. at 193. The Court then \n     held that Congress did indeed have the authority to expand \n     tribal criminal jurisdiction. Id. at 200.\n       In Lara, the Court plainly held, based on several \n     considerations, that ``Congress does possess the \n     constitutional power to lift the restrictions on the tribes' \n     criminal jurisdiction.'' Id. The Court relied on Congress's \n     plenary power and a discussion of the pre-constitutional \n     (historical) relationship with tribes, focusing on foreign \n     policy and military relations. The Court in Lara held that \n     ``the Constitution's `plenary' grants of power'' authorize \n     Congress ``to enact legislation that both restricts and, in \n     turn, relaxes those restrictions on tribal sovereign \n     authority.'' Id. at 202. The Court noted that Congress has \n     consistently possessed the authority to determine the status \n     and powers of tribal governments and that this authority was \n     rooted in the Constitution. So the decision in Lara shows \n     clearly that the expansion of tribal jurisdiction by \n     Congress, as proposed in Section 904 of S. 1925, is \n     constitutional.\n       The Lara majority also recognized that the Duro fix was \n     limited legislation allowing for an impact only on tribes' \n     ability to control crimes on their own lands, and would not \n     undermine or alter the power of the states. The same is true \n     of Section 904, which does nothing to diminish state or \n     federal powers to prosecute.\n\n\n                          Due Process Concerns\n\n       It is important to note that Section 904 of S. 1925 does \n     not constitute a full restoration of all tribal criminal \n     jurisdiction--only that which qualifies as ``special domestic \n     violence criminal jurisdiction.'' So there must be an \n     established intimate-partner relationship to trigger the \n     jurisdiction. Moreover, no defendant in tribal court will be \n     denied Constitutional rights that would be afforded in state \n     or federal courts. Section 904 provides ample safeguards to \n     ensure that non-Indian defendants in domestic violence cases \n     receive all rights guaranteed by the United States \n     Constitution.\n\n\n                         A. Narrow Restoration\n\n       The scope of the restored jurisdiction is quite narrow. \n     First, the legislation only applies to crimes of domestic \n     violence and dating violence when the victim is an Indian and \n     the crime occurs in Indian country. Thus, it applies to a \n     narrow category of persons who have established a marriage or \n     intimate relationship of significant duration with a tribal \n     member. Second, for a non-Indian to be subject to tribal \n     court jurisdiction, the prosecuting tribe must be able to \n     prove that a defendant:\n       (1) Resides in the Indian country of the participating \n     tribe;\n       (2) Is employed in the Indian country of the participating \n     tribe; or\n       (3) Is a spouse or intimate partner of a member of the \n     participating tribe.\n       In other words, a defendant who has no ties to the tribal \n     community would not be subject to criminal prosecution in \n     tribal court. Federal courts have jurisdiction to review such \n     tribal jurisdiction determinations after exhaustion of tribal \n     remedies. Section 904 is specifically tailored to address the \n     victimization of Indian women by persons who have either \n     married a citizen of the tribe or are dating a citizen of the \n     tribe. This section is designed to ensure that persons who \n     live or work with tribal members are not ``above the law'' \n     when it comes to violent crime against their domestic \n     partners.\n\n\n                            B. Civil Rights\n\n       The Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA) already requires tribal \n     governments to provide all rights accorded to defendants in \n     state and federal court, including core rights such as the \n     Fourth Amendment right to be secure from unreasonable \n     searches and seizures, and the Fifth Amendment privilege \n     against self-incrimination. 25 U.S.C. 1301 1303. There is no \n     question that federal courts have authority to review tribal \n     court decisions which result in incarceration, and they have \n     the authority to review whether a defendant has been accorded \n     the rights required by ICRA. See Santa Clara Pueblo v. \n     Martinez, 436 U.S. 49 (1978).\n       Section 904 of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization \n     Act re-emphasizes and reinforces the protections afforded \n     under ICRA. It requires that tribal courts provide ``all \n     other rights'' that Congress finds necessary in order to \n     affirm the inherent power of a participating tribe. Tribal \n     governments are already providing the due-process provisions \n     in cases involving non-Indians in civil cases. Empirical \n     studies have demonstrated that tribal courts have been even-\n     handed and fair in dispensing justice when non-Indian \n     defendants appear in court in civil matters. Section 904 \n     provides ample protection for any non-Indian subject to the \n     special domestic violence prosecution. The special domestic \n     violence jurisdiction is conditioned on a requirement that \n     tribes maintain certain minimal guarantees of fairness.\n       The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act affirms the \n     right of habeas corpus to challenge detention by an Indian \n     tribe, and goes even further by requiring a federal court to \n     grant a stay preventing further detention by the tribe if \n     there is a substantial likelihood that the habeas petition \n     will be granted. The legislation does not raise the maximum \n     sentence that can be imposed by a tribal court, which is one \n     year (unless the tribal government has qualified to issue \n     sentences of up to three years per offense under the Tribal \n     Law and Order Act).\n       Thus, the legislation provides ample safeguards. Nothing in \n     the legislation suggests that a defendant in tribal court \n     will be subject to proceedings which are not consistent with \n     the United States Constitution. Indeed, the legislation \n     creates an even playing field for all perpetrators of \n     domestic violence in Indian country. No person who commits an \n     act of violence against an intimate partner will be above the \n     law.\n\n\n                       C. Political Participation\n\n       While some have criticized tribal jurisdiction over \n     nonmembers based on the inability of nonmembers to \n     participate in tribal political processes through the ballot \n     box, we note that such political participation has never been \n     considered a necessary precondition to the exercise of \n     criminal jurisdiction under the concept of due process of \n     law. A few examples illustrate that point. First, Indians \n     were subjected to federal jurisdiction under the Federal \n     Major Crimes Act of 1885, now codified as amended at 18 \n     U.S.C. 1153, almost 40 years before most of them were made \n     citizens or given the vote by the Citizenship Act of 1924. \n     Second, due process certainly does not prevent either the \n     federal government or the states from prosecuting either \n     documented or undocumented aliens for crimes committed within \n     the United States, despite the fact that neither can vote on \n     the laws to which they are subjected. Third, likewise, due \n     process of law does not preclude criminal prosecution of \n     corporations despite the fact that corporate or other \n     business organizations, which are considered separate legal \n     persons from their shareholders or other owners, also cannot \n     vote on the laws to which such business organizations are \n     subjected. In short, there simply is no widely applicable \n     due-process doctrine that makes political participation a \n     necessary precondition for the exercise of criminal \n     jurisdiction.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       In conclusion, the signers of this letter urge Congress to \n     enact the VAWA Reauthorization and fully include the tribal \n     jurisdictional provisions necessary for protecting the safety \n     of Native women. Public safety in Indian country is a primary \n     responsibility of Congress, the solution is narrowly tailored \n     to address significant concerns relating to domestic violence \n     in Indian country, and the legislation is unquestionably \n     constitutional and within the power of Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n       Kevin Washburn, Dean and Professor of Law, University of \n     New Mexico School of Law; Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean and \n     Distinguished Professor of Law, University of California \n     Irvine School of Law; Stacy Leeds, Dean and Professor of Law, \n     University of Arkansas School of Law; Carole E.

Mr. President, I respect my colleagues' \nconcerns about the tribal provisions of this bill, and I am willing to \nwork with any Senator who may have concerns about these provisions. \nNative American law can be daunting, but I want to stress how much \neffort, research, and consultation went into drafting the tribal \nprovisions in the Violence Against Women Act. Title 9 is taken almost \nentirely from S. 1763, the Stand Against Violence and Empower Native \nWomen Act, the SAVE Native Women Act. This bill was passed on a \nDepartment of Justice proposal submitted to Congress last July. That \nproposal was the product of extensive multiyear consultations with \ntribal leaders about public safety generally and violence against women \nspecifically. It builds on the foundation laid by the Tribal Law and \nOrder Act of 2010.\n  The SAVE Native Women Act was cleared by the Indian Affairs Committee \nin a unanimous voice vote. The Presiding Officer serves on that \ncommittee and knows that this is a committee--the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee--that works in a bipartisan way. This passed by a unanimous \nvoice vote through the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.\n  Shortly thereafter, its core provisions were again vetted and \nincorporated in the Judiciary Committee's Violence Against Women Act \nReauthorization as title 9. In short, the Safety for Indian Women title \nhas been vetted extensively and enjoys wide and bipartisan support. The \ntribal provisions in this bill are fundamentally about fairness and \nclarity and affording Native women the protections they deserve.\n  As a former Federal prosecutor and attorney general of a State with a \nlarge Native American population, I know firsthand how difficult the \njurisdictional maze can be for tribal communities. One result of this \nmaze is unchecked crime. Personnel and funding run thin, distance is a \nmajor prohibitive factor, and the violence goes unpunished. Title 9 \nwill create a local solution for a local problem by allowing tribes to \nprosecute the crime occurring in their own communities. They will be \nequipped to stop the escalation of domestic violence. Tribes have \nalready proven to be effective in combating crimes of domestic violence \ncommitted by Native Americans.\n  Let me reiterate this very important point: Without an act of \nCongress, tribes cannot prosecute a non-Indian even if he lives on the \nreservation, even if he is married to a tribal member. Without this act \nof Congress, tribes will continue to lack authority to protect the \nwomen who are members of their own tribes. With this bill, we can close \na dark and desperate loophole in criminal jurisdiction.\n  Beyond extending the jurisdiction of tribes within specific \nconstraints, the bill will also promote other efforts to protect Native \nwomen from an epidemic of domestic violence by increasing grants for \ntribal programs to address violence and for research on violence \nagainst Native women and also by allowing Federal prosecutors to seek \ntougher sentences for perpetrators who strangle or suffocate their \nspouses or partners.\n  All of these provisions are about justice. Right now Native women \ndon't get the justice they deserve, but these are strong women. They \nrightly demand to be heard. They have identified a desperate need and \nsupport logical and effective solutions. That is why Native women and \ntribal leaders across the Nation support the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act and the proposed tribal provisions. Let us work \nwith these women to create as many tools as possible for confronting \ndomestic violence.\n  There are far too many stories of desperation that illustrate why the \nprovisions protecting Native women are in this bill, and I want to \nshare one story now. This is the story of a young Native American woman \nmarried to a non-Indian. He began abusing her 2 days after their \nwedding. They lived on her reservation. In great danger, she filed for \nan order of protection as well as a divorce within the first year of \nmarriage. The brutality only increased. It ended with the woman's \nabuser going to her place of work--which was located on the \nreservation--and attempting to kill her with a gun. A coworker, trying \nto protect her, took the bullet. Before that awful day, this young \nwoman had nowhere to turn for help. She said:\n\n       After a year of abuse and more than 100 incidents of being \n     slapped, kicked, punched and living in horrific terror, I \n     left for good. During the year of marriage I lived in \n     constant fear of attack. I called many times for help, but no \n     one could help me.\n\n  The tribal police did not have jurisdiction over the daily abuse \nbecause the abuser was a non-Indian. The Federal Government had \njurisdiction but chose not to exercise it because the abuse was only \nmisdemeanor level prior to the attempted murder. The State did not have \njurisdiction because the abuse was on tribal land and the victim was \nNative American.\n  Her abuser, at one point after an incident of abuse, actually called \nthe county sheriff himself to prove that he was untouchable. The deputy \nsheriff came to the home on tribal land but left saying he did not have \njurisdiction. This is just one of the daily, even hourly, stories of \nabuse, stories that should outrage us all. These stories could end \nthrough local intervention and local authority that will only be made \npossible through an act of Congress. We have the opportunity to support \nsuch an act in the tribal provisions of VAWA.\n  I encourage my colleagues to fully support the tribal provisions in \nthis very important bill.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico.) Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, 42 days ago--that is more than 1,000 \nhours--42 days ago, 74 Senators from this Chamber voted to pass a badly \nneeded, long-term transportation bill. At that time, I joined many of \nmy colleagues from both sides of the aisle to call on the House to \nconsider the Senate's bill or a similar bipartisan bill that would \nprovide highway and transit programs with level funding for at least 2 \nyears.\n  While the House has not yet passed a long-term bill, I am pleased \nthat they voted to go to conference with the Senate. That means we are \none step closer to finally having legislation in place that would \nsupport nearly 2 million jobs--about 6,600 of those in New Hampshire--\nand a bill that would maintain current funding levels, which would \navoid an increase in both the deficit and gas taxes. I urge the House \nand the Speaker to immediately appoint conferees so we can continue \nmoving forward and finally pass a long-term transportation bill. We \ncannot wait any longer. Mr. President, 937 days have passed since our \nlast Federal Transportation bill expired. If you are counting, that is \n2 years, 6 months, and 27 days.\n  If the House does not join the Senate and support a reasonable \nbipartisan transportation bill that is paid for, States and towns will \nnot have the certainty they need from Washington to plan their projects \nand improve their transportation infrastructure.\n  According to numerous studies, deteriorating infrastructure--the \nhighways, the railroads, the transit systems, the bridges that knit our \neconomy together--cost businesses more than $100 billion a year in lost \nproductivity. That is because we are not making the investments we need \nto make. And this is no time to further stall programs that encourage \neconomic growth and create the climate for businesses to succeed.\n  In New Hampshire, we very directly experience the consequences of \nthis uncertainty. The main artery that runs north and south in New \nHampshire, Interstate 93, is congested. Currently, we have a project \nunderway that would reduce that congestion on our State's most \nimportant highway. It would create jobs. It would spur economic \ndevelopment.\n  Although this project has been underway for several years, the pace \nof the project has slowed dramatically because we do not have a \ntransportation bill in place. Businesses and developers along the I 93 \ncorridor cannot hire workers or invest for the future while the project \nremains uncertain.\n  We need to act now to unleash the economic growth this project and \ntransportation investments across the country will make possible. We \nknow that projects such as Interstate 93 produce good jobs. New \nHampshire's Department of Transportation said that work on just one \nsection of the highway--just one section, between exits 2 and 3--\ncreated 369 construction jobs. And all around the country we have \nprojects like Interstate 93 that are waiting on Congress to complete \nthis effort.\n  For every billion dollars we spend in infrastructure investment, it \ncreates 27,000 jobs. It should not be so hard to get this done. If \nBarbara Boxer and Jim Inhofe can agree on legislation, then the House \nought to be able to agree on legislation. Cities and businesses need \nthe certainty as we get to the new construction season. And the longer \nthe House waits to appoint conferees, the harder it will be for \nCongress to pass a long-term bill.\n  I urge the House to swiftly appoint representatives to negotiate with \nthe Senate so that we can come together and make the Federal \ninvestments necessary to get transportation projects moving and get \npeople back to work.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2683-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2683-S2697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    21ST CENTURY POSTAL SERVICE ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President and all of my colleagues here, this \namendment is the only one that will give us a chance to save, truly, \nthe American Postal Service. It is the only one. It is a 2-year \nprohibition against closing any of our post offices and postal \nservices.\n  A lot of good things have been done and a lot of amendments have been \nmade already that nibble around the edges. This is the only amendment \nthat basically says: For a 2-year period, you have to sit down and \nrestructure this. Now, $200 million is what they are talking about. I \ncan go in many different directions with this, but that is 1 day in \nAfghanistan.\n  This is what the little State of West Virginia will lose: 150 post \noffices.\n  They are saying: Well, we have a 1-year moratorium. We can \nrestructure this and show where the savings should be.\n  I have a lot of different ideas on where the savings can be, but I \ncan tell you right now that we can start with former Postmaster General \nPotter, who earned $501,000. That is more than the President of the \nUnited States. There are a lot of savings at the top end of this. But \nwe could save these.\n  If you take these lifelines away--and this is all that people have. \nThey get their medicine and they get everything they do and depend on \ntheir lifelines with these post offices. They have nothing else. Their \ntowns have just about gone away except for that connection. And I am \nasking basically for my colleagues to consider keeping these lifelines. \nLet us work and give us the 2-year period we need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, respectfully to my dear friend from \nWest Virginia, I am going to oppose this amendment, and let me put it \nin this context. The U.S. Postal Service is in trouble. It is losing \nabout $23 million or $24 million on the average every day, more than \n$13 billion in the last 2 years. It is not going to survive if the \nstatus quo prevails. It needs to change. This bill provides for change \nbut in a way that we think is balanced and reasonable. My friend from \nWest Virginia has introduced an amendment that would prohibit all \nchange for the next 2 years and therefore I think open the way for a \nkind of death spiral for the U.S. Postal Service.\n  There are many protections in our bill before a post office could be \nclosed, even more or just as many before a mail-processing facility \ncould be closed. We added more protections yesterday with the \nMcCaskill-Merkley and the Tester-Levin amendments, but they allow \nchange because without change this Postal Service of ours will die.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, next on the list is Senator Paul's \namendment No. 2026.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, at a time when America's infrastructure is \ncrumbling, at a time when the Postal Service is losing $4 billion a \nyear, does it make sense to send $2 billion to Egypt? Does it make \nsense to borrow money from China to send it to Egypt? At a time when \nAmerican citizens are being prosecuted in Egypt, at a time when \nAmerican citizens are having international warrants sworn out on their \narrests by Egypt, does it make sense to send $2 billion to Egypt?\n  Last week I met with a young prodemocracy worker from Egypt. She is \nafraid to return home. She is afraid she will never see her children \nagain. She is afraid of the cage they will put her in to prosecute her \nfor political crimes. She fears that the Egyptian freedom movement will \ndie in its infancy.\n  So I ask--for as long as prodemocracy workers are being prosecuted, \nAmerican and Egyptian--I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. \n2023 and that it be voted on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I object on the same grounds we discussed earlier in \nthis debate. It is irrelevant to the subject matter of the Postal \nService.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to not offer my \namendment No. 2026, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that State liaisons for States without a district \n           office are located within their respective States)\n\n       On page 48, line 2, after ``State.'' insert the following: \n     ``An employee designated under this subsection to represent \n     the needs of Postal Service customers in a State shall be \n     located in that State.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by my \ncolleague, Senator Udall, and would require State liaisons for States \nthat do not have district offices in them to be located within the \nStates they represent. This is a commonsense amendment. There are 10 \nStates that will not have district offices in them. As currently \ncontemplated, they are operated out of district offices in adjacent \nStates.\n  The substitute amendment would require the Postal Service to \ndesignate at least one employee to be a State liaison, and this \namendment I am offering says that person must be located within the \nState they represent.\n  I ask all my colleagues to support this. I don't see any basis for \nobjection to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is an excellent and thoughtful \namendment introduced by the Senator from New Mexico, and I am glad to \nsupport it.

Mr. President, at a time when we are asking post offices \nand people around our country to suffer the loss of their local post \noffice, I think the very least we can do is show we are willing to give \nup some of the post offices around here. We have seven post offices in \nthe Capitol. We have a post office in almost every building. I am \nasking that we have one on the House side and one on the Senate side. \nIf we are asking people to suffer the loss of their post offices in \ntheir States, I think the very least we can do is do without a few post \noffices here, and I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is a commonsense amendment. It would \nlimit the number of post offices in the Capitol Complex to one on each \nside--one in the House and one in the Senate. It does not affect the \nprocessing of mail out of the Capitol, and I believe we should accept \nthe amendment.\n  I urge that we accept the amendment by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2027) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, next on the list is Senator Cardin's \namendment No. 2040, which I understand he will withdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am going to withdraw the amendment. Let \nme point out that this amendment was offered in an effort to make sure \nwe can continue overnight delivery in most of our country by keeping \nopen processing centers that are necessary. The underlying substitute \nthat Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, Senator Carper, and Senator \nBrown brought forward accomplishes that goal. I don't believe this \namendment is necessary. For that reason, I will not offer the \namendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Maryland for \nmoving expeditiously. I hope it will continue.\n  Next is Senator Paul's amendment No. 2028.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2028\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment \nNo. 2028.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2028.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish a pilot program to test alternative methods for \n                    the delivery of postal services)\n\n     At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Any such use proposed by a person in a bid submitted \n     under paragraph (3)(C) shall, for purposes of the competitive \n     bidding process, be taken into account using the fair market \n     value of such use.\n       (5) Applications from communities with potential \n     closures.--When reviewing and granting applications, the \n     Postal Service shall give priority to applications from \n     communities identified for potential post office closures.\n       (d) Limitation on Applications.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided under paragraph (2), no \n     more than 250 applications may be approved for participation \n     in the pilot program under this section at any 1 time.\n       (2) Increased limitation.--If more than 250 applications \n     for participation in the pilot program are filed during the \n     90-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     no more than 500 applications may be approved for \n     participation in the pilot program under this section at any \n     1 time.\n       (e) Termination of Community Participation.--Subject to \n     such conditions as the Postal Service may by regulation \n     prescribe and the terms of any written agreement or contract \n     entered into in conformance with such regulations, the \n     participation of a community in the pilot program may be \n     terminated by the Postal Service or by the review board for \n     that community if the Postal Service or the review board \n     determines that the continued participation of the community \n     is not in the best interests of the public or the Government \n     of the United States.\n       (f) Evaluations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Postal Service shall evaluate the \n     operation of the pilot program within each community that \n     participates in the pilot program.\n       (2) Contents.--An evaluation under this subsection shall \n     include an examination, as applicable, of--\n       (A) the reliability of mail delivery (including the rate of \n     misdeliveries) in the community;\n       (B) the timeliness of mail delivery (including the time of \n     day that mail is delivered and the time elapsing from the \n     postmarking to delivery of mail) in the community;\n       (C) the volume of mail delivered in the community; and\n       (D) any cost savings or additional costs to the Postal \n     Service attributable to the use of alternative providers.\n       (3) Analysis of data.--Data included in any evaluation \n     under this subsection shall be analyzed--\n       (A) by community characteristics, time of year, and type of \n     postal service;\n       (B) by residential, business, and any other type of mail \n     user; and\n       (C) on any other basis as the Postal Service may determine.\n       (4) Submission of evaluations.--Not later than 90 days \n     after the date on which the pilot program terminates, the \n     Postal Service shall submit each evaluation under this \n     subsection and an overall evaluation of the pilot program to \n     the President and Congress.\n       (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect the obligation of the Postal Service to \n     continue providing universal service, in accordance with \n     otherwise applicable provisions of law, in all aspects not \n     otherwise provided for under this section.\n       (h) Regulations.--The Postal Service may prescribe any \n     regulations necessary to carry out this section.\n       (i) Termination.--\n       (1) Termination by the postal service.--The Postmaster \n     General may terminate the pilot program under this section \n     before the date described in paragraph (2)(A), if--\n       (A) the Postmaster General determines that continuation of \n     the pilot program is not in the best interests of the public \n     or the Government of the United States; and\n       (B) the Postal Regulatory Commission approves the \n     termination.\n       (2) Termination after 5 years.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided under subparagraph (B), \n     the authority to conduct the pilot program under this section \n     shall terminate 5 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Extensions.--\n       (i) In general.--The Postmaster General may extend the \n     authority to conduct the pilot program under this section, if \n     before the date that the authority to conduct the pilot \n     program would otherwise terminate, the Postmaster General \n     submits a notice of extension to Congress that includes--\n\n       (I) the term of the extension; and\n       (II) the reasons that the extension is in the best \n     interests of the public or the Government of the United \n     States.\n\n       (ii) Multiple extensions.--The Postmaster General may \n     provide for more than 1 extension under this subparagraph.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment would allow a pilot program \nfor local postal autonomy. One of the complaints I heard from \npostmasters when they came to talk to me about this bill is that they \nthink there is a lot of middle management in the Postal Service making \nunwise decisions, and if they were given more autonomy at the local \nlevel to make decisions about their post offices, they would have the \nability to have cost-saving measures to try to save the post office for \ntheir local community. I think this makes sense. I think we would have \nmore innovation and get some useful ideas from our local postmasters.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I respectfully oppose this amendment. \nThis would actually fracture the U.S. Postal Service as we have known \nit, as a national institution that maintains national standards, \nincluding the promise of universal service wherever one lives or does \nbusiness, by authorizing localities to break away. I think that in \ndoing so, it would jeopardize the foundation promise our Postal Service \nmade since the beginning of universal service. So I would oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this amendment establishes what is \nessentially a privatization pilot program for the alternative delivery \nof mail outside of the universal service mandate of the Postal Service. \nI believe it would create chaos by allowing for inconsistent delivery \nstandards across the country. It would cause cream skimming of \nprofitable delivery areas, and that would harm rural America.\n  I urge rejection of the amendment.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment doesn't change any of the \npostal mandates and, to tell my colleagues the truth, the system we \nhave now is not working very well. I think we do need some innovation, \nso I think it would be a good idea to vote for this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2028.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 35, nays 64, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 78 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--35\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kyl\n     Lee\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--64\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hoeven\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kirk\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the next amendment is Senator Carper's \namendment No. 2065.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 2065.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment has \nnot been proposed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Delaware.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2029, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, we go now to Senator Paul's amendment No. 2029.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n2029 with the modifications at the desk be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the \namendment, as modified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2029, as modified.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Postal Service to take into consideration the \n      impact of regulations when developing a profitability plan)\n\n       On page 136, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       (5) the impact of--\n       (A) regulations the Postmaster General was required by \n     Congress to promulgate; and\n       (B) congressional action required to facilitate the \n     profitability of the Postal Service;\n       On page 136, line 15, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(6)''.\n       On page 136, line 18, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(7)''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment would add a technical change \nto the profitability plan that is already required under the bill, and \nit would simply ask that when they do the profitability plan, they \nreport on whether Congress is helping or hurting. A lot of times we do \nthings that are well intentioned that may not work out. I think they \nneed to let us know more about whether Congress is helping or hurting \nthe process.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I support the amendment. The underlying \nbill requires the Postal Service to send us a detailed plan for \nattaining long-term financial solvency. This amendment would add \nseveral factors to the list of items that should be considered in the \nreport. I think it strengthens the bill, and I urge its adoption by \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I too support the amendment and urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non the adoption of the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2029), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2066.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To appropriately limit the compensation of executives of the \n                            Postal Service)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Limit on Maximum Compensation.--\n       (1) Number of executives.--Section 3686(c) of title 39, \n     United States Code, is amended in the first sentence by \n     striking ``12 officers'' and inserting ``6 officers''.\n       (2) Interim limitation.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     and notwithstanding section 3686(c) of title 39, United \n     States Code, as amended by this Act, for 2012, 2013, 2014, \n     and 2015, the total compensation of an officer or employee of \n     the Postal Service may not exceed the annual amount of basic \n     pay payable for level I of the Executive Schedule under \n     section 5312 of title 5.\n       (B) Performance based compensation relating to solvency \n     plan.--\n       (i) In general.--Any compensation relating to achieving the \n     goals established under the plan under section 401 shall not \n     apply toward the limit on compensation under subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (ii) Other limitations apply.--Nothing in this subparagraph \n     shall be construed to modify the limitation on compensation \n     under subsections (b) and (c) of section 3686 of title 39, \n     United States Code, as amended by this Act.\n       (b) Carry Over Compensation.--The Postal Service may not \n     pay compensation for service performed during a year (in this \n     subsection referred to as the ``base year'') in any \n     subsequent year if the total amount of compensation provided \n     relating to service during the base year would exceed the \n     amount specified under section 3686(c) of title 39, United \n     States Code, as amended by this Act, or subsection (a)(2), as \n     applicable.\n       (c) Benefits.--Section 1003 of title 39, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Limitations on Benefits.--For any fiscal year, an \n     officer or employee of the Postal Service who is in a \n     critical senior executive or equivalent position, as \n     designated under section 3686(c), may not receive fringe \n     benefits (within the meaning given that term under section \n     1005(f)) that are greater than the fringe benefits received \n     by supervisory and other managerial personnel who are not \n     subject to collective-bargaining agreements under chapter \n     12.''.\n       (d) Effective Date; Applicability.--This section and the \n     amendments made by this section shall--\n       (1) take effect on the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) apply to any contract entered or modified by the Postal \n     Service on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, some of our colleagues have raised \njustifiable concerns about the level of compensation that has gone to \nsome of the most senior officials at the U.S. Postal Service. The \ncompensation package for one previous leader of the Postal Service was \nin excess of $1 million. In a day and age when rank-and-file postal \nemployees are going to be asked to make some sacrifices as labor \nnegotiations go forward, I think it is important for us to remember the \nconcept of leadership by example.\n  This amendment makes sure that, frankly, deferred compensation \npackages of the kind I just described do not\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\noccur. We cut in half--from 12 to 6--the number of postal executives \nwho are able to receive compensation in excess of a Cabinet-level \nsalary, but to give the Board of Governors the ability to pay a fee for \ngood progress toward reducing the budget deficit at the Postal Service \nthrough pay above that up to about $270,000.\n  The last thing we say is, the idea that senior executives at the \nPostal Service do not have to pay anything for health care or do not \nhave to pay anything for their life insurance is wrong and that should \nend. We do that with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I support the amendment on executive \ncompensation. I believe it addresses this matter in a manner that \nPresident Bush 41 might have called prudent. I urge it be adopted by a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2066) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2039\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the next amendment is Senator Paul's \namendment No. 2039.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2039.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit employees of the United States Postal Service \n                from engaging in collective bargaining)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 107. PROHIBITION ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1206 of title 39 is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec.  1206. Prohibition on collective-bargaining agreements\n\n       ``The Postal Service may not enter into a collective-\n     bargaining agreement with any labor organization.''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--Chapter 12 of \n     title 39, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in section 1202--\n       (A) in the section heading, by striking ``Bargaining \n     units'' and inserting ``Employee organizations'';\n       (B) by striking the first sentence; and\n       (C) by striking ``The National Labor Relations Board shall \n     not include in any bargaining unit--'' and inserting ``An \n     organization of employees of the United States Postal Service \n     shall not include--'';\n       (2) in section 1203, by striking subsections (c), (d), and \n     (e);\n       (3) in section 1204(a), by striking ``shall be conducted \n     under the supervision of the National Labor Relations Board, \n     or persons designated by it, and'';\n       (4) in section 1205(a), by striking ``not subject to \n     collective-bargaining agreements'';\n       (5) by striking sections 1207, 1208, and 1209; and\n       (6) in the table of sections--\n       (A) by striking the item relating to section 1202 and \n     inserting the following:\n\n``1203.

Prohibition on collective-bargaining agreements.''.\n\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, let's be frank. The Postal Service is \nbankrupt and only dramatic action will fix the Postal Service. The \nproblem is labor costs. Eighty percent of the Postal Service's costs \nare labor. If we look at UPS, it is about 50 percent. If we look at \nFedEx, it is about 38 percent. Before we close one post office, before \nwe end Saturday mail, before we ask citizens to get poorer services for \nhigher prices, maybe we ought to look at the root of the problem.\n  Even FDR--the biggest of the big government advocates--said this \nabout collective bargaining:\n\n       All Government employees should realize that the process of \n     collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be \n     transplanted into the public service.\n\n  So agreeing with FDR, I hope my colleagues from across the aisle will \nagree with their patron saint FDR and will support this amendment that \nwould end collective bargaining.\n  In the interest of time, I will be happy to have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this amendment would strip from the \npostal workers the right to collectively bargain. This is an enormous \nchange in labor law. Postal workers have had the right to engage in \ncollective bargaining for more than 30 years. We did make changes in \nthis bill in the arbitration process. We made sure if a contract \ndispute goes to arbitration, the arbitrator has to consider the \nfinancial condition of the Postal Service. That will help bring balance \ninto the system. But there is no justification for completely removing \nthe right of workers to collectively bargain.\n  I urge we reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2039.\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 2042. This \nis really an amendment that maintains standards that we have had a \nright to expect and have expected for many generations; that is, the \nstandard of service that the Postal Service has come to be known for.\n  I call up amendment No. 2042.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Casey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2042.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To maintain current delivery time for market-dominant \n                               products)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MAINTENANCE OF DELIVERY SERVICE STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``2011 \n     market-dominant product service standards'' means the \n     expected delivery time for market-dominant products entered \n     into\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\n     the network of sectional center facilities that existed on \n     September 15, 2011, under part 121 of title 39, Code of \n     Federal Regulations (as in effect on March 14, 2010).\n       (2) Maintenance of delivery time.--Notwithstanding \n     subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 3691 of title 39, \n     United States Code, the Postal Service may not increase the \n     expected delivery time for market-dominant products, relative \n     to the 2011 market-dominant product service standards, \n     earlier than the date that is 4 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Postal facilities.--Section 404(f) of title 39, United \n     States Code, as added by this Act, is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (6)(C)--\n       (i) by striking ``3-year period'' and inserting ``4-year \n     period''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``section 201 of''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (7)--\n       (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``, including the \n     service standards established under section 201 of the 21st \n     Century Postal Service Act of 2012''; and\n       (ii) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``, including the \n     service standards established under section 201 of the 21st \n     Century Postal Service Act of 2012,''.\n       (2) Definition.--For purposes of section 206(a)(2), the \n     term ``continental United States'' means the 48 contiguous \n     States and the District of Columbia.\n       (3) Section 201.--Section 201 of this Act shall have no \n     force or effect.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, this is about the standard of service that \nwe have come to expect from the Postal Service for many generations. I \nrealize a lot of work has gone into this consensus that has developed. \nWe know we need to make changes to the Postal Service. But one thing we \nshould not change or downgrade or compromise or degrade in any way is \nthe standard of service.\n  I think what we should do is have a 4-year moratorium on the \nimplementation that would lead to changes because there will be a lot \nof changes made in the next couple of years upon enactment. What we \nshould not do, though, is move too quickly to change the standard of \nservice that people have had a right to rely upon.\n  I would ask for a ``yes'' vote on this amendment. I should note for \nthe record the cosponsors: Senators Brown of Ohio, Senator Sanders, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Leahy, Senator McCaskill, Senator Shaheen, \nSenator Merkley, and Senator Menendez.\n  I would ask for a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment by my \nfriend from Pennsylvania. Everybody acknowledges that the Postal \nService is in crisis, losing $23 million a day. Mail volume has dropped \n21 percent in the last 5 years. That means everybody--we simply cannot \nafford every mail processing facility that exists because there is not \nthat much mail anymore.\n  The Postal Service will only survive if we change it. Our bill allows \nfor orderly change. This amendment would basically maintain the status \nquo for 4 years. I think doing so is a kind of invitation to the Postal \nService to go into bankruptcy. Our country cannot afford that. So, \nrespectfully, I would oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to Casey amendment No. 2042.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in support of this amendment, offered on behalf of myself and \nmy colleagues, Senators Snowe, Stabenow, and Shaheen.\n  We are very concerned that the Postal Service has not looked \ncarefully enough at the impact some of its decisions might have on \nsmall businesses that rely on their operations. So all this amendment \nsays--and I understand there is no opposition, so we might be able to \ntake it by voice vote--is that included in the studies the Postal \nService is going to do to analyze their way forward, they must consider \nthe impact on small businesses they serve. As you know, in some areas, \nparticularly rural areas, this is an arm of the small business, and we \ncan't have that arm chopped off.\n  So that is the amendment. I don't believe there is any opposition, \nand if the managers would accept this by voice vote, we could save some \ntime.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Landrieu for proposing \nthis amendment. I support it enthusiastically. It will strengthen the \nprotections regarding the closing of processing facilities, and it \nrequires the Postal Service to take into account the impact of any \npotential closing or consolidation on small businesses.\n  This amendment reminds us how many people and how many businesses, \nincluding particularly small businesses, across America depend on the\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\nU.S. Postal Service and why it is so important for us to change it to \nsave it. So I thank my friend from Louisiana for proposing this \namendment.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2072) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Next is Senator DeMint's amendment No. 2046.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2046\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2046.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2046.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide protections for postal workers with respect to \n   their right not to subsidize union nonrepresentational activities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PAYCHECK PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--The section may be cites as the \n     ``Paycheck Protection Act''.\n       (b) Right Not To Subsidize Union Nonrepresentational \n     Activities.--Chapter 12 of title 39, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1210. RIGHT NOT TO SUBSIDIZE UNION NONREPRESENTATIONAL \n                   ACTIVITIES.\n\n       ``No Postal Service employee's labor organization dues, \n     fees, or assessments or other contributions shall be used or \n     contributed to any person, organization, or entity for any \n     purpose not directly germane to the labor organization's \n     collective bargaining or contract administration functions \n     unless the member, or nonmember required to make such \n     payments as a condition of employment, authorizes such \n     expenditure in writing, after a notice period of not less \n     than 35 days. An initial authorization provided by an \n     employee under the preceding sentence shall expire not later \n     than 1 year after the date on which such authorization is \n     signed by the employee. There shall be no automatic renewal \n     of an authorization under this section.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this amendment is the Paycheck Protection \nAct, and it protects the first amendment rights of postal workers by \nrequiring postal labor unions to obtain prior approval from their \nworkers before they spend their dues money on behalf of political \nparties, political candidates or other political advocacy.\n  Unions are the only organizations in many States that cannot only \nforce people to join but forcibly use their dues for political purposes \nwithout the permission of the members. Sixty percent of union members \nobject to their dues being spent for political purposes without their \npermission.\n  This amendment protects their right to have their dues used in the \nway they intend them to be used. So I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this freedom, this protection of constitutional rights. It is \nconsistent with the Supreme Court ruling in Communications Workers v. \nBeck.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. It is taking a \nbill that has the urgent purpose of saving the U.S. Postal Service--\nchanging it to save it--and bringing in a matter of internal labor \nunion business.\n  The fact is no postal employee is forced to join a union, but once \none does, the union leadership can guide the policy positions the union \nsupports through the democratic processes within the union. No postal \nemployee himself or herself is forced to involuntarily support the \nadvocacy or political activities of a union. That is their choice--\nwhether to join it. But once they do, their leadership has the right to \nparticipate in a political process.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to \nSenator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be given 30 \nseconds to explain her position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I urge support of Senator DeMint's amendment. It \nprotects the first amendment rights of postal workers by requiring that \nunions obtain prior approval from workers before spending their dues on \npolitical purposes.\n  I think this is probably the one and only amendment where I will \ndiverge with my chairman, but I do urge support of Senator DeMint's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mrs. McCaskill] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2030.\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I ask unanimous consent that further reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, April 17, 2012, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 2030, offered by the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, S. 89 makes significant changes to \nthe Federal Employees Compensation Act, FECA, which I support. The \nchanges seek to reduce overspending in the program. But this is an \namendment that will allow a couple of considerations that I think are \nimportant to include.\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\n  The amendment, along with other things, would improve upon the \ncurrent program by providing those injured while deployed in armed \nconflict additional time to file a claim for FECA benefits and to \nensure that deployed employees injured in a terrorist attack overseas \nwhile off-duty would receive the FECA benefits. It also creates an \nexemption for hardship if someone would be eligible for food stamps if \ntheir benefits are decreased even further.\n  These provisions are similar to the FECA reform legislation, H. Res. \n2465, that has already passed the House of Representatives, and I ask \nfor the consideration of the body of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first let me commend the Senator from \nMissouri for this amendment.\n  It does make a great deal of sense to have the hardship exemption and \nto give more time for individuals who are injured in war zones and \nlonger deadlines for the paperwork for those individuals who might have \ntrouble submitting the paperwork from a war zone. We are talking about \ncivilian employees who are deployed there. This amendment makes a great \ndeal of sense, and I urge that it be accepted by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2039) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2036\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, we will go to Senator Pryor's \namendment No. 2036.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask that we go to amendment No. 2036.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], for himself and Mr. \n     Begich, proposes an amendment numbered 2036.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to the \n    closing and consolidation of postal facilities and post offices)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Postal Service \n     should not close or consolidate any postal facility (as \n     defined in section 404(f) of title 39, United States Code, as \n     added by this Act) or post office before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, this, hopefully, will be a \nnoncontroversial amendment.\n  Basically, it is a sense of the Senate that the Postal Service should \nnot close any postal facilities or post offices until enactment of this \npostal reform bill.\n  So this is a sense of the Senate. The idea is we don't know exactly \nwhen the House is going to pass their bill, if they ever do. But we \nwill have a sense of the Senate on the record.\n  The Postal Service's self-imposed moratorium expires May 15. \nHopefully, this will give them time to extend this until a bill is \npassed. If this bill does pass--and I hope it does--this is a major \nreset for the Postal Service, and I hope much of the rationale for \nclosing these offices goes away with the passage of this bill.\n  Madam President, I would love to have a voice vote on this, if that \nis possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Arkansas. This \nis a good amendment, and I support it wholeheartedly and move its \nadoption by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2036) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2073, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We will now go to Senator Rockefeller's amendment No. \n2073.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I call up my amendment No. 2073, and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be modified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2073, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 16, strike line 8 and all that follows \n     through page 23, line 6, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 105. MEDICARE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR POSTAL SERVICE \n                   EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Educational Program.--The Postmaster General, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management and the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare \n     & Medicaid Services, shall develop an educational program for \n     Postal Service employees and annuitants who may be eligible \n     to enroll in the Medicare program for hospital insurance \n     benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.) (commonly known as ``Medicare \n     Part A'') and the Medicare program for supplementary medical \n     insurance benefits under part B of title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395j et seq.) (commonly known as \n     ``Medicare Part B''), the objective of which shall be to \n     educate employees and annuitants on how Medicare benefits \n     interact with and can supplement the benefits of the employee \n     or annuitant under the Federal Employees Health Benefit \n     Program.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed to authorize the Postal Service to require a Postal \n     Service employee or annuitant (as defined in subsection (c)) \n     to enroll in Medicare.\n       (c) Definition of Postal Service Employee or Annuitant.--In \n     this section, the term ``Postal Service employee or \n     annuitant'' means an individual who is--\n       (1) an employee of the Postal Service; or\n       (2) an annuitant covered under chapter 89 of title 5, \n     United States Code, whose Government contribution is paid by \n     the Postal Service under section 8906(g)(2) of such title.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, as modified, this amendment would \nsimply eliminate a very problematic provision in the underlying bill, \nprovision section 105, but it has a very bad effect, and this would \nclear that up. It would shift onto Medicare and raise premiums for \ncurrent postal workers and retirees in some cases by as much as 35 \npercent. There is more to it, but that is the bulk of it. So I would \nhope that it would be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Some questions were raised about parts of the bill relating to \naccessibility to Medicare by postal employees. I think there has been a \ngood meeting of the minds with this modification. I support the \namendment as modified and urge its adoption by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2073, as modified.\n  Amendment (No. 2073), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Before we get to Senator Rockefeller's second \namendment, Senator Coburn has asked me to withdraw amendment No. 2059 \non his behalf. I thank him for that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2074\n\n  We will now go to Senator Rockefeller's amendment No. 2074.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2074, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 2074 and \nask unanimous consent that it be modified with the changes that are at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the Postal Service Health Benefits Program).\n\n       On page 12, strike line 18 and all that follows through \n     page 16, line 7, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104. POSTAL SERVICE HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``covered employee'' means an officer or \n     employee of the Postal Service who is--\n       (A) represented by a bargaining representative recognized \n     under section 1203 of title 39, United States Code; or\n       (B) a member of the Postal Career Executive Service;\n       (2) the term ``Federal Employee Health Benefits Program'' \n     means the health benefits program under chapter 89 of title \n     5, United States Code;\n       (3) the term ``participants'' means--\n       (A) covered employees; and\n       (B) officers and employees of the Postal Service who are \n     not covered employees and who elect to participate in the \n     Postal Service Health Benefits Program; and\n       (4) the term ``Postal Service Health Benefits Program'' \n     means the health benefits program that may be agreed to under \n     subsection (b)(1).\n       (b) Collective Bargaining.--\n       (1) In general.--Consistent with section 1005(f) of title \n     39, United States Code, the Postal Service may negotiate \n     jointly with all bargaining representatives recognized under \n     section 1203 of title 39, United States Code, and enter into \n     a joint collective bargaining agreement with those bargaining \n     representatives to establish the Postal Service Health \n     Benefits Program that satisfies the conditions under \n     subsection (c).

Madam President, next on the list is Senator Schumer's \namendment No. 2050.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I call up my amendment No. 2050.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2050.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent further reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To maintain all current door delivery point services)\n\n       On page 48, strike line 3 and all that follows through the \n     end of the matter between lines 5 and 6 on page 52.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, there are more than 35 million \nhouseholds and businesses that receive door delivery in every State \nacross the country. As originally written, the postal reform bill would \nhave pushed the Postal Service to stop delivering mail to individual \ndoors and mailboxes. Instead, the Postal Service would install \napartment complex style group boxes, where all the mail for a given \nstreet or neighborhood would be delivered to the boxes that were \ngrouped together in one place. Rather than have mail delivered to their \nmailbox or door, homeowners could have been forced to travel further \nfrom their home simply to pick up the mail. My amendment simply \npreserves the same door delivery only for customers who already receive \nit. In other words, not for new complexes. But for existing houses, \nthey should keep the delivery the way it is.\n  What some people may not know is the Postal Service already has the \nauthority to eliminate door delivery, but the Postal Service has not \nmandated such a change because they know how unpopular it would be. By \nremoving the door delivery provisions from this bill we can ensure the \nPostal Service will continue to provide the door delivery service our \nconstituents expect and rely upon.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I urge the adoption of the amendment \nby voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2050) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move reconsideration and ask the \nmotion be laid on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2071, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Next will be Senator Tester, amendment No. 2032. \nSenator Tester is not on the floor right now. I know we were building \nup to Senator Warner's amendment as the last amendment, but this may \nnow be the second-to-last amendment. Next we will have Senator Warner \nNo. 2071.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask to call up amendment No. 2071. \nThere is an agreed-upon substitute text at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank Chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins for their \nhelp on this amendment. It is a simple amendment. One of the goals of \nthis process is to encourage retirement expected for 100,000 members of \nthe Postal Service. Unfortunately, now OPM has an over 50,000-person \nbacklog of retirement claims. This is unacceptable. We still have a \npaper processing process. This amendment would require the\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\nPostal Service to report on a regular basis, as well as OPM, on the \nstatus of these retirement processing claims and hopefully speed up \nthis process and also compare it to the forms of other agencies. This \nis completely unacceptable to folks who are retiring, waiting sometimes \nup to a full year to get their retirement benefits. I thank the \nchairman and the ranking member and ask for acceptance of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I support this amendment. There is an \ninexcusable backlog at OPM in processing the application for retirement \nbenefits. It has caused real hardships for some retired Federal \nemployees and postal employees. This bill will obviously increase the \nnumber of postal employees who will be seeking retirement benefits so I \nthink it is important we have the kind of reporting the Senator from \nVirginia has proposed.\n  I urge acceptance of the amendment. I urge it be accepted by the \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2071), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move for reconsideration and ask \nthe motion be placed on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2032\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The excitement builds now as we move to the last \namendment. Senator Tester has amendment No. 2032.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2032.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Tester], for himself and Mr. \n     Pryor, proposes an amendment numbered 2032.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To appropriately limit the pay of Postal Service executives)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Limitations on Compensation.--Section 1003 of title 39, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking the last sentence; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Limitations on Compensation.--\n       ``(1) Rates of basic pay.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), an officer \n     or employee of the Postal Service may not be paid at a rate \n     of basic pay that exceeds the rate of basic pay for level II \n     of the Executive Schedule under section 5313 of title 5.\n       ``(B) Very senior executives.--Not more than 6 officers or \n     employees of the Postal Service that are in very senior \n     executive positions, as determined by the Board of Governors, \n     may be paid at a rate of basic pay that does not exceed the \n     rate of basic pay for level I of the Executive Schedule under \n     section 5312 of title 5.\n       ``(2) Benefits.--For any fiscal year, an officer or \n     employee of the Postal Service who is in a critical senior \n     executive or equivalent position, as designated under section \n     3686(c), may not receive fringe benefits (within the meaning \n     given that term under section 1005(f)) that are greater than \n     the fringe benefits received by supervisory and other \n     managerial personnel who are not subject to collective-\n     bargaining agreements under chapter 12.''.\n       (b) Limitation on Bonus Authority.--Section 3686 of title \n     39, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``The Postal Service'' \n     and inserting ``Subject to subsection (f), the Postal \n     Service''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Limitation on Bonus Authority.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `covered \n     year' means the fiscal year following a fiscal year relating \n     to which the Office of Management and Budget determines the \n     Postal Service has not implemented the measures needed to \n     achieve long-term solvency, as defined in section 208(e) of \n     the 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2012.\n       ``(2) Limitation.--The Postal Service may not provide a \n     bonus or other reward under this section to an officer or \n     employee of the Postal service in a critical senior executive \n     or equivalent position, as designated under subsection (c), \n     during a covered year.''.\n       (c) Effective Date; Applicability.--The amendments made by \n     subsections (a) and (b) shall--\n       (1) take effect on the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) apply to any contract entered or modified by the Postal \n     Service on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Sunset.--Effective 2 years after the date of enactment \n     of this Act--\n       (1) section 1003 of title 39, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following: \n     ``No officer or employee shall be paid compensation at a rate \n     in excess of the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule \n     under section 5312 of title 5.''; and\n       (B) by striking subsection (e); and\n       (2) section 3686 of title 39, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a), by striking ``Subject to subsection \n     (f), the Postal Service'' and inserting ``The Postal \n     Service''; and\n       (B) by striking subsection (f).\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, this amendment is pretty simple. I thank \nSenator Pryor for joining me on it. It basically is an amendment that \nreduces compensation for the senior executives at the Postal Service. \nIt limits the six most senior Postal Service employees to a base salary \nno more than we pay our Cabinet Secretary, which is just a skosh under \n$200,000. There are going to be some changes in the Postal Service. \nSome of these cuts are going to take place at the lower end, some in \nthe middle management, some at the upper end.\n  To be fair, everybody needs to feel the pain and besides that, to be \nright fair, the Postmaster is an important job but so is the Secretary \nof Defense, Secretary of State, and others. I don't think we should be \npaying him more than what we do our Cabinet Secretaries. After all, the \nPostal Service is public service. I ask Senators' concurrence on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Montana for \nhis amendment. He explained it well and I urge its adoption by voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2032) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move for reconsideration and ask \nthat motion be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, colleagues, we have completed all the \namendments on the bill and we are ready to vote on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the power of Congress to establish post \noffices is enshrined in our Constitution, and the U.S. Postal Service \nhas been a valued institution since the earliest days of our Republic. \nToday, the Postal Service accounts for millions of jobs nationwide. It \nis essential that we have a viable and effective Postal Service in the \nlong term. Unfortunately, the Postal Service is currently facing \ncritical financial challenges that have been brought on by a number of \nfactors, including the movement to electronic forms of communication. \nThis situation requires immediate attention of Congress.\n  The bill we are voting on today, the 21st Century Postal Service Act, \nis not perfect. I am particularly disappointed that the Senate did not \nagree to an amendment that I supported that would have preserved 6-day \ndelivery, and I am concerned that a permanent switch to 5-day delivery \ncould lead to the further erosion of jobs and the undermining of the \nPostal Service. However, it is clear that we cannot afford to do \nnothing. Congressional inaction, coupled with the extreme measures \nbeing pushed by the Postal Service's leadership, will result in drastic \nchanges that would seriously undermine our Nation's mail system, \nbeginning with the closure of a number of post offices and mail \nprocessing facilities across the country. I am concerned that the \nchanges sought by the Postal Service's leadership will severely \nundermine the Postal Service's long-term viability and threaten \nthousands of good jobs. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  The 21st Century Postal Service Act includes a number of important \nprovisions designed to put the Postal Service back on solid footing. It \nwill allow for the refunding of overpayments by the Postal Service to \nthe Federal Employees Retirement System and ease\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\nthe prefunding requirement for the Postal Service's retiree health \nbenefits. It also strengthens the review process for closing post \noffices and facilities and encourages innovation by the Postal Service \nto improve its business model with the goal of returning to \nprofitability.\n  I am also concerned that the version of postal reform legislation \nthat is eventually passed by the House of Representatives could prove \nto be very damaging. When the Senate considers the final version of \npostal reform legislation that is negotiated by the two Chambers, I \nwill carefully consider the changes that have been made before lending \nmy support to its passage.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise support of my amendment, which has \nbeen modified in consultation with the managers of the Postal Reform \nbill, S. 1789. I am very pleased that both Chairman Lieberman and \nRanking Minority Member Collins have agreed to accept my amendment to \nfurther strengthen the segment of the bill governing proposed \nconsolidations for the Postal Service's processing and distribution \nfacilities.\n  With my amendment as part of the underlying bill, the Postal \nRegulatory Commission, PRC, will now independently verify the Postal \nService's methodology and estimated costs savings from proposed plant \nconsolidations. In other words, starting with those facilities \ncurrently under review, the Postal Service will no longer have \nunchecked authority to close or consolidate these important facilities.\n  The Postal Service has unfortunately proven itself unable to make \nthese decisions, many of which have far-reaching implications for the \nquality of service of postal customers, without proper oversight, fact-\nchecking and third-party verification.\n  As part of a major restructuring of the Postal Service's mail \ndelivery infrastructure, Postmaster General Donahue proposed closing \nand consolidating 232 mail processing and distribution facilities \nacross the United States. Unfortunately for the people of Maine, his \nproposal included the consolidation of the Eastern Maine Processing and \nDistribution Facility in Hampden into the Southern Maine Processing and \nDistribution Facility located in Scarborough.\n  This was a fundamentally flawed proposal from its inception. The \nEastern Maine Processing and Distribution Facility, located \napproximately 144 miles away from Maine's other mail processing \nfacility in Scarborough, ME, currently processes mail destined for \neastern, western, and northern Maine. Without this facility, mail \nservice to communities, families, the elderly, and businesses \nthroughout most of Maine would be severely delayed.\n  I strongly opposed this proposed consolidation from the beginning. In \nDecember, I visited the facility and met with the plant's manager and \nemployees. During the visit, I conveyed my strenuous opposition to the \nplan and questioned the ability of the Postal Service to save money by \nshifting jobs from Hampden to Scarborough.\n  As part of its consolidation process, the Postal Service holds public \nmeetings in communities facing the loss of a Processing and \nDistribution facility. For Hampden, the Postal Service held a public \nmeeting on January 11 2012, which I attended, along with approximately \n300 other Mainers, all of whom opposed the Postal Service's \nrecommendation.\n  In advance of the public meeting, my staff carefully reviewed the \nPostal Service's Area Mail Processing--AMP--report, which contained the \nestimated cost savings for consolidating the Hampden facility. In \nreviewing the AMP report, we discovered a very large mathematical \nerror.\n  The Postal Service originally claimed that eliminating two white \ncollar management positions at the plant would save almost $800,000. \nWhen my office started asking questions about this, the Postal Service \nbacktracked to claiming that eliminating these jobs would save only \n$120,000 in advance of its public meeting.\n  Shockingly enough, the Postal Service's final AMP report which was \nreleased in February retained the obviously mistaken claim that \neliminating these two positions saved almost $800,000. In all, the \nPostal Service has resumed mistakenly claiming almost 400 percent more \nin savings than would be accurate.\n  Under my amendment, if a local community is opposing a proposed \nconsolidation, it can appear that recommendation to the Postal \nRegulatory Commission--PRC--which will be able to independently review \nthe Postal Service's methodology and estimated cost savings to guard \nagainst facilities being closed due to faulty calculations by the \nPostal Service. If the PRC concludes that the AMP report was mistaken \nor inaccurate, the PRC has the authority to prevent closure or \nconsolidation from moving forward until the facts are corrected.\n  With my amendment being added to the underlying bill, local \ncommunities will now be assured of an even playing field and a thorough \nand accurate assessment of the impact of any closure or consolidation.\n  In closing, I wish to thank the managers of the bill for accepting my \namendment and I urge the Senate to adopt it by voice vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, while the amended bill before us is far \nfrom perfect, I will vote in support. Failure to pass a bill could \nresult in the Postal Service pursuing a misguided course of post office \nand facility closures. Such a dramatic course would irreparably harm \nthe ability of the Postal Service to provide postal services and would \nin fact, threaten the viability of the US Postal System. While, as a \nwhole, the USPS needs to be a rate-payer supported organization, not \nevery post office needs to post a profit. In fact, while some post \noffices are too small to turn a profit, they are still an important \npart of the Postal System and a vital part of their community. And, \nbased on the estimates I have seen, the projected cost-savings from the \nproposed closing of the 3,700 post office locations would offset but a \ntiny part of the USPS's current financial problems. These closures \nwould deliver a painful blow to the communities they serve, but would \nreduce the Postal Service's deficit by less than 1 percent.\n  The bill includes an amendment that I offered with Senators Tester \nand Franken that requires that substantial economic savings be shown \nbefore a post office or processing facility is closed and clarifies \nthat a proposed closure shall be suspended during appeal to the Postal \nRegulatory Commission, PRC. This amendment will help ensure that any \npost office and facility closures do not unduly impact a community's \naccess to postal services and that any such closure is economically \njustified.\n  There is no doubt that the Postal Service has faced a decline in \nfirst class mail volume over the past few years and will need to make \nsignificant adjustments in the future. I am hopeful that the Postal \nService will work with Congress as the mail system continues to \ntransform so that postal services can be continued and to ensure that \nthe Postal Service is able to offer new and innovative services so it \ncan remain viable in the 21st Century.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will vote for S. 1789, the 21st \nCentury Postal Service Act, because it is undeniable that the Postal \nService is facing a crisis and something must be done very soon. There \nare those who say that this bill goes too far in reforming the Postal \nService and implementing uncomfortable changes, and then there are \nthose who say that this bill does not go far enough in transforming the \nPostal Service to be viable in the long term. I agree that this bill is \nnot perfect. It is a compromise so just about everyone can find \nsomething in it to dislike. However, unless we do something to help the \nPostal Service cut costs, the borrowing authority of the Postal Service \nwill run out in the fall and it will be unable to make payroll. I will \nsupport this bill, imperfect though it is, because we need to make \nprogress in addressing this looming crisis now. Otherwise, if we wait \nmuch longer, we will be faced with a choice between a shut-down of mail \nservice across our country or a massive taxpayer bailout, both of which \nwould hurt the economy and take money out of the pockets of hardworking \nAmericans.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' \non S. 1789 and give the Postal Service both the financial footing and \nthe business tools it needs to compete in this new communications age.\n  Let's start by facing facts. USPS is losing business and losing \nmoney. If we\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\ndo nothing, on May 15th the Postmaster will be allowed to implement his \nown downsizing plan, which is far more severe than this bill allows and \nwill lead to a loss of jobs and services that could be painful in this \nfragile economy, especially to our small towns and rural communities.\n  We have another choice.\n  To all my colleagues who say they are worried about the burdens the \nPostmaster's proposal to close 3,700 post offices will impose on \nfamilies and businesses of their states, I say: ``Vote for this bill.''\n  It requires the Postal Service issue service standards that ensure \ncommunities throughout the country have access to retail postal \nservices, and requires offering alternatives to closures, such as \nreduced hours at existing facilities, or permitting private contractors \nor rural carriers to provide services.\n  To all my colleagues who worry about the loss of postal processing \nfacilities in their states, and the jobs and services that will go with \nthem, I say: ``Vote for this bill.''\n  While it permits the Postal Service to eliminate excess capacity, it \nalso requires it to maintain an overnight delivery standard--although \nfor somewhat smaller geographic areas. And the maximum standard \ndelivery time--3 days for a letter mailed anywhere in the continental \nUnited States--would remain unchanged.\n  That means fewer plant closings.\n  To all my colleagues who worry about the loss of Saturday delivery, I \nsay: ``Vote for this bill,'' which takes a responsible, balanced \napproach to this difficult issue.\n  The bill prohibits implementation of 5-day delivery for 2 years and \nrequires the Postal Service to determine if the other cost-saving \nmeasures in this bill have made cancelling Saturday service \nunnecessary--and to tell us how it plans to cushion the impacts on the \nbusinesses and communities it serves if it decides to go to five days.\n  Only if the Comptroller General and the Postal Regulatory Commission \nreview the evidence and conclude that the change is necessary, will the \nswitch to 5-day service be allowed.\n  To all my colleagues who worry about the Postal Service's bleak \nfinancial outlook, I say: ``Vote for this bill,'' which provides \ncrucial financial breathing room to help ward off some of the drastic \ncuts I just spoke of.\n  First, not one dollar of taxpayer money is being used. This is not a \npostal ``bailout.''\n  Roughly $11 billion in USPS overpayments to the Federal Employee \nRetirement System will be refunded and used to encourage its 100,000 \nworkers at or near retirement age to take voluntary buyouts that could \nsave $8 billion a year.\n  Money left over can also be used to retire debt.\n  The bill also reduces the amount the Postal Service has to pay each \nyear to prefund its Retiree Health Benefits, by amortizing its \nliability over the next 40 years.\n  This will significantly cut the $5.5 billion annual payment USPS has \nbeen making, while still assuring there will be sufficient funds to \nmeet the commitments for future retirees' health benefits.\n  To all my colleagues who worry that the Postal Service just isn't \nrelevant in the 21st Century, I say: ``Vote for this bill,'' which \ngives the Postal Service tools to bring in fresh revenues by offering \nnew products and services, such as contracting with state and local \ngovernments to issue state licenses, shipping beer, wine and distilled \nspirits, and creating specialized Internet services.\n  It also sets up a blue ribbon panel to develop a new strategic \nblueprint for the Postal Service for this new age.\n  Finally, in many ways the debate over postal reform is a mirror of \nthe overall budget debate--but writ small.\n  We confront a financial crisis that could wreak havoc on our economy \nwere the Postal Service to run out of money and be forced to severely \nslash services. Yet no one wants to cut any services or raise any rates \non anybody.\n  This bill will not solve all the problems that confront the Postal \nService, but it is a beginning. This bill represents a clear-eyed and \npragmatic way forward for the Postal Service--one that avoids panic or \ncomplacency.\n  It is the kind of balanced and bipartisan approach we will need to \ndeal with the even bigger problems with fast-approaching deadlines \nracing towards us--like the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the \nsequestration of military funding.\n  So to my colleagues who worry about our ability to get big things \ndone and who want to prove to the American people--and ourselves--that \nCongress can rise above partisan and parochial interests and work for \nthe good of all Americans, I urge you to pass this bill.\n  I do want to thank the three colleagues on our committee--Senator \nCollins, Senator Carper, Senator Brown--for the work everyone did to \nbring about a bipartisan bill that will bring necessary change to the \nPostal Service in order to save it. Make no mistake about it, this bill \nwill bring the change that the post office needs to stay alive, serving \nthe people and businesses of our country.\n  Here is the bottom line. The Postal Service itself says that within 3 \nyears, as sections of this bill are phased in, they will reduce their \ncost of operating by $19 billion and probably in the year after that \nthey will go into balance. That is what this bill will accomplish.\n  I again thank my colleagues on the committee and the staffs of both \nsides and the floor staffs on both sides for the extraordinary work \nover a long period that was done to get us to this point.\n  We still need 60 votes to pass this bill. I appeal to my colleagues \nto do so, with a feeling of confidence that we have met a problem here \ntogether and have offered a solution that will fix the problem for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I believe the odds of our getting the \n60 votes for final passage are increased if I make my statement later, \nrather than delivering it right now. I will deliver my statement after \nthe vote, but I do wish to thank Senator Lieberman, Senator Scott \nBrown, Senator Carper, all the staffs who have worked so hard.\n  Today, assuming we get those 60 votes, we have proven the Senate can \ntackle an enormous problem in a bipartisan way and make real progress \non an issue that matters to our economy and to the American people.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the leaders for their excellent work and the \npeople who joined them. I think the policy has been debated well. I do \nwish to say, at the beginning there was discussion that there be a 60-\nvote threshold at the end and that some of the amendments might improve \nthe funding aspect. I still want to say one more time that a vote for \nthis bill is a vote to increase our deficit this year by $11 billion \nand a vote to violate the Budget Control Act that we just passed last \nyear.\n  I appreciate the work. I do wish we had worked to pay for this. We \nhave not done that. I would like to remind everyone voting for this \nthat we are, in fact, adding $11 billion to our deficit, more so than \nwas laid out by the Budget Control Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to \ncongratulate both the chairman, Senator Lieberman, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Collins, for handling a very difficult bill. It is, in \nmy view, the way we ought to legislate. We had a number of amendments \nthat were important to our Members. We are glad they had an opportunity \nto offer them. I wanted to just take a moment to congratulate Senator \nCollins and Senator Lieberman for a very skillful job handling this \nvery difficult piece of legislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the substitute \namendment, as modified and amended, is agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill, as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\non S. 1789, as amended. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor passage of the bill, the bill, as amended, is passed.\n  The bill (S. 1789), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, with the passage today of S. 1789, we \nhave given the United States Postal Service--created more than two \ncenturies ago in the age of inkwells and quill pens--the tools to \nthrive in the age of e-mail and the Internet.\n  Overall, about 8 million jobs hung in the balance, as well as the \nneeds of every household and business in America that depends on the \nPostal Service to deliver everything from medicines to spare parts.\n  Passage of this bill is a bipartisan victory that reflects well on \nthe Senate and I want to take this moment to thank the many dedicated \nstaff, from the majority and minority who helped make it possible.\n  From my staff on the Homeland Security and Governmental I would like \nto thank Beth Grossman, Deputy Staff Director and Chief Counsel; Larry \nNovey, Chief Counsel for Governmental Affairs; Kenya Wiley, Staff \nCounsel; Mike Alexander, Staff Director; Holly Idelson, Senior Counsel; \nJason Yanussi, Senior Professional Staff Member; Leslie Phillips, \nCommunications Director; Sara Lonardo, Press Secretary; Scott Campbell, \nCommunications Advisor; Rob Bradley, Legislative Aide, and Staff \nAssistant Nick Trager.\n  From Senator Collins' staff, I would like to thank Katy French, \nDeputy Staff Director; John Kane, Professional Staff Member; Katie \nAdams, Professional Staff Member; Cassie D'Souza, detailee from the \nPostal Regulatory Commission; Nick Rossi, Staff Director and E.R. \nAnderson, Press Secretary.\n  From our Federal Financial Management Subcommittee, which is chaired \nby Senator Carper and Ranking Member Scott Brown, I also want to thank \nJohn Kilvington, Staff Director for the majority and Justin Stevens, \nProfessional Staff Member, from the minority.\n  And I would also like to thank all of the staff for the majority and \nminority leaders, especially Gary Myrick and Tim Mitchell and Dave \nSchiappa who of course make everything happen on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Thomas Jefferson once asked the question: ``What duty does a citizen \nowe to the government that secures the society in which he lives?''\n  Answering his own question, Jefferson said: ``A nation that rests on \nthe will of the people must also depend on individuals to support its \ninstitutions if it is to flourish. Persons qualified for public service \nshould feel an obligation to make that contribution.''\n  These dedicated staff members answered Jefferson's call to duty and I \nam proud to be able to work with such people.\n  Negotiations on the contours of the bill that would become S. 1789 \nbegan last October with members of Ranking Member Collins' and Senator \nCarper's staffs.\n  The goal was to create a bipartisan bill that would gain support \nfirst in the Committee and then on the floor of the Senate.\n  Today's vote to pass S. 1789 shows the long nights and weekends that \nwent into this bill were worth it.\n  So again, my thanks to our staffs and for all the work you do for the \nAmerican people.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this is an important victory for the \nU.S. Postal Service and the American economy.\n  The Postal Service is the linchpin of a $1.1 trillion mailing and \nmail-related industry that employs nearly 8.7 million Americans in \nfields as diverse as mail, printing, catalog companies and paper \nmanufacturing. Those industries and the jobs they sustain are in \njeopardy.\n  The Postal Service lost $13.6 billion over the past two years and has \nseen a 26 percent drop in first class mail since 2006.\n  But today we have begun to right the ship.\n  There is still much work to be done, including working with our \ncolleagues in the House to present the President with a bill he can \nsign.\n  Nevertheless, I appreciate the solid bipartisan support that this \nbill received. It's gratifying that so many of my colleagues understand \nthat the Postal Service should not choose the destructive path of \ncutting service and raising prices.\n  This vote sends the message that we can't allow the Postal Service to \ndrive customers away to other communication options. Once they leave \nthe mail system, they won't be coming back, and the Postal Service will \nbe sucked further into a death spiral.\n  As we move toward a conference with the House, we must continue to \nresist ill-conceived policy changes. We must avoid short term ``fixes'' \nthat undermine service and thus jeopardize the long-term sustainability \nof this American institution.\n  Today's vote is also a win for bipartisanship.\n  Americans are rightly frustrated about what many feel is a \ndysfunctional Congress. With enormous problems facing our country and \nCongress having little to show by way of accomplishments, the process \nwe've just completed on this bill demonstrates that it is sometimes \npossible for Congress to do more and bicker less.\n  Today we see what can happen when Republicans and Democrats work \ntogether; when Senators from big states and small find common ground. \nWe can achieve important policy for those who sent us here.\n  I want to thank Senator McConnell for working with us so well to \npreserve an amendment process that fostered healthy debate and allowed \nour colleagues to get votes on their priorities. Of course, I must also \nthank Majority Leader Reid for pushing hard to resolve differences in \norder to create a successful process once the bill was brought to the \nfloor. I know that we would not have had the support that we had for \nfinal passage of this bill without the Leaders working together to \nensure an amendment process that was fair and reasonable.\n  As always, Chairman Lieberman's commitment to bipartisanship is \nunmatched, and it's making him extremely busy and productive in his \nlast year in the Senate. This marks the third bill we have shepherded \nthrough to Senate passage in this Congress. I hope to work with him \nsuccessfully on at least one more bill--cybersecurity.\n\n  Senator Scott Brown has already built an impressive record as a key \nvoice for both postal reform and the STOCK Act. I appreciate his \npartnership on both of these important measures. He has become an \nindependent leader for common sense and I thank him.\n  I appreciate Senator Carper's leadership on this bill. We have been \nworking together on postal issues for many years, and I am grateful for \nhis expertise and dedication.\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\n  My bipartisan cosponsors and I consulted extensively with postal \ncustomers, both business and residential, postal workers, and local \ncommunities deeply committed to preserving their postal facilities. We \ncould not have gotten this bill passed through the Senate without their \nimportant contributions, cooperation, creativity and support.\n  This bill would not have been possible without the hard work and \ndedication of our staff, and I'd like to recognize some of them \npersonally.\n  Katy French, John Kane, Katie Adams, and Cassie D'Souza on my staff, \nhave been working for four months as if this bill were coming to the \nfloor the next day. My Committee staff director, Nick Rossi, press \nsecretary, E.R. Anderson, and other members of our team have ably \nsupported them. Justin Stevens on Senator Scott Brown's staff has been \nan incredible partner as well.\n  Their colleagues across the aisle were models of hard work and \ncollegiality, and I want to thank them, especially the Chairman's \nstaff, Mike Alexander, Beth Grossman, Kenya Wiley, and Larry Novey, and \nJohn Kilvington of Senator Carper's staff. I know it's been hard work, \nbut the staff have the highest level of professionalism, collegiality, \npatience with each other and the process and it's made the challenge of \nbringing this bill to the floor a rewarding one.\n  Finally, I can't thank enough the long-suffering floor staff, who \nhave been incredibly patient, helpful and have gone out of their way to \nserve many competing agendas with grace. Thank you especially to David \nSchiappa with Senator McConnell's staff and his team in the Republican \ncloakroom, and Gary Myrick and his team, with the Majority Leader.\n  Our work isn't done. Today is just the first step on a long road \nahead. We must move a bill to the President's desk. The House has a \nbill that awaits floor consideration. We will come together for a \nconference process. More compromises will have to be made along the \nway. But we can't forget the urgency of our task--saving the Postal \nService for the next generation of Americans.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I thank my colleagues \nfor their support on final passage of this critical piece of \nlegislation.\n  This is an important first step forward towards putting the Postal \nService on a path for solvency and success in the future.\n  The long-term survival of the Postal Service is an issue that touches \nevery single home, community, and business in this country, including \nin my home State of Massachusetts. Its poor financial health is a real \nproblem.\n  There is an envelope company in Worcester that has had to recently \nlay off almost a third of its workforce because incoming orders have \ndropped by a quarter from last year. The owner says his customers have \ntold him that they have stopped mailing because of the unknown future \nof the Postal Service. This is but one example of the impact that a \nfailing Postal Service has on businesses large and small across the \ncountry.\n  So, that is why I am so pleased that we can show the American people \nthat, yes, once again the U.S. Senate can come together in a bipartisan \nmanner and solve real problems.\n  In a Congress infamous for gridlock and division, the passage of this \nbill is proof positive of the results when we work together in good \nfaith.\n  Reforming the Postal Service is no easy task and there are no easy \nanswers. Millions of jobs, a trillion-dollar mailing industry, and an \ninstitution as old as this Nation are all at stake.\n  But this shows that a majority of Members here knew that resolving \nthe crisis at the Postal Service would require a balanced approach, \nsome difficult decisions, and a lot of compromise to see a bill passed.\n  We all recognize the new business environment that the Postal Service \noperates in, but we also know that the focus had to be on helping the \nPostal Service sustain their customer base in that environment, not \nsurrender to it.\n  I am proud of this bill and the example this sets for the power of \nbipartisanship for the rest of this session.\n  The other cosponsors--Senators Lieberman, Collins, and Carper have \nbeen setting this example for some time. I have been proud to be in \ntheir company on this bill and thank them for their leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  With the recent passage of the STOCK Act and the crowdfunding bill, I \nfeel like we have all been on kind of a streak lately. I hope that it \ncontinues and that our colleagues in the House can now take our lead \nand pass a balanced postal reform bill as well. The Postal Service is \nrunning out of time and they cannot afford any further delay.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted against S. 1789 because short-term \nfinancial relief for the Postal Service that will ultimately lead to a \ntaxpayer bailout is no longer acceptable. According to the Postal \nService, S. 1789 ``does not provide the Postal Service with the speed \nand flexibility it needs to achieve the $20 billion in cost \nreductions'' and they will need additional legislative action in 2 to 3 \nyears.\n  The bill is designed to keep the current failing Postal Service \nbusiness model in place by halting the structural changes the Postal \nService says it needs to ensure its long-term viability. Instead of the \nSenate dealing with the real problems, such as 80 percent labor costs \nand consolidating the excess retail network of the Postal Service, the \nbill continues to allow no-layoff clauses in union contracts, will lock \nin unsustainable mail service standards, and place new litigious \nprocesses, restrictions, regulations, and appeals that will make it \nimpossible for the Postal Service to close and consolidate \nunderutilized post offices and mail-processing facilities. These \nroadblocks fly in the face of the hard reality that the Postal Service \nlost $13 billion in the past 2 years due to its failing business model \nand the changes in the way the American public communicates.\n  S. 1789 also prevents the Postal Service from moving to 5-day \ndelivery, at a savings of anywhere from $1.7 to $3 billion annually and \nis one of the largest single steps available to restore their financial \nsolvency. The Postmaster General has been coming to Congress since 2009 \nasking for this flexibility, and the American people overwhelmingly \nsupport this move. The Senate, however, chose to protect the 6-day \ndelivery of junk mail even with first-class mail, which makes up more \nthan half of postal revenues, on a downward spiral with no sign of \nrecovery.\n  Finally, this bill continues the harmful practice of passing bills \nthat are not paid for. S. 1789 has at least five budget points of order \nagainst it, and instead of being fiscally responsible and pay for this \nbill as promised, the Senate agreed to move forward and stick the \nAmerican taxpayer with the tab. If we are not willing to keep our \npromise and abide by the spending limits we put in place, we are not \nreally serious about fixing our countries financial problems.\n  Congress can no longer enact temporary fixes that avert financial \ncrisis for only a brief period. If we continue to act in this \nirresponsible way, the American taxpayer will be the one that \nultimately suffers in the form of higher postage prices and taxpayer \nbailouts. We must make hard choices now so future generations of \nAmericans will have a viable Postal Service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are able to move \ndirectly to the legislation without a cloture vote.\n  The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act is a bipartisan bill. \nIt has 61 cosponsors. I was encouraged yesterday morning to hear the \nmajority leader and the Republican leader discussing moving forward \nquickly to pass this legislation.\n  I agree with the majority leader. I don't want to see the bill \nweakened. I agree with the Republican leader that there is strong \nbipartisan support for the Leahy-Crapo bill. I look forward to working \nout an agreement. I have spoken to both of them and told them I will \nsupport an agreement that will allow us to consider, and expeditiously \napprove, the bill in short order. Of course, I will be happy to help in \nany way I can to facilitate that.\n  The bipartisan Violence Against Women Act has been the centerpiece of \nthe Federal Government's commitment to combat domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking. The impact of the landmark law \nhas been remarkable. It is one law I can point to and say that it has \nprovided life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of women, \nchildren, and men.\n  At a time when we can sometimes be polarized around here, I \nappreciate the bipartisan support of this bill.\n  Senator Crapo and I introduced the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act last year. We come from different parts of the \ncountry. We come from different parties. We, I think it is safe to say, \ncome from different political philosophies. But we agreed that we all \nhave to work to stop violence against women. In fact, we didn't move \nforward to do so at all until it had a lot of discussion both with the \nstaff of the ranking member and other Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee. We did our best to try to accommodate all points of view.\n  We continued our outreach after the introduction of the bill, in the \nhearings and in the committee process. The amendment the Judiciary \nCommittee adopted on February 2 included several additional changes \nrequested by Republican Senators. I made sure they were in there. They \nare outlined in the committee report.\n  We eliminated several provisions that would have offered significant \nassistance to immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence. It was \ndifficult to remove these provisions, but we earnestly sought \ncompromise, and I was encouraged when in our committee meetings Senator \nGrassley acknowledged our efforts to reach agreement where we could.\n  I said then and I now say that we were willing to go as far as we \ncould to accommodate Senators on either side of the aisle. But as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I cannot abandon core principles \nof fairness, and I will not. I continue to urge all Senators to join to \nprotect the most vulnerable victims of violence, including battered \nimmigrant women, assisting law enforcement, Native American women who \nsuffer in record numbers, and those who have had trouble accessing \nservices.\n  I have said so many times on this floor that a victim is a victim is \na victim. They all need to be helped. They deserve our attention. They \ndeserve the protection and access to the services our bill provides.\n  We now have 61 cosponsors, including 8 Republicans; 16 of the 17 \nwomen in the Senate, from both parties, have joined as cosponsors. They \nhave been strong supporters from the start, and the bill is better \nbecause of their efforts.\n  There is one purpose, and one purpose alone, for the bill that \nSenator Crapo and I have introduced: to help protect victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence. That purpose is reinforced as we turn to \nthis bill during Crime Victims' Rights Week and Sexual Assault \nAwareness Month.\n  Our bill is based on months of work with survivors, advocates, and \nlaw enforcement officers from all across the country--and I must say \nfrom all political persuasions, from the right to the left. the \nbipartisan bill was developed in an open and democratic process, and it \nis responsive to the unmet needs of victims.\n  The New York Times had a column by Dorothy Samuels last Sunday that \ngot it right. She wrote:\n\n       [T]he provisions respond to real humanitarian and law \n     enforcement needs.\n\n  When Senator Crapo and I worked to put this legislation together, we \npurposely avoided proposals that were extreme or divisive on either the \nright or the left. We selected only those proposals that law \nenforcement and survivors and the professionals who work with crime \nvictims every day told us were essential. We did not go for somebody \nwho didn't have firsthand experience. We asked the people who actually \nhave to make the law work. That is actually why every one of these \nprovisions has such widespread support.\n  In fact, our reauthorization bill is supported by more than 1,000 \nFederal, State, and local organizations, and they include service \nproviders, law enforcement, religious organizations, and many more.\n  We have done a good job on the domestic violence front, so sexual \nassault is where we need to increase our focus. That is what the bill \ndoes. The administration is fully onboard, and I welcome their \nstatement of support.\n  We have to pass this legislation. We have to pass this provision to \nfocus on sexual assault. I think of the advocates in my State of \nVermont who work not only in the cities but especially in the rural \nareas. Mr. President, it is not just those of us from small States; \nevery single State has rural areas. The distinguished Presiding Officer \ndoes, the distinguished majority leader does, the distinguished \nRepublican leader does. We all have rural areas.\n\n  I think of Karen Tronsgard-Scott of the Vermont Network to End \nDomestic and Sexual Violence and Jane Van Buren with Women Helping \nBattered Women. They have helped us put this together. I appreciate the \nguidance from all across the Nation from such organizations as the \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence, the National Alliance to End \nSexual Violence, the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic \nViolence Against Women. The coalition has been maintained and has been \nvaluable in these efforts. It is working with them that we were able to \nadjust the allocation of funds to increase needed funding for sexual \nassault efforts, and do it without harming the other coordinated \nefforts.\n  We reached our understanding in working with them, not by picking a \nnumber out of a hat or trying to outbid some proposal. It wasn't there. \nEverybody worked together. We only have so many dollars. We tried to do \nit and use the money where it works the best.\n  The provision ensuring that services will be available to all victims \nregardless of sexual orientation and gender identity is supported by \nthe Leadership Conference of Civil Rights and numerous civil rights and \ncrime victim advocates. I was pleased to see a letter from Cindy Dyer, \nPresident Bush's Director of the Office of Violence Against Women, in \nwhich she writes:\n\n       As criminal justice professionals, our job is to protect \n     the community, but we are not able to do that unless all the \n     tools necessary . . . are available to all victims of crime.\n\n  Of course, she is right. A victim is a victim is a victim.\n  Mr. President, when I was the State's attorney, I went to crime \nscenes at 3 o'clock in the morning and there was a battered and bloody \nvictim--we hoped alive, but sometimes not. The police never said: Is \nthis victim a Democrat or a Republican? Is this victim gay or straight? \nIs this victim an immigrant? Is this victim native born?\n  They said: This is a victim. How do we find the person who did this \nand stop them from doing it again? A victim is a victim is a victim. \nEverybody in law enforcement will tell you that.\n  Because of that, we added a limited number of new visas for immigrant \nvictims of serious crimes who help law enforcement, which is backed \nonly by the immigrants' rights organizations, as one might expect, but \nit is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police which writes that ``the \nexpansion of the U visa program will provide incalculable benefits to \nour citizens and our communities at a negligible cost.'' My friends in \nlaw enforcement are right, as they so often are.\n\n  On Tuesday, in an editorial in our local paper, the Washington Post \nurged passage of our bipartisan bill, noting:\n\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\n\n       A comprehensive committee report convincingly details gaps \n     in current programs as identified by law enforcement \n     officers, victim-service providers, judges and health-care \n     professions. No one--gay or straight, man or woman, legal or \n     undocumented--should be denied protections against domestic \n     abuse or sexual violence.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with that editorial because what it says is \nwhat we have said over and over on this floor--a victim is a victim is \na victim. If you are a victim, you should have somebody ready to help.\n  They are improvements that are not only reasonable but necessary if \nwe are to fulfill our commitment to victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence. If we say you are a victim of domestic or sexual violence, we \ncan't pick and choose to say this victim will be helped but this one is \ngoing to be left on their own. We say we are going to help all of them. \nA victim is a victim is a victim.\n  I believe that if Senators of both parties take an honest look at all \nthe provisions in our bipartisan VAWA reauthorization bill, they will \nfind it to be a commonsense measure we can all support. This isn't a \nDemocratic or a Republican measure, this is a good-government measure. \nThis protects the people in our society who sadly need protection. \nSixty-one Senators have already reached this conclusion from both \nparties, so I hope more will join us. I hope the Senate will promptly \npass the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\n  Mr. President, I was going to suggest the absence of a quorum, but I \nsee the distinguished Senator from Texas in the Chamber, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. Senator Leahy, the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, has a bill that has many good parts, and I was \nlistening to the things he said about it and agree with many of them. \nBecause there are some areas of disagreement, I have worked with many \nof my colleagues to create a substitute that has the same coverage but \nis better in other ways also. So I hope we will have the ability to \nlook at both and that from that we would be able to pass a bill out of \nthe Senate to address the violence against women we see in our country.\n  Our bill, as Senator Leahy's bill does, actually covers men, who we \nknow now are also subject to this kind of violence. So our bill covers \nmen who have suffered the same kinds of victimization as women and whom \nwe covered 16 years ago.\n  I would like to point out that I have been championing this issue for \na very long time. When I was in the Texas Legislature, I learned there \nwere serious problems in the reporting and prosecution of rape in our \ncountry. The State statute in Texas in the early 1970s discouraged \nreporting because of embarrassment to the victim and the difficulty of \nobtaining convictions because victims were not willing to come forward \nand report rapes because they felt they were treated like a criminal \nsometimes. If they actually did report it and agree to help the \nprosecution, their treatment on the witness stand was so humiliating \nthey often gave up. So the reports of rape were often not made. This \nwas true in Texas, but it was true throughout our country.\n  I worked with Democratic members in our legislature and led the \neffort to strengthen victim protection in this area, and it included \nlimiting irrelevant questions asked by law enforcement officials and \nattorneys and redefining the meaning of consent, all of which enhanced \nthe privacy rights of our victims. We created a statute of limitations \nthat was more in line with other crimes of assault and battery.\n  Our bill was so good when it passed in 1975 that it became a model \nfor other States that were passing legislation. So this was the \nbeginning of the effort to do just that. It was the model bill many \nStates looked at to adapt and adopt in their States to protect the \nvictims of violent crimes in our country.\n  In the Senate, it was my bill that created the Amber Alert system \nthat would go across State lines. I worked with Senator Feinstein on \nthat bill, and our bill has saved 550 abducted children. That has been \ndocumented. So we have been able to do some things on a bipartisan \nbasis. I have also strongly supported the National Domestic Violence \nHotline, and stalking across State lines was also in my bill. So I have \nbeen in this effort for a long time.\n  Of course, 16 years ago when the Violence Against Women Act first \npassed, we did so unanimously, on a voice vote. Everyone supported it. \nWe now have to renew this bill yet again, and I hope we are going to \ncome together tomorrow to pass it.\n  I am going to support Senator Leahy's bill. I like many parts of it. \nI also think we can improve it in the areas I have included in my \nsubstitute, and I hope we will be able to pass that as well. Our bill \nkeeps much of the committee-reported bill intact. For instance, I am \ncosponsoring Senator Klobuchar's bill to take the stalking bill I \npassed originally into cyber stalking because that was not a problem \nwhen we first passed the Violence Against Women Act but is a problem \ntoday.\n  The current legislation I am going to introduce will update and \nstrengthen current law and fix some weaknesses that I think are in \nSenator Leahy's bill. Our bill updates current law by mandating tougher \nsentences for violent crimes, increasing support for sexual assault \ninvestigations and rape kit testing, and requiring more effective \nJustice Department oversight of grant programs to ensure scarce funds \naren't wasted. This was done as a result of the IG in the Justice \nDepartment saying there was not enough oversight and not enough \nauditing of the grants to ensure they go to the victims and victims' \nrights organizations for which they are intended. Our bill is one I \ncertainly hope we will be able to pass.\n  One of the trends--and not a good trend--in this country right now is \nthe downward curve of sentences handed out in Federal courts for child \npornography. The most recent report to Congress from the U.S. \nSentencing Commission notes that child pornography defendants are being \nsentenced to terms below Federal sentencing guidelines in 45 percent of \nthe cases. Almost half of these defendants are receiving less than the \nrecommended sentences. In one particularly egregious instance, a man \nwas convicted of knowingly possessing hundreds of child pornography \npictures and videos of 8- to-10-year-old girls being abused. I can \nhardly even talk about that, but even worse, the sentencing guidelines \ncalled for this man to receive 63 to 78 months of imprisonment, yet he \nwas sentenced to 1 day in prison. That is ridiculous. It is obscene in \nand of itself.\n  Our bill would impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 1 year in these \ncases. If I could have written this bill by myself, it would have been \nmore. So a minimum of 1 year for child pornography showing 8- to-10-\nyear-old girls being violated. That is hard to talk about, and we need \nto do something about it. Our substitute does create a minimum sentence \nfor this type of violation.\n\n  We have many other provisions in our bill that are very strong. My \nsubstitute is one I think we can put together with Senator Leahy's bill \nwhen we go to conference. I know the House is going to pass a bill. \nThey are introducing their own. We will go to conference on this bill, \nand we will come out with a good bill if everyone will cooperate \nbecause we are on the same path.\n  I think our bill is a good and solid one. I am looking forward to \ntalking about it tomorrow, having a vote, and I hope we will be able to \ngo forward with the sincerity I think everyone has on this issue.\n  I think Senator Cornyn has a wonderful amendment that will also \nincrease getting rid of the backlog in the rape testing kits so that \npeople who are guilty of these crimes can be found through the testing \nand stopped from committing future crimes on victims. That is the \npurpose. So Senator Cornyn and I hope to be able to have our amendments \nbrought forward tomorrow--two amendments--and with Senator Leahy's \nbill, we can pass this and send it to the House.\n  Something is going to pass the Senate, and I hope we will just have a \nminimum ability to move on our very respectable alternatives or \namendments and then go to conference, where we can come out with a bill \nthat extends this very important act in our country.\n  Mr. President, I have four letters of support for our bill. One \nletter is from a rape prevention and victim protection group. The \nPROTECT group says\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\ntheir support is for strengthening Federal sentencing of child sexual \nexploitation. The Shared Hope International organization is very \nsupportive of the parts of our bill that have gotten into the \ninternational realm of trafficking. The Rape Abuse & Incest National \nNetwork, which is the largest rape victim organization in America, has \nwritten a very strong letter of support, as has the Criminal Justice \nLegal Foundation.\n  I hope we will be able to talk again tomorrow about these pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe four letters to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Protect,\n\n                                    Knoxville, TN, April 23, 2012.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: We are writing to enthusiastically \n     endorse your legislation to strengthen federal sentencing of \n     child sexual exploitation.\n       Your proposed amendments to 18 U.S.C. 2252 and 2252A would \n     create a mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration for any \n     offender who possesses child abuse images of ``a prepubescent \n     minor or a minor who had not attained 12 years of age.''\n       The Grassley bill stands squarely in the way of a growing \n     movement by federal judges to weaken sentences for child \n     pornography crimes. This judicial movement, given credence \n     and momentum by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, would treat \n     so-called ``simple possession'' as a victimless crime.\n       This outrageous judicial campaign leaves Congress no \n     choice. With its aggressive criticism of child pornography \n     penalties, the U.S. Sentencing Commission has shot across \n     your bow. We cheer you for returning fire! The federal \n     judiciary must hear loudly and clearly that the values of \n     Americans demand that sexual exploitation be treated as a \n     serious crime.\n       For the record, we hope to see even more Congressional \n     action, strengthening protections for older children and \n     meaningful restitution and asset forfeiture as well. Your \n     bill is a reasonable but tough step to shore up and \n     strengthen sentencing of child predators.\n       Never let the apologists for child pornography traffickers \n     deny the pain and harm done by possessors of these images. \n     These are human rights crimes, and should be treated as such. \n     So-called ``simple possessors'' fuel the market for more and \n     more crime scene recordings of children being raped, tortured \n     and degraded. Even those who don't pay for the images they \n     acquire create a crushing market demand for barter and \n     production. Thank you for standing up for these victims.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Grier Weeks,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Shared Hope International,\n\n                                                   April 24, 2012.\n     Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: Shared Hope International supports \n     your proposed VAWA Reauthorization bill. On October 21, 2009, \n     the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International \n     Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight held a hearing on \n     international violence against women at which I testified to \n     the connections between sexual violence against children and \n     women, and the need to view the sex trafficking occurring in \n     the U.S. as part of the widespread crime of international \n     violence against women. We view the inclusion of provisions \n     related to mandatory minimum sentences for possession of \n     pornography when the victim is under 12 and the expansion of \n     the administrative subpoena power for the U.S. Marshals to \n     track unregistered sex offenders as efforts to protect \n     children who are subject to violence through sex trafficking. \n     These provisions bring greater criminal enforcement and \n     deterrence to child sex trafficking crimes. Child pornography \n     is one form of child sex trafficking and is too often \n     intertwined with the other forms of sexual exploitation, \n     which include prostitution and sexual performance. Stiffer \n     penalties will bring greater deterrence and justice for the \n     victims. Prevention of child sex trafficking includes \n     empowering families and communities with the knowledge of the \n     location of sex offenders. Those offenders who fail to \n     register circumvent the purpose of this law. Tools to \n     increase the ability of the U.S. Marshals to track these \n     unregistered sex offenders is important to enforcement of \n     this law.\n       We commend your leadership in combating child sex \n     trafficking by viewing it as part of the overall violence \n     against women issue and fully support your efforts. Please \n     contact me with any questions and thank you for considering \n     our views on this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Linda Smith,\n       (U.S. Congress 1995 99, Washington State Senate/House 1983 \n     94), Founder and President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Rape, Abuse & Incest\n\n\n                                             National Network,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2012.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: I am writing to thank you for \n     including the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry \n     (SAFER) Act in S. 2338, to reauthorize the Violence Against \n     Women Act. The SAFER Act is bipartisan and cost-free, and \n     will help bring more rapists to justice by reducing the rape \n     kit backlog. It is our hope that it will be included as part \n     of the final VAWA reauthorization package.\n       One out of every six women and one in 33 men are victims of \n     sexual assault--20 million Americans in all, according to the \n     Department of Justice. Rapists tend to be serial criminals, \n     often committing many crimes before they are finally caught; \n     and only about 3% of rapists will ever spend a single day in \n     prison.\n       We believe it is in the best interests of victims, the \n     criminal justice system, and all Americans to enact the SAFER \n     Act. The SAFER Act will help get an accurate count of the \n     rape kit backlog on a national level, increasing transparency \n     and efficiency and allowing lawmakers to target funding to \n     the areas of greatest need. An accurate count of the backlog \n     will lead to more successful prosecutions, and to more \n     violent criminals behind bars.\n       RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) is the \n     nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization. RAINN \n     created and operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline \n     (800.656.HOPE and rainn.org), which has helped more than 1.7 \n     million people since 1994. RAINN also carries out programs to \n     prevent sexual assault, help victims, and ensure that rapists \n     are brought to justice. For more information about RAINN, \n     please visit www.rainn.org.\n       Thank you again for including the SAFER Act in S. 2338. We \n     believe SAFER will greatly enhance VAWA and result in a \n     stronger, more effective bill. We are grateful for your \n     leadership in the battle to prevent sexual violence and \n     prosecute its perpetrators, and we look forward to working \n     with you to encourage passage of this important act and to \n     reauthorize VAWA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Scott Berkowitz,\n     President and Founder.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Criminal Justice\n\n\n                                             Legal Foundation,\n\n                                   Sacramento, CA, April 19, 2012.\n     Re: S. 1925, Violence Against Women Reauthorization\n\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: the Criminal Justice Legal \n     Foundation, an organization supporting the rights of victims \n     of crime in the criminal justice system, supports your \n     efforts to establish a minimum sentence for the crime of \n     aggravated sexual abuse when committed within federal \n     jurisdiction.\n       The present statute provides that a person who commits this \n     crime, more commonly described as forcible rape, ``shall be \n     fined . . ., imprisoned for any term of years or life, or \n     both.'' (18 U.S.C. Sec.  2241(a).) Sentencing laws with such \n     an enormous range of punishments are relics of a bygone era. \n     At one time, it was thought proper to give the trial judge \n     such wide latitude, but the disparate sentences under this \n     system were eventually understood to outweigh the advantages.\n       In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a bipartisan reform \n     sponsored by Senators Kennedy and Thurmond, the wide-ranging \n     sentences in the statutes were overlaid, and largely \n     replaced, by a set of binding sentencing guidelines. From \n     1984 to 2005, a good argument against adding statutory \n     mandatory minimums was that they were unnecessary in a \n     properly functioning system of binding guidelines.\n       Unfortunately, Congress's chosen mechanism for reducing \n     sentencing disparity was declared unconstitutional by the \n     Supreme Court in Booker v. United States, 543 U.S. 220 \n     (2005). In its place, we have a confusing, one might even say \n     chaotic, system of discretion in the trial court and review \n     in the courts of appeals.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this body has a long tradition of \nbipartisan support for the Violence Against Women Act. One of the bills \nbefore us will continue that tradition. The other will destroy it. The \nbill introduced by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, stays true \nto the purpose and scope of the legislation that in the past received \nwide bipartisan support. The other bill introduced by the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy, deliberately departs from that purpose and scope \nand introduces divisive and controversial new provisions that, I \nbelieve, are designed to shatter that bipartisan support.\n  The purpose of the Violence Against Women Act is to combat violence \nagainst women. The description of the Office on Violence Against Women, \ncurrently on the Department of Justice Web site, states the same thing \na half dozen times: that this legislation is designed to end violence \nagainst women.\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nThe steadily growing bipartisan consensus behind this legislation has \nmade it more important and more effective.\n  Senator Leahy's bill, S. 1925, undermines the consensus that has been \ngrowing for two decades by introducing controversial and divisive \nproposals that fundamentally change the focus and scope of this \nlegislation. If those proposals have merit, they should receive their \nown separate consideration with appropriate legislation introduced and \nhearings held. But it is inappropriate to use the Violence Against \nWomen Act and the good will that it has attracted as cover for those \nnew and divisive projects.\n  I support Senator Hutchison's bill both for what it contains and what \nit does not contain. First, it provides stronger penalties for crimes \nsuch as forcible rape, aggravated sexual assault, child pornography, \nand interstate domestic violence resulting in death. The Leahy bill is \nweaker than Senator Hutchison's when it comes to addressing these \ncrimes, and in some instances it does not address them at all. Second, \nit targets more grant funding to address sexual assault and requires \nfar more funding be used to reduce the backlog in testing rape kits. \nThird, it requires an audit of the Office for Victims of Crime to \nensure that funds from the Crime Victims Fund are reaching those it \nexists to help. Forth, it addresses problems with inadequate oversight \nand administration by requiring that 10 percent of grantees be audited \neach year and by capping the percentage of appropriated funds that may \nbe used for administrative costs.\n  Senator Hutchison's bill does not contain the controversial and \ndivisive provisions that the majority insisted on including. It does \nnot, for example, authorize unused U visas from previous years to be \nused in the future. This provision in the majority's bill led the \nCongressional Budget Office to conclude that it will add more than $100 \nmillion to the deficit. The Hutchison bill does not extend Indian \ntribal court criminal jurisdiction to non-Indians. A Congressional \nResearch Service memo outlines a number of constitutional concerns \nregarding this provision in the majority bill.\n  Let me conclude by expressing both my disappointment and my thanks. I \nam truly disappointed that the majority has deliberately politicized \nthe reauthorization of VAWA in a way that they knew would render \nimpossible the kind of bipartisan consensus this legislation has had in \nthe past. It seems that the majority was more interested in having a \ncampaign issue for President Obama than in actually doing the hard work \nof creating a consensus bill that would protect women from violent \ncrime.\n  However, I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Hutchison and the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, for \nstepping up and offering this legislation to reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act in a way that can attract that consensus and continue \nthe effort to end violence against women.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2720-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Abraham Tarwoe\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, the \nPresiding Officer, to pay tribute to Lance Corporal Abraham Tarwoe, a \nRhode Islander who served in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  On April 12, Lance Corporal Tarwoe was killed while conducting combat \noperations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. A memorial service will be \nheld on Saturday in Rhode Island to honor his selfless sacrifice, and \nhe will then be laid to rest in his native home of Liberia.\n  When he was about 7 years old, Lance Corporal Tarwoe left Liberia and \nstarted a new life in the United States. He was one among thousands of \nLiberians who came to the United States seeking safety from a civil \nwar. We are proud that so many of these brave individuals and their \nfamilies now call Rhode Island their home, and our State continues to \nbe enriched by this strong community.\n  Lance Corporal Tarwoe enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in June 2009. \nHe was on his second deployment to Afghanistan, assigned to the 2nd \nBattalion, 9th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine \nExpeditionary Force, where he was serving as a mortarman and had \nadditional duties as a military dog handler.\n  Each generation of Americans is called upon to protect and sustain \nour democracy, and among our greatest heroes are the men and women who \nhave worn the uniform of our Nation and have sacrificed for our country \nto keep it safe and to keep it free.\n  It is our duty to protect the freedom they sacrificed their lives for \nthrough our service, our citizenship. We must continue to keep their \nmemories alive and honor their heroism, not simply by our words but by \nour deeds as citizens of this great country.\n  Today, our thoughts are with Lance Corporal Tarwoe's loving family in \nLiberia, Famatta and Abraham Kar, his brother Randall, his wife Juah, \nand his son Avant, and all his family, friends, and his comrades-in-\narms. We join them in commemorating his sacrifice and honoring his \nexample of selfless service, love, courage, and devotion to the Marines \nwith whom he served and the people of Afghanistan he was trying to \nhelp.\n  Lance Corporal Tarwoe is one among many Rhode Islanders who have \nproven their loyalty, their integrity, and their personal courage by \ngiving the last full measure of their lives in service to our country \nin Afghanistan, in Iraq, and elsewhere around the globe.\n  Today, we honor his memory and the memory of all those who have \nserved and sacrificed as he did. He has joined a distinguished roll of \nhonor, including many Rhode Islanders who have served and sacrificed \nsince September 11, 2001.\n  All of these men and women who have given their lives in the last \ndecade in Afghanistan and Iraq have done a great service to the Nation. \nIt is a roll of honor. It is a roll that Lance Corporal Tarwoe joins, \nand it should be for us a roll not just to recognize and remember but \nto recommit, to try in some small way to match their great sacrifice \nfor this great Nation.\n  In Lance Corporal Tarwoe's situation, it also should remind us that \nthis young man, born in Liberia, who came as a child and to Rhode \nIsland, demonstrates to us all that being an American is about what is \nin your heart, not necessarily where you were born or what language you \nmay have spoken as a child. It is about believing in America--believing \nso much that you would give your life to defend the values that we so \nmuch cherish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2720-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2720-S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAXWELL R. DORLEY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today, along with the Presiding \nOfficer, my colleague, Senator Whitehouse, to pay my respect and honor \nthe life of Sergeant Maxwell R. Dorley, a distinguished and beloved \nmember of the Providence Police Department, who passed away tragically \nin the line of duty.\n  Sergeant Dorley's personal story, which began in Liberia is another \nexample of the extraordinary contribution of the Liberian community to \nthe State of Rhode Island, along with recently deceased Lance Corporal \nTarwoe of the U.S. Marines. Sergeant Dorley's story is also another \nexample of inspiration and hope for all of us.\n  At the young age of 7, Sergeant Dorley followed his aunt, Hawa \nVincent, to Providence, beginning his own chapter of the American \ndream, and he wrote a remarkable chapter in that great story of \nAmerica. Sergeant Dorley attended Mount Pleasant High School, and not \nonly graduated at the top of his class earning admission to Brown \nUniversity, but he also befriended Kou, who would become his wife and \npartner for 27 years. His love and devotion to his family was so deep \nand genuine that when their first child, Amanda, was on her way, \nSergeant Dorley declined admission to Brown University and began \nworking four jobs so he could support his new family.\n  At this early stage in his life, Sergeant Dorley chose to prioritize \nhis new family over himself. And as he did\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nso many times throughout his life, Sergeant Dorley thought about others \nbefore he thought of himself. His example of hard work--four jobs to \nsupport the family--is the story of America, coming here from someplace \nelse, working as hard as you can to build a strong family and \ncontribute to a strong community.\n  From helping his family pay off the notes on their cars to gathering \nold and used police uniforms for his fellow police officers in Liberia, \nSergeant Dorley exemplified the best of what we expect from our public \nservants--a deep commitment to serving others for the greater good.\n  While terribly tragic, Sergeant Dorley passed away last Thursday \ndoing what he knew best, helping others by trying to come to the aid of \nhis Providence Police Officers, Edwin Kemble and Tony Hampton, who were \ntrying to break up a fight.\n  Today, we offer our deepest condolences, and our thoughts are with \nall of Sergeant Dorley's family, friends, and colleagues, but \nespecially with his mother Miatta who is traveling from Liberia, his \nwife Kou, and daughter Amanda, his son Robert, and all of his beloved \nfamily. We join them in celebrating Sergeant Dorley's many \ncontributions.\n  Despite his short time with us, he gave us much, and we honor his \nmemory and his service to the people of Providence as a Providence \nPolice Officer.\n  The loss of Sergeant Dorley is also a reminder of the great sacrifice \nand incredible courage of all of our Police Officers who voluntarily \nput themselves in harm's way to preserve the peace and stability that \nallows us to enjoy our own lives. Today, we especially salute the \nservice and sacrifice of Sergeant Dorley, and we honor the legacy he \nleaves of serving others and prioritizing the greater good over his own \npersonal interest. We have indeed lost a remarkable individual and a \ngreat example of selfless service. Again, we offer our deepest \ncondolences to his family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is an honor to follow my senior \nSenator, Jack Reed, who has been kind enough to preside now for me so \nthat we may deliver these remarks together.\n  The State of Rhode Island has lost two men in recent days, two men \nwho came from far away to our State to dedicate themselves to its \nservice and to the service of our country, one serving our country with \nhonor and distinction in Afghanistan and the other serving our Ocean \nState's great capital city of Providence.\n  U.S. Marine LCpl Abraham Tarwoe, of Providence, was a mortarman with \nWeapons Company, 2nd Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment of the 2nd Marine \nDivision out of Camp Lejeune, NC. He deployed with the Second Marine \nExpeditionary Force Forward, where he served as a dog handler in \naddition to his duties as a mortarman.\n  Abraham was born in Liberia during a time of civil war. His mother \nand father sent him to America when he was only 7 years old to find a \nbetter life. He joined our Liberian community in Rhode Island, which is \nan important and valued part of our Rhode Island civic life.\n  Abraham grew of age and joined the Marines in June of 2009 and was \npromoted to Lance Corporal in August of 2010. In December he deployed \nfor a second tour of duty to Afghanistan. He had earned the Combat \nAction Ribbon, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the Afghanistan \nCampaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, and the NATO Medal.\n  He died Thursday, April 12, from wounds sustained from an improvised \nexplosive device during a dismounted patrol in support of combat \noperations in the Marjah district of Helmand Province. He was 25 years \nold.\n  His commanding officer, Captain Charles E. Anklam III, said Abraham \nhad an understanding of suffering and sacrifice from his childhood and \nfamily ties to Liberia. ``He also knew about disproportionate \nservice,'' Captain Anklam said. ``He held no birth obligation to \nAmerica; in fact his citizenship was still being processed when he gave \nhis life for his newly adopted country and his brothers-in-arms.''\n  Abraham leaves behind his wife, Juah Kelly, and their 18-month-old \nbaby boy, Avant Kar, who Abraham would talk to by webcam almost every \nnight. My prayers for comfort and solace go out to them, and to \nAbraham's mother Famatta Kar, his brother Randall Kar, and to his \nnetwork of extended family and friends in the United States and \nLiberia.\n  A memorial service will be held by Abraham's family and friends in \nRhode Island this weekend. And then Abraham will be transported to \nLiberia, where a funeral will be held and he will be laid to rest.\n  On Monday, in Afghanistan, the Marines and sailors of Weapons Company \ngathered around a makeshift battlefield cross for their own memorial \nservice in Abraham's honor. As Abraham's comrades stepped forward one \nby one to pay their silent respect, Yeager, the black lab who had been \nAbraham's partner since July 2011, walked to the front and lay down \nbefore his handler's cross.\n  The Marine's Prayer says, in part: ``Protect my family. Give me the \nwill to do the work of a Marine.''\n  Abraham's wife Juah said that the Marine Corps was Abraham's other \nlove, his second family. Abraham died doing the work of a Marine. And \nwe pray in Abraham's memory for the protection of his brothers and \nsisters so bravely serving our country in the Marine Corps, and of his \nbeloved family here at home.\n  Like Lance Corporal Tarwoe, Providence Police Sergeant Maxwell Dorley \nwas also born in Liberia, and came to America as a child. He and his \nmother settled in Providence and Max attended Mount Pleasant High \nSchool where he met his high school sweetheart and wife, Kou. Max \nworked four jobs to support their young family, and eventually became a \nProvidence police officer, where he would serve the people of Rhode \nIsland's capital city for 15 years.\n  Max practiced community policing in the truest sense. He went by his \nfirst name when he was on patrol. His life experiences growing up in \nProvidence public housing allowed him to relate to the kids in the \nneighborhoods on his beat.\n  Max was dedicated to the Police Department, and to the men and women \nof the force. When a call for back-up came across the radio this past \nThursday morning from two officers trying to break up a fight on River \nAvenue, Max leapt into his cruiser. As he rushed to the aid of his \nfellow officers, lights and sirens blaring, he swerved to avoid a \ncollision with a car that crossed his path. He lost control and struck \na utility pole. He was rushed to Rhode Island Hospital, but his \ninjuries were too great. Maxwell Dorley died at age 41.\n  He now joins a list of other Providence, Police Officers who have \ngiven their lives: Steven Shaw, Cornel Young, and James Allen.\n  Max is remembered as a devoted husband and loving father, always \nseeking the best for his children, Amanda and Robert, and encouraging \nthem to follow their dreams. ``Life has no limits,'' he would tell \nthem.\n  Today, on behalf of the people of Rhode Island and the U.S. Senate, I \nsend my wholehearted condolences to Kou, Amanda, and Robert, to Max's \nmother, Miatta Dorley, and to the brave men and women of the Providence \nPolice Force who have lost another colleague and friend.\n  Max gave his life protecting the citizens of our community. And for \nthat, we owe him a gratitude that we cannot repay.\n  We mourn the loss of two good men. Two men with similar beginnings, \nand a common calling to serve and protect others. Abraham and Max \nhelped make our neighborhoods, our country, our world a better and \nsafer place to live. They gave their lives, making a real difference in \nthe lives of so many others. We honor them today in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, on July 1, approximately 7.4 million college \nstudents will see the interest rate double on their student loans \nunless Congress takes action. For every year we fail to act, borrowers \nwill pay $1,000 more in interest on their loans. In January, I \nintroduced S. 2051, the Student Loan Affordability Act, to maintain the \nsubsidized student loan interest rate at the current 3.4 percent. \nToday, I am proud to join my colleagues Senator Brown of Ohio and \nSenator Harkin, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, in sponsoring the Stop Student Loan Interest Rate \nHike Act. This legislation is a fully paid for, 1-year extension of the \n3.4-percent interest rate for subsidized student loans.\n  There is bipartisan support for keeping interest rates low. Governor \nRomney has endorsed a temporary extension of the current 3.4 percent \nrate. Two-thirds of Republican Senators voted to cut the interest rate \nto 3.4 percent under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007.\n  The Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act will maintain the \ninterest rate at 3.4 percent for another year. The 1-year extension is \nfully paid for by eliminating a tax loophole that has allowed some \nshareholder-employees of so-called S corporations to avoid paying their \nfair share of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes. This offset \nwill apply only to a subset of S corporations that are professional \nservice businesses--those that derive 75 percent of their gross income \nfrom the services of three or fewer shareholders or where the S \ncorporation is a partner in a partnership whose primary activity is \nprofessional services. Additionally, the offset only impacts filers \nwith income over $250,000, filing jointly, or $200,000, single filer.\n  The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, GAO, found that in \nthe 2003 and 2004 tax years, individuals used S corporations to \nunderreport over $23 billion in wage income. The median misreported \namount was $20,127.\n  Closing this loophole will fully offset the $6 billion cost of a 1-\nyear extension of the interest rate and would make the Tax Code more \nfair. It is a win-win proposition.\n  Some may say that the Federal Government cannot afford to forgo the \nhigher interest payments because of the budget deficit. However, this \nlegislation is fully paid for and should garner support from both sides \nof the aisle.\n  It is a matter of priorities. We need to put the interests of middle-\nclass Americans ahead of those who would avoid paying their fair share \nin taxes.\n  Student loan debt affects millions of Americans. Two-thirds of the \nclass of 2010 graduated owing student loans, with an average debt of \nover $25,000. Student loan debt has passed the $1 trillion mark--\nexceeding credit card debt. Moreover, the students and families we are \ntrying to help with the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike have \ndemonstrated economic need. Indeed, nearly 60 percent of the dependent \nstudents who qualify for subsidized loans come from families with \nincomes of less than $60,000.\n  The question before us is, Will we make the student loan debt burden \nworse by allowing interest rates to double or will we take action to \nprotect low and moderate income students?\n  We need to act fast. July 1 is only 66 days away. I urge all my \ncolleagues to join with Senator Sherrod Brown, Chairman Harkin, and me \nin supporting the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2722-4", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2722-S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ROBERT SATTER\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nextraordinary life and immeasurable legacy of long-time Connecticut \nlegislator and Superior Court judge, the Honorable Robert Satter, who \npassed away on January 16, 2012, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The \nsymbolic meaning of this coincidence resonated with many who admired \nJudge Satter for his crusading work on behalf of civil rights and equal \nopportunity.\n  After serving in the Navy during World War II, Bob dedicated himself \nwholeheartedly to the law, first as a well-known attorney in Hartford \nwhere he took on controversial death penalty cases. In 1959, Bob won a \nseat in the Connecticut Legislature, attributing his successful \ncampaign to the path previously blazed by Democratic Governor Abraham \nRubicoff. He served in the Connecticut Legislature until 1961 and then \nagain from 1963 to 1966 where he is known for fighting for society's \nmost marginalized. As a State legislator, he penned Connecticut's first \ncivil rights bill that targeted discrimination in housing sales. \nStarting in 1966, Bob served as general counsel to the Democratic \nlegislative majority, and was nominated to the bench in 1975 as a \nConnecticut State judge. Although officially retiring at the age of 70, \nBob served as a senior judge and trial referee--only vacating this role \nwhen he was too ill to continue serving.\n  As an attorney, legislator, Superior Court Judge and then as a senior \njudge, Bob continually challenged himself, presiding in many difficult \nand controversial cases and always working to make laws to serve the \npeople of Connecticut.\n  He constantly made the time to give back to future generations of \nlawyers, teaching courses such as Constitutional Law at Trinity \nCollege, Liberties of an American at the University of Hartford, \nAdministrative Law at the University of Connecticut's Graduate School \nof Political Science, and the Development of Social Policy at Yale \nUniversity. Bob is a legend at the University of Connecticut Law \nSchool, where he taught a Legislative Process course for 27 years.\n  Bob achieved national renown, but was also well known personally \nthroughout his local community, participating in informal groups, \nincluding book, poker, and writing clubs. In his last column for the \nConnecticut Law Tribune, ``The Last Word on a Long, Rich Life,'' Bob \nwrote of his appreciation for practicing law in Hartford as opposed to \nNew York City where he started out his legal career. In the greater \nHartford area, Bob wrote, ``I found time to participate in the \ncommunity.'' He created the Hartford Community Renewal Team, which was \nHartford's first agency dedicated exclusively to combatting poverty, \nand in his last published newspaper column, he wrote that he ``would \ndrop any legal matter to come to its assistance.''\n  This humanity is clearly evident in Bob's essays and books--true \ngifts to future generations. When he turned 90, he wrote in the \nHartford Courant: ``Internally, I am a bunch of memories of people I've \nknown, events I've experienced, books I've read and poems I can still \nrecite. More and more I live in that interior space, recalling the \npast. When I die, that presence and circuitry will vanish.'' \nRespectfully, my own view is that his memories will endure through the \nfamily and friends that adore him, his legal accomplishments will \nwithstand time, and his ``presence and circuitry'' will be ever \nvibrant.\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\n  Although he served Connecticut for more than 5 decades, Bob's \ncontributions were immeasurable. Connecticut has lost a great mind, \nteacher, and integral part of its political and progressive \ninfrastructure. Connecticut and the Nation will never forget this great \nman. He lives on through his words and his tremendous acts of vision \nand courage as well as his passion for life, the law, and the State of \nConnecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2723-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    2012 INTEL SCIENCE TALENT SEARCH\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the seven \nConnecticut students who have been named 2012 Intel Science Talent \nSearch semifinalists. This elite, national competition seeks to honor \nhigh school students who excel in a science or math research project in \norder to ``highlight the need for improved math and science education \nin the United States.'' Beginning in 1942, the Society for Science and \nthe Public, SSP, has partnered with Westinghouse and then in 1998 with \nthe Intel Corporation to offer this opportunity for young scientists \nand mathematicians. These 7 students from Connecticut have been \nselected from over 1,500 applications from around the country, and I am \nproud that they represent Greenwich, Guilford, Hamden, Lakeville, \nWallingford, and Woodbridge Counties. Their hard work, motivation, and \ncuriosity gives me great pride and hope in their ability to change the \nworld. Using their intelligence, ideas, and passion, they can help \nsolve some of our Nation's most pressing issues.\n  Student Zizi Yu from Amity Regional High School observed the severe \nfood allergies experienced by some of her peers. Through a survey and a \ncase controlled study, she took a closer look at what has been commonly \ncalled the hygiene hypothesis, finding a correlation between the age of \nexposure to certain foods and substances and the prevalence of \nallergies later in life. After being named a semifinalist on January \n25, 2012, Zizi was selected as one of 40 finalists and traveled to \nWashington, DC, in March to meet with national leaders to present her \nfindings.\n  William Bennett Hallisey and Ryota Ishizuka took a unique, \nindependent science research class at Greenwich High School, where they \nwere inspired to experiment with the intersection of biology and \nenvironmental studies. After learning about research conducted at \nStanford University, William adjusted the materials previously used in \nexperimentation and examined how silver nanoparticles and felt \nsubstrates could serve as an easily transportable, low-cost, and user-\nfriendly filtration system, removing about 95 percent of a system's \nbacteria. Ryota Ishizuka looked at ways to harness the potential of \nmicrobial fuel cells to generate electricity through hydrogen output. \nShe found that she could create a fully autonomous water treatment \nsystem, powering a wastewater treatment reactor, by the reactions of \nbacteria found in the wastewater itself.\n  Guilford High School's Yuning Zhang used this competition, in \nconjunction with work at Yale University's School of Medicine, to \nexpress his interest in biomedical research. According to his advanced \nplacement biology teacher, Ruth Heckman, Yuning is ``so excited about \ndoing research and wants to make it his future.'' After isolating \nkidney cells, growing them in enriched cultures, and staining and \ncharacterizing them, he compared these samples to non-selectively grown \ncells. He found that there was an over 70 percent increase in the \namount of stem cells that would grow from selectively grown cells, \nwhich has incredible future applications for injury repairing and wound \nhealing.\n  Aaron Shim of Choate Rosemary Hall used computer models and an \nopportunity to work alongside Yale chemistry professors to study \norgano-\nmetallic complexes and their possible applications for renewable \nenergy. His goal was to further refine the modeling methods of these \ncomplexes in order to expedite our understanding and utilization of the \nway hydrogen is stored in fuel cells. Over the course of his research, \nAaron was motivated by and hopes to explore in the future how computers \ncan help ``us understand a little bit more about the natural world \naround us, helping solve real-world problems through their rather \nabstract power of mathematics and computation.''\n  Hailing from Hamden High School, Yiyuan Hu examined MyD88--a protein \ninvolved in the body's immune system--and its role in DNA damage \nresponse. Through novel research of infectious diseases as part of Dr. \nAlbert Shaw's laboratory at Yale University's School of Medicine, \nYiyuan helped discover unexpected new applications for MyD88 to counter \ndiseases tied to chemicals that help kill bacteria but can also damage \nDNA. Yiyuan has even inspired other students at Hamden High School to \nbecome excited about research and involved in the school's science \nclub.\n  Student Seung Hyun Lee contemplated the Steiner ratio problem as part \nof an independent study project in conjunction with his math instructor \nat his high school, the Hotchkiss School, and Hofstra University's \nProfessor Dan Ismailescu. Seung experimented with the field of \ncombination optimization, a study that combines math and theoretical \ncomputer science, with the aim to advance our understanding of the \nSteiner ratio problem.\n  The success of these talented young adults is a testament to the care \nand dedication of the teachers, mentors, and administrators who \nnurtured them and their projects, giving the time and space for \ncreativity, problem-solving, and experimentation. Even though the Intel \nScience Competition has strict rules about independent student work, \nthese brilliant mentors inspire their students to spend their free time \nresearching new ideas and thinking big thoughts.\n  Greenwich High School's independent science research class is taught \nby Andy Bramante, who left a 15-year career as a chemical engineer and \nchemist to inspire high school students to love research. An advanced \nplacement biology teacher at Guilford High School and educator for 36 \nyears, Ruth Heckman was excited to report that she gets to learn from \nstudents like Yuning Zhang. Zizi's research was guided by Deborah Day, \nscience research teacher at Amity Regional High School. Kevin Rogers, \nthe head of the science department and chemistry teacher at Choate \nRosemary Hall, helped Aaron Shim work with an outside group at Yale \nUniversity in furtherance of his research. Similarly, the instructor of \nmathematics at the Hotchkiss School, Marta Eso, worked with Seung Hyun \nLee to complete an independent study research project at his high \nschool and also at Hofstra University. And Sonia Beloin, teacher and \nadviser to the Science Bowl and Science Olympiad clubs at Hamden High \nSchool, mentored Yiyuan Hu, helping to facilitate his successful work \nat the Section of Infectious Diseases at Yale School of Medicine and \nsupporting him to improve his presentation over time.\n  Several of these students were invited to join high-level study on \ntheir chosen topics at several select universities. Yuning Zhang, Aaron \nShim, and Yiyuan Hu were invited into cutting-edge laboratories at Yale \nUniversity. Yuning worked with Dr. Gilbert Moeckel, the director of the \nRenal Pathology and Electron Microscopy Laboratory at Yale University's \nSchool of Medicine. After reading some of their papers, Aaron was \ninvited to join Professor Victor S. Batista's research team at Yale \nUniversity's Department of Chemistry.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the Stamford \nYoung Artists Philharmonic, SYAP, and most especially, Salvatore\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nPrinciotti, SYAP's beloved founder and conductor, who is retiring after \n52 years.\n  Currently, SYAP runs eight different ensembles for a wide range of \nages, including the advanced Young Artists Philharmonic, an \nintermediate level orchestra, a string ensemble, flute choirs, jazz \ngroups, and a Summer Jazz Workshop that draws student musicians from \naround the country.\n  SYAP has become closely connected to the Stamford area community. Its \nmembers are artistic ambassadors, sharing their love of music as a \ncommon language and source of connection with all of Connecticut. \nThrough both classical and jazz programming, the SYAP shares different \nstyles of music in venues around Stamford--outreach through plush \nmelodies and moving rhythms--holding performances, for example, at \nStamford Town Center, such as the popular outdoor concert series, Jazz \non the Plaza.\n  Committed to a strong tradition of giving back to the less fortunate, \nthe SYAP has partnered with the Union Baptist Church in Stamford where, \nin exchange for rehearsal space, it held an annual holiday concert \nwhose proceeds benefited the church's senior members. In addition, the \nPhilharmonic partners with the Waterside School in their Outreach \nString Program, offering lessons to students who cannot afford \ninstruments.\n  SYAP's level of musicianship is first-rate as demonstrated by its \nrelationship with the Stamford Symphony, which mentors the young \nmusicians, sharing performances and giving workshops. However, the \nsurest indicator of the high level of musicianship is the leadership \nand 52 dedicated years of the enormously talented violinist and \nconductor, Maestro Princiotti.\n  Sal Princiotti, or ``the Prince,'' as he is called by the orchestra \nmembers, has dedicated a half a century to enhancing the lives of young \nmusicians, inspiring a passion for melody with specific performances as \ntemporary goals, but with overall experience as his motivating \nprinciple. Mr. Princiotti brings enormous talent to the SYAP as a \ngraduate of the Juilliard School and past soloist at Tanglewood Music \nFestival under world-renown conductors Leonard Bernstein and Charles \nMunch. In addition to founding and leading the SYAP, and conducting the \nRidgefield Symphony and Stamford Symphony, Mr. Princiotti maintains a \nbusy, private teaching practice and has directed the string programs \nfor the Greenwich and Darien school systems.\n  Under Mr. Princiotti's baton, the SYAP has performed for many \nsignificant commemorations, including the New York World's Fair in \n1964, the rededication of the Statue of Liberty, and a program for \nPresident George H.W. Bush. In addition to enriching our Nation's \nhistory, Mr. Princiotti has ensured that his groups of musicians give \nback to their country through annual holiday concerts at Grand Central \nStation for AmeriCares. He has also expanded the horizons of the SYAP, \nbringing them to Italy in 2001 and 2006 on an international tour. He is \nthe author of a book--The Heart of Music--which explores the art of \nmusic education.\n  I am in the company of many others who have demonstrated their \nappreciation of Mr. Princiotti. He was the 2000 recipient of the Film \nand Arts Bravo Network Award, the 1987 Stamford Community Arts Council \nArts Award, and has been inducted into the Stamford High School Wall of \nFame. Mr. Princiotti holds the keys to the City of Stamford, and is a \nmost treasured member of the Stamford area and the State of \nConnecticut.\n  ``The Prince's'' final concert will be held on May 6, 2012, at the \nPalace Theater in Stamford, CT, where friends, family, alumni of the \norchestra, and current young artists of this esteemed group will spend \nhours wrapped in melodic memory in celebration of more than 50 years of \nartistry, education, and true connection. At this event, a scholarship \nfund and chair will be dedicated in Mr. Princiotti's honor. I can say \nwith certainty that there is no need for a chair for the Maestro to be \nremembered for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2724-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JEROME D. SCHNYDMAN\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jerome D. \nSchnydman who will be retiring on June 30 from Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. Jerome has spent his adult years at Johns Hopkins, first as \na student and All-American lacrosse player, graduating in 1967, then as \nan assistant lacrosse coach from 1968 until 1978, when he rose from \nassistant director to become the director of undergraduate admissions \nfor the schools of Arts and Sciences and Engineering. He went on to \nserve as executive director of the Office of Alumni Relations and, most \nrecently, as the secretary to the board of trustees and executive \nassistant to the president of Johns Hopkins.\n  If you count Jerome's stint as captain of the 1967 National \nChampionship Lacrosse Team, he has served Johns Hopkins University for \n4\\1/2\\ decades and he has done so with grace, intelligence, compassion, \nand distinction. He received the Alexander K. Barton Cup for ``strong \ncharacter, high ideals, and effective moral leadership'' upon \ngraduating. In 1998, he was inducted into the Johns Hopkins Athletic \nHall of Fame. In 2003, he was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall \nof Fame.\n  There will be 10 different disciplines at the University honoring \nJerome Schnydman for his distinguished service. That is no surprise: he \nhas been the ``go-to'' guy for everyone and everything. Generations of \nHopkins students, faculty, and staff on any of the University's \ncampuses--from Homewood to East Baltimore; from Bayview to SAIS in \nWashington, D.C.; from Bologna to Shanghai--all know of Jerome and the \nfine work he has done on their behalf and on behalf of the University. \nWhether someone works in the Homewood garage or is a Nobel Laureate \nexploring the cure for cancer, he or she counts Jerome as a friend. He \nhas great respect for the institution, and especially for those who \nwork each day to create and sustain the ``Hopkins family.''\n  I am proud to say that Jerome and his wife Tammy, a special education \nteacher, are personal friends. Their children--Becky and her husband \nLarry, and Andy and his wife Nancy--and their grandchildren--Sophie, \nJason, Tucker, and Cassidy--are an integral part of Baltimore. When \nJerome retires from Johns Hopkins University, he is excited about \nserving as the president of his synagogue, Beth El, and spending more \ntime with his family and friends in Baltimore and Bethany Beach.\n  I ask my colleagues to recognize the enormous contributions that \nJerome has made to the Johns Hopkins University and Baltimore \ncommunities and to wish him well in his well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2724-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2724-S2725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE GELATO FIASCO\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in anticipation of the warm spring \nweather upon us and the long summer days ahead in my home State of \nMaine, our thoughts quickly turn towards fun in the sun and cool \nrefreshing treats. Today, I rise to commend and recognize The Gelato \nFiasco, located in Brunswick, ME, for developing and growing a niche \nmarket serving delectable frozen gelato treats while expanding and \ncreating economic opportunities across the State.\n  In 2002, the founders of The Gelato Fiasco, Josh Davis and Bruno \nTropeano, were students at Bentley University in Waltham, MA, and \ndreamed of starting their own company and becoming successful \nentrepreneurs. As the two students spent their time exploring various \nventures, this team decided to open a homemade gelato store as a result \nof being dissatisfied with the gelato options available to them \nthroughout the Northeast.\n  Made mostly from milk and sugar, gelato has less fat than standard \nice cream and also contains less air, making the final product denser. \nTaking advantage of the small gelato market that existed with an \nestimated 1,500 gelaterias total in the United States Bruno and Josh \nsaw an opportunity to market a superior version of the delicious \nItalian treat. Determined to serve a top quality gelato, The Gelato \nFiasco features only the best local ingredients available.\n  In these uncertain economic times, as young entrepreneurs, Josh and\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nBruno faced unique challenges while attempting to accomplish their \ndream and receive funding for their first store. Initially, they \npursued loans from about 20 banks but were turned down by all of them. \nHowever, with persistence and determination, they were able to acquire \na $225,000 SBA-backed loan which covered the majority of their startup \ncosts.\n  Their premier store, The Gelato Fiasco, opened in 2007, and has \nserved more than 450 flavors since its start. Even with the complex \nchallenges of trying to grow during these tough economic times, Bruno \nand Josh's initial success allowed them to garner additional support \nfrom Coastal Enterprises Inc., CEI, a local community development \nfinancial institution. CEI granted this small business a $140,000 loan \nthrough a new crowdfunding initiative established by Starbucks CEO \nHoward Schultz called ``Create Jobs for USA.'' The Gelato Fiasco \nutilized these critical funds to expand to a second location in \nPortland, ME, buy equipment, and hire at least 10 new employees to help \nstaff it.\n  As this small firm continues to grow, introducing more customers to \ntheir gelato treat, the shop diligently produces 25 to 35 different \nflavors each morning in their store. Despite the tumultuous economy, \nJosh and Bruno remain focused on ensuring the fun-loving experience and \nquality of their gelato are consistent. Their remarkable vision has \nbecome a reality as their Italian style ice cream has continued to find \nits way throughout Maine and New England in various coffeehouses, \nrestaurants, and grocery freezer cases.\n  Despite difficult economic times and the obstacles faced by young \nentrepreneurs, the dynamic duo of Bruno Tropeano and Josh Davis has \nclearly fostered a winning strategy. I am proud to extend my praise to \nJosh and Bruno and everyone at The Gelato Fiasco for their \nentrepreneurial spirit and successful company. I offer my best wishes \nfor their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2725-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2725-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2725-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 491.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing \n     Congress to reject the recommendations of the United States \n     Department of Defense to remove the A 10 Thunderbolt II force \n     from the 127th Wing of the Air National Guard at Selfridge \n     Air National Guard Base; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 211\n\n       Whereas, The federal mission of the Air National Guard is \n     to maintain well-trained, well-equipped units available for \n     prompt mobilization during war and to provide assistance \n     during national emergencies; and\n       Whereas, The Michigan Air National Guard exemplifies this \n     federal mission and provides well-trained citizen-airmen to \n     the United States Air Force; and\n       Whereas, Utilizing the highly-trained and experienced \n     citizen-airmen of the Michigan Air National Guard is \n     significantly more economical for the United States \n     Department of Defense than utilizing active military units; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Michigan Air National Guard provides \n     protection of life and property, and preserves peace, order, \n     and public safety in the state of Michigan, by providing \n     emergency relief support during natural disasters; conducting \n     search and rescue operations; providing support to civil \n     defense authorities; and maintaining vital public services \n     and counterdrug operations in the state; and\n       Whereas, The Michigan Air National Guard, being the air \n     force militia of the state, has a long and proud history with \n     the state of Michigan; and\n       Whereas, The Selfridge Air National Guard Base dates back \n     to 1917, and currently hosts 20 units from all branches of \n     the United States military, as well as the United States \n     Coast Guard and the United States Customs and Border Patrol; \n     and\n       Whereas, The 127th Wing flies KC 135 Stratotankers, which \n     provide aerial refueling capabilities around the globe in \n     support of Air Mobility Command, and A 10 Thunderbolt 11, \n     which provide support to Air Combat Command. Additionally, \n     the 127th Wing supports the Air Force Special Operations \n     Command with its 107th Weather Flight; and\n       Whereas, The A 10 Thunderbolt II mission was transferred to \n     Selfridge Air National Guard Base from the Battle Creek Air \n     National Guard Base following the 2005 Base Realignment and \n     Closure Commission recommendations; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Defense has proposed the removal \n     of all 24 of the A 10 Thunderbolt II aircraft from the 127th \n     Wing and replacing them with four additional KC 135 \n     Stratotankers; and\n       Whereas, Approximately 650 personnel are attached to the A-\n     I0 Thunderbolt 11 mission; and\n       Whereas, It is unknown how many support personnel will be \n     necessary to service the additional KC 35 Stratotankers; and\n       Whereas, Removing the A 10 Thunderbolt II mission could \n     affect more than 600 families in and around Macomb County; \n     and\n       Whereas, The removal of the A 10 Thunderbolt 11 mission \n     could make the Selfridge Air National Guard Base vulnerable \n     to closure in future Base Realignment and Closure Commission \n     recommendations; and\n       Whereas, The Selfridge Air National Guard Base is one of \n     the busiest, most diverse military installations in the \n     United States, encompassing approximately 680 buildings, \n     runways measuring 9,000 and 4,870 feet, over a million square \n     yards of taxiway and paved aircraft parking ramps, 39 miles \n     of paved roads, and seven miles of railroad track; and\n       Whereas, Recent military construction improvements to \n     Selfridge include $5.2 million to replace the Control Tower/\n     Radar Approach Control Center and $9.8 million for an \n     infrastructure upgrade; and\n       Whereas, The Selfridge Air National Guard Base is essential \n     to the local economy, as nearly 3,000 full-time civilian and \n     military personnel work at the base, in addition to \n     approximately 3,000 members of the Air and Army National \n     Guard and the reserve components of the United States \n     military who are stationed at the base; and\n       Whereas, Portions of the Selfridge Air National Guard Base \n     have previously been targeted for closure in 1995 and 2005; \n     and\n       Whereas, The defense industry is vital to the economy of \n     Macomb County; and\n       Whereas, The loss of the Selfridge Air National Guard Base \n     will have a significant impact on the local community, with \n     the loss of employment positions, local revenue, and a \n     significant source of community pride; and\n       Whereas, The military presence in Michigan has already been \n     significantly reduced by the United States Department of \n     Defense with the 1977 decision to close Kincheloe Air Force \n     Base in Chippewa County, the 1991 decision to close the \n     Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Iosco County, the 1993 decision \n     to close the K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base in Marquette County, \n     and the 2005 decision to close the United States Army \n     Garrison at Selfridge Air National Guard Base; and\n       Whereas, Losses to the 127th Wing of the Air National Guard \n     at Selfridge Air National Guard Base will have immeasurable \n     consequences for the state of Michigan, both in terms of \n     economic ramifications, as well as in terms of community \n     pride and disaster readiness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     Congress of the United States to reject the United States \n     Department of Defense recommendations to remove the A 10 \n     Thunderbolt II aircraft from the 127th Wing of the Air \n     National Guard at Selfridge Air National Guard Base; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Secretary of Defense, President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\n     House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 78. A memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State \n     of Florida, memorializing Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank \n     Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010; to \n     the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Memorial No. 1778\n\n       Whereas, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \n     and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, and\n       Whereas, the stated purposes of the act are ``To promote \n     the financial stability of the United States by improving \n     accountability and transparency in the financial system, to \n     end `too big to fail,' to protect the American taxpayer by \n     ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial \n     Services practices . . .,'' and\n       Whereas, the act's almost 2,400 pages of federal \n     legislation increases the size of the Federal Government by \n     creating 13 new regulatory agencies requiring 2,600 new \n     positions while abolishing only one agency, and\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that the \n     cost for companies to implement the act over the next 5 years \n     will be approximately $2.9 billion, and other groups estimate \n     that the broader economic costs of the act could approach $1 \n     trillion, and\n       Whereas, the extensive regulations imposed by the Dodd-\n     Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will \n     severely damage the ability of American companies to compete \n     internationally with foreign companies or even create \n     American jobs, and\n       Whereas, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n     Protection Act is an inadequate response to the financial \n     devastation that began in 2008, in part because it has given \n     unfair advantages to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \n     Corporation (``Freddie Mac'') and the Federal National \n     Mortgage Association (``Fannie Mae''), institutions that were \n     substantial contributors to the financial crisis, and,\n       Whereas, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n     Protection Act was championed as creating the most \n     significant financial regulatory reform since the Great \n     Depression, but, in contrast, it has become a radical \n     expansion of federal regulation, vests unprecedented power in \n     the hands of unelected bureaucrats, increases the likelihood \n     that there will be more taxpayer bailouts, has not \n     strengthened the economy or brought stability to the troubled \n     housing market, and does nothing to address the most \n     elemental causes that created the financial crisis of 2008: \n     Now, therefore, be it Resolved, by the Legislature of the \n     State of Florida: That the Congress of the United States is \n     urged to repeal the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act of 2010; be it further\n       Resolved, that copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 79.

Goldwater range, among \n     others, to accomplish this goal; and\n       Whereas, Department of Defense officials indicate that \n     heightened focus on the application of environmental statutes \n     has affected the use of its training areas; and\n       Whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, \n     especially the Endangered Species Act (ESA), has caused some \n     training activities to be canceled, postponed or modified; \n     and\n       Whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, \n     particularly the ESA, has forced military officials to make \n     adjustments to training regimens, including requiring units \n     in training to avoid areas with ESA restrictions; and\n       Whereas, since 2003, the Department of Defense has obtained \n     exemptions from three environmental laws and sought \n     exemptions from three others; and\n       Whereas, these exemptions allow the military to maintain \n     its high state of readiness and help to ensure its ability to \n     meet unexpected threats; and\n       Whereas, these exemptions are under increased scrutiny by \n     environmental groups and federal officials who would rather \n     protect wildlife than allow the military to maintain its \n     readiness; and\n       Whereas, a GAO report found no instances in which the \n     Department of Defense's use of exemptions from the ESA or the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act has adversely affected the \n     environment; and\n       Whereas, the United States military has proven itself to be \n     a responsible and effective steward of the land and \n     environment.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress enact legislation \n     exempting United States military bases and training \n     facilities from the regulations and restrictions of the \n     Endangered Species Act.\n       2.

to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 57\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor Social Security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned Social \n     Security benefit for any person who also receives a public \n     pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a person who \n     had worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of Congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, nine out of ten public employees affected by the \n     GPO lose their entire spousal benefits, even though their \n     spouses paid Social Security taxes for many years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO often reduces spousal benefits so \n     significantly it makes the difference between self-\n     sufficiency and poverty; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on thousands of \n     citizens and undermines the original purpose of the Social \n     Security dependent/survivor benefit; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively impacts approximately 28,825 \n     Louisianians; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking individuals to lose a \n     significant portion of the Social Security benefits that they \n     earn themselves; and\n       Whereas, the WEP negatively impacts approximately 27,755 \n     Louisianians; and\n       Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and the WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation and because of \n     the longer life expectancy of women; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong, yet the current GPO and WEP provisions \n     compromise that quality of life; and\n       Whereas, retired individuals negatively affected by GPO and \n     WEP have significantly less money to support their basic \n     needs and sometimes have to turn to government assistance \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and the WEP penalize individuals who have \n     dedicated their lives to public service by taking away \n     benefits they have earned; and\n       Whereas, our nation should respect, not penalize, public \n     servants; and\n       Whereas, the number of people affected by GPO and WEP is \n     growing every day as more and more people reach retirement \n     age;\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established in federal law, \n     and repeal of the GPO and the WEP can only be enacted by the \n     United States Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     Government\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\n     Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision Social \n     Security benefit reductions and to consider eliminating or \n     reducing them by enacting the Social Security Fairness Act of \n     2011 (H.R. 1332), the Public Servant Retirement Protection \n     Act of 2011 (S. 113), or a similar instrument; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 81.

That the Wyoming Legislature call on all \n     Americans to defend our freedom of religion by opposing this \n     mandate.\n       Section 2.

That, in order to secure the border between the United \n     States and Mexico, to enhance the security of people and \n     their property in the currently unsecure regions of the \n     border and to increase economic growth and stability for the \n     residents of Arizona, the Legislature:\n       1. Supports the increase of Border Patrol personnel as \n     called for in the Restore Our Border (ROB) Security Plan in \n     the Tucson sector along the border between the United States \n     and Mexico.\n       2. Supports the increase of Customs Field Office personnel \n     at the ports of entry in Nogales, Douglas and Yuma, Arizona.\n       B.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging Congress to adopt a Veterans \n     Remembered Flag; to the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Memorial No. 1007\n\n       Whereas, there are flags for all branches of the armed \n     services and there is a flag for POWs and MIAs, but there is \n     no flag to honor the millions of former military personnel \n     who have served our nation; and\n       Whereas, a flag is a symbol of recognition for a group or \n     an ideal. Veterans comprise a group and certainly represent \n     an ideal, and surely they deserve their own symbol; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that 20,400,000 veterans, \n     affiliated and unaffiliated with veterans' organizations, who \n     have served in our nation's military comprise a significant \n     portion of our country's population; and\n       Whereas, a Veterans Remembered Flag would memorialize and \n     honor all past, present and future veterans and provide an \n     enduring symbol to support tomorrow's veterans today; and\n       Whereas, displaying and flying this flag would validate the \n     lives of millions of individuals who have served our country \n     in times of war, peace and national crisis; and\n       Whereas, the Veterans Remembered Flag would fill the void \n     of a flag to honor all veterans who have served in our \n     country's armed forces; and\n       Whereas, the symbolism of this unique flag's design would \n     be all-inclusive and would pay respect to the history of our \n     nation and to all branches of the military, and would honor \n     those who have served or died in the service of our nation; \n     and\n       Whereas, the design of the Veterans Remembered Flag does \n     all of the following:\n       1. Depicts the founding of our nation through the 13 stars \n     that emanate from the hoist of the flag and march to the \n     large red star that represents our nation and the five \n     branches of our country's military that defend her: the Army, \n     Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.\n       2. The white star indicates a veteran's dedication to \n     service.\n       3. The blue star honors all men and women who have ever \n     served in our country's military.\n       4. The gold star memorializes those who have fallen while \n     defending our nation.\n       5. The blue stripe that bears the title of the flag honors \n     the loyalty of veterans to our nation, flag and government.\n       6. The green field represents the hallowed ground where all \n     rest eternally.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress adopt a Veterans \n     Remembered Flag as described in this Memorial.\n       2.

According to the SBA, as of February 15, 2012, the \n$50 billion in 504 loans has created over 2 million jobs. The \nrefinancing option in the Small Business Jobs Act authorized $7.5 \nbillion in refinancing until September 27, 2012. Unfortunately, because \nof a delay in promulgating regulations to enable refinancing, the \nprogram did not become operational until a few months ago, \nsignificantly shortening the period of time that business could \nrefinance existing 504 loans. The 504 loan program also comes at no \ncost to taxpayers, has created jobs and will provide much needed relief \nto businesses for one additional year.\n  America's small business owners face a daunting business life cycle \nthat is volatile at best: according to the SBA, while seven out of 10 \nnew employer firms survive for at least 2 years, only \\1/3\\ of these \nfirms exist after 10 years. These failure rates are quite constant for \ndifferent industries. Yet one factor that is a bell-weather for success \nis access to capital. The SBA identifies the\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nmajor factors in a firm's survivability as including: an ample supply \nof capital, being large enough to have employees, the owner's education \nlevel, and the owner's reason for starting the firm.\n  Clearly, the drive of an entrepreneur is a major factor in start-ups \nwhere statistics from the 2008 ``Report to the President on the Small \nBusiness Economy'' delivered by SBA's Office of Advocacy, show that in \n2005, more than 12 million individuals were involved in starting 7 \nmillion ventures. After six years, only one third of entrepreneurs have \na working business despite the fact that they put in 9.9 billion hours \nof uncompensated time in 2005 launching their businesses. These \nuncompensated hours represented 2.7 percent of total paid work in the \nUnited States that year and almost one half of the hours for all \nAmerican self-employed workers. That is an incredible effort of time \nand talent and a show of great risk taking.\n  A number of small businesses utilize 504 loans as long-term, fixed-\nrate financing used to acquire fixed assets for expansion or \nmodernization. These 504 loans are made available through Certified \nDevelopment Companies, CDCs, SBA's community based partners for \nproviding 504 loans. The 504 loan program offers small businesses both \nimmediate and long-term benefits, so business owners can focus on \ngrowing their business. These benefits include 90 percent financing, \nlonger loan amortizations, no balloon payments, fixed-rate interest \nrates, and savings that result in improved cash flow for small \nbusinesses.\n  Generally, a business must create or retain one job for every $65,000 \nguaranteed by the SBA under this program. Small manufacturers must \ncreate or retain a ratio of one job for every $100,000 guaranteed. In \naddition, the 504 program serves to revitalize a business district, \nexpand exports, promote small businesses owned and controlled by women, \nminorities and veterans, especially service-disabled veterans, aid \nrural development, and increase productivity and competitiveness.\n  As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the 504 program is a job \ncreator that does not receive any appropriated funds. The 1-year \nextension of the refinancing for the 504 loan program will allow \nbusinesses to retain employees and it also comes at zero cost to \ntaxpayers. These are solid measures that will help small businesses at \na time when many small enterprises are struggling to keep their \nemployees and run basic operations. I ask my colleagues to support this \nlegislation as swiftly as possible, as our Nation's capital-starved \nsmall businesses deserve no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Kyl, \n        Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Barrasso, Mrs. \n        Hutchison Mr. Blunt, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Coats, and \n        Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 2366. A bill to extend student loan interest rates for \nundergraduate Federal Direct Stafford Loans; placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit more \nspecifically this morning about the issue of interest rates on student \nloans. President Obama is busy this week traveling to campuses across \nAmerica to talk about student loans. It is a noble goal to talk about \nmaking it easier for students to afford college. It is a goal we all \nshare.\n  But I am afraid the President is not telling the whole story. Because \nif he were to tell the whole story, what he would have to tell the \nstudents is that the principal reason for the rise in tuition at public \ncolleges and universities and community colleges across America and the \nprincipal reason for the increase in student loans is President Obama \nhimself and his own health care policies.\n  To be fair, he did not start many of these policies. They have been \ngoing on for a good while. But he has made them worse over the last \nseveral years. When the new health care law goes into effect in 2014, \nwith its new mandates on States, we will find an exaggeration of what \nhas already been happening, which is that Federal health care mandates \non States are soaking up the money States otherwise would spend on the \nUniversity of Oklahoma, and Tennessee, and the State University of New \nYork.\n  When States do not support their public colleges and universities, \nwhich is where approximately three-quarters of our college students \nattend, then their only choice is either to become more efficient, to \ndecrease their quality or to raise tuition. Most of them are trying to \ndo all three.\n  So Federal health care policies are the main reason tuition is up, \nand the reason tuition is up is the main reason debt is up. \nSpecifically, what we are talking about, and what the President has \nbeen talking about, is a 3.4-percent interest rate for some student \nloans.\n  Here are some facts about that. The President has proposed that for 1 \nyear, for new Stafford subsidized loans, rates would remain at 3.4 \npercent. Governor Romney agrees with him. I agree with him. So there is \nsubstantial support from both the President and his probable Republican \nopponent in the Presidential race for this next year. New loans, after \nJuly 1, which are now at 3.4 percent, would stay at 3.4 percent. The \nbenefit to students who get the advantage of that lower rate--most \nother loans are at 6.8 percent by law--is about $7 a month, according \nto the Congressional Research Service.\n  All this talk is about offering students the benefit of about $7 a \nmonth for new loans. It is important to notice that no student who has \na 3.4-percent loan today will see his or her interest rate go up. I \nwill say that again. If you have a loan and you are going to the \nUniversity of North Carolina and are paying 3.4 percent today, your \nrate will not go up on July 1. The law only affects new loans, and it \ndoesn't affect 60 percent of loans. For 60 percent of those getting new \nloans after July 1, they will continue to pay the 6.8 percent set by \nCongress a long time ago.\n  I am glad the President is bringing this issue up, because the real \ndriver of higher tuition and higher interest rates is the President's \nown policies--in two ways: The government and congressional Democrats \nwho passed the health care law are actually overcharging students--all \nstudents--on student loans and using some of the money to pay for the \nhealth care law. These aren't just my figures. The CBO said when the \nnew health care law passed, Congress took $61 billion of so-called \nsavings--I call them profits on student loans--and it spent $10 billion \nto reduce the debt, $8.7 billion on the health care law, and the rest \non Pell grants.\n  How does that work? How could Congress be overcharging students? \nWell, under the health care law, the government borrows money at 2.8 \npercent. The government then loans to students at 6.8 percent. That \nproduces a profit. The Congressional Budget Office has said that the \nCongress could have lowered the interest rate from 6.8 to 5.3 percent \nand save all students $2,200 over the life of their average 10-year \nloan. I am introducing legislation today on my behalf and on behalf of \nothers called the Student Interest Rate Reduction Act. This law \nproposes to keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent for subsidized \nStafford loans beginning July 1 of this year, just as the President and \nGovernor Romney proposed. We will pay for that by taking back the money \nthat the Congress overcharged students on their student loans under the \nhealth care law.\n  This 1-year solution, as I said, will save students about $7 a month \non interest payments on their new loans, or about $83 a year. It will \ncost the taxpayers about $6 billion, which will be paid for by \nreductions in savings from the new health care law.\n  Let's talk a moment about the real cost of tuition and student debt \ngoing up--that is, Federal health care policies. When I was Governor of \nTennessee in the 1980s, the same thing would happen every year as I \nmade up my State budget, and it is happening today in every State \ncapital in America. I would work through all the things we had to fund \nwith State tax dollars--the roads, the schools, the prisons, and the \nvarious State agencies. Then I would get down to the end of the \nbudgeting process and have some money left. The choice would always be \nbetween Medicaid and higher education--our public colleges and \nuniversities. I spent my whole 8 years as Governor trying to keep the \namount we gave to Medicaid down so that I could increase the\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\namount for colleges and universities, because I thought that was the \nfuture of our State.\n  In fact, we had a formula then that said if you went to a public \ncollege or university, the taxpayer would pay for 70 percent of it and \nthe student would pay for 30 percent. If we raised your tuition, we \nwould raise the State's share. We kept that 70/30. That is now turned \ncompletely around in Tennessee, where it is closer to 30/70 now; the \nstudent pays 30 percent and the taxpayers pay nearly 70 percent. This \nshift is because Medicaid mandates from Washington on every State have \nforced Governors and legislatures to take the money they would \notherwise spend for public colleges and universities and spend it \ninstead for Medicaid. As a result, State colleges and universities have \nless money, and to get more money, they must raise tuition.\n  When tuition goes up at the University of California, and you see \nstudents protesting, the reason is because of Washington. As I said, \nPresident Obama didn't invent this problem--this is a 30-year old \nproblem--but he has made it worse. He made it worse with laws that say \nwhen States have less money, they have to spend more on Medicaid. If \nthey are told from Washington to spend more on Medicaid, even though \nthey have less revenues, they are going to spend less on something \nelse. So they spend less on the University of California, or the State \nUniversity of New York, or the University of Tennessee.\n  Last year in Tennessee, State funding for Medicaid went up 16 percent \nin actual dollars; as a result, State funding for community colleges \nand the University of Tennessee went down 15 percent in real cuts. That \nwas not a cut in growth. That was a real cut. What did the state \ncolleges and universities do? They raised tuition 8 percent. What did \nstudents do? They borrowed more money.\n  I have been trying to get this point across ever since I became a \nSenator. I said during the health care debate that everybody who voted \nfor it ought to be sentenced to serve as Governor for 8 years in his or \nher State so they would understand this problem.\n  We cannot continue to order the States to spend more for Medicaid and \nexpect our great colleges and universities to be affordable and \ncontinue to be the best in the world. That is the real reason why \ntuition is going up and loans are going up.\n  Here are the facts. There are still good options for students. I \nmentioned earlier that the average cost of tuition at a 4-year public \nuniversity in America is about $8,200. For a community college, it is \naround $3,000. There are many scholarships to help them go there. It is \ntrue that loans are going up to very high levels. It is true that there \nare some abuses here and there--within the for-profit and other parts \nof the higher education system. But it is also true that in the United \nStates we not only have some of the best colleges and universities in \nthe world, we have almost all of them. Many of them are public colleges \nand universities. They are at risk today. Why? Because of Federal \nhealth care policies that are hamstringing States and soaking up the \nmoney that States should be using to fund the universities of this \ncountry and the community colleges of this country.\n  Mr. President, again, I am introducing today the Student Loan \nInterest Rate Reduction Act. It addresses exactly the subject President \nObama is talking about on the campaign trail these days. How do we keep \nthe interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans, the new loans that \nbegan July 1--how do we keep that at 3.4 percent for 1 year? Governor \nRomney supports that. President Obama supports that. I support that. \nThe only difference is how we pay for it. It will cost $6 billion.\n  Our friends on the Democratic side have come up with their usual \nmethods of paying for it: They are going to raise taxes on small \nbusiness and people who create jobs.\n  We have a little better idea on this side, which is, let's take the \n$8.7 billion back that the Federal Government overcharges students on \nstudent loans today to help pay for the health care law and give it \nback to the students, and let's extend this for 1 year. That will leave \nnearly $3 billion extra, which we can use to shore up the Pell grant \nfunding gap that is expected over the next couple of years.\n  Respectfully, I say to President Obama, when you visit the next \ncollege campus, tell the whole story. It is hard to attend and pay for \ncollege. There are many good options. Debt is up. But in fairness, the \nprincipal reason tuition is rising, and therefore debt is rising, is \nbecause of President Obama's own health care policy. He didn't start \nit, but he made it worse. What he has done is put into place a set of \npolicies that are soaking up the money States would use to fund public \ncolleges and universities and community colleges across this country, \nforcing them to use that money for Medicaid. As a result, the \nuniversities and community colleges have less money, they raise \ntuition, and that is the principal reason why we have higher tuition \nand higher interest rates.\n  The way to stop that would be to either repeal the health care law or \nrepeal the Medicaid mandates. That would improve the quality of \nAmerican public higher education, and it would improve access to higher \neducation. It would slow down the rising of tuition and slow down the \nrising of student debt.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 2367. A bill to strike the word ``lunatic'' from Federal law, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nCrapo in introducing the 21st Century Language Act of 2012. This \nbipartisan legislation updates federal law by eliminating references \nthat contribute to the stigmatization of mental health conditions. \nSpecifically, this legislation removes the word ``lunatic'' from \nseveral sections of the United States Code to reflect our nation's \nmodern understanding of mental health conditions.\n  Recently, a North Dakota constituent contacted my office to express \nsupport for legislative efforts to remove this outdated and \ninappropriate language from federal law. Senator Crapo and I agree that \nfederal law should reflect the 21st century understanding of mental \nillness and disease, and that the continued use of this pejorative term \nhas no place in the U.S. Code.\n  Senator Crapo and I have worked with the Senate Banking Committee to \nconfirm that ``lunatic'' is an unnecessary term and that its removal \nwill have no impact on the broader federal law. This legislation enjoys \nstrong support from a number of mental health advocates across the \nnation, including the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental \nHealth America, National Council on Community Behavioral Healthcare, \nand the Clinical Social Work Association. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in working to pass this overdue update to the U.S. Code.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2734-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2734-S2735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 435--CALLING FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN SYRIA, AND FOR \n                             OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

This week in Alaska, and in States and communities across the \nNation, we celebrate and bring greater awareness to the importance of \nthe early years of children's lives.\n  The Week of the Young Child officially began in 1971 as an annual \nobservance and public education effort of the National Association for \nthe Education of Young Children, the Nation's oldest and recognized \nleader in early childhood education for children from birth through age \n8, to reach out to families and communities and to emphasize the \ncrucial role adults play in giving children the foundation they need to \nsucceed in school and beyond.\n  This week focuses attention on the importance of children's early \nyears. Early childhood educators, librarians, United Ways, and other \norganizations provide a range of activities to highlight how each of us \ncan help children and families thrive. This is a national issue as well \nas local issue. Federal policy and funding is a significant component \nof early childhood education in this country, from Early Head Start and \nHead Start to the Child Care and Development Block Grant as well as \nTitle I and even higher education financial aid and teacher support \nprograms for the early childhood education workforce. Yet our \ninvestments remain inadequate, especially when you consider the work of \nnoted economists such as James Heckman on the return on investment to \nour Nation's economy. Today, not quite half of the poorest preschoolers \nin our country\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\ncan enroll in Head Start and only 3 percent of the babies and toddlers \nwho could benefit from Early Head Start can attend because of \ninadequate resources. Child care assistance reaches only one in seven \neligible children, making it harder for families to have stable jobs \nand for children to have safe and nurturing places to grow and learn. \nThe committed individuals who work in child care earn woefully \ninadequate salaries, often without health care or retirement support.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will find out more about the activities \ncelebrating the Week of the Young Child in their States and can show \ntheir support for families and the professionals who work with young \nchildren every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/25/senate-section/article/S2736-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 437--CONGRATULATING THE BOSTON COLLEGE MEN'S ICE \n     HOCKEY TEAM ON WINNING ITS FIFTH NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n            ASSOCIATION DIVISION I MEN'S HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Brown of Massachusetts) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
