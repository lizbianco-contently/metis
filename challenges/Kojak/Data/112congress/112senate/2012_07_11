I object to any further proceedings with respect to this \nbill at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                                Tax Cuts\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, over the last few years Americans who are \nvery wealthy have taken home a greater share of the Nation's income \nsince the 1920s. That is 90 years. A larger percentage of what is out \nthere the rich are getting. The rich are getting richer and the poor \nare being squeezed, as are the middle class. The rich are doing well.\n  But while the bank accounts of a few fortunate Americans have grown, \ntheir tax bills have not. The wealthiest Americans now pay the lowest \ntax rates in more than 50 years.\n  While this generous Tax Code has been good for their bottom lines, it \nhasn't been good for America's bottom line. Hundreds of billions of \ndollars in tax cuts--some say more than $1 trillion--have been handed \nout disproportionately to the rich by the previous administration, \nfueling skyrocketing deficits and a growing national debt.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike agree that we have to reduce the \ndeficit and rein in the debt. Unfortunately, the same Republicans who \nsay we have to get our fiscal house in order also claim millionaires \nand billionaires cannot afford to contribute even a tiny bit more and \nshare the effort that is before this country.\n  These same Republicans say multimillionaires such as Mitt Romney need \nlower taxes--even lower than the only tax return we have been able to \nsee of Governor Romney, which showed his rate at 16 percent. We don't \nknow what is in the other tax returns he should have made public. Tax \nreturns were made public by his father, who started it, and everyone \nwho has run for President since then has followed him. George Romney \nset an example that his son should follow. We want to know what is in \nthose tax returns he refuses to show the American public. Did he pay \nany taxes?\n\n  Well, I suggest to everybody that Mitt Romney doesn't need another \ntax\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nbreak. In fact, he has so much money that he doesn't even know where it \nis all located--Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Bermuda? No wonder he \ndoesn't want America to see his tax returns.\n  Mitt Romney is doing fine, and so are the other millionaires and \nbillionaires. It is the middle class I am worried about, not the very \nwealthy.\n  We all know times have been tough the last few years for ordinary \nAmericans who are struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on \nthe table. That is the literal truth. The last thing they can afford \nnow is a tax increase. That is why Democrats want to keep taxes low for \n98 percent of Americans, including almost 98 percent of small \nbusinesses--everyone making less than $250,000 a year. But while \nDemocrats are focused on how we can help 98 percent of Americans, \nRepublicans are focused on how they can help Mitt Romney and the rest \nof the top 2 percent. They are willing to hold tax cuts for everyone \nhostage to protect tax breaks for that top 2 percent.\n  Democrats don't agree the top 2 percent of wage earners can't afford \nto pay the same tax rate they paid when Bill Clinton was President. \nRemember, that was when the budget was balanced and we were paying down \nthe debt. Some claimed they were paying down the debt too quickly. The \nyears of the Bush administration took care of that, when the $7 \ntrillion surplus over 10 years was wiped out.\n  Still we are willing to debate that with our Republican colleagues, \nand we are willing to discuss it reasonably. But we don't believe \nmiddle-class families should wait and wonder, watch and worry whether \ntheir taxes are about to go up while Congress has that conversation. We \nshould not wait until the last second to act.\n  Here is what one major newspaper wrote yesterday about the need to \nact:\n\n       The majority of Americans, and the broader economy, should \n     not be held hostage again to another debate over the merits \n     of tax cuts for the wealthy. . . . There will never be \n     consensus for solving our nation's budget problems without \n     first ending the lavish tax breaks at the top.\n\n  I call on my Republican colleagues to help us give 98 percent of \nAmerican families the certainty and the security they need, and to do \nit now, right away. I call on them to help us pass a tax cut that will \nbenefit the middle class without bankrupting our Nation.\n  It is time we faced facts. If we are serious about reducing the \ndeficit, we cannot keep handing out more tax breaks to the richest of \nthe rich. We will have to make difficult decisions about where to cut \nand invest to keep our Nation strong.\n  But whether we keep taxes low for middle-class families should not be \none of the difficult decisions we make. I haven't heard one person--\nDemocrat, Republican, or Independent--say we should raise taxes on \nmiddle-class families. This is an area where we can easily find common \nground. So what is stopping us from doing what is right and doing it \nnow? I hope it won't be more Republican hostage-taking on behalf of the \ntop 2 percent.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Raising Taxes\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, earlier this week President Obama \nreiterated his desire to raise taxes on small businesses earning over \n$250,000 a year. I and all of my Republican colleagues oppose this tax \nhike for the same reason the President himself opposed it 2 years ago--\nbecause raising taxes would only make a bad economy worse.\n  But here it comes again--sort of like a bad penny--the liberal \ncrusade for more government, regardless of the circumstances, the \nimpact it would have on working Americans or the broader economy.\n  On Monday the President issued the following reckless ultimatum: Let \nme raise taxes on about 1 million business owners, and I promise I \nwon't raise taxes on everybody else.\n  In the face of 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent, \nthe President is begging Congress to let him raise taxes on the very \nbusinesses the American people are counting on to create jobs.\n  It is the exact opposite, of course, of what is needed. For some \nreason, he thinks a tax hike is his ticket to reelection. He says it is \nfair.\n  Well, I don't think most Americans think it is particularly fair for \na government that doesn't do a thing to live within its means to take \nmore money away from those who have worked and sacrificed to earn it, \nonly to waste it on some solar company or on one more government \nprogram we can't afford.\n  We have seen this movie too many times in the past. Frankly, we don't \nhave the luxury to waste any more time arguing about a question that is \nalready settled for most people. The problem here isn't that the \ngovernment taxes too little but that it spends too much.\n  What the American people need right now isn't a lecture on fairness; \nthey would like to have some certainty. That is why today I am going to \ncall on the Senate to provide just that. I have already called for a 1-\nyear extension of all the current income tax rates.\n  Today I will go further by asking consent that we set up two votes in \nthe Senate: one on the President's proposal to raise taxes on nearly 1 \nmillion business owners in the middle of the worst economic recovery in \nmodern times, and another that would extend current income tax rates \nfor 1 year and task the Finance Committee to produce a bill that would \nenact fundamental, progrowth tax reform.\n  It has been over a quarter century since we last did comprehensive \ntax reform. We all agree, on a bipartisan basis, that we need to do it \nagain.\n  The Senate should make itself clear which policy it supports, and \nthis is our chance to do it.\n  On Monday, the President said if the Senate passes this tax hike on \nsmall businesses, he would sign it right away. That is what he said 2 \ndays ago, on Monday. I can't see why our friends on the other side \nwould not want to give him the chance.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. today the motion to \nproceed to S. 2237 be adopted, and that the first two amendments in \norder to the bill be the Hatch-McConnell amendment No. 2491, which \nwould provide for the extension of current rates while we work on tax \nreform, and a Reid or designee amendment to enact the President's \nproposal, which, as I have said, would impose job-killing tax hikes on \nnearly 1 million businessowners.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we have \nbeen here before. We try to legislate here, and the program of the \nRepublicans in the Senate has been to divert, deny, and obstruct.\n  I asked the Chair when we started what we were doing here, and we are \non a small business jobs bill. It is extremely important legislation. \nIt would give small businesses across America--small businesses with \nless than 500 employees--and that is where most jobs are created--a 10-\npercent tax credit for hiring more people, and it would also give them \nthe ability, this year, to purchase equipment and write that off. It \nwould be great for the economy.\n  We are told by outside experts that it would create about a million \njobs. What we have before us is something that the Republicans in the \nHouse have sent us. It is their version of this. It is the ``help Paris \nHilton'' legislation. It would give people like her a tax break for \ndoing nothing--$46 billion of the American people's money to help Paris \nHilton and others. It would give people a tax break for doing nothing--\nnothing. And for my friend the Republican leader to talk about small \nbusinesses being hurt with the proposal of the President--that is not \ntrue. As I said in my opening statement, 98 percent of the American \npeople would have the benefit of that tax benefit, and 97\\1/2\\ percent \nof small businesses would benefit.\n\n  So we are in the situation where my friend talks about the fact that \nwe have not had enough job creation, and I acknowledge that. Certainly \nthat is true, and the President acknowledges that. But you see, we have \nkind of a hole to pull ourselves out of. During the prior 8 years, 8 \nmillion-plus jobs were lost, and we have filled that hole more than \nhalfway, with 4\\1/2\\ million new jobs being created. We have had 28 \nmonths of private sector job growth--28 months in a row. So we are \nmaking progress, but we have a long way to go.\n  Madam President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me simplify this for everybody. On Monday the \nPresident asked that we have the vote I have just offered to the \nmajority. We have a clear contrast here. We have 41 straight months of \nunemployment over 8 percent. If this is a recovery, it is the most \ntepid recovery in modern times. The President's solution to that is to \nraise taxes on about 1 million small business owners, representing \nabout 53 percent of small business income and up to 25 percent of the \nworkforce.\n  We are on a different bill that my friend the majority leader is \ntalking about, that I understand would be slipped by the House in any \nevent. Clearly, what we are doing this week is having a political \ndiscussion, not seriously legislating. So my recommendation is that we \ngive the President what he asked for. He wants to have a vote on \nraising taxes on individuals making over $250,000 a year, which, of \ncourse, includes almost 1 million small businesses that pay taxes as \nindividuals, not as corporations--they are either S corps or LLCs--the \nmost successful small businesses in America, in fact. That is a vote we \nwelcome. It is a vote the President is asking for, and it is a vote I \njust asked for.\n  Senator Hatch, our leader on the Finance Committee, here on the floor \nright behind me today, has advocated that we extend the current tax \nrates for 1 year--the same thing the President, I would say to my \nfriend from Utah, wanted to do 2 years ago, at that time arguing it \nwould be bad for the economy not to do that. And the growth then was \nactually better than it is now. We think we ought to vote on that. It \nwould give Senator Hatch and Senator Baucus and the people on the \nFinance Committee a year to work us through comprehensive tax reform. \nAgain, it has been a quarter of a century since we have done that.\n  Why not have those votes today? That is what my consent agreement is \nabout. I am a little surprised we are not willing to give the President \nwhat he asked for, which is a vote on a clear distinction for the \nAmerican people so they can understand how the two sides look at this \nimportant issue. It could not be more clear.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the American people are seeing again--\nagain and again and again--the scores of times during the last 18 \nmonths that we have engaged in a filibuster. As I said earlier, it is a \nway to divert attention from what we are doing today--to obstruct. As \nis indicated in the Oxford English Dictionary, a filibuster is an act \nwhich obstructs progress in a legislative assembly; to practice \nobstruction. That is what is going on today.\n  Now, why shouldn't we pass this bill that is before the body today? \nIt would create 1 million jobs and give small businesses--not Paris \nHilton but small businesses--across America today a tax credit for \nhiring more people and allow them to write off what they purchase, \nwhich would create more jobs.\n  So we have here a big Las Vegas neon sign flashing on and off saying: \nGrover Norquist has won again.\n  To the people out there watching who might be wondering who Grover \nNorquist is, remember, he is this guy who goes to the Republicans and \nasks if they would be kind enough to sign a pledge for him that does \nwhat he wants them to do and not what the American people want, which \nis that they will not tax the rich at all, not even a tiny bit. He \nsays: Sign this pledge, will you? Of course they all sign. But the \nAmerican people--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--agree that \nthe richest of the rich should pay a little bit more.\n  But we are now involved in a filibuster to divert attention away from \nan important piece of legislation. Let's pass this legislation. We will \nhave this tax debate. We will be happy to do that, but let's get this \ndone first. As most people know, I appreciate my friend the Republican \nleader. I know he has a job to do. But let's get away from this pledge, \nand let's start legislating and not have to break filibusters on \nvirtually everything we do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I think we have witnessed here a new \ndefinition of a filibuster. My good friend the majority leader, I \ngather, is accusing me of filibustering when I am trying to get a \nvote--not one but two votes--on what he says he is for, what the \nPresident says he is for, and a vote on what Republicans are for. So we \nhave here a brandnew definition of a filibuster. Even when you are \ntrying to get votes and they are objected to by the other side, somehow \nthat is a filibuster.\n  Now, my good friend talks about what would help small businesses. I \nthink we ought to ask them would they prefer the underlying bill, which \nthe majority leader has called up and we have voted to proceed to, or \nwould they prefer not to have their taxes go up at the end of the year? \nTalk about a no-brainer. I don't think there is any question what small \nbusinesses would rather have.\n  But we are certainly not filibustering. We enjoy discussing our \ndifferences of opinion on the tax issue. There couldn't be anything \nmore important to the American people if we are going to get this \neconomy going again. And certainly trying to set up two votes--No. 1 on \nwhat the President is asking for and No. 2 on what Republicans think is \na better alternative--could not, in my view, be the definition of a \nfilibuster.\n  So Senator Hatch is here--and obviously the majority leader can speak \nagain if he wishes--and he is going to address the matter as well, but \nI wish to thank him again for his conspicuous leadership on the Finance \nCommittee. We are looking to him to work us through this comprehensive \ntax reform matter again next year. It is going to be extremely \nimportant for the country, and I thank him for his good work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, when I came here this morning--I repeat \nfor the third time--I asked what the business was before this body. It \nis the small business jobs bill. Of course, there has been a direct \nattack on that legislation by saying: Let's do something else. Let's \nnot do this right now. Let's do something else.\n  I understand the definition of a filibuster. I understand it very \nclearly--from the Dutch, a ``free booter,'' one of a class of piratical \nadventurers who pillaged the Spanish colonies in the West Indies during \nthe 17th century; one who engages in unauthorized and irregular warfare \nagainst a foreign state. They go on to say, in the United States, to \nobstruct progress in a legislative assembly; to practice \nobstructionism.\n  Yes, they are trying to, as the ``free booters'' here, steal \nlegislation and move to something else. They will do anything they can, \nas my friend the Republican leader said at the beginning of this \nCongress, to divert attention from the fact that President Obama should \nbe reelected.\n  Madam President, I will end this debate soon. There will be other \ntimes to do this. But if Governor Romney came before this body to be a \nCabinet officer, he couldn't get approved. He won't show anybody his \nincome tax returns. So if he doesn't qualify to be a Cabinet officer, \nhow could he qualify to be President? So let's debate the issues before \nus. We will get to the tax issues, and that way we will be able to talk \nin more detail about Governor Romney's taxes. But right now, before \nthis body is the small business jobs bill.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the following hour will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                                Tax Cuts\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this is really an amazing moment, as far \nas I can see. Sometimes, for those watching on C-SPAN, the Senate, with \nits unique rulings, can seem like a pretty arcane place. The impact of \nunanimous consent requests is not something ordinary folks talk about, \nso let me put this in plain English.\n  The Senate's Republican leader has just made a remarkable offer to \nour friends on the other side, the Democrats. We hear all the time from \nthe left that Republicans refuse to do anything in the Senate, which \ncertainly is\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\nmind-boggling. Remember this episode the next time you hear that. My \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from Kentucky and the Republican \nleader, Mitch McConnell, presented this body with an opportunity to \ntake a stand, to take a vote--two votes, as a matter of fact--to show \nthe American people our cards on the most important issue facing this \ncountry: the coming fiscal cliff. In exchange for a vote on the \namendment I introduced to extend all of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief \nfor 1 year, the Republican leader agreed to a vote on the President's \ncounteroffer that would increase taxes on families and small \nbusinesses. You heard that right. The Republican leader offered a vote \non President Obama's plan to raise taxes, and the Democratic leader \nrejected this offer. That is mind-boggling to me. Senate Democratic \nleadership turned down an opportunity to vote on President Obama's tax \nincrease bill--the bill he insists is the only acceptable way to \naddress the fiscal cliff.\n  After today, all of the President's surrogates, if they are honest, \nwill have to rewrite their talking points about the do-nothing \nRepublicans in the Senate. Senate Democratic leadership is effectively \nfilibustering--and that is the real use of the term--President Obama's \ntax increase bill. Did everyone out there hear that? They are \nfilibustering their own bill by not agreeing to equivalent votes here.\n  So what does that tell us? Here is what it tells us. It tells us that \nthe President's tax increase plan is not just an economic disaster, it \nis a political loser, and they know it. It tells us that in spite of \nall the big talk from the President's Chicago reelection campaign about \nevil Republicans who want to extend all of the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief, vulnerable Members of the Senate's Democratic conference do not \nwant to be anywhere near the President's tax increase alternative. To \nborrow from the film ``Top Gun,'' the President's campaign is writing \nchecks that Senate Democrats can't cash or, as we westerners like to \nsay, the President is all hat and no cattle. He is tipping his tax \nincrease Stetson, but he doesn't have enough of a herd in the Senate to \nfollow him.\n  Keep in mind that the Democratic leadership is not just filibustering \nthe President's tax increase proposal, that leadership is also \nfilibustering my tax relief proposal as well. And I suspect they are \nfilibustering this amendment because they are afraid it would pass. \nForty Democrats in this Chamber supported the extension of the 2001 and \n2003 tax relief in 2010--40 Democrats--and they would probably do so \nagain if they had a chance, so the Democratic leadership has decided to \ndeny them that chance.\n  The President is asking for compromise. Well, he is looking at it. As \nthe ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, I have deep \nreservations about temporary tax policies. Temporary tax policy does \nnot provide the certainty to small businesses and families that is \nnecessary for long-term planning and investment. If a small business \ndoes not know what its tax bill is going to be next year, it is not \ngoing to be doing any hiring. We all understand that. So it is not \nsurprising to me, with next year's tax rates up in the air, that we \njust saw the worst quarter of hiring in over 2 years.\n  But in the interest of preventing a tax increase that would further \nhamper the economy, I am willing to set aside the virtue of permanency \nfor the time being.\n  My amendment would just extend the 2001 and 2003 tax relief for 1 \nyear, and during that year we would work on doing what is right with \nregard to tax reform.\n  The amendment I have filed with my friend, the Republican leader, is \nin itself a compromise, but we have offered a further compromise. Fair \nis fair. We have our proposal: We want to keep taxes low for all \nAmericans, particularly with our economy on the ropes. And the \nPresident has his proposal: He wants to raise taxes on small \nbusinesses, even as the prospects for economic growth and job creation \nlook increasingly bleak.\n  So let's have these votes. Let's get it on the record. Our \nconstituents sent us here to make hard choices. It is time to put our \nmoney where our mouth is.\n  If the President and his party think it is morally reprehensible to \nextend all of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief, then they should vote \nagainst it. If they think raising taxes is the way to go, then vote for \nthe President's plan.\n  I wish I could say I was shocked, but this is just par for the \ncourse. We have been watching this now for a couple of years.\n  I know the hand-wringing Washington pundits like to blame Republicans \nfor the lack of progress on the fiscal cliff, but this episode should \nshow, once and for all, what a fiction that is. Republicans are ready \nto act. We are ready to vote. We can vote on my amendment to extend tax \nrelief to all Americans and on the President's proposal to deny that \ntax relief to small businesses. We can do what our constituents sent us \nhere to do--we can vote and let the better plan win. But the Democratic \nleadership, fearful of the embarrassing reality that their own \nconference has serious reservations about the President's tax-hiking \nagenda, is now filibustering their own bill, and they are now \nfilibustering President Obama's signature tax policy.\n  Those who continue to talk about the President's reelection prospects \nin glowing terms need to reevaluate that fairly. President Obama thinks \nthe ticket to his reelection runs through tax hike valley. He is going \nto succeed where Walter Mondale failed.\n  President Obama's signature economic policy is a promise to raise \ntaxes on job creators when we are facing the 40th straight month of \nunemployment in excess of 8 percent. We don't need a sophisticated poll \nto figure out how popular this policy is in swing States or with \nIndependents. Just look at what happened this morning. Republicans \noffered a vote on the President's plan, and Democrats balked at the \nopportunity.\n  Democrats are filibustering President Obama's signature domestic \npolicy--a bill to increase taxes--and they are doing so because many \nmembers of their own conference know that a vote for these tax \nincreases would sink them back home. They know that.\n  This is a pathetic spectacle made even more so by the fact that time \nis running short, the fiscal cliff is approaching, and families and \nbusinesses need to know what their tax rates will be next year. To \ndate, the Senate's Democratic leadership has done absolutely nothing to \nprovide that certainty. It is disgraceful what we are witnessing this \nmorning. We need to put politics aside and have these votes.\n  I would renew the Republican leader's unanimous request and ask that \nwe immediately proceed to debate and votes on my amendment to extend \ntax relief to all Americans and on the President's tax increase plan. \nPresident Obama seems to think he has a winning issue. It might be good \nfor him, but delaying resolution of these tax rates is putting partisan \ngoals ahead of the common good. The American people deserve better than \nthis.\n  What is mind-boggling to me is for our leader to tie up the \nparliamentary tree so no real amendments can be voted on. And we offer \nhim a vote on the President's proposal and he accuses us of \nfilibustering when he refuses to allow that vote? Before that we would \nlike to have a vote on our proposal for the 2001 and 2003 tax relief \nthat we know needs to be effectuated. Then what really boggled my mind \nis when the leader talked in terms of the Republicans are \nfilibustering? Give me a break.\n  We have asked for two major votes: one on the President's own \nproposal and the other on my proposal to extend those tax cuts for 1 \nmore year, during which time both sides should come together, work \ntogether, compromise together, and come up with a new reformed Tax Code \nthat doesn't continue to eat us alive.\n  I am absolutely amazed by what happened this morning.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I came down to the floor early to line up \nin the queue to talk about taxes and the proposal that has just been \ndiscussed.\n  I sat here in amazement as the Senator from Utah has just expressed, \nand as the minority leader expressed the redefinition of \n``filibuster.'' It was a tortured effort on the part of the majority \nleader to try to redefine it in a way that had just the opposite effect \nof what a filibuster really is.\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\n  I wish the majority leader had been at our caucus luncheon yesterday \nwhen we debated whether we would vote against the cloture motion to \nproceed on this bill. The consent of our caucus was, no; we welcome a \ndebate on taxes. We welcome the opportunity to move forward and discuss \nour two visions of how we need to revive this economy.\n  So let's not use parliamentary tricks or a parliamentary procedure to \navoid that debate and to avoid a vote on the President's proposal. We \nrealized there was the opportunity for the majority leader to use \nparliamentary tricks and procedures in order to deny us the opportunity \nto offer our own version of what we thought we should do with our Tax \nCode and provisions, particularly as it reflects this particular tax on \nsmall business, but we welcome the opportunity to come and debate that \nand work through it and, hopefully, make an offer that is acceptable.\n  So the minority leader came down here this morning and turned to the \nmajority leader and said: We are going to give you your vote. We are \nnot going to use parliamentary procedures to prevent you from having an \nopportunity to vote on your proposal, the President's proposal.\n  By some tortured way of opposing this, the majority leader \nessentially said: There you go again. Republicans are filibustering. I \nthink we all just sat here with our mouths agape saying: Have we missed \nsomething? We are offering to give you your vote.\n\n  Now, it is clear this center aisle--not completely--divides us in \nterms of how we think we should go forward in dealing with this very \nsick and anemic economy. There is probably pretty close to a consensus \nthat tax reform needs to be an essential part of what we need to do.\n  In a bipartisan way, Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, and \nDan Coats, a Republican from Indiana, have been working for 1\\1/2\\ \nyears now on something that was started with Senator Gregg, who is now \nretired from distinguished service in the Senate but worked with \nSenator Wyden for 2 years in putting a package together, a \ncomprehensive tax reform package. It is the only plan out there that \nhas been written, scored, and is available for debate and available to \nthe tax-writing committees to use as a basis--or foundation or parts of \nit or all of it or whatever--in forming their own version to bring \nforward. But there is a bipartisan consensus that we ought to move \nforward on comprehensive tax reform.\n  Senator Hatch, our Republican leader in the Finance Committee--which \nis the committee responsible for writing that bill--has said piecemeal \nis not the way to go. Anybody who has analyzed our current situation \nunderstands that comprehensive tax reform is the best solution. But \neven Senator Hatch agreed, in this instance, given the situation we now \nface, he would accept going forward with a short-term proposal that \nwould give us 1 year to put together a comprehensive tax reform \npackage. The last one occurred in 1986, so long past time we overhaul \nthe Tax Code. With all the credits and subsidies and additions and \naddendums to the current Tax Code, it is complex beyond anybody's \nability to fully understand. And it isn't fair. It favors some at the \nexpense of the many. In many cases, there are special credits and tax \nbreaks that go to a single industry. So we need much more fairness \nacross the board, and that is what Senator Wyden and I attempt to do in \nour proposal.\n  The word ``fairness'' is thrown around here as a condemnation on the \nRepublican Party's ability to achieve bipartisan consent, but if we \nwant to talk about fairness, let's talk about what just happened here. \nIt was imminently fair for the minority leader to offer the Democrats a \nvote on the President's proposal. All we asked in return was an \nopportunity to present, debate and vote on our proposal.\n  What is amazing is that the Democratic Party controls the Senate. \nThey have the votes to pass the President's proposal. So in the end, if \nthey voted in unison with the President, their proposal wins. If we \nvote and we come up short, we lose.\n  Obviously, there must be a reason they don't want that vote. They \ndon't want an alternative presented to them because they must fear they \nwould lose votes on their side of the aisle for the President's \nproposal, and we would gain votes from them on our side. It has \nhappened in the past, and apparently that is the decision they made.\n  But this torturous explanation of how this could be a Republican \nfilibuster--if they can spin this one at the White House and at the \npress conference today, or if they can spin this through the press, \nthey are not listening or understanding what is actually going on here.\n  What is going on here is a decided attempt by the majority leader to \nprotect his party from having to take a vote for or against. If the \nAmerican people want anything out of this body, and if they are \ndisgusted with anything that comes out of this body, it is when people \ngo home and say: Well, we didn't have a real vote on that. There was a \nprocedural this or that and it got stopped here or modified there or \nthe others tied up the legislative tree.\n  What in the world does that mean to most people outside of this body? \nThey used some procedural way to avoid a real vote.\n  They want our yes to be yes and our no to be no, and we are offering \nto the Democratic leader that opportunity. Let your yes be yes and your \nno be no on the specific bill before us, and then go home and explain \nto your people why you voted yes or why you voted no. Then they can \ndecide in this democratic process whether they want to send you back or \nsend somebody else back for you.\n  The American people aren't getting that kind of clarity right now, \nand it is no wonder they are disgusted with Congress. It is 10:00 in \nthe morning when we are talking about this. If they get a fair \ntreatment in the press over what happened this morning, they will fully \neasily grasp and understand that what was proposed by the Republicans \nwas nothing but fairness, and what was proposed by the other party was \nnothing but unfairness.\n  What could be more fair than giving each side, in a divided vision of \nhow we should go forward, their opportunity to debate what they believe \nin and to call a vote for it? Particularly from the party that has the \nvotes to win and the party that has the votes not to win, why not have \nthe vote? What have you got to lose? Unless you think you are going to \nlose your own people or not want to put them on the line for having a \nyes or a no recorded clearly before the American people.\n  I have diverted from what I was going to say this morning. I was just \nso amazed by what took place down here I could not help but comment on \nit.\n  We will see how this all gets spun out by the White House. We will \nsee what is the next diversionary tactic they use to stop us from \ntalking about the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 issue facing this country; \nthat is, this anemic economy. Eighty thousand jobs? Only eighty \nthousand jobs created in June. People say we are on the right track? \nThat doesn't even replace the number of people who are retiring, let \nalone add new jobs. How many college graduates this spring are living \nin the basement of their parents' home? That has happened now for more \nthan 3 years. There are millions, 12.7 million people who woke this \nmorning with no job to go to. There are many more who woke to go to \njobs far below their abilities or training. So 80,000 jobs, let's put \nthis in perspective. It is far below what we need just to break even, \njust to give anybody a new shot and a new chance.\n  We have had 3\\1/2\\ years of the policies of this administration which \nhave not improved the situation and, in fact, some have said are making \nit worse. We all know we have come through a tough time. We all know \njust sticking the blame against one side or the other is not the \nsolution. The solution is to find how to put sensible policies in place \nthat will get this economy moving again. One of those policies is \ncomprehensive tax reform.\n  Once again, I bring up the Wyden-Coats bill. It has been out there. \nIt is written. It is scored. It is available to take up right now if \nthat were the case, but because the tax-writing committees have the \njurisdictional right to have a say and because it is a complex process, \nthey would like some time to put it together.\n  The proposal of Senator Hatch, eminently fair, is to basically say \nlet's not put a bandaid on the Tax Code now with something that is not \ngoing to make much difference at all and, in fact, we believe, will \nnegatively impact small businesses around the country.\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\n  I had a small business group in my office yesterday basically saying \nthe President only talks about the middle class. That is whom I hire, \nthey say. That is who is working in our business. If they put a tax on \nme, the owner of the business, actually it is a tax on the business--\nthe passthroughs, the noncorporations that exist here where, from a tax \nbasis, everything flows through to that individual taxpayer. They say I \nam the guy who owns the business. I am the guy who makes the decision \non hiring. I am the guy who has to put the health care plan together. I \nam the guy who hires the people and pays the people. If government \ntaxes me more, I do not have the same flexibility to hire, expand or \nbuy equipment or expand my factory or hire more people.\n  Yes, the White House can go out and spin it like I am a rich guy, but \nbecause I have chosen a certain way in order to form my business--not \nas a corporation--I am taxed in an entirely different way than \ncorporations. But if you go out and say we are giving the middle class \na break--and we are hurting the people who employ the middle class and \nyou are raising their taxes--you are hurting the middle-class people. \nThe very people the President says he is trying to protect, he is \nhurting by raising this tax. The President himself said in his campaign \nand throughout his Presidency: The worst thing you can do is raise any \ntaxes during a time of economic distress.\n  I do not care if you are Paul Krugman or if you are the most \nconservative economic analyst out there, there is a widespread \nconsensus that the last thing you do is raise taxes at a time of a \nstagnant economy, a recessionary economy. It is the last thing you do.\n  Dan Coats just said that, respected economists on the left and right \nsaid that, and even the President of the United States said that as a \ncandidate and throughout his Presidency. In 2010, the President said \nthe last thing we should do is raise any taxes. Now he has turned \naround to say let's tax up to 1 million small businesses because \nobviously they can spin that and play that in what sounds like a \npolitically opportune way.\n  It is a direct contradiction coming out of the mouth of the \nPresident, out of the mouths of others. It is simply an election year \npolitical class division ploy to divert from the miserable record under \nthis administration, in terms of dealing with this economy. Frankly, if \nthey know--we can hardly conclude anything, but they just do not know \nwhat they are doing. But even if they know what they are doing, their \npolicies have not worked.\n  Whether it is Republicans or Democrats, if they have done something \nfor 3\\1/2\\ years and it has not worked, isn't it time to look at a \ndifferent set of policies? That is what we wanted to debate, but the \nmajority leader is not allowing us to debate. In some excruciatingly, \ntwisted way, he is saying Republicans are trying to prevent us from \ngoing forward. It boggles the mind.\n  I will stop with that and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                        Stolen Valor Act of 2011\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I have enjoyed the \nprevious speaker. It was very interesting.\n  I wish to shift gears and talk about S. 1728, the Stolen Valor Act of \n2011. As many know, the Supreme Court recently struck down the Stolen \nValor Act of 2011 by saying that lying about military awards, records, \nand service is protected by our first amendment rights. The Court has \nruled. But let's be clear, it is wrong and cowardly for people to make \nfraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions they have not \nearned. Let me say that again. It is wrong and cowardly for people to \nmake fraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions they have \nnot earned.\n  As a 32-year member of the Army National Guard still serving, I feel \nvery strongly about this issue, and I believe we need a Federal law to \npunish those who seek to benefit from making false claims and steal the \ntrue valor of our heroic men and women in uniform. My bipartisan, \nbicameral Stolen Valor Act of 2011 reminds me of the bill we worked on, \nthe insider trading bill. We have an opportunity once again to send a \npowerful message to the American people that in the middle of the \ngridlock we can work together on something that makes complete sense. \nIt addresses the Supreme Court's change by making a key change in order \nto protect first amendment rights. It would punish individuals who \ndeliberately lie about their military service, their records or honors, \nwith the intention of obtaining anything of value.\n\n  The key term is ``of value.'' One actually gets something of value as \na result of their misrepresentations. Again, the new Stolen Valor Act \nmakes it a Federal crime to lie about military service in order to \nprofit or benefit, and that is the key distinction.\n  Yesterday, Congressman Joe Heck of Nevada and I--he is the lead \nsponsor in the House version of the bill, I in the Senate--held a press \nconference to start a fresh campaign to pass the new Stolen Valor Act. \nWe had wonderful results. Within a few hours of that press conference, \nwe gained 27 new cosponsors in the Senate, making a total of 29. I \nencourage the Presiding Officer and others on her side of the aisle to \nget involved in this very real effort to help our heroes who have \nserved legitimately. Congressman Heck also has 67 bipartisan cosponsors \nin the House.\n  Also, yesterday, the Pentagon announced they will take a major step \nto deter con artists by establishing a searchable database of military \nawards and medals to confirm, in fact, that the person with whom one is \ndealing or speaking with is, in fact, deserving of the medals and \nhonors they received.\n  It is clear this cause has momentum and the Supreme Court decision \nhas given many a sense of urgency and clarity. In fact, today I wrote \nPresident Obama to ask for his public endorsement of the bill, very \nsimilar to the day he was walking up the aisle after the State of the \nUnion and I said: Mr. President, I have a bill on Harry Reid's desk on \ninsider trading. Let's get it out. He said: I will; I will get it out.\n  He can do the same here. He can give his public endorsement of this \nvery important bill, and I am hopeful the Commander in Chief will lend \nhis endorsement to this cause, to show leadership on this issue and \ngive his blessing so we can actually get to work on legislation that \nwill truly pass, I venture 99 to 0, in this Chamber. His voice would \njoin several military organizations that endorsed the Stolen Valor Act \nof 2011: the Military Officers Association of America, the Association \nof the U.S. Army, Military Order of the Purple Heart, and the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America.\n  As bipartisan support of this effort grows, I ask my Senate \ncolleagues who have not cosponsored the Stolen Valor Act of 2011 to get \non board. It is time. It is time to send a very powerful message to the \nmen and women who have served with dignity and honor that we respect \nthat service and we are tired of the frauds who are out there \nperpetrating fraud and wearing medals and receiving honors to which \nthey are not entitled.\n  If we choose to come together and pass this legislation, we can \nrespond immediately to the Supreme Court's ruling with the urgency this \nissue deserves. It is very similar to how Senator McCaskill and I, in \nthe middle of the gridlock a couple years ago, passed the Arlington \nCemetery bill. We can do it with this legislation as well and send a \nmessage to the American people that we can work together and that \nunified message will protect the valor of our heroic veterans and \nservicemembers who defend our freedom and serve our country with the \ngreatest of honor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I applaud the Senator from \nMassachusetts for introducing the bill. He is trying to make a \nconstitutional way so those who have done the service for our country \nand earned the medals are assured that those medals mean something and \ncannot be in any way misrepresented without a consequence. I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                               Tax Policy\n\n  I rise to talk about this week's issue, which is taxes on our \nNation's small\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nbusinesses. Small businesses are the economic engine of America. It is \nnot big business. Jobs are created by small businesses that grow and \nbecome medium-size businesses. They are responsible for driving most of \nthe job growth in this country. Fifty-five percent of private sector \njobs are created by small business. Punishing them with new taxes in a \ntime of economic stagnation is incomprehensible. It is \nincomprehensible.\n  This tax that is suggested by the President on those who make \n$200,000 to $250,000 or more will affect small business, make no \nmistake about it. I have been a small businessperson, and I know if \nsomeone is paying all the expenses they are paying, if they are taxed \nas an individual in their small business, they are not going to be able \nto hire new people--not with what is looming next year in increased \ntaxes. Even the talk of it is part of the reason we have the stagnation \nwe do.\n  Seventy-five percent of the small businesses in our country pay taxes \nat an individual rate. They are organized as flowthrough businesses: \nPartnerships, S corporations, LLCs, and sole proprietorships. Fifty-\nthree percent of all flowthrough business income will be subject to the \ntop two individual income tax rate increases subject to take place in \n2013. Even our talking about tax increases is on the minds of our small \nbusinessespeople. It makes them very nervous.\n  We have an already uncertain environment. Hiring is stalled. We have \nbeen strangling growth in our country and the hope of recovery is not \nthere. The first round of taxes in the health care law the President's \nparty and the President passed will kick in, in 2013. I do not want to \nhave to go back to the small business owners whom I have just visited \nwith last week all over my State and say: Yes, it is true. You are \ngoing to have the taxes involved in the health care plan that will take \neffect in 2013 and your taxes are going up because you are going into a \nhigher bracket, and if the President has his way, the rates are going \nto increase too. That is not the message anyone in this body should \nwant to take back to their home States and I do not want to go back to \nthe hard-working employees and customers and tell them the same thing \nbecause it will not be just small business owners caught in the net of \nhigher taxes, every American is going to see their taxes increase if \nthey are paying taxes today.\n  We have a cliff. Everyone around here is talking about the fiscal \ncliff. It happens on December 31 of this year. Taxes will automatically \ngo up on January 1. Everybody will go into a higher bracket. We will \nlose the marriage penalty relief we have had. We are going to see tax \nincreases on the middle class, and it is going to be steep. \nApproximately 31 million Americans will be hit for the first time with \nthe alternative minimum tax. Most people know the alternative minimum \ntax was enacted in 1969 to target a few hundred millionaires in America \nto try to ensure that those millionaires paid a tax. Well, guess who \nqualifies next year if we don't do something. A single person making \n$33,750 and a married couple earning $45,000 will be considered as not \npaying their fair share of taxes. That is outrageous for this Congress \nto let that happen. We must work with the President to ensure that \nthose steep tax increases do not take effect.\n\n  The tax increases, the astronomical debt we face, and the persistent \nhigh unemployment rate have come together to create a perfect recovery-\nkilling storm. And if this weren't enough to send our economy into \npermanent hiding, we now have the dubious honor of having the highest \ncorporate tax rate in the world at 35 percent. We used to be second, \nbut Japan had the good sense to lower its rate earlier this year, so \nnow it is America that holds that dubious honor.\n  This is not a recipe for growth. Is it any wonder that we have a \nrecurring over 8 percent unemployment rate in this country? If we don't \ndo something before the end of this year, those who are employed are \ngoing to pay more taxes next year, and for those who are not employed, \nit is going to be harder to find a job. So what is the answer? The \nanswer, as we all know, is for this Congress and the President to do \nsomething before the election.\n  Now, Senator Reid has introduced a tax bill. It is a bill that will \nprovide two temporary tax credits, but a 1-year temporary tax credit is \nreally not enough. Many of us voted in support of the motion to proceed \nto this bill because we would like something to start with, and I hope \nthe majority leader is going to allow amendments because there are many \namendments for us to try to cobble together a bill that will really \nmake a difference in our economy. So it is a start, and I am going to \ngive the leader credit for that.\n  A real long-term solution is what business is looking for. If we have \na 1-year tax credit, we are going to get a 1-year plan, and a 1-year \nplan is not going to encourage people to be hired. It is not going to \nencourage employers when they see a 1-year plan and know that Congress \nis going to do what it has done so often; that is, get to the last of \nthe year and then cobble something together that will perhaps last a \nyear. Maybe it will be the same or maybe it won't. That is not the way \nbusiness works. They have to plan. They have to know what they are \ngoing to have in the next 5 years in expenses so they know what they \ncan produce and what they can charge. That is the private sector.\n  We should be focusing on the underlying issue. It should be tax \nrelief and tax reform. We can alleviate the employers' conundrum and \nget them to start hiring if they know what to expect, and a 1-year fix \nwill not do it. We need long-term tax reform, we need to address the \nlooming debt, and we know it. We know what the fiscal cliff is.\n  I would like to read a letter I received in answer to a \ncongratulatory note I wrote to the former football coach at Texas A, \nR.C. Slocum, who is one of the finest men I have ever met. He is \nexactly what America is. He was just inducted into the College Football \nHall of Fame, and I congratulated him sincerely because he is the kind \nof person we want coaching our young men in football.\n  Well, he wrote me back, and I am going to read an excerpt from his \nletter. He does the niceties of thanking me for writing him, and then \nhe says:\n\n       I am really concerned that the America that you and I grew \n     up in is being attacked from within. Although I grew up in a \n     poor family, I was taught that I was privileged because I was \n     born in America, the land of opportunity. We did not begrudge \n     the ``rich'' but was encouraged that through hard work and \n     education, some day we could be one of them. Thankfully, I \n     was not taught that it was someone else's fault that we were \n     poor or that government would, or should, come bail us out. \n     We worked our own way out and felt the great feeling of \n     accomplishment that goes with it. In my career as a coach, I \n     encouraged my players to try the formula I was given. It \n     still works and I am so proud of the young men that have \n     dramatically changed their lives, and with it the course of \n     their families' lives.\n\n  That is what America is, and that is what we ought to be working to \nachieve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I am here on the Senate floor \nto highlight our country's clean energy future.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent regarding \ntime?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I would be happy to yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nUdall proceed for 6 minutes, that I proceed for 12 minutes, and that \nSenator Manchin proceed for 12 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I am here on the floor, as I \nhave been for a succession of morning speeches, to talk about the \nimportance of extending the tax credit for wind power. If you look in \nevery corner of our great country, the production tax credit has \nresulted in good-paying jobs for Americans--jobs, I might add, that \ncan't be exported overseas.\n  I have taken a tour of the country. This morning I wish to highlight \nthe beautiful State of South Carolina.\n  South Carolina is one of the few States that do not have installed \nonshore wind power, but that has not stopped South Carolina from \nattracting literally dozens of manufacturers\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nthat support 1,000 good-paying wind energy jobs across the State.\n  As we look at this chart of the State of South Carolina, we can see \nthat the green circles acknowledge the manufacturing facilities that \nbuilt components for wind turbines. Nearly every component in a wind \nturbine is built in South Carolina.\n  I wish to highlight Greenville, up here in the northwestern part of \nSouth Carolina. GE has a facility there, and they have designed the \n1.5-megawatt wind turbine that is a hallmark of GE. That facility \nsupports more than a dozen suppliers and hundreds of jobs across the \nState.\n  One of the most exciting ventures outside of manufacturing that is \ngoing on in South Carolina is the massive investment that has been made \nin innovation. In 2009 Clemson University won a $45 million grant from \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Department of Energy \nfor the construction of a brandnew facility that will be the largest \nwind turbine testing facility in the world. In that facility, they will \ntest cutting-edge drivetrain technologies for the next generation of \nwind turbines.\n\n  Now, South Carolina has doubled down on that support of wind \ninnovation. The university donors and other partners have joined \nClemson and have come up with another $53 million to supplement the $45 \nmillion that came through the Recovery Act. That is $98 million that \nwill be an investment in South Carolina's economy and in our wind \nenergy future.\n  So not only will there be good-paying jobs created at this wind \nturbine drivetrain testing facility, but this facility will be a global \nleader in developing wind turbines capable of 3 to 10 times as much \npower as wind turbines today. I was under the impression that wind \nturbine technology had matured and that we had wrung out every electron \npossible. I have been told we can increase the yields by 3 to 10 times \nthrough this kind of research. This facility will focus on onshore and \noffshore wind turbines. So this is crucial research.\n  We know in Colorado that the presence of top-notch research and \ndevelopment institutions attracts incredibly talented individuals and \noften results in the creation of new companies that commercialize the \nnew and innovative technologies developed in these R facilities. I \nknow that in the Presiding Officer's State, that is a formula for \nsuccess. When we make the investments such as South Carolina, Colorado, \nand New York are making, we draw top-notch resources that are able to \nexploit in a responsible way natural resources.\n  The grant I mentioned combined with the research dollars that have \ncome from the private sector represent an enormous opportunity for \nSouth Carolina and for our country in turn. We already see millions of \ndollars that have been attracted into South Carolina from global \ninvestors because they see the potential of what is going to happen at \nClemson.\n  The point I want to make is that if we don't extend the wind tax \ncredit, the PTC, then these wind manufacturers may not have the \nwherewithal, frankly, to team up with Clemson, to commercialize the new \ntechnologies that will be developed in South Carolina, and then the \njobs that follow won't be created. That just doesn't make sense. South \nCarolina and Clemson are going to be global leaders in the development \nof these new technologies.\n  The question is, Where will these new turbines be built? I know, for \none, that the Chinese would be happy to step in and take away our \nmanufacturing jobs. But if we get our act together and extend the PTC, \nthen these wind turbines will be built here in America. They will be \nbuilt in South Carolina, they will be built in Colorado, and they will \nbe built in Pennsylvania. They will be built all over our country in \nliterally every corner. But if we let the PTC expire, we risk shipping \nthis industry and our good-paying jobs overseas.\n  Coloradans keep telling me--and I know in the Presiding Officer's \nhome State as well--that there is no reason to outsource these jobs. \nThere is no reason to outsource energy production, and there is no \nreason to handicap a growing industry that has helped make us and our \ncountry more energy independent. Let's pass the extension of the PTC \ntoday. Let's create jobs today. Let's build this clean energy economy. \nLet's pursue an all-of-the-above strategy. Let's do it here in the \nUnited States, and let's do it now.\n  Madam President, thank you for your attention and your interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, was there any time remaining for Senator \nUdall?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. He used 6 minutes.\n\n\n                               Tax Policy\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to talk a little bit about health \ncare and what it would mean if the Republicans get their way and take \naway so many benefits for millions of people. But before I do, I would \nlike to respond to Senator Hutchison's remarks on taxes.\n  President Obama has called on us to pass a tax cut for 98 percent of \nthe American people. That would not be for millionaires, but for the \nmiddle class. It is not for billionaires, but for the middle class--98 \npercent. He said anyone earning up to $250,000 will get a tax break. As \na matter of fact, he said all income under $250,000 will get a tax cut. \nOnly income over $250,000 would go back to the tax rates of Bill \nClinton. Let me remind everyone that in those years we had 23 million \nnew jobs created and a balanced budget, and we never had more \nmillionaires created in one period of time as we did then because it \nwas a fair tax system.\n  President Obama has asked us to give a tax break to everyone on the \nfirst $250,000 of their income and after that go back to the rates \nunder Bill Clinton. That includes 97 percent of small business owners. \nWhen we hear the Republicans get up and say: Democrats want to hurt \nsmall businesses, Democrats want to hurt the job creators, our position \nis that 97 percent of small business owners agree with the President--\nthey should get a tax break. If you earn over that $250,000, which is a \nfew percent, pay the fair share that we paid during the fabulous \neconomic growth period when Bill Clinton was the President.\n  Why do we feel it is important that we say 98 percent and not 100 \npercent of taxpayers? Because we have a deficit issue. We have a debt \nproblem. We want to get back to the days of balanced budgets, and we \nwill get there, if everyone pays their fair share.\n  So let's be clear. All of those tears being shed on the other side \nare being shed for people such as Donald Trump. Isn't it unfortunate \nthat a man such as Donald Trump, who was able to catch the dream to the \nultimate--and all right, we want that for everyone--has to pay just a \nlittle bit more? At a time when people are taking their money out of \nthis country and putting it in Swiss bank accounts and Bermuda accounts \nand accounts in the Cayman Islands, it is time for everyone to have a \nlittle patriotism here. We have to have the greatest country in this \nworld, and that means the strongest military in the world; that means \nthe best roads and bridges in the world; that means a strong education \nsystem. We want to wipe out cancer, AIDS, and Alzheimer's. That means a \nstrong medical research system. We need everyone in America to do their \npart.\n  My dad was a CPA. We were very middle class--lower middle class, I \nwould say. I started working in little jobs when I was 16, 17, and I \ngot mad. I hate to age myself, but the minimum wage was quite low then. \nIt was in the cents. It was around 75 cents an hour or something. I \nremember saying, Why do I have to pay anything to the government? I \ndon't want to pay anything. My father would say to me, You kiss the \nground you walk on because you live in America, and we have to have \nthings in this country to make us great. And don't you ever forget \nthat, and don't you complain about it. He also said, You make sure it \nis spent right and you make sure you have a voice in it. But this \ncountry needs to be strong. So to have millionaires and billionaires \ntake their money out of America and hide it in accounts in other \ncountries is not something I would be proud of. We should invest our \nfunds here and everyone should pay their fair share.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Here is the deal. The Republicans have said if they take over all of \nthe branches of government, which is their\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\ngoal, on day one they are going to repeal ObamaCare. They are going to \nrepeal our health care law. It reminds me of this: If I were to say to \nthe Presiding Officer, meet me on the corner at 6 o'clock tonight and I \nam going to punch you in the nose, hit you over the head, and leave you \nthere, she might rethink meeting me. She might say, you know, Barbara, \nthat is not something to look forward to. Well, let me say this to the \nmillions of Americans who are already receiving the benefits of \nObamaCare, which I will describe: You are about to be hit over the head \nand punched in the nose, if the Republicans take over Washington, DC. \nThat is their goal, to take over the Senate, take over the Presidency, \nand keep the majority in the House.\n  Let me tell my colleagues why I say this. Here are the benefits that \nare in jeopardy--not in jeopardy from repeal; they will be repealed: \nFree preventive services which have already begun: Cancer screenings \nand immunizations for those people who have private insurance. Fifty-\nfour million people are going to be punched in the nose and hit in the \nhead, if the Republicans take over and they repeal health care--on day \none. They are trying to do it today over in the House for the 31st \ntime.\n  Prescription drug discounts for seniors who are in the doughnut hole. \nFifty-two million seniors have already saved $3.7 billion. They are \ngoing to be hit in the head and punched in the nose on day one--not \neven day two--of a Republican takeover.\n  Free preventive services for seniors. We have 32.5 million Medicare \npatients who get free screenings now--32.5 million. That is almost as \nmany people as live in California who will be hit in the head and \npunched in the nose on day one--not on day two or three, but right \naway.\n  Protection against lifetime dollar limits. Right now, people think \nthey have a good health care insurance plan. If a person gets, God \nforbid, something such as cancer and they have it checked out and find \nout the limit is $\\1/2\\ million, maybe $1 million, maybe even $2 \nmillion limit--they don't know how fast that limit comes and then they \nare out of insurance. So now 105 million Americans who had limits on \ntheir policies no longer have limits. Well, if the Republicans take \nover, punch in the nose, hit in the head, they are finished; they are \nout.\n  Young adults who can now stay on their parents' plan up to age 26--\n6.6 million young adults--are out of luck on the first day of a \nRepublican takeover.\n  Let's go to the next chart. Limits on the amount of premiums health \ninsurance companies can spend on administrative costs. Right now, 12 \nmillion Americans-plus are going to receive a total of $1 billion in \nrebates because, under ObamaCare, the insurance companies have to spend \nthe money on patients--80 percent--not on their own perks, not on their \nbonuses, and people are going to get checks in the mail. So I say to \nthese 12.7 million Americans: I hope you are listening, because on day \none, no more rebates.\n  Tax credits to help small businesses purchase health insurance. We \nhear about how the Democrats don't care about small business. How about \nthis: The 360,000 small businesses who insure 2 million workers have \ngotten tax credits, right now--right now. We see the crocodile tears \nover there, yet they want to repeal a tax break that is helping 360,000 \nsmall businesses.\n  If a child is born with a preexisting condition, let's say some heart \ndefect, and that child can't get insurance. Today they can. Guess what. \nSeventeen million children benefit from this protection right now. \nSeventeen million of the most vulnerable people now have protection \nbecause of ObamaCare. But if the Republicans take over, these little \nbabies are out--out of luck--and their parents will probably have to go \non welfare. Great. Meet you on the corner, be there, vote for me, and I \nwill punch you in the nose and hit you in the head. That is what is \ngoing on.\n  Funding for new community health care centers and expansions. Already \n3 million patients have been helped by this. The fact is we have seen \nfunds go to these community health care centers in our communities, so \nwhether a person has insurance or not, they can drop in to a health \ncare center. It is particularly important in rural areas where they \nhave very little access.\n  I just talked about what happens already. Now, in 2014, we set up the \nhealth insurance exchanges so there is competition and people can get \ncheaper insurance. The preexisting condition benefit will then apply to \neverybody, so if you have a preexisting condition and you are an adult, \nyou can still get health care.\n  Women will get protection. Women have had to pay twice as much as a \nman for insurance. That is discrimination. That will be banned starting \nin 2014.\n  There will be protection against arbitrary annual limits on the \nhealth care benefits people can get. Sometimes people have the ability \nto get health care coverage, but it is capped every year. No more \nartificial caps.\n  Finally, we will say that health insurance plans have to cover \nessential benefits such as maternity care. Many plans will not cover \nmaternity care. That is over.\n  So then people say, Well, how is this reform paid for? The \nRepublicans say taxes will go up, deficits will go up. The CBO has told \nus that this is actually a reducer of the deficit by tens of billions \nof dollars. As a matter of fact, it reduces the deficit by $127 billion \nover the next 10 years. How is it that ObamaCare saves money? It is \nbecause we invest in prevention. Everyone within the sound of my voice \nknows that if a woman gets an annual mammogram and it indicates a very \ntiny start of a breast tumor and the patient gets that tumor out at an \nearly stage, they have avoided the worst consequences and it is way \ncheaper than waiting until the end when a patient needs radiation, \nchemotherapy, all of this tough medicine that is also expensive.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How else do we pay for this? We cut out waste and fraud \nin Medicare. We say to the health care industry: You make a lot more \nmoney and you have to pay a little more, and they will.\n  Then there are the free riders who say, I will never get sick, and if \nI do I will get free health care at the emergency room. We finally say \nto them, as they did in Massachusetts: Those days are over. If you can \nafford it, you need to get a basic policy. By the way, it is a tiny \npercentage of people. It is 1.4 million people. I think it is less than \n1 percent of the people who will have to get insurance because the rest \nof us are paying $1,000 a year to cover these people. So no more free \nrides. We all work together.\n  I will close with this. Watch out in this election who you vote for. \nIf somebody tells you they are going to repeal health care, that means \nall of these benefits go out the window. All of this deficit cutting \ngoes out the window. The Supreme Court said it is constitutional, and \nit is.\n  I want to make this point: Don't vote for people who will punch you \nin the nose, hit you in the head, and walk away from you. I think the \nchoice is between those who will lift people up and make life better \nfor people and their families and those who would go back to a system \nthat was so harmful for our families.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                             Power Outages\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise this morning to address a \nsituation that is very hard for me to believe, and I am sure for many \nof my colleagues, and maybe the Presiding Officer as well. It makes no \nsense to the people of our great State of West Virginia.\n  For nearly 2 weeks, hundreds of thousands of West Virginians have \nbeen deprived of basic necessities such as water and electricity \nbecause of massive storms--not just West Virginia but up and down the \neast coast. At the peak of the outage, FEMA estimates that 688,000 West \nVirginians didn't have power. That is a third of our State. One-third \nof our State was completely knocked out. Hundreds of thousands of \npeople had to throw away all of the food in their refrigerators and \nfreezers because of the lack of electricity.\n  Our National Guard and first responders did a superb job of keeping\n\n[[Page S4844]]\n\npeople safe. But this country learned just how vulnerable and \ninadequate our infrastructure is and how much we have come to depend on \nit. Up and down the east coast, our electrical grid was crippled by \nthis storm because there is no backup plan--none whatsoever--that could \nkeep the vital necessities of life running during these horrific \nstorms.\n  The fact is we have to invest in our Nation's infrastructure. We all \ntalk about it but still very little is being done. Power outages cost \nthis country between $79 billion and $164 billion every year. That is \nbecause on top of powering our hospitals, our nursing homes, and our \nschools, reliable energy underpins our economy and keeps Americans at \nwork.\n  I know there are other needs around the world, but seeing firsthand \nhow vulnerable our system is, I was so surprised--and the Presiding \nOfficer might be also--and disappointed to hear yesterday that the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers is making a massive investment in power \ninfrastructure in another country by awarding a $94 million contract to \nprovide--listen--reliable power in Afghanistan. So I thought: How will \nI explain this back home? We are providing reliable power to the \nAfghans when nearly 200,000 West Virginians spent an entire week \nwithout electricity, lost all of their food, and suffered through \nnearly 100-degree heat during this period of time, when our country is \nlosing tens and hundreds of billions of dollars because of power \noutages all over the east coast? As of 6 p.m. yesterday--this is more \nthan 12 days after the storm--we still have over 30,000 people without \nelectricity.\n  I cannot count the number of times I have come to the floor of this \nSenate Chamber to say it is time to start rebuilding America and not \nAfghanistan. But in all my time in the Senate, I have not seen a \nstarker example of misplaced priorities. It is wrong to invest in \nreliable power for the Afghan people when tens of thousands of not just \nWest Virginians but Americans all over this country have been without \npower for nearly 2 weeks because our infrastructure is so vulnerable.\n  In fact, in our State, too many people still don't have reliable \nwater. When the power goes out, the water systems can't purify the \nwater. In McDowell County in our southern coalfields, FEMA expects it \nwill be another 2 to 3 weeks before our water service is restored to \nthe customers in the Northfork public service district. Let me repeat \nthat. They will go another 2 to 3 weeks without water, a basic \nnecessity of life. That will be a full month after the storm without \none of life's basic necessities.\n  Something is truly out of balance. It has been almost 2 weeks since a \nstorm of unprecedented strength hit our State. How can I look the \npeople of my great State of West Virginia in the eye when our \ninfrastructure is so poor that they do not have reliable power or water \nbut still tell them we are investing in transmission lines to provide \nreliable power to Afghanistan? It just does not make sense.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the American \ntaxpayers have already spent more than $9 billion--$9 billion--on \ninfrastructure projects in Afghanistan, including the costs of \nreconstruction assistance, diplomatic security, and activities by non-\nDepartment of Defense agencies. This is in addition to the $551 billion \nwe have spent on military operations. And that does not even begin to \naddress Iraq, where we have spent at least $5 billion on electrical \nsystems and $61 billion total on infrastructure projects, according to \nthe Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\n  Still, when we take a closer look at the project that was announced \nyesterday, the facts are even more disturbing. The Army Times reported \nthat the Corps' awarding of $93.6 million to improve electrical \ntransmission from the Kajaki Dam power station throughout the Helmand \nProvince of Afghanistan includes burying transmission lines--burying \ntransmission lines which we do not even do in America--and providing \nbackup generators--which we do not have, which is why we have lost our \nwater systems and our food.\n  But believe it or not, the people of the United States already paid \nto build the Kajaki Dam powerhouse in the 1970s. I am going to quote \nfrom this article from the Army Times.\n\n       Because the entire electrical system has largely been \n     neglected--\n\n  Neglected--\n\n     due to decades of war, Afghan and U.S. agencies are \n     partnering to increase power generation and distribution to \n     solve the severe lack of electricity in the region.\n\n  Trust me, in West Virginia we can understand the severe lack of \npower.\n  This facility was not maintained in the 1970s. It was not maintained \nin the 1980s. It was not maintained in the 1990s. It is still not being \nmaintained. What makes us think it is going to be maintained now that \nwe are spending millions and millions of dollars?\n  This is only one small piece of an even more costly contract to bring \nelectricity to southern Afghanistan. The $93.6 million contract is the \nfirst of six integrated components collectively called the Kandahar \nHelmand Power Project, a USAID initiative to expand the electrical \ndistribution system of two provinces in southern Afghanistan, with a \ncombined estimated population of 1.7 million. That is short of the \npopulation of my home State of West Virginia. We are about 1.8 million.\n  It is one thing to help another country with loans--which I am all \nfor--that will help them get back on their feet so they can repay their \ndebts, but it is another thing entirely to pour billions of taxpayer \ndollars into another country for a decade with no chance of any \nrepayment to this country and to the taxpayers of the United States of \nAmerica. Something is wrong with that.\n  I cannot say it enough: If you build a bridge in West Virginia, we \nwill not blow it up. If you help us build a school, we will not burn it \ndown. We are very appreciative. We appreciate the help of all American \ntaxpayers because we are part of this great country. If you help us \ninvest in a more reliable electricity system, we will use that power to \nmake this country stronger, to power this Nation's economy, and to \nprovide good-paying jobs all over this country.\n  Not only that, the scope of the problem with electricity \ninfrastructure in West Virginia is tremendous. According to the \nNational Energy Technology Laboratory, power outages in West Virginia \ntake four times longer to fix than the national average. We have been \nblessed with so much beauty, but we have kind of a challenging \ntopography, if you will, and it makes it much more difficult.\n  If we modernize our grid to make it more flexible and reliable, we \ncan make a return on investment of up to $6 for every $1 we invest, \naccording to studies from both the Electric Power Research Institute \nand the National Energy Technology Laboratory. Instead of investing \nthat money in Afghanistan, doesn't it just make sense to invest it here \nat home? And we will start right in West Virginia if you like.\n  Madam President, I would feel the same if this was in your State, if \nit was in any other State in the country. This might have been a ``once \nin a lifetime'' storm, one where millions of people lost power no \nmatter how well we prepared, but the fact that tens of thousands of \nWest Virginians are still without power and water is a sign that we \nmust do better as a country.\n  This could have happened to any State--whether it is a storm, an \nearthquake, tornado, fire, flood, or a hurricane--and I hope that my \ncolleagues in the Senate would share my feelings. We cannot help others \nif we do not make and keep ourselves strong. We are beginning to \nneglect our very real needs at home.\n  As West Virginians, I am proud to say we are a strong people. We are \nable to pick ourselves up faster than most, and we go to the aid of our \nfriends and neighbors who need it most--even though we are in need \nourselves. But when you go to a filling station and the sign says \n``cash only,'' and then you find out that the banks are closed because \nall the power is down, and the ATM is out--we are changing and \ntransforming our whole monetary system, but there is no backup plan--\nwhat do you do? We have a problem. We truly have a problem. But I know \nwe can fix it because we are Americans.\n  That is why it is time to rebuild America and our infrastructure, not \nAfghanistan or other places of the world. Let's make ourselves strong \nagain so we can help people.\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, first, before I make my comments--I want \nto talk about the Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act--I want to say \nto my friend from West Virginia, I know they are struggling under \nincredible issues--even before the storm that occurred. I know he has \nefforts he is doing to build infrastructure, and his statements are \nright on the mark.\n  In western Alaska, 40 percent of the communities do not even have \nwater infrastructure. It is not a question of rebuilding it; they do \nnot have it. So I recognize the Senator and his great work for West \nVirginia, making it a better place. His points are well thought out and \nright to the mark about what we need to do to rebuild this country. A \ngood part of all that is it is about American jobs, American workers \nbuilding those water and sewer lines and putting those transmission \nlines back up--whether they be above or below the ground.\n  So, again, I commend the Senator for his work in West Virginia.\n  Madam President, I have come down to talk about the Small Business \nJobs and Tax Relief Act. I come from the small business world. I know \npeople come down to the Senate floor on the other side of the aisle and \ntalk about being from the small business world. I always like to look \nand see what that really means. It is always amazing to me.\n  When someone is from the small business world, here is what it is \nreally about: It is not about working for some corporation, having a \nnice title, not really worrying about making it from day to day or \nworrying about a payroll. At the end of the day, if the business is not \ngood, they do not get a check. That is how it works in the small \nbusiness world.\n\n  So when I hear people come down and talk about small business, it \nsurprises me, to be very frank, the lack of understanding, the lack of \nknowledge they have about the small business world. I have been in it \nfrom the age of 14. My wife has grown a business from serving and \nselling smoked salmon on the street corner to now, having a couple \nretail stores and doing very well. But she has struggled just like \neveryone else. She has had to deal with the bureaucracy. She has had to \nfigure out how to raise the capital, put retirement money on the table, \nmaximize her credit cards--do everything possible to take her dream and \nmake it a reality, just as I have done for all my years in the small \nbusiness world.\n  So I come here not just as a Senator from Alaska, representing \nAlaskans and small businesses, but also as someone who has lived it, \nworked it, and understands it. We have a chance--and I appreciate the \n80-to-14 vote to let us proceed to this bill, which is the Small \nBusiness Jobs and Tax Relief Act. This is an important bill. It has two \ncomponents that seem simple in a lot of ways but have great impact.\n  First, I want to mention the idea that you can get a tax credit for \nhiring people. Some say, well, small businesses will not use a tax rate \njust to hire people. I, maybe, agree to a certain extent on that, but \nwhy is this important? If you are a small businessperson and you are \ngoing to increase your payroll--maybe you are giving raises or bonuses, \nand so forth, or you are going to hire part-time or full-time people, \nif you hire those people--and just a clear example is if your payroll \nis $200,000, and your payroll goes up by $20,000 to $220,000, you will \nget a tax break of 10 percent, which is $2,000.\n  What will that small business do with that $2,000? In a big business \nthat just gets lost in some pile. Maybe it goes to some corporate \nsalary. But here is what a small businessperson will do with it. They \nwill get that $2,000, and they might now go recarpet their lease-hold \nimprovement or their rental space they are using for their small \nbusiness.\n  What does that mean? That $2,000 now goes to the carpet layer and the \ncarpet seller. What will they do with it? They will put it into the \nnext part of the economy. It just keeps moving much quicker and faster \nin the economy. As a matter of fact, every $1 we see out there has a \nmultiplier effect that is pretty significant for small business.\n  So the one piece is giving tax credits for small businesses to \nincrease their payrolls. It may be for increased salaries or for \nincreased employment. Either way you are putting more money into the \nworking people of this economy and, therefore, they are putting it back \ninto the economy.\n  The second piece of the act is the depreciation. If you are not a \nsmall businessperson, you do not really pay a lot of attention to this. \nBut the way the IRS Code works is if you invest in new equipment, \ncarpeting, sheet rock, lighting, whatever, the IRS has these schedules \nto deappreciate this over many years.\n  Here is how it works: First, we have the tax credit for payroll, and \nnow we have a second piece of this bill, which is accelerated or bonus \ndepreciation, which means if you are thinking of an idea--I will tell \nyou, a small business I just visited in Alaska called Lime Solar, by \nChet Dyson and Jessie Moe--these are two young men who are starting a \nsmall business to sell solar products for homes and businesses, but \nthey got a lease-hold space. They rented a space. It had no sheet rock, \nno lighting. They are responsible for paying for all of that.\n  So they invested, they cleaned it up, sheet-rocked it, fixed it all \nup, put equipment in. All that expense now--if this bill passes--can be \nwritten off in the first year instead of depreciating it over multiple \nyears.\n  Why is that important? Let's assume they spent $100,000 renovating \ntheir facility and they are in a 25-percent tax bracket. They will save \nin the first year $25,000--like that--instead of spreading that over \nthe next 10 or 15 years. Why is that important? That $25,000 they save \nin taxes or depreciation they will be able to reinvest, reinvest into \ntheir business as they struggle to figure out how to build their \nmarkets.\n  Another friend of mine, Jack Lewis, opened his second restaurant \nrecently, Firetap. Restaurants are not a cheap business. I have been in \nthat business. I would not wish it on anybody. It is a tough business. \nMargins are thin. But, again, he invested, he built it, built it all \nout of scratch. Now he can, again, under this bonus depreciation \nschedule depreciate it, write it off in the first year. That is a huge \nbenefit for these small businesses.\n  When I look at another small company called SteamDot Coffee--it is a \nsmall coffee company. Jonathan White owns it. They brew their own \ncoffee, have their own coffee, and they also package it and manufacture \nit for resale. That takes a lot of equipment. Now they get to write \nthat off in the first year.\n  What this bill does is simple, but yet it has a huge impact. As a \nmatter of fact, under the depreciation it is estimated that for every \n$1 we give in the tax benefit, there is a $9 benefit to the GDP, a 1-\nto-9 ratio. Any businessperson would love that deal. That is a great \ndeal.\n  So this bill, I hope--our colleagues have shown by 80 to 14 this is a \ngreat bipartisan effort. I hope we now move to the next stage. Maybe we \nwill have some amendments and work through it. But lets do it for the \nsmall business community of this country, for the State I live in, and \nfor every State.\n  I say to the Acting President pro tempore, the State of New York is \npiled with small businesses. When you go through New York City, every \ninch of the street has a small businessperson. That is what drives this \neconomy. That is what makes this economy happen. That is where we need \nto put our investment.\n  I will end on this note: I know we will have some pro forma votes, as \nI call them, show-and-tell. We will vote on this 20-percent tax rate \ndeduction that is being proposed by the House. It sounds good, but \nthere is no guarantee that is going to go back into the economy. As a \nmatter of fact, if you are a hedge funder, you will get that break. If \nyou are an attorney, you will get that break. If you are a small \nbusinessperson, you will get that break. But there is no guarantee that \nmoney goes back into the economy. So if we are going to give these tax \nincentives, let's make sure it is helping the economy and building jobs \nand building a future for us.\n  So, Madam President, I just wanted to come down and speak on this \nbill and encourage my colleagues to support the Small Business Jobs and \nTax\n\n[[Page S4846]]\n\nRelief Act, not only through the pro forma vote we had yesterday to \nmove forward on it but also to really pass it.\n  We have done a great job the last few months passing a lot of \nlegislation out of this body. Let's continue that effort and help our \neconomy grow.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBlumenthal and I be recognized for the next 20 or so minutes to speak \non the issue of cybersecurity.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Cybersecurity\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise to speak about cybersecurity, \nbut specifically about the cyber threat to our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure. By critical infrastructure I mean the power grid that \nsupplies electricity to our homes that keeps us warm in the winter and \ncool in the summer. I mean the financial services' processing systems \nthat connect our ATMs to our accounts and move money around in our \ncomplex financial system. I mean the communications networks by which \nwe talk and e-mail and text and message one another.\n  The men and women we have charged with our Nation's defense and we \nhave confirmed in these roles in the Senate have repeatedly and \nconsistently warned us about the danger of cyber attacks on this \ncritical infrastructure. It provides power and light and heat, tracks \nand records financial transactions, allows communication and data \ntransfer, keeps airlines safe in the air, controls our dams, and \nenables our commerce. The consequences of failure in these areas could \nbe catastrophic. We must pay heed to these warnings about America's \ncritical infrastructure as we consider cybersecurity legislation.\n  The administration has described this cyber threat in no uncertain \nterms. The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, has \nstated:\n\n       [I]t's clear from all that we've said [that] we all \n     recognize we need to do something. . . . We all recognize \n     this as a profound threat to this country, to its future, to \n     its economy, to its very being.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has warned:\n\n       The next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a \n     cyber attack.\n\n  Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano has compared this \nthreat to the September 11 attacks.\n\n       Prior to 9/11, there were all kinds of information out \n     there that a catastrophic attack was looming. . . . The \n     information on a cyberattack is at that same frequency and \n     intensity and is bubbling at the same level, and we should \n     not wait for an attack in order to do something.\n\n  Attorney General Holder stressed the urgency of responding to this \nthreat in a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. He said:\n\n       This a problem that we must address, our nation is \n     otherwise at risk and to ignore this problem, to think it is \n     going to go away runs headlong into all of the intelligence \n     we have gathered, the facts we have been able to accrue which \n     show that the problem is getting worse instead of getting \n     better. There are more countries that are becoming more adept \n     at the use of these tools, there are groups that are becoming \n     more adept at the use of these tools, and the harm that they \n     want to do to the United States and to our infrastructure \n     through these means is extremely real.\n\n  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey has warned that \n``a cyber attack could stop society in its tracks.''\n  NSA Director and U.S. Cyber Commander GEN Keith Alexander, a four-\nstar general, has stated:\n\n       We see this as something absolutely vital to the future of \n     our country. Cybersecurity for government and critical \n     infrastructure is key to the security of this Nation.\n\n  A recent report from the Department of Homeland Security found that \ncompanies which operate critical infrastructure have reported a sharp \nrise in cybersecurity incidents over the past 3 years. Companies \nreported 198 cyber incidents in 2011, up from 41 incidents in 2010, and \njust 9 in 2009. This may reflect that the private sector is just now \nbeginning to catch on. It is unfortunate but true that the private \nsector cannot be counted on to respond to this growing challenge on its \nown.\n  As Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter has explained, and I \nquote again:\n\n       There is a market failure at work here. . . . Companies \n     just aren't willing to admit vulnerability to themselves, or \n     publicly to shareholders, in such a way as to support the \n     necessary investments or lead their peers down a certain path \n     of investment and all that would follow.\n\n  These were administration warnings, but the concerns are bipartisan. \nA wide range of national security experts from previous Republican \nadministrations have echoed this alarm. Former Director of National \nIntelligence and NSA Director ADM Mike McConnell has said, and I quote:\n\n       The United States is fighting a cyber-war today, and we are \n     losing. It's that simple.\n\n  He explained:\n\n       As the most wired nation on Earth, we offer the most \n     targets of significance, yet our cyber defenses are woefully \n     lacking. . . . The stakes are enormous. To the extent that \n     the sprawling U.S. economy inhabits a common physical space, \n     it is in our communications networks. If an enemy disrupted \n     our financial and accounting transactions, our equities and \n     bond markets or our retail commerce--or created confusion \n     about the legitimacy of those transactions--chaos would \n     result. Our power grids, air and ground transportation, \n     telecommunications and water filtration systems are in \n     jeopardy as well.\n\n  That ends the quote from Admiral McConnell.\n  Admiral McConnell also made a comparison to threats from the past.\n\n       The cyber-war mirrors the nuclear challenge in terms of the \n     potential economic and psychological effects. . . . We \n     prevailed in the Cold War through strong leadership, clear \n     policies, solid alliances and close integration of our \n     diplomatic, economic, and military efforts. We backed all of \n     this up with robust investments--security never comes cheap. \n     It worked, because we had to make it work. Let's do the same \n     with cybersecurity. The time to start was yesterday.\n\n  Former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz has also echoed the \nadministration's warning that a cyber attack has the potential of \ncausing devastation on the scale of another September 11. He stated:\n\n       I hope we do not have to wait for the cyber-equivalent of \n     9/11 before people realize that we are vulnerable.\n\n  Former Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Stewart Baker has compared the threat to the catastrophic \neffects of Hurricane Katrina.\n\n       We must begin now to protect our critical infrastructure \n     from attack. And so far, we have done little. We are all \n     living in a digital New Orleans. No one really wants to spend \n     the money reinforcing the levees. But the alternative is \n     worse. . . . And it is bearing down on us at speed.\n\n  Former NSA Director and CIA Director Michael Hayden has said:\n\n       We have entered into a new phase of conflict in which we \n     use a cyberweapon to create physical destruction, and in this \n     case, physical destruction in someone else's critical \n     infrastructure.\n\n  Former Republican officials have also noted the cybersecurity gap in \nthe private sector due to this market failure. Former Secretary of \nHomeland Security Chertoff said:\n\n       The marketplace is likely to fail in allocating the correct \n     amount of investment to manage risk across the breadth of the \n     network on which our society relies.\n\n  The following examples are emblematic of the market failure that both \nDemocratic and Republican national security officials have identified \nin this cybersecurity area for critical infrastructure.\n  When the FBI-led National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force \ninforms an American corporation that it has been hacked, 9 times out of \n10 that American corporation had no idea.\n  Kevin Mandia of the leading security firm Mandiant has said, and I \nquote:\n\n       In over 90 [percent] of the cases we have responded to, \n     Government notification was required to alert the company \n     that a security breach was underway. In our last 50 \n     incidents, 48 of the victim companies learned they were \n     breached from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \n     Department of Defense, or some other third party.\n\n  In operation Aurora, the cyber attack which targeted numerous \ncompanies, most prominently Google, only 3 out of the approximately 300 \ncompanies\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\nattacked were aware that they had been attacked before they were \ncontacted by the government.\n  We cannot count on the private sector to defend itself against a \nthreat about which it is so unaware. An advanced persistent intrusion \nof the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's systems also went undetected until \nthe chamber received help from the government. The Wall Street Journal \nreported that a group of hackers in China breached the computer \ndefenses of the U.S. Chamber, gained access to everything stored in its \nsystems, including information about its 3 million members, and \nremained on the network for at least 6 months and possibly more than a \nyear. The chamber only learned of the break-in, according to the \narticle, when the FBI told the group that servers in China were \nstealing its information. The special expertise of our national \nsecurity agencies is a consistent theme through these examples. As \nformer Assistant Attorney General, OLC Director, and Harvard Law School \nProfessor Jack Goldsmith has explained:\n\n       The government is the only institution with the resources \n     and the incentives to ensure that the [critical \n     infrastructure] on which we all depend is secure, and we must \n     find a way for it to meet its responsibilities.\n\n  By the way, that was Goldsmith at the Department of Justice in the \nBush administration. This is a Republican appointee speaking. These \nwarnings have been repeatedly communicated to us in the Senate. We \ncannot plead ignorance of them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to \nSenate Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell dated January \n19, 2012.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 19, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell, We \n     write to urge the Senate to take up, debate, and pass \n     legislation to strengthen our nation's cybersecurity.\n       As former executive branch officials who shared the \n     responsibility for our nation's security, we are deeply \n     concerned by the severity and sophistication of the cyber \n     threats facing our nation. These threats demand a response. \n     Congress must act to ensure that appropriate tools, \n     authorities, and resources are available to the executive \n     branch agencies, as well as private sector entities, that are \n     responsible for our nation's cybersecurity. The Senate is \n     well-prepared to take up legislation in this important \n     national security field, and to do so in a bipartisan manner \n     in the best traditions of the Senate.\n       Every week brings new reports of cyber intrusions into \n     American companies or government agencies, new disclosures of \n     the breach of Americans' private information, or new \n     revelations of incidents of cyber disruption or sabotage. The \n     present cyber risk is shocking and unacceptable. Control \n     system vulnerabilities threaten power plants and the critical \n     infrastructure they support, from dams to hospitals. Reported \n     intrusions into defense contractors and military systems \n     reveal the direct national security cost of cyber attacks. \n     Evaluations of the Night Dragon and Aurora attacks reveal the \n     vulnerability of our most advanced and essential industries \n     to sophisticated hackers. The recent report by the Office of \n     the National Counterintelligence Executive makes clear that \n     foreign states are waging sustained campaigns to gather \n     American intellectual property--the core assets of our \n     innovation economy--through cyber-enabled espionage. The \n     growing threat of terrorist organizations acquiring cyber \n     capabilities and using them against American interests opens \n     another battlefront in cyberspace. And every day, Americans' \n     identities are compromised by international criminals who \n     have built online marketplaces for buying and selling \n     Americans' bank account numbers and passwords.\n       This constant barrage of cyber assaults has inflicted \n     severe damage to our national and economic security, as well \n     as to the privacy of individual citizens. The threat is only \n     going to get worse. Inaction is not an acceptable option.\n       Senate committees of jurisdiction have done important, \n     bipartisan work developing legislation to strengthen our \n     nation's cybersecurity. The Administration likewise has \n     weighed in with a set of legislative proposals. The stage \n     thus is set for the Senate to take up cybersecurity \n     legislation. We believe that it can and should undertake this \n     work in keeping with its best, bipartisan traditions, \n     addressing this pressing national security need with the \n     seriousness that it deserves.\n       We urge the Senate to do so in short order: the rewards of \n     increased security for our country, particularly our private \n     sector critical infrastructure, will be rapid and profound.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Chertoff.\n     William J. Lynn III.\n     J. Michael McConnell.\n     Richard Clarke.\n     Dr. William J. Perry.\n     Paul Wolfowitz.\n     Jamie Gorelick.\n     Gen. (ret.) James Cartwright, USMC.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. This explains that the threat is only going to get \nworse; inaction is not an acceptable option. This letter was signed by \nformer Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, former Deputy \nSecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, former Director of National \nIntelligence and NSA Director ADM Mike McConnell, former Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff General James Cartwright, former Defense \nSecretary Dr. Willian Perry, former Deputy Attorney General Jamie \nGorelick, former Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn, III, and \nformer Special Advisor to the President for Cyber Security, Richard \nClarke.\n  I also have a letter written to Majority Leader Reid and Minority \nLeader McConnell, dated June 6, 2012, which I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 6, 2012.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell, We write to urge you to \n     bring cyber security legislation to the floor as soon as \n     possible. Given the time left in this legislative session and \n     the upcoming election this fall, we are concerned that the \n     window of opportunity to pass legislation that is in our view \n     critically necessary to protect our national and economic \n     security is quickly disappearing.\n       We have spoken a number of times in recent months on the \n     cyber threat--that it is imminent, and that it represents one \n     of the most serious challenges to our national security since \n     the onset of the nuclear age sixty years ago. It appears that \n     this message has been received by many in Congress--and yet \n     we still await conclusive legislative action.\n       We support the areas that have been addressed so far, most \n     recently in the House: the importance of strengthening the \n     security of the federal government's computer networks, \n     investing in cyber research and development, and fostering \n     information sharing about cyber threats and vulnerabilities \n     across government agencies and with the private sector. We \n     urge the Senate to now keep the ball moving forward in these \n     areas by bringing legislation to the floor as soon as \n     possible.\n       In addition, we also feel that protection of our critical \n     infrastructure is essential in order to effectively protect \n     our national and economic security from the growing cyber \n     threat. Infrastructure that controls our electricity, water \n     and sewer, nuclear plants, communications backbone, energy \n     pipelines and financial networks must be required to meet \n     appropriate cyber security standards. Where market forces and \n     existing regulations have failed to drive appropriate \n     security, we believe that our government must do what it can \n     to ensure the protection of our critical infrastructure. \n     Performance standards in some cases will be necessary--these \n     standards should be technology neutral, and risk and outcome \n     based. We do not believe that this requires the imposition of \n     detailed security regimes in every instance, but some \n     standards must be minimally required or promoted through the \n     offer of positive incentives such as liability protection and \n     availability of clearances.\n       Various drafts of legislation have attempted to address \n     this important area--the Lieberman/Collins bill having \n     received the most traction until recently. We will not \n     advocate one approach over another--however, we do feel \n     strongly that critical infrastructure protection needs to be \n     addressed in any cyber security legislation. The risk is \n     simply too great considering the reality of our \n     interconnected and interdependent world, and the impact that \n     can result from the failure of even one part of the network \n     across a wide range of physical, economic and social systems.\n       Finally, we have commented previously about the important \n     role that the National Security Agency (NSA) can and does \n     play in the protection of our country against cyber threats. \n     A piece of malware sent from Asia to the United States could \n     take as little as 30 milliseconds to traverse such distance. \n     Preventing and defending against such attacks requires the \n     ability to respond to them in real-time. NSA is the only \n     agency dedicated to breaking the codes and understanding the \n     capabilities and intentions of potential enemies, even before \n     they hit ``send.'' Any legislation passed by Congress should \n     allow the public and private sectors to harness the \n     capabilities of the NSA to protect our critical \n     infrastructure from malicious actors.\n       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been \n     averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do \n     not want to be in the same position again when `cyber 9/11' \n     hits--it is not a question of `whether' this will happen; it \n     is a question of `when.'\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\n       Therefore we urge you to bring cyber security legislation \n     to the floor as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     Hon. J. Mike McConnell,\n     Hon. Paul Wolfowitz,\n     Gen. Michael Hayden,\n     Gen. James Cartwright (RET),\n     Hon. William Lynn III.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Secretary Chertoff, Admiral McConnell, Deputy \nSecretary Wolfowitz, General Hayden, and General Cartwright urged us \nto:\n\n       . . . bring cyber security legislation to the floor as soon \n     as possible. Given the time left in this legislative session \n     and upcoming election this fall, we are concerned that the \n     window of opportunity to pass legislation that is in our view \n     critically necessary to protect our national and economic \n     security is quickly disappearing.\n\n  They specifically focused on the threat to critical infrastructure, \nstating that ``protection of our critical infrastructure is essential \nin order to effectively protect our national and economic security from \nthe growing cyber threat.''\n  We must not ignore this chorus of warnings issued by those who are \nthe most informed and most alert about the danger to our critical \ninfrastructure. We must pass cybersecurity legislation, and we must \nensure that the cybersecurity legislation we pass addresses our \nNation's critical infrastructure. No bill that fails to address \ncritical infrastructure can be said to have done the job of protecting \nour country.\n  Our Nation will be vulnerable if critical infrastructure companies \nfail to meet basic security standards, as they do right now. \nLegislation must include a mechanism to end this continuing \nvulnerability. If operators object to a particular approach to \ncybersecurity for our critical infrastructure on the basis that it is \ntoo burdensome or too unwieldy, they will find many Members of the \nSenate on both sides--myself and Senator Blumenthal included--who are \nready and eager to work with them. But if the purpose of the exercise \nis to come to an end point in which the operators of our critical \ninfrastructure do not have to reach adequate levels of cybersecurity, \nthen we need to move on and we need to vote and go beyond that.\n  The question of how we get to cybersecurity is one we should engage \nin the Senate. The question of whether we protect our privately held \ncritical infrastructure in a responsible way is one we should not allow \nto deter us from getting this job done to protect our national and \neconomic security.\n  Whatever the ultimate solution, we simply must find a way to improve \nthe cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Blumenthal, who has been engaged in \nefforts with me to try to find a way through to a bipartisan bill that \nwill protect our critical infrastructure. He has expertise in this area \nas a superbly trained lawyer, a multiply elected Attorney General of \nhis home State, a former marine dedicated to our national security, and \nas a person who brings the highest level of legal talent to this \ndiscussion, having argued, I think, five separate cases before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He has been an enormous asset, and I appreciate his \nparticipation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, my distinguished colleague, for those very generous remarks. \nActually, I had four arguments in the Supreme Court. The rest was \nsimilarly exaggerated as to my qualifications. But I thank the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. Most importantly, I thank him for his extraordinary \nwork on this issue and for his leadership and vision as well as his \ncourage.\n  I wish to emphasize a number of the points he made so powerfully in \nhis remarks earlier. First and most significantly, the United States is \nunder cyber attack. The question is, How do we respond? It is our \nnational interests that are at stake.\n  Every day this Nation suffers attempted intrusions, attempted \ninterference, and attempted theft of our intellectual property as a \nresult of the ongoing attacks we need to stop, deter, and answer.\n  National security is indistinguishable from cybersecurity. In fact, \ncybersecurity is a matter of national security and not only so far as \nour defense capabilities; our actual weapons systems are potentially \nunder attack and interference, but also, as my colleague from Rhode \nIsland said so well, because our critical infrastructure is every day \nat risk--our facilities in transportation, our financial systems, our \nutilities that power our great cities and our rural areas and our \nintellectual property, which is so valuable and which every day is at \nrisk and, in fact, is taken from us wrongfully, at great cost to our \nNation.\n  The number and sophistication of cyber attacks has increased \ndramatically over the past 5 years. All the warnings--bipartisan \nwarnings--say those attacks will continue and will be mounted with \nincreasing intensity. In fact, experts say that with enough time, \nmotivation, and funding, a determined adversary can penetrate nearly \nany system that is accessible directly from the Internet.\n  The United States today is vulnerable. To take the Pearl Harbor \nanalysis that our Secretary of Defense has drawn so well, we have our \n``ships'' sitting unprotected today, as they were at the time of the \nPearl Harbor attack. Our ships today are not just our vessels in the \nsea but our institutions sitting in this country and around the world, \nour critical infrastructure, which is equally vulnerable to \nsophisticated and unsophisticated hackers.\n  In fact, the threat ranges from the hackers in developing countries--\nunsophisticated hackers--to foreign agents who want to steal our \nNation's secrets, to terrorists who seek ways to disrupt that critical \ninfrastructure.\n  It is not a matter simply of convenience. We are not talking about \ntemporary dislocations, such as the loss of electricity that the \nCapital area suffered recently or that our States in New England \nsuffered as a result of the recent storms last fall; we are talking \nabout permanent, severe, lasting disruptions and dislocations of our \nfinancial and power systems that may be caused by this interference.\n  One international group, for example, accessed a financial company's \ninternal computer network and stole millions of dollars in just 24 \nhours.\n  Another such criminal group accessed online commercial bank accounts \nand spread malicious computer viruses that cost our financial \ninstitutions nearly $70 million.\n\n  One company that was recently a victim of intrusion determined it \nlost 10 years' worth of research and development--valued at $1 \nbillion--virtually overnight. These losses are not just for the \nshareholders of these companies, they are to all of us who live in the \nUnited States because the losses, in many instances, are losses of \ninformation to defense companies that produce our weapons, losses of \nproperty that has been developed at great cost to them and to our \ntaxpayers. We should all be concerned about such losses.\n  As Shawn Henry, the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI, has \nsaid: ``The cyber threat is an existential one, meaning that a major \ncyber attack could potentially wipe out whole companies.''\n  Those threats to our critical infrastructure, as we have heard so \npowerfully from my colleague from Rhode Island, are widespread and \nspreading.\n  Industrial control systems, which help control our pipelines, \nrailroads, water treatment facilities, and powerplants, are at an \nelevated risk of cyber exploitation today--not at some point in the \nfuture but today. The FBI warns that a successful cyber attack against \nan electrical grid ``could cause serious damage to parts of our cities, \nand ultimately even kill people.''\n  The Department of Homeland Security said that last year they had \nreceived nearly 200 reports of suspected cyber incidents, more than 4 \ntimes the number of incidents reported in 2010.\n  In one such incident, more than 100 computers at a nuclear energy \nfirm were infected with a virus that could have been used to take \ncomplete control of that company's system.\n  These reports, these warnings, go on.\n  In summary, the Director of the FBI said it best: ``We are losing \ndata, we are losing money, we are losing ideas, and we are losing \ninnovation. ``\n  Those threats are existential to our Nation, and we must address them \nnow--not simply as a luxury, not as a possibility but as a need now.\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, as well as my distinguished \nfellow Senator from Connecticut, Joseph Lieberman, and others on the \nother side, such as Senators McCain, Collins, Graham, and Chambliss, as \nwell as other colleagues on this side, for their leadership in this \narea. They have started this effort with great dedication.\n  There has been substantial work done already. No one here has ignored \nthis threat. We must move forward for the sake of our Nation's \nsecurity. Our cybersecurity must be addressed as soon as possible. \nCybersecurity is not an issue we can wait to address until we see the \nresults of failure. The consequences of a debilitating attack would be \ncatastrophic to our Nation. I hope we can continue to fill the \nconsensus, which the Senator from Rhode Island has been working to do, \nwith other colleagues, so we can come together, as he said--not whether \nbut how--and do it in a bipartisan way. This issue has elicited, very \ncommendably and impressively, colleagues from both sides who have been \nworking on this issue with dedication and diligence. I hope the body as \na whole will match the vigor that is appropriate.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. Part of our challenge \nwill be to elicit better agency coordination. If the Senator from Rhode \nIsland wishes to comment further, I hope perhaps he can respond to the \nquestion of how soon we should come together and work on this issue. Is \nit a problem we can delay until the next session or should we try to \naddress it during the coming months of this session before we close?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am delighted to respond to the \nSenator in two ways. First, as the Senator so well pointed out, this is \nnot a future threat or a prospective threat that we need to prepare \nourselves against; this is an ongoing, current threat. There is a \ncampaign of attacks into our national security infrastructure, into our \nintellectual property, and into our critical infrastructure, such as \nthe power grids and the communications networks we count on in our \ndaily lives for what we consider the American standard of living here \nat home. So time is not our friend.\n  As one of the individuals I quoted said--I think Admiral McConnell--\nthe day to get this done was yesterday. So the sooner the better. We do \nneed to form a consensus in this body, enough to move through the \nparliamentary obstacles that exist in this body, which allows us to go \nforward and will allow us to go forward in a way that does something \nserious about forcing the operators of our critical infrastructure to \nput in adequate cybersecurity protections. If they have to do it \nbecause they have incentives to do it, that is one way of getting \nthere. If they have to do it because there are regulations that demand \nit, that is another way of getting there. There are different ways of \ngetting there. And as the Senator from Connecticut and I have \ndiscussed--and we are actually working together on this--we are open to \ndifferent ways to get there, but it should be agreed amongst us in the \nSenate that getting there, getting to the point where America's \ncritical infrastructure is protected from cyber attack as reasonably \nwell as we can should be the nonnegotiable goal. Anything short of that \nshould be seen as failure.\n\n  There is another thing I wanted to add. The Senator was very generous \nin his remarks and credentialing of a great number of Senators who have \nbeen working very hard. I would also like to single out Senator Coons, \nwho has been very helpful in our efforts.\n  I will stay on our side of the aisle at this point and add in \nparticular Senator Mikulski. Barbara Mikulski serves on the \nIntelligence Committee. She is keenly aware of the cyber threat. She \nhas taken deep dives into this issue in her role as a cardinal on the \nAppropriations Committee. She does the appropriations for many of the \nnational security agencies and law enforcement agencies that are deeply \ninvolved in this. So when she speaks, she speaks with real authority \nand she speaks with real impact. Her participation in this effort is \nextraordinarily helpful, in addition to the efforts of the many \nSenators whom my colleague singled out as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Louisiana is \nhere, and I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Senator and the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                        Prescription Drug Policy\n\n  Mr. VITTER, Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to talk about a \npriority of mine that has been the case since I first came to the \nSenate; that is, reimportation--changing Federal law appropriately to \nallow Americans to buy safe, cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and \nother countries.\n  We all know prescription drug prices are sky-high in the United \nStates. They are sky-high by any metric, by any measure, but certainly \nin this down economy and certainly for folks like our seniors who are \non a fixed income. They are particularly sky-high when you compare \nthose drug prices to the prices of exactly the same drugs in other \ncountries, including other Western industrialized countries, such as \nCanada immediately to our north.\n  For this reason, from the very beginning of my work in the Senate, I \nhave laid out a number of solutions that I believe would make the \nsituation a lot better, including generics reform, which I am working \non in a bipartisan way with other Members of the Senate. One of those \nproposed solutions has been reimportation. Again, that would mean \nchanging Federal law, as I think we absolutely need to do, to allow \nAmerican seniors and all Americans to buy safe, cheaper prescription \ndrugs from other countries such as Canada.\n  Let me emphasize that I am talking about exactly the same \nprescription drugs as we can buy here at much higher prices, and I am \nonly talking about FDA-approved drugs. I am talking about drugs coming \nfrom the same sources, manufacturing sites, either in this country that \ngo to Canada and other countries or sometimes from third-party \ncountries, with the drugs coming to both Canada and the United States.\n  When I first came to the Senate, we were on the verge of passing that \nlegislation. I worked in a bipartisan way with a large group of \nSenators, including Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, who was one \nof the leaders of the issue at the time; John McCain on our Republican \nside; and many others, including Olympia Snowe, who were also involved \nin this issue.\n  One of those strong vocal supporters of reimportation was then-\nSenator Barack Obama. He took a very clear position as a U.S. Senator \nbeing strongly in support of reimportation. He voted for the full-\nfledged reimportation bill in 2007, and as he became a Presidential \ncandidate, that strong, clear support continued during his Presidential \ncampaign. Then-candidate Obama clearly stated once again his strong, \ncrystal-clear support for reimportation. In fact, Presidential \ncandidate Obama used very feisty language about reimportation. He \nclaimed he would fight Big Pharma--the big pharmaceutical companies--\nstating, ``We'll take them on, hold them accountable for the prices \nthey charge'' and ``[drug] companies are exploiting Americans by \ndramatically overcharging U.S. consumers.''\n  Unfortunately, after then-candidate Obama was elected President, some \nthings changed, and the biggest change was the ObamaCare proposal and \nall of the backroom deals, bartering, and deal-making that led to its \npassage through Congress. I had concerns at the time. In fact, I spoke \nvery clearly about my concerns here on the Senate floor that there were \nsome backroom deals going on, essentially trading reimportation--the \nWhite House pledging to oppose reimportation, clearly against what the \nPresident ran on and how he voted here in the Senate, if Big Pharma \nwould join the effort to pass ObamaCare into law.\n  More recently, in the last few months, e-mails and other evidence \nhave surfaced that clearly confirm that is exactly what went on. In \nfact, the House Energy and Commerce Committee has had an investigation \ninto this issue, and it has revealed and made very clear the closed-\ndoor negotiations about ObamaCare that essentially struck a deal \nbetween Big Pharma and the White House, the White House saying: You \nsupport ObamaCare, you help us pass it, you\n\n[[Page S4850]]\n\nproduce advertising dollars to do that, and we will deep-six--kill \nforever--reimportation.\n  As I said, this House investigation has laid out a clear pattern of \ne-mails and other communications that tell the story very clearly. \nPhRMA e-mails, for instance, say:\n\n       Rahm will make it clear that PhRMA needs a direct line of \n     communication, separate and apart from any other coalition.\n\n  Of course, Rahm is then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.\n  On June 10, 2009, PhRMA lobbyists met with White House officials, and \ncoming out of that meeting, they said they had discussed the details \n``and the expected financial gain from health reform.''\n  The same House investigation has revealed meetings between top \nadministration officials and other special interest groups, including \nmeetings at the DSCC--Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee--to \ncoordinate political operations. PhRMA lobbyists attended these \nmeetings to learn about White House messaging and ``how our effort can \nbe consistent with that.''\n\n  Then the final big deal was struck, and the big deal, as revealed \nclearly by this evidence and these e-mails, was very clear: PhRMA--the \nbig pharmaceutical companies--would support ObamaCare not just in word \nbut in deed, including putting up $70 million to help fund an \nadvertising campaign in support of the passage of ObamaCare. That $70 \nmillion from the biggest pharmaceutical companies went to two 501(c)(4) \ngroups--Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care. \nThese groups were formed specifically to advertise and promote the \npassage of ObamaCare. The former group was actually created after a \nmeeting discussing the need for these efforts at the DSCC, a Democratic \ncampaign arm. In addition, Big Pharma--the biggest pharmaceutical \ncompanies--offered $80 billion in payment reductions and other parts of \nhealth care financing in order to again secure their top priority: \nkilling, in their mind, hopefully forever, reimportation.\n  In June President Obama's top White House health care adviser, Nancy-\nAnn DeParle, wrote to PhRMA that the Obama administration had ``made \n[the] decision, based on how constructive you guys have been, to oppose \nimportation.'' Later, after that, PhRMA lobbyist e-mails confirm the \ndeal and specifically highlight a conversation a PhRMA lobbyist had \nwith White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina. The PhRMA lobbyist \nwrote:\n\n       Confidential. [White House] is working on some very \n     explicit language on importation to kill it in health care \n     reform.\n\n  In August 2009 PhRMA's top lobbyist at the time, Billy Tauzin, made \nit crystal clear as well when he said:\n\n       We were assured . . . you will have a rock-solid deal.\n\n  The tragedy of all this is they apparently did have a rock-solid deal \nbecause if we look at Senate votes after that backroom deal which \nhelped pass ObamaCare, there were multiple individual Senators who \nflipped their votes and made good on the White House rock-solid deal to \nkill reimportation--that opportunity for all Americans, particularly \nseniors, to be able to buy safe, cheaper prescription drugs from Canada \nand elsewhere.\n  Let's look at votes on the broad reimportation bill which was led by \nthen-Senator Byron Dorgan. I was a cosponsor, and so were many other \nSenators who had been involved in this issue, such as John McCain, \nOlympia Snowe, and many others. In 2007 the Senate actually passed that \nmeasure 63 to 28, although after that it was essentially scuttled by a \npoison pill that was added to the bill. But the vote on the base \nmeasure was 63 to 28, with 47 Senate Democrats voting yes, including \nthen-Senator Barack Obama.\n  Now let's flash-forward to 2009, after the ObamaCare backroom deal, \nand it is a whole different planet, a whole different landscape. The \nSenate defeated the same measure 51 to 48. There was a 60-vote \nthreshold, with 38 Senate Democrats voting yes--a far smaller number--\nand 23 Senate Democrats switching their votes from 2007. It was exactly \nthe same measure, but 23 Senate Democrats flip-flopped, switched their \nvotes in light of the White House ObamaCare deal.\n  We can see a similar flip-flop with regard to votes on my Vitter \namendment, which was a more narrowly tailored measure regarding \nreimportation. In 2009 the Senate passed that Vitter amendment 55 to \n36, with, again, 45 Senate Democrats voting yes on that more focused \nand narrowly tailored reimportation amendment. But in 2011, after the \ndeal, it was a completely different story. The Senate rejected the same \namendment 45 to 55, with only 29 Senate Democrats voting yes--again, 14 \nSenate Democrats having switched their votes, doing a complete flip-\nflop from 2009.\n  So I believe the facts are in. Investigations, e-mails, and other \ncrystal-clear evidence, including those votes and vote switches, make \nit very clear there was a backroom deal worth billions of dollars to \nBig Pharma and worth a lot politically to the Obama White House. That \ndeal, as evidenced by these communications and quotes and e-mails, was \nvery clear.\n  Big Pharma said: We will help you pass ObamaCare. We will give you \n$70 million in advertising money. We will help lower costs so you can \nbrag that ObamaCare is, through some smoke and mirrors accounting, \nactually saving money when it is not. And, in exchange, you kill \nreimportation, which would lower prices on us and hurt our profit \nmargin. And the White House said: Absolutely, we agree.\n  Senator Obama was full bore for reimportation. Candidate Obama \ncampaigned on the issue and was very strong and vocal about it. \nPresident Obama cut the backroom deal and killed it. Those of us who \nare still fighting for lower prescription drug costs here in the Senate \nare, quite frankly, still reeling from the setback and still trying to \ndeal with it. But I believe we ultimately will deal with it and will \nrecover from this major setback when the American people fully realize \nwhat went on--the corrupt, I would say, backroom deal that was cut \nbetween the White House and Big Pharma, and how seniors and other \nAmericans are paying the price.\n  ObamaCare passed, and prescription drug prices continue to be sky \nhigh. They continue to hurt tens of millions of Americans, particularly \nthose on a fixed income such as seniors. And we continue to need a \nsolution to that very real problem. That is why I will continue to \nfight. I will continue to fight for any measure that makes sense to \nlower prescription drug prices, generics reform, streamlining at FDA, \nand, yes, reimportation, to level the playing field, to get a world \nprice on the drugs we use and not force a much higher price on \nAmericans than virtually anyone else pays around the world.\n  America's seniors need that relief. I wish the Obama White House \nunderstood that and acted upon that. I wish President Obama would keep \nhis word that he made as a Senator and as a Presidential candidate. But \nI will continue to keep my word on the issue and to build that support \nfor strong, effective reimportation legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                       Honoring Raoul Wallenberg\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today on a matter that has \nbecome very close to my heart; and that is, honoring Raoul Wallenberg \nwith the Nation's highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal \nof Honor. I urge my colleagues to support conferring this honor on Mr. \nWallenberg, and I am grateful that we already have 71 of my colleagues \nfrom every part of the political spectrum supporting our efforts.\n  During World War II, Raoul Wallenberg chose to leave his life of ease \nin Sweden for a diplomatic assignment in Hungary, which was then an \nally in Nazi Germany. His assignment was the result of a recruitment \neffort by the United States War Refugee Board and the Office of \nStrategic Services to try to save the remaining Hungarian Jews from the \nHolocaust.\n  In his effort, Mr. Wallenberg succeeded beyond anyone's expectations. \nHe provided Swedish passports for thousands of Jews, which literally \nmade the difference between life and death. Mr. Wallenberg rented 32 \nbuildings in Budapest, raised a Swedish flag, and declared them \nprotected with diplomatic immunity. Within these buildings, he housed, \nprotected, and saved almost 10,000 precious lives.\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\n  Mr. Wallenberg's bravery and his will to act are shining examples to \nus all. According to eyewitnesses, Mr. Wallenberg once climbed onto the \nroof of a train with Jews departing for Auschwitz, handing them \nprotective passes through the doors. Amid threats from the guards, he \nthen marched dozens of those with passes to safety in a diplomatic \nconvoy. As the Nazi front was collapsing and Adolf Eichmann moved to \nkill all the remaining Jews in Budapest, it was Mr. Wallenberg who \nhelped thwart that plan by threatening Hungarian leaders with the \npromise of hanging for war crimes if they carried out the plot.\n  Sadly, and selflessly, Mr. Wallenberg was later taken prisoner when \nthe Soviet Army liberated Budapest from the Nazis, and it is presumed \nthat he died in a Moscow prison.\n  This hero's willingness to risk his own life for others exemplifies \nhis outstanding spirit, his dedication to humanity, and the \nresponsibility for all of us to speak out against atrocities. His \nenduring legacy lives on in the countless descendants of those he \nsaved, the lives of New Yorkers such as Peter Rebenwurzel, a New York \nCity resident whose late father helped Jews in the Budapest ghetto, and \nwhose father-in-law only survived because of Mr. Wallenberg's heroic \nefforts.\n  I wish also to take this moment to recognize Andrew Stevens, who was \nan active member of the Jewish underground during the Holocaust who \nworked bravely alongside Mr. Wallenberg to save Jewish lives.\n  As we move to award Raoul Wallenberg with this Congressional Medal of \nHonor upon the centennial of his birth, we pay tribute to an \nextraordinary man whose life should serve as a shining example of \nleadership and courage for all future generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I wish also to address the second issue of something \nwe have been debating on the floor all morning, and that is the issue \nof jobs and what this Congress is doing to help our small businesses \ngrow.\n  I rise in support of the Landrieu-Snowe amendment and the underlying \nbill. These two proposals will address what every American expects us \nto take on; that is, coming together to create jobs, help our economy \ngrow, and focus squarely on creating opportunities for our middle class \nto thrive. All across my home State of New York, too many middle-class \nfamilies are continuing to struggle in this very tough economy.\n  Of course, the government doesn't create any jobs. Businesses create \njobs and ideas, and people create jobs, especially small businesses. \nSmall businesses have been responsible for at least 60 percent of all \nnew jobs that have been created, and small businesses can give us the \nspark we actually need to create a growing economy and a thriving \nmiddle class.\n  I have spent months going all across New York State having \nroundtables with businesses, and I have particularly hosted roundtables \nfocused on women-owned businesses. I have been to restaurants, I have \nbeen to bookstores, I have been to recyclers, I have been to \nincubators, I have been to home stores, all businesses created by women \nall across New York State.\n  Women-owned businesses are among the fastest growing sector within \nthe small business economy. More than 10 million businesses are owned \nby women, employing more than 13 million people and generating nearly \n$2 trillion worth of sales in 2008 alone. Even though women-owned \nbusinesses start their businesses with about eight times less capital \nthan their male counterparts, in the decade from 1997 to 2007, women-\nowned businesses added roughly \\1/2\\ million jobs to our economy. That \nis the kind of growth we need right now. That is the kind of spark that \ncould actually make a difference. And we could do our part right here \nin Congress this week. It is time to end all the political posturing. \nIt is time to come together around commonsense core ideas, such as \ngiving these businesses the tax breaks they need to grow.\n\n  We shouldn't wait another day to eliminate capital gains on \ninvestments in these small businesses. We should extend the tax breaks \nfor businesses that allow them to invest in new property, plants, or \nequipment and take those deductions upfront. We should give them \nincentives to hire those new employees. It is our responsibility as \nlawmakers to do this kind of work together, in a bipartisan way, one \nthat can set aside the political gamesmanship.\n  I know, just as women-owned small businesses are ready to lead us to \nlasting economic strength and growing economy, the women of the Senate \nare there to support them. Democrats and Republican women have come \ntogether around this bill in a bipartisan way to urge our colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  These tax provisions provide relief to the self-employed, to small \nbusinesses in their capital investments, and encourage new investment. \nThey work hand in hand with other tax credits that encourage new hires \nand wage increases. The combination of these things will harness their \nfull potential for our American businesses to grow.\n  We know these proposals are effective. They helped boost private \nsector job creation over the past 2 years. But we all know there is so \nmuch more we have to do, and we can start by renewing these commonsense \nsteps to unlock the power of our small businesses.\n  These aren't Democratic ideas; they are not Republican ideas; they \nare just good ideas. They are good, commonsense ideas that can make a \ndifference. We should be able to come together to do this for the \nAmerican people to create a growing economy again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted by a wide margin \nto proceed to Leader Reid's Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act.\n  Everyone in this Chamber claims to support both small businesses and \ntax relief, and Republicans know the best way to do that is to stop the \n$4.5 trillion tax hike that looms over the economy, and it is crippling \njob creators.\n  Fortunately, there is an easy way to solve the problem: Vote on and \npass amendment No. 2491, introduced by Senators Hatch and McConnell and \ncosponsored by myself and several colleagues.\n  The amendment is simple. It prevents the looming expiration of the \n2001 and 2003 tax relief for 1 year, and lays out specific conditions \nfor progrowth tax reform in the coming months. It is similar to the \napproach the House will take later this month.\n  In other words, the Hatch-McConnell amendment stops income tax rates \nfrom rising. It stops capital gains and dividends rates from rising. It \nstops the job-killing death tax from rising and the related exemption \nfrom falling. And it prevents the alternative minimum tax from \nengulfing millions more middle-income Americans.\n  It is an amendment that would protect our economy more than any debt-\nfinanced stimulus bill or other kind of short-term tax credit that the \nObama administration could dream up. It is an amendment that, given the \nhistory of bipartisan support for tax relief in this Chamber, should \npass the Chamber today.\n  To be clear, stopping these tax hikes for 1 year is not a perfect \nsolution. My preference is to continue the current rates as we move \ntoward comprehensive tax reform for both individuals and corporations. \nBut let's be clear about what the other options are.\n  First, we could let the top two marginal tax brackets increase from \n33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent respectively. That is what \nPresident Obama and Leader Reid wish to do.\n  That strategy means that almost 1 million business owners will be hit \nwith a massive tax increase on New Year's Day. And that is according to \nthe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. That strategy means 53 \npercent of business income will be subjected to a tax hike in order to \nfund the historic levels of spending from the current administration. \nThe strategy guarantees more jobs will be lost, that unemployment will \nstay high, and that economic growth will remain sub par.\n  Let me repeat that. Over half--53 percent--of all business income \nwould be subjected to this tax increase.\n  If we do nothing, the current code expires and Americans will see \nover $4.5\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\ntrillion taken from the private sector over the next decade. This will \nhelp push us into a recession next year, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. For any Member of this Chamber who cares about job \ncreation and economic recovery, these two options should be \nunacceptable. They certainly were for President Obama in 2010. Less \nthan 2 years ago, when President Obama signed legislation into law \npreventing taxes from going up on any American, he noted that tax \nhikes, and I am quoting here, ``would have been a blow to our economy \njust as we are climbing out of a devastating recession.''\n  Evidently, 40 Senate Democrats agreed with the President since they \ntoo voted to stop taxes from increasing in 2010. What is the difference \nnow? Our economy is in worse shape, growing now at less than 2 percent. \nAt that time it was 3 percent. So there is even more reason not to \nraise taxes now than there was in 2010 when the President thought it \nwas a bad idea.\n  I want to echo the sentiments of Senator McConnell this morning. Even \nthough the President's plan is bad for the economy, we should vote on \nit and we should vote on the Hatch amendment today. Let's show the \nAmerican people where we stand. A unanimous consent agreement to do \njust that was blocked this morning by the majority leader even though \nPresident Obama said the following 2 days ago:\n\n       So my message to Congress is this: Pass a bill. I will sign \n     it tomorrow. Pass it next week; I'll sign it next week. Pass \n     it next--well, you get the idea.\n\n  We should follow President Obama's suggestion. We should vote on \nthese proposals. Let's vote on his proposal. Let's vote on Senator \nHatch's proposal. Senator Hatch's proposal will stop taxes from going \nup on any American. The other one will burden nearly 1 million business \nowners with job-killing higher taxes. I think Americans deserve to know \nwhere their elected officials stand on these critical issues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask to speak on an amendment I have sent \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments are not in order at this time, but \nit can be submitted.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask to speak on the bill I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The measure will be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. WEBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Parliamentarian for \nthat clarification.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Webb pertaining to the introduction of S. 3372 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WEBB. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the current parliamentary \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is postcloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 2237.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n\n\n                         Vermont National Guard\n\n  Mr. President, let me begin by noting that this morning, while \nwatching ``The Today Show,'' I saw a piece about the Vermont National \nGuard. We have called them the Green Mountain Boys from the time of \nEthan Allen. It was fascinating to watch Savannah Guthrie, who is one \nof the anchors of the morning program ``The Today Show.'' Her brother \nis a colonel with the Vermont National Guard who flies F-16s. She got \nto ride on the plane with her brother, which I thought was remarkable. \nI had the opportunity to fly with them before. For those of us who are \nusually confined to flying on airlines, this is a little bit different, \nboth in takeoff, visibility, and maneuvers. I have never been on a \ncommercial airplane where I was pulled anywhere from 5 to 9 Gs, as that \nflight was.\n  I was glad to see not only Colonel Guthrie recognized, but also all \nthe men and women of the Vermont National Guard. This is a group who, \nin the hours after 9/11--the tragedies of 9/11--immediately took to the \nair and guarded the skies over New York City.\n  I recall when our adjutant general called me to tell me that the \nGreen Mountain Boys were protecting New York City around the clock.\n  I asked her: Where are you basing them from?\n  She said: Vermont.\n  I said: Well, how long does it take you to get to New York City?\n  She told me: With the after burners, a matter of minutes.\n  I have never been quite able to make that flight on a commuter plane \nfrom Burlington, VT, to New York City. But they can be refueled in \nmidair.\n  Everybody, whether on vacation or not, showed up at the Vermont \nNational Guard--our mechanics, flight administrators, and pilots, of \ncourse. They kept those planes going around the clock for weeks. They \ndid not miss a single day of their mission, or a single minute of their \nmission--even with all the calibration of weapons and radar and \neverything else. It was a remarkable scene.\n  I am glad to see them recognized this morning, and as a Vermonter, I \nam extraordinarily proud of our Vermont National Guard, both our Army \nGuard and our Air Guard. They do all the people of our State proud.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak on another matter, and I ask as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, small businesses and working families \nthroughout Vermont and around the country are facing incredibly \nchallenging times. These problems are especially acute in my State, \nwhere we rely so heavily on small businesses to create jobs for our \ncitizens and to make Vermont the desirable place to live and to visit \nthat it is.\n  The Federal Government has rightly recognized the important role \nsmall businesses play in our economy. From SBA loans, to USDA Rural \nDevelopment grants, to small business set-asides on government \ncontracts, a variety of targeted Federal programs join with small \nbusinesses to help them grow and prosper.\n  This Congress has enacted several job-creating steps. Just last year, \nI was able to lead the effort here in the Senate to enact a major \noverhaul of our Nation's outdated patent laws. The Leahy-Smith America \nInvents Act is going to create jobs, but also, and very importantly, it \nis going to help unleash more American innovation, and it does not add \na penny to our deficit. In fact, last year Vermont was awarded more \npatents per capita than any State in the Union. Of course, those \npatents mean more jobs for Vermonters.\n  And 2 weeks ago we made further progress by passing a transportation \nfunding bill that will make vital investments in our Nation's roads, \nbridges, and transit systems, and a student loan bill that will lower \nthe costs of college borrowing for thousands of students and their \nfamilies.\n  I might say, these student loans are extremely important. I remember \nthe one I had when I was in law school--a 10-year loan. Two things \nhappened the year of that last payment, that 10th payment on my student \nloan from law school: first, the satisfaction my wife, Marcelle, and I \nhad in paying off the loan, and second, it was that same year I was \nsworn into the U.S. Senate. I wonder if I would have been here had we \nnot had the money to pay for school.\n  But I think we can and must do more to help our struggling small \nbusinesses and working families.\n  That is why I strongly support the bill before us today that will \nprovide small businesses with tax incentives to begin hiring again. The \nbill is a multipronged strategy for spurring job creation. First, it \nwould create a tax credit for businesses to hire new workers or \nincrease wages for their current\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\nworkers. In other words, instead of saying that we just give a tax \nbreak to extraordinarily wealthy people and somehow jobs will be \ncreated, we say: Let's see the jobs. Show me the jobs. Show me the \njobs. If you have a tax credit for businesses that hire new workers or \nincrease wages for their current workers, then that is a good use of \nour Tax Code. Second, it would allow businesses to immediately write \noff all of the major purchases they make this year. That is a tangible \nincentive for new investments and new hires, right away.\n  I do not support this bill just because the President supports it, or \nthe Democratic leader supports it, or most of the Members of my side of \nthe aisle support it. They all do stand behind this effort, and I am \ngrateful for that. I support this bill because I have heard from small \nbusiness owners in Vermont, Democratic and Republican alike, who tell \nme they would make capital improvements and put people to work \nimmediately if this bill were signed into law. And I suspect the same \nwould be true in virtually every other State in this country.\n  On the shores of Lake Champlain, in the northern border town of \nHighgate, VT, sits one of America's most genuine and beautiful family \nresorts: the Tyler Place Family Resort. Year after year, families flock \nto the resort to spend time with their families, swimming and boating \nand enjoying a summer campfire. It is the kind of place that draws the \nsame families year after year, where multigenerational families take \ntime to enjoy each other's company as well as the great food and the \nmagnificent views. It is easy to forget, especially when you are \nsitting there watching the sunset over the beautiful, great big Lake \nChamplain, that it is one of the millions of small businesses that keep \nAmerica's economy moving forward and Americans at work.\n  Last year I heard from the owners of the resort, including Pixley \nTyler Hill, a dogged advocate for Vermont, for Vermont's tourism \nindustry, and for Lake Champlain, about their interest in seeing an \nextension of the bonus depreciation provision that expired in December.\n  Her brother Ted Tyler summed it up by saying:\n\n       These changes in the tax law make all the difference in the \n     world in decisions whether to spend money, and thereby \n     stimulate the economy and increase employment in the process. \n     For example, consider a resort deciding whether to add tennis \n     courts, put in a new sewer system, upgrade roads or do major \n     landscaping work--say, at an anticipated cost of $300,000. \n     Absent bonus depreciation the company will have paid $300,000 \n     but it can only deduct $20,000 that year as an expense for \n     tax purposes. True enough that over the next 14 years, the \n     business can continue to write off $20,000. But how many \n     small businesses can afford to wait that long to recoup the \n     $280,000 they no longer have?\n\n  Pixley and Ted had me sold the minute they explained that this tax \nincentive was the difference between making new investments and hiring \nsomeone, and sitting on their hands waiting for things to change. \nExtending this provision alone is reason enough to pass the bill.\n  This bill is full of a million other reasons why we should be working \nwith all the determination we can muster and promptly pass it. Pass it \nnow when the economy needs it. It is a good, solid reason for each of \nthe jobs it would create for working families and businesses all over \nAmerica.\n  I urge all Senators to work without delay on this important \nlegislation. Businesses in each of our 50 States are waiting for us to \nlend another helping hand to the economic recovery act.\n\n\n               Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act\n\n  Mr. President, it has been nearly 3 months since the Senate passed \nthe bipartisan Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act--\n3 months. We are no closer to enacting this bill into law than we were \nin April when 68 Senators, Republican and Democratic Senators alike, \nvoted for this critical legislation to protect women from domestic and \nsexual abuse.\n  I am concerned that politics threatens to get in the way of passing \nthis critical legislation this year. Protecting every victim of \ndomestic and sexual violence should be above politics. Members of \nCongress in both Chambers, set aside the political rhetoric. Act \nswiftly to reauthorize this landmark legislation and save countless \nlives.\n  Time is running out. There are only a few weeks left in this session \nbefore election-year politics take over and Congress comes to a \nstandstill. There are critical improvements in the Leahy-Crapo \nreauthorization bill that will not take effect unless Congress acts. We \ncannot simply say: Well, if we do not enact it, maybe we can do it next \nyear or the year after. There are a lot of major programs that can only \nbe enacted in this bill, not in appropriations, not any other way.\n  Sexual assault programs will not receive the added support they need \nunless we pass our bill into law. The legislation's emphasis on \nincreasing housing protection for victims and preventing homicides \nconnected to domestic and sexual violence will not have an opportunity \nto help vulnerable victims across the country. Important improvements \nin campus safety and prevention programs for teens will not occur. \nImmigrant victims, Native women, and LGBT victims will continue to \nremain without the services and protection they need and deserve.\n  The legislation is too important to wait. I hear from victims and the \nprofessionals who work on their behalf. They say they need the \nimprovements made by the Leahy-Crapo bill and they need them today.\n  The legislation is particularly important during difficult economic \ntimes because the economic pressures facing many Americans can pose \nadditional hurdles in leaving abusive relationships. Active community \nnetworks are needed to provide support to victims in these \ncircumstances, yet budget cuts result in fewer available services, such \nas emergency shelters, transitional housing, and counseling.\n  Late last month, I had the opportunity to speak at the VAWA National \nDays of Action rally, where survivors and professionals in the field--\nthose who have dedicated their lives to helping victims all over the \ncountry--gathered together to send Congress a message. They told me \nthey are very frustrated by the lack of progress in passing VAWA, and \nrightfully so, because they and the victims they serve are the ones who \nare affected by Congress's inaction. They were so inspired when this \nbody came together and 68 of us voted to pass it. Now they ask when are \nwe going to finish.\n  Their message to Congress was loud and clear: Do your job. Pass VAWA \nnow. Supporting the work of these tireless advocates, and the victims \nthey help, should be our priority.\n  Victims should not be forced to wait any longer. They will not \nbenefit from the improvements we made in the Senate bill unless both \nHouses of Congress vote to pass this legislation. The problems facing \nvictims of domestic and sexual violence are too serious for Congress to \ndelay. Domestic and sexual violence knows no political party. Its \nvictims are Republican and Democratic, rich and poor, young and old. As \nI said so many times, a victim is a victim is a victim. Helping these \nvictims, all of these victims, should be our goal.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we were here two winters ago, in \nFebruary, when Washington was hit by a snowstorm that achieved the \nnickname Snowmageddon. The city and, in fact, much of the mid-Atlantic \nwas buried under feet of snow. It was the biggest snowstorm in 90 years \nfor this area. People in Washington were struggling to get to work and \nschool, and people went without power for days.\n  This being Washington, some of our colleagues in the Senate seized on \nthat opportunity to mock climate change and to suggest these winter \nsnowstorms were inconsistent with the projections of what would happen \nfrom global warming and climate change. As an initial matter, that is a \nfalse comparison from the very get-go all by\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\nitself. Climate science models have predicted consistently that as \npolar icecaps and glaciers melt and more water enters the system, we \ncan expect heavier precipitation events. One of the ways it has been \ndescribed is that if you have a pot on the stove and you have the heat \nunder it and it is simmering, when you turn up the heat, you get more \nactivity in the pot. You add energy to a dynamic system like a pot of \nboiling water, and it creates more energy in the dynamic environment.\n  In the same way, the extra energy coming in because of climate \nchange, our carbon pollution in the atmosphere, is energizing our \natmosphere and our weather, and we are getting weather extremes as a \nresult.\n  There was an article in Science Daily, headlined ``Arctic Ice Melt Is \nSetting Stage for Severe Winters.'' It says this:\n\n       The dramatic melt-off of Arctic sea ice due to climate \n     change is hitting closer to home than millions of Americans \n     might think.\n       That's because melting Arctic sea ice can trigger a domino \n     effect leading to increased odds of severe winter weather \n     outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere's middle latitudes--\n     think the ``Snowmageddon'' storm that hamstrung Washington, \n     DC, during February 2010.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That shows the original challenge to climate change \ntheory, based on the incident of Snowmageddon, was like so much that is \nsaid to challenge climate change--phony, outright wrong, a \nmisunderstanding of how it works, and misrepresenting what it shows.\n\n       Scientists have recently published an article in \n     Oceanography that demonstrates that link between climate \n     change and severe winter weather in the northern Hemisphere's \n     middle latitudes. I think that can be debunked as a phony \n     claim against the facts of climate change that are \n     surrounding us. Look around at what is happening now. We are \n     seeing extreme weather on the other side.\n\n  Last week, Eugene Robinson wrote a Washington Post column that was \nentitled ``Feeling the Heat.'' He wrote:\n\n       Still don't believe in climate change? Then you're either \n     deep in denial or delirious from the heat.\n\n  He points out that the evidence is mounting in irresistible and \nultimately irrefutable ways. To quote from his article:\n\n       The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says \n     the past winter was the fourth-warmest on record in the \n     United States. To top that, Spring--which meteorologists \n     define as the months of March, April and May--was the warmest \n     since recordkeeping began in 1895.\n\n  Again, this spring--March, April, and May--was the warmest since \nrecordkeeping began in 1895.\n  He continues:\n\n       If you don't believe me or the scientists, ask a farmer \n     whose planting seasons have gone awry.\n\n  The Bloomberg news recently wrote a story entitled ``U.S. Corn \nGrowers Farming in Hell as Midwest Heat Spreads.'' The story reported \nthat corn crops are in the worst condition since 1988 and that 53 \npercent of the Midwest is experiencing moderate to extreme drought \nconditions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the Bloomberg article I have just referenced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is not just the agricultural sector that is \ngetting clobbered by the drought and the heat. As the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Udall of New Mexico, knows all too well, and to quote \nfrom a New York Times story:\n\n       Explosive wildfires have burned across much of the west in \n     recent weeks. In southwestern New Mexico, the largest \n     wildfire in state history has burned nearly 300,000 acres.\n\n  Of course, New Mexico is the Presiding Officer's home State, but the \narticle also describes other fires on the loose in Colorado and Utah.\n\n       The High Park Fire, which has been burning for weeks near \n     Fort Collins and is one of the largest and most destructive \n     blazes in the state's history . . .\n\n  The article also mentions that Colorado had more than half a dozen \nfires burning and said conditions have not been this bad in a decade.\n  So we are seeing exactly the kind of extreme weather conditions the \nclimate scientists, whom the deniers have always mocked and made fun \nof, actually predicted. They predicted this would happen, and it is, in \nfact, happening.\n  It is clear we can't take a particular storm and say this storm, this \nfire, this drought was the product of climate change. The example \npeople use to describe what is going on is that it is akin to loading \ndice. The more someone loads the dice, the more the numbers they have \nloaded the dice to show up will show up. So we will get more weather \nevents. Even if we don't load the dice, we are sometimes going to get \ndouble sixes. We can't show every double six is because the dice were \nloaded, but when we see more and more double sixes showing up--more \nthan history would suggest or more than the odds would suggest--then \nsomething is going on. That is what we have done by loading our \natmosphere with carbon pollution. We have loaded the dice for these \nextreme weather events, and now we are reaping that bitter harvest from \nthe pollution we have thrown up there.\n  Unfortunately, the bitter harvest in this city is that we continue to \nlisten to propaganda and nonsense from the polluters designed \nspecifically to create enough doubt to prevent us from taking action \nabout something that is creating these immense consequences for \nforesters and firefighters in the West, for corn farmers in the \nMidwest, and for anybody who has to experience extraordinary weather \nevents like ``snowmageddon,'' so-called, here in Washington. These \nthings are beginning to have an effect as real life begins to model \nwhat the climate scientists predicted.\n  NOAA's Chief Jane Lubchenco spoke before an audience in Australia, \nwhich is experiencing very similar conditions, and said these extreme \nweather events are convincing many Americans that climate change is a \nreality. We are seeing that more and more.\n  Yale, George Mason University, and the Knowledge Networks did some \npolling on this subject, and 69 percent of the respondents said they \nagreed that ``global warming is affecting the weather in the United \nStates'' versus 30 percent who said they disagreed. So better than 2 to \n1 the American people are ready for us to do something about this. They \nknow there is a connection and they expect us to take responsible \naction.\n  Gallup polls are reflecting a rebound in the public's concern about \nclimate change from 51 percent in 2011 up to 55 percent in March of \nthis year. Before the recession, it was all the way up to 66 percent, \nuntil the economic issues pushed it aside.\n  The contention the polluting industries and their mouthpieces here in \nWashington make--that the jury is still out on climate change caused by \ncarbon pollution--is simply false. The jury is not still out. The \nverdict is in, the verdict is clear, and we should start doing \nsomething about it.\n  When I come to the Senate floor to give these talks, I often quote a \nletter from back in October 2009 that was signed by virtually every \nmajor scientific organization in the country--the American Chemical \nSociety, the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological \nSociety, the American Society of Agronomy, the Botanical Society of \nAmerica, the Soil Science Society of American, the American Statistical \nAssociation, and I could go on and on. The point is not to name all the \nmultiple responsible and respected scientific organizations that signed \nthe letter but to read what it was they said. If we think about it, as \nI read it, think about how cautious scientists ordinarily are in the \nlanguage they use. Here is what they said:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear--\n\n  Clear--\n\n     that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific \n     research demonstrates--\n\n  Not suggests, demonstrates--\n\n     that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are--\n\n  Not maybe, are--\n\n     the primary driver. These conclusions are based on multiple \n     independent lines of evidence, and contrary assertions are \n     inconsistent with an objective assessment of the vast body of \n     peer-reviewed science.\n\n  That is a very ``sciencey'' way of saying something that is pretty \nharsh, which is that all these contrary assertions about climate change \nsimply cannot be reconciled with an objective assessment of the facts, \nof the vast body\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\nof peer-reviewed research. If it can't be reconciled with an objective \nassessment, what kind of assessment is it getting? What it is getting, \nI submit, is a phony assessment, a political, propaganda-driven \nassessment, and an assessment with the purpose of creating enough doubt \nto slow down political action, to preserve the status quo, and to allow \npollution to continue to pour out of these smokestacks.\n  I speak very specifically about smokestacks because Rhode Island is a \ndownwind State, and so much of the coal pollution that gets piped up \ninto the atmosphere through Midwestern smoke stacks ends up landing in \nmy State. It lands in the form of ozone, in particular. There are days \nin a Rhode Island summer that look clear, look beautiful, and someone \ncan be driving by sparkling Narragansett Bay in the morning on their \nway to work when off goes the radio and the radio jock, in giving the \nnews announcements of the day, says: Today is a bad air day in Rhode \nIsland. Infants should stay indoors. The elderly should stay indoors. \nPeople with breathing difficulties should stay indoors.\n\n  This is an otherwise beautiful day. Yet children, seniors, and people \nwith breathing difficulties should stay indoors? Yes, because \ncorporations, pumping carbon pollution and other forms of pollution out \nof their Midwestern smokestacks, will not clean up their act. So they \nget to hold Rhode Islanders, on a clear summer day, captive indoors \nbecause they will not clean it up? That is wrong. It is just plain \nwrong.\n  I am going to continue to come to the floor on a regular basis to \nkeep pointing this out. For some reason, this has become the issue in \nWashington that dare not be mentioned. Enough of that. It is time we \nstarted to mention it. It is time we started to force this issue, and \nit is time we started to do something about it because any other form \nof activity faced with these facts would be wildly irresponsible.\n  Let me give the example I have used before. You are a parent. You \nhave responsibility for the welfare and well-being of your child. Your \nchild is showing symptoms. You don't know quite what is wrong, but you \ntake her to the doctor and the doctor says: Something is wrong here. \nShe needs treatment. Treatment is not going to be easy, it will not be \ncheap, but she needs it. You think: OK. That is bad news. I tell you \nwhat, I am going to be a responsible parent and I am going to go get a \nsecond opinion. So you go and get a second opinion and that doctor says \nthe exact same thing: Your daughter is sick. She needs treatment. So \nyou ask a couple more doctors who are friends. You get a third and \nfourth opinion.\n  Let's say you are the most determined parent in the world and you go \nout and you get 99 second opinions. You contact 100 doctors about your \ndaughter's condition, and 97 of them, 97 of those doctors say your \ndaughter is sick and she needs to be taken care of and she needs this \ntreatment. At that point you say: There is still doubt. There are these \nthree other doctors who aren't so sure about this, so I am not going to \ndo it. That is not something a responsible parent would do. I suspect \nin some circumstances that would be so irresponsible that it might land \nyou in the child and family services office of your local government.\n  That is exactly what we are being asked to do about climate change--\nto ignore the 97 percent of peer-reviewed climate scientists who \nunderstand this is real, this is man-made, and the consequences are \ngoing to be ferocious for us because there is a 3-percent doubt. It \ngets even worse because so many of the scientists involved in the 3 \npercent are scientists for hire who have economic ties to the polluting \nindustries. Some of them even go back to previous fights, such as those \nover whether cigarette smoking is good for you or whether lead paint is \nsafe for children. These are scientists who have made a career of \nmanufacturing doubt on behalf of the cigarette and tobacco industry, on \nbehalf of the lead paint industry, and now on behalf of the big carbon \npolluters. In a nutshell, they are phonies, and we are being asked to \nbelieve them.\n  I see the Senator from Florida is here, and I think my time at this \npoint has probably expired. I appreciate the time to come before this \nbody and share these views again. I will close by pointing out if there \nis one place we truly need to worry about climate change and about the \neffects of our carbon pollution, it is not just in our atmosphere, it \nis not just in the climate or in the weather, it is in the oceans. The \noceans are undergoing historic changes as a result of the amount of \ncarbon in our atmosphere. We are acidifying our oceans at a rate that \nis unprecedented. We are now out of a bandwidth that has lasted for \n8,000 centuries--8,000 centuries. Our entire species has developed \nwithin a safe bandwidth of atmospheric carbon and of ocean acidity that \nwe have now, for the first time, stepped out of and a long way out of. \nIf we do not take this issue on in a responsible way, we are going to \nbear an even more bitter harvest.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the ScienceDaily, June 6, 2012]\n\n          Arctic Ice Melt Is Setting Stage for Severe Winters\n\n                              (By Anne Ju)\n\n       The dramatic melt-off of Arctic sea ice due to climate \n     change is hitting closer to home than millions of Americans \n     might think.\n       That's because melting Arctic sea ice can trigger a domino \n     effect leading to increased odds of severe winter weather \n     outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere's middle latitudes--\n     think the ``Snowmageddon'' storm that hamstrung Washington, \n     D.C., during February 2010.\n       Cornell's Charles H. Greene, professor of earth and \n     atmospheric sciences, and Bruce C. Monger, senior research \n     associate in the same department, detail this phenomenon in a \n     paper published in the June issue of the journal \n     Oceanography.\n       ``Everyone thinks of Arctic climate change as this remote \n     phenomenon that has little effect on our everyday lives,'' \n     Greene said. ``But what goes on in the Arctic remotely forces \n     our weather patterns here.''\n       A warmer Earth increases the melting of sea ice during \n     summer, exposing darker ocean water to incoming sunlight. \n     This causes increased absorption of solar radiation and \n     excess summertime heating of the ocean--further accelerating \n     the ice melt. The excess heat is released to the atmosphere, \n     especially during the autumn, decreasing the temperature and \n     atmospheric pressure gradients between the Arctic and middle \n     latitudes.\n       A diminished latitudinal pressure gradient is associated \n     with a weakening of the winds associated with the polar \n     vortex and jet stream. Since the polar vortex normally \n     retains the cold Arctic air masses up above the Arctic \n     Circle, its weakening allows the cold air to invade lower \n     latitudes.\n       The recent observations present a new twist to the Arctic \n     Oscillation--a natural pattern of climate variability in the \n     Northern Hemisphere. Before humans began warming the planet, \n     the Arctic's climate system naturally oscillated between \n     conditions favorable and those unfavorable for invasions of \n     cold Arctic air.\n       ``What's happening now is that we are changing the climate \n     system, especially in the Arctic, and that's increasing the \n     odds for the negative AO conditions that favor cold air \n     invasions and severe winter weather outbreaks,'' Greene said. \n     ``It's something to think about given our recent history.''\n       This past winter, an extended cold snap descended on \n     central and Eastern Europe in mid-January, with temperatures \n     approaching minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit and snowdrifts \n     reaching rooftops. And there were the record snowstorms fresh \n     in the memories of residents from several eastern U.S. \n     cities, such as Washington, New York and Philadelphia, as \n     well as many other parts of the Eastern Seaboard during the \n     previous two years.\n       Greene and Monger did note that their paper is being \n     published just after one of the warmest winters in the \n     eastern U.S. on record.\n       ``It's a great demonstration of the complexities of our \n     climate system and how they influence our regional weather \n     patterns,'' Greene said.\n       In any particular region, many factors can have an \n     influence, including the El Nino/La Nina cycle. This winter, \n     La Nina in the Pacific shifted undulations in the jet stream \n     so that while many parts of the Northern Hemisphere were hit \n     by the severe winter weather patterns expected during a bout \n     of negative AO conditions, much of the eastern United States \n     basked in the warm tropical air that swung north with the jet \n     stream.\n       ``It turns out that while the eastern U.S. missed out on \n     the cold and snow this winter, and experienced record-\n     breaking warmth during March, many other parts of the \n     Northern Hemisphere were not so fortunate,'' Greene said.\n       Europe and Alaska experienced record-breaking winter \n     storms, and the global average temperature during March 2012 \n     was cooler than any other March since 1999.\n       ``A lot of times people say, `Wait a second, which is it \n     going to be--more snow or more warming?' Well, it depends on \n     a lot of factors, and I guess this was a really good winter \n     demonstrating that,'' Greene said. ``What we can expect, \n     however, is the Arctic wildcard stacking the deck in favor of \n     more severe winter outbreaks in the future.''\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                     [From Bloomberg, July 9, 2012]\n\n       U.S. Corn Growers Farming in Hell as Midwest Heat Spreads\n\n                            (By Jeff Wilson)\n\n       The worst U.S. drought since Ronald Reagan was president is \n     withering the world's largest corn crop, and the speed of the \n     damage may spur the government to make a record cut in its \n     July estimate for domestic inventories.\n       Tumbling yields will combine with the greatest-ever global \n     demand to leave U.S. stockpiles on Sept. 1, 2013, at 1.216 \n     billion bushels (30.89 million metric tons), according to the \n     average of 31 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That's \n     35 percent below the U.S. Department of Agriculture's June 12 \n     forecast, implying the biggest reduction since at least 1973. \n     The USDA updates its harvest and inventory estimates July 11.\n       Crops on July 1 were in the worst condition since 1988, and \n     a Midwest heat wave last week set or tied 1,067 temperature \n     records, government data show. Prices surged 37 percent in \n     three weeks, and Rabobank International said June 28 that \n     corn may rise 9.9 percent more by December to near a record \n     $8 a bushel. The gain is threatening to boost food costs the \n     United Nations says fell 15 percent from a record in February \n     2011 and feed prices for meat producers including Smithfield \n     Foods Inc. (SFD)\n       ``The drought is much worse than last year and approaching \n     the 1988 disaster,'' said John Cory, the chief executive \n     officer of Rochester, Indiana-based grain processor Prairie \n     Mills Products LLC. ``There are crops that won't make it. The \n     dairy and livestock industries are going to get hit very \n     hard. People are just beginning to realize the depth of the \n     problem.''\n\n\n                            Top Commodities\n\n       Corn rallied 18 percent in the month through July 6 on the \n     Chicago Board of Trade to $6.93, trailing only wheat among 24 \n     commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor's GSCI Spot Index, \n     which rose 2 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of \n     equities advanced 4 percent, and the dollar gained 1.3 \n     percent against a basket of six currencies in the period. \n     Treasuries returned 0.5 percent, a Bank of America Corp. \n     index shows. Corn for December delivery in Chicago extended \n     the rally today, jumping 5.3 percent to settle at $7.30.\n       About 53 percent of the Midwest, where farmers harvested 60 \n     percent of last year's U.S. crop, had moderate to extreme \n     drought conditions as of July 3, the highest since the \n     government-funded U.S. Drought Monitor in Lincoln, Nebraska, \n     began tracking the data in 2000. In the seven days ended July \n     6, temperatures in the region averaged as much as 15 degrees \n     Fahrenheit above normal. Soil moisture in Illinois, Indiana, \n     Ohio, Missouri and Kentucky is so low that it ranks in the \n     10th percentile among all other years since 1895.\n       Fields are parched just as corn plants began to pollinate, \n     a critical period for determining kernel development and \n     final yields. About 48 percent of the crop in the U.S., the \n     world's largest grower and exporter, was in good or excellent \n     condition as of July 1, the lowest for that date since 1988 \n     and down from 77 percent on May 18, government data show.\n\n\n                              Yield Losses\n\n       The USDA may cut its production forecast by 8.5 percent, \n     the biggest July reduction since a drought in 1988 led the \n     government to cut its estimate by 29 percent, a separate \n     Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts showed. Farmers probably will \n     collect 13.534 billion bushels, compared with the USDA's June \n     forecast for a record 14.79 billion, based on the average of \n     estimates in the survey.\n       Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said July 2 that yields will reach \n     153.5 bushels an acre, below the USDA estimate for an all-\n     time high of 166.\n       ``Corn yields were falling five bushels a day during the \n     past week'' in the driest parts of the Midwest, said Fred \n     Below, a plant biologist at the University of Illinois in \n     Urbana. ``You couldn't choreograph worse weather conditions \n     for pollination. It's like farming in hell.''\n\n\n                              Record Crop\n\n       Even with the drought, U.S. production in 2012 is expected \n     to rise 9.5 percent from last year to a record after farmers \n     sowed the most acres since 1937, the survey showed. Higher \n     output would help boost inventories before next year's \n     harvest, up from what analysts said will be a 16-year low on \n     Sept. 1 of 837 million bushels.\n       Futures fell 2.2 percent on July 6, the most in two weeks, \n     after the USDA reported a 90 percent drop in export sales in \n     the week ended June 28. U.S. refiners curbed output of corn-\n     based ethanol last week to the lowest since September as \n     gasoline demand weakened, government data show.\n       Corn's rally also may stall if Europe's widening debt \n     crisis and a faltering global economy erode record demand for \n     the grain. The International Monetary Fund will reduce its \n     estimate for growth this year because of weakness in \n     investment, employment and manufacturing in Europe, the U.S., \n     Brazil, India and China, Managing Director Christine Lagarde \n     said July 6.\n       ``The shrinking global economy is the elephant in the room \n     that no one wants to discuss as long as U.S. crops are under \n     siege,'' said Dale Durcholz, the senior market analyst for \n     Bloomington, Illinois-based AgriVisor LLC. ``Corn demand at \n     $5 is much more robust than when it costs $7.''\n\n\n                         Changing Expectations\n\n       Corn tumbled into a bear market in September and kept \n     dropping as farmers planted more crops. Robert Manly, the \n     chief financial officer at Smithfield Foods, the largest U.S. \n     pork producer, told analysts on a June 14 conference call \n     that hog-raising costs would ``begin to decline starting in \n     the fall.'' Corn has surged 41 percent since then, reaching a \n     nine-month high today.\n       U.S. corn production may drop to 11 billion bushels, the \n     smallest crop in seven years, because the hot, dry weather \n     killed the pollen and rains now may be too late to reverse \n     the damage, according to Cory, the Indiana mill owner and a \n     former investment banker. Prices may reach $9 before demand \n     slows, he said.\n       World corn use rose to a record every year since 1997 as \n     the expanding economy boosted incomes and the consumption of \n     meat and dairy products from animals raised on the grain. The \n     USDA projected last month a 6.4 percent increase in global \n     demand to 923.39 million tons in the year that starts Sept. \n     1, the biggest gain in six years. More U.S. output went to \n     ethanol production than livestock feed in 2011 for the first \n     time ever.\n\n\n                           Vulnerable Period\n\n       While the U.S. harvest is about two months away, the \n     drought reached plants at the most vulnerable period in their \n     growing cycle, said Nick Higgins, a London-based analyst at \n     Rabobank, predicting a 13.488 billion-bushel harvest.\n       Based on current soil moisture and June temperatures, the \n     drought is probably the worst since 1988, said Joel Widenor, \n     a vice president at the Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, \n     Maryland. The private forecaster said July 5 that corn output \n     this year will be 13.52 billion bushels, and that hot, dry \n     weather in the next two weeks may reduce yields further.\n       The drought may spark a rebound in global food prices this \n     month through October, halting a slide that sent costs in \n     June to the lowest level in 21 months, Abdolreza Abbassian, \n     an economist in Rome at the United Nations' Food & \n     Agriculture Organization, said July 5.\n\n\n                            Base Ingredient\n\n       ``Corn is key because of its widespread use as a base \n     ingredient in so many foods and for its use in feed for \n     livestock,'' said Stanley Crouch, who helps oversee $2 \n     billion of assets as chief investment officer at New York-\n     based Aegis Capital Corp. ``We are at the tipping point.''\n       In May, retail prices of boneless hams, ground beef and \n     cheese in the U.S. were close to all-time highs set earlier \n     this year, while chicken breast jumped more than 12 percent \n     during the first five months of the year, government data \n     show.\n       ``When people look at rising prices for hamburger, butter, \n     eggs and other protein sources from higher corn costs, that's \n     when more money ends up in the food basket,'' said \n     Minneapolis-based Michael Swanson, a senior agricultural \n     economist at Wells Fargo & Co., the biggest U.S. farm lender. \n     ``We were hoping for a break, and we aren't going to get \n     it.''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in postcloture time.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, when Congress began debating health care in \n2009, the goal was to lower the cost of care and give Americans the \ncare they need from a doctor they choose.\n  Americans were promised that if they liked the insurance they had and \nthe doctor they had, they would be able to keep the plan and to \ncontinue to see the doctor they liked. Americans were promised that the \nnegotiations would be transparent and televised on C-SPAN. Americans \nwere promised the bill wouldn't add a dime to the deficit, and that it \nwould lower the cost of care. Americans were promised their premiums \nwould go down by $2,500. Americans were promised this President would \nnot raise taxes on families with incomes below $250,000.\n  Instead, Congress passed a massive governmental takeover of the \nhealth care industry. In the last 2 years, we have seen that Americans \ncan't keep the insurance they had, continue to see the doctor they \nlike, and are paying more for health care now than they would have if \nthis administration had not pushed through the massive 2,700-page bill. \nThe law adds billions to the deficit. And at the end of the day, \nAmericans will find they are left holding a bag full of empty, broken \npromises.\n  Today I want to focus on the broken promises of taxes. The President \npledged not to raise taxes on individuals making less than $200,000 and \nfamilies making less than $250,000 per year.\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\nYet the new individual mandate tax--which the Supreme Court affirmed as \na tax increase--will raise $54 billion in new taxes, largely on middle-\nincome Americans between 2015 and 2022.\n  In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 77 percent of \nthose projected to pay the tax in 2016 will be those earning less than \n$120,000 per year. Americans earning less than $120,000 clearly meet \nthe President's definition as middle income.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projections confirm that at least \nthree out of every four Americans subjected to the new individual \nmandate tax will be the same middle-income taxpayers President Obama \npromised would not see their taxes raised by one dime.\n  In fact, when asked by George Stephanopoulos of ``ABC News'' in \nSeptember of 2009 if the President rejected the notion that the \nindividual mandate was a tax, the President stated, ``I absolutely \nreject that notion.'' The President wasn't equivocal and he didn't \nleave any room for interpretation.\n  So let's be clear. This President and the Democratic leaders here in \nCongress sold ObamaCare as if it did not contain significant new tax \nincreases on the middle class. Yet what they now know what they were \nselling was an incredible bait and switch. They were in fact enacting \n$54 billion in new individual mandate taxes primarily on the middle \nclass by calling it something else.\n  I would note that this tax increase is larger than the ``Buffett \nrule'' tax increase the President has spent much of the year promoting.\n  The Supreme Court ruled that the individual mandate is not \nconstitutional under either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and \nProper Clause of the Constitution. So there are only two options: \nEither the individual mandate is a tax--and it happens to be a tax that \nfalls hardest on the middle class--or it is unconstitutional.\n  It is estimated that average tax on an American subject to this new \ntax increase will be about $1,100 per year. And after paying this tax, \nthese Americans still won't have health insurance.\n  We should not forget that the national health insurance tax is not \nthe only tax increase in ObamaCare affecting individuals. Starting next \nyear, individuals will be able to save less money, taxfree, in Flexible \nSpending Accounts to pay for their own healthcare expenses. Currently, \nthere is no statutory limit on FSA contributions, though many FSAs set \ntheir own limits. Starting next year, ObamaCare will cap the amount \nAmericans can save in a Flexible Savings Account at only $2,500 per \nyear, and ObamaCare will limit tax deductions for those with the \nlargest health care needs by reducing the medical expense deduction \nfrom expenses above 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income to expenses \nabove 10 percent of adjusted gross income. So at the very time \nObamaCare is driving up health care costs, it is also making it more \ndifficult for American families to pay for their own healthcare needs.\n  These tax increases don't even take into account the new 3.8-percent \ntax increase on investment income or the almost 1-percent Medicare \nsurtax that will be imposed on higher income Americans starting in \n2013, making it more expensive for small business owners to hire new \nworkers or otherwise invest in our economy.\n  These taxes on individuals are in addition to the ObamaCare taxes on \nbusinesses, such as the new medical device tax or the tanning tax. We \nknow these taxes on businesses will ultimately be passed through to \nconsumers of health care, driving health care prices even higher.\n  In fact, of the $552 billion in new taxes included in ObamaCare, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional \nBudget Office, the Joint Economic Committee has estimated that roughly \n$250 billion is tax increases that will hit the middle class either \ndirectly or through the health care products they consume.\n  In addition to this new national health insurance tax of $1,100 a \nyear and other increases in ObamaCare, Americans will see that health \ncare costs will continue to rise.\n  Despite the President's promise that his health care plan would \nreduce insurance premiums, premiums have increased by over $2,200 since \nObama took office, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. And \naccording to the President's own Actuary at the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services in a report from this month on national health \nexpenditure projections, premiums under the new health care law will \nrise faster than if we had done nothing at all. I want to quote from \nthat report.\n\n       In 2014, growth in private health insurance premiums is \n     expected to accelerate to 7.9 percent, or 4.1 percentage \n     points higher than in the absence of health reform.\n\n  Think about what is actually being said here. The cost of health \ninsurance would have gone up a lot less per year had we done nothing \nthan what we did with this bill, which is to increase those \nexpenditures for health care by about 7.9 percent.\n  Americans are going to be stuck paying higher costs for health \ninsurance medical devices due to the tax on these sectors that this \nbill imposes.\n  Americans know firsthand that we are going to continue to struggle \nwith an economy that is not performing well. The unemployment rate \nremains above 8 percent for 41 consecutive months. On the immediate \nhorizon the American people stare down an enormous tax increase, from a \nhealth reform law they didn't want and still don't want.\n  Americans are also seeing this law has impacted our economy. \nAccording to a recent poll, 48 percent of businesses that are not \ncurrently hiring list the potential cost of health care regulations as \na reason for not seeking new employees. And according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, ObamaCare will mean 800,000 fewer jobs \nover the next decade. The last 3 years have made it very clear that \nObamaCare is making our economy worse by driving up costs and \ndiscouraging job creation.\n  Moving forward, Congress needs to start by repealing ObamaCare. We \nneed to repeal ObamaCare and enact commonsense, step-by-step reforms \nthat protect Americans' access from the care they need, from the doctor \nthey choose, at a lower cost.\n  Republicans will not repeat the Democrats' mistakes. We will not rush \nto pass a massive bill the American people don't support. We need to do \nthis the right way: No backroom deals or 2,700-page bills that no one \nhas read.\n  This President owes it to Americans to admit his broken promises, and \nto work with Republicans to put in place real health care reforms that \nwill actually help lower health insurance costs for individuals and \nfamilies and ensure that Americans can get the care they need when they \nneed it.\n  The taxes I have mentioned in the health care law are going to add up \nto a massive tax increase on average ordinary Americans. All the \nanalyses that have been done by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and the Joint Economic Committee come to \nthat very same conclusion.\n  This is a tax that is going to hit middle-class Americans, \nnotwithstanding the President's promise that he wouldn't raise taxes on \nthose making less than $200,000 a year. Seventy-five percent of that \ntax burden from that individual mandate tax--which is $54 billion--will \nhit those making less than $120,000 per year.\n  So the whole idea of promises made and promises broken I think is the \nnarrative that has attached itself to this health care reform law. I \nsubmit that the Congress and the President need to work together to \nrepeal this law and to work in a constructive way to put in place \ncommonsense, step-by-step reforms that actually will drive the cost of \nhealth care down for Americans, because that is the one thing that \nAmericans, as they look at the health care economy today, want to see. \nThey want to know their costs are going to go down rather than up, and \nthey continue to see these increases in premiums year over year and \nthat continues to affect our economy.\n  The mandates that are imposed upon employers in this health care law \nas well are going to lead to fewer jobs. That is the outcome of this \nhealth care law. It is higher costs for Americans, and it is going to \nmean fewer jobs for American workers.\n  Coupled with that, we have seen as recently as yesterday the \nPresident saying he now wants to raise taxes on those small businesses \nin our country.\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nThe tax he has proposed on those making more than $250,000 a year, \ninterestingly enough, hits 940,000 small business owners. Fifty-three \npercent of the passthrough income would face higher taxes as a result \nof the proposal he made yesterday. The people who run those businesses \nemploy 25 percent of the American workforce. So we are talking about \nhuge new burdens on our economy at a time when we absolutely cannot \nafford it: 41 consecutive months of 8-percent or higher unemployment; \n23 million Americans either unemployed or underemployed; 5.4 million \nAmericans who have been unemployed for a long period of time; and the \nweakest recovery literally since the end of World War II. Those are the \neconomic circumstances we find ourselves in today, and now we have \nproposals coming out of the White House, in addition to the burdens \nimposed by ObamaCare, that would lead to higher taxes on the very \npeople we look to to get us out of this economic circumstance, and that \nis our small businesses and entrepreneurs, all of whom are going to be \nfaced with higher taxes because of the President's proposals.\n  We can do better for the American people. We can get this economy \ngrowing again with commonsense health care reforms, commonsense tax \nreforms, regulatory reforms that lower the cost and the burden of doing \nbusiness in this country, a comprehensive energy policy that will make \nsure we are developing our own energy sources in this country, and \ngetting Federal spending under control.\n  We need a smaller Federal Government and a bigger, more robust \nprivate economy. You cannot do that by continually piling more taxes \nand more regulations and more mandates and more requirements on the \nvery people who create jobs. The American people deserve better and we \ncan do better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as a courtesy to Senator \nInhofe, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Inhofe be recognized after \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks by the Senator from Florida the Senator from \nWyoming be recognized, and then I be recognized after the Senator from \nWyoming for up to 35 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Veterans Unemployment\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, on the battlefield there is a \ncode among the military that you don't leave anybody behind. That \nprinciple ought to apply to our returning veterans as well. It is \nessential for us to care for our veterans when they get home and show \nthem the same respect and loyalty they showed us during their service.\n  This economic downturn has been especially tough for many of our \nveterans as they come back from Iraq and Afghanistan. The unemployment \nrate among veterans returning from those two countries was 9.5 percent \nin June. While this is clearly an improvement from last year, and an \nimprovement in the entire economy over the last couple of years, it is \nstill more than a point higher than the national average. For our \nyoungest veterans, it is even worse--29 percent in 2011.\n  Our servicemembers have already done the toughest jobs out there. \nThey are highly trained and extremely skilled. We ought to give them as \nmany opportunities as possible to succeed when they get home. That \nmeans when veterans come back from war, they shouldn't have to do \nbattle with bureaucrats.\n  I wanted to make a commonsense suggestion, so I filed a bill--which \nrecently passed both the House and the Senate--to remove some of those \nbureaucratic obstacles in our veterans' way and to make it easier for \nthem to get occupational and professional licenses when they get \nhome. The Veteran Skills to Jobs Act is a bipartisan bill cosponsored \nby 17 Senators and supported by veterans organizations such as the \nAmerican Legion. I ask unanimous consent that the American Legion's \ncommentary on this legislation be printed in the Record.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The bill directs Federal agencies to recognize \nrelevant military training when certifying veterans for Federal \noccupational licenses. It is common sense. If veterans have skills \nlearned in the military, they ought to be able to utilize those skills, \nthat training, without having to go through duplicate training when \nthey get into a specialized civilian job. If the military training is \nfound to be comparable to the civilian requirements, the veteran would \nbe deemed qualified for that occupation.\n  These are the licenses people need in order to get jobs in the \ncivilian sector.\n  I want to give an example. Let's say an Air Force or Navy aircraft \nmechanic gets out of the service. That veteran may want to use those \nskills learned in the military to work in the commercial airline \nbusiness. To do so, that veteran must be certified as an aircraft \nmechanic technician, certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. \nThis requires an airframes and powerplant license from the FAA.\n  Although the veteran has trained to do this, this highly skilled \noccupation for our military, what we are seeing all too often is common \nsense goes out the window, and that veteran may have to go through \nredundant and expensive training to get that airframes and powerplant \nlicense. Of course, that does not make sense.\n  This is not just a Federal issue. Many States are starting to \nrecognize military training when certifying veterans for State \nlicenses, such as nurses and truckdrivers. I am pleased that the \nFederal Government will now move in this direction as well. We have \nalready passed it unanimously in the Senate; likewise, they have passed \nit in the House. Both bills are down in the other's respective \nChambers. We need to go ahead and pass this legislation. Today I will \nmove for final passage of the bill, and I know of no objection since we \ngot it out of the Senate unanimously.\n  One of the greatest honors I have in my job is getting to meet and \nthank our veterans and current members of our military and all of our \nnational security apparatus. It is up to us to stand by these folks. \nPassing legislation to help employ veterans, such as the Veteran Skills \nto Jobs Act, is one way we can thank them.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                             Office of the National Commander,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 2012.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: On behalf of the 2.4 million members \n     of The American Legion, I would like to express support for \n     S. 2239, the Veteran Skills to Jobs Act of 2012, which \n     provides for Federal certification of veterans who have been \n     qualified for licensure through relevant military training.\n       With an anemic economy and a downsizing military, it is \n     essential veterans be given the ability to quickly find \n     civilian employment upon separation from the military. \n     Without these types of opportunities, separating military \n     personnel could add to the unemployment problem currently \n     faced by millions of Americans. Federal certification and \n     licensure of veterans who have received relevant training \n     will assist in this process of ensuring that veterans are \n     able to smoothly and quickly transition between military and \n     civilian employment. Matching qualified veterans with Federal \n     licenses which require their expertise is good for veterans, \n     good for the economy and good for the country.\n       Again, The American Legion fully supports enacting S. 2239 \n     and applauds your leadership in addressing this critical \n     issue facing our nation's veterans and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Fang A. Wong,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I do week \nafter week, ever since the President's health care law has been passed, \nto offer a doctor's second opinion about this health care law, which I \nbelieve is bad for patients, bad for providers--the nurses and doctors \nwho take care of those patients--and terrible for taxpayers.\n  We saw the Supreme Court issue its historic decision on the \nPresident's health care law. The Court confirmed that the individual \nmandate in the President's health care law is a tax. The President said \nit was not a tax. I\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nwill just say the Supreme Court confirmed that it is in fact a tax. The \ndecision makes it clear that the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, \nwill now play an unprecedented role in America's health care system.\n  That is not something American citizens have asked for or want, but \nit is something many American citizens fear. Recently, the Associated \nPress highlighted this concern in an article titled, ``Tax Man Cometh \nto Police You on Health Care.''\n  ``Tax Man Cometh to Police You on Health Care.''\n  The article points out that the health care law contains the largest \nset of tax changes in more than 20 years. To be specific, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, there are at least 18 separate taxes \ncontained in the health care law. These taxes are expected to cost \ntaxpayers more than $500 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The Associated Press points out that the IRS is expected to spend \nover $880 million just to implement the law from 2010 to 2013, and to \ndo this they are going to hire more than 2,700 new government workers. \nThis could be just the tip of the iceberg. According to a report issued \nby the House Ways and Means Committee, the Internal Revenue Service may \nneed as many as 16,500 additional bureaucrats to enforce the \nPresident's health care law--now the President's health care tax.\n  One of these taxes the agents are going to be enforcing is something \ncalled the individual mandate. This is the part of the law that forces \nevery American to have health insurance. If they do not have it, the \nlaw forces them to purchase health insurance--and not just any health \ninsurance. No, no, not at all. They need to purchase government-\napproved health insurance. This is not necessarily something this \nfamily thinks is right for them and their needs and their insurance and \ntheir family. No, that is not good enough. They have to purchase \ngovernment-approved insurance, and the IRS is going to check on them to \nmake sure they do.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 77 percent of those \nforced to pay the tax will be people making less than $120,000 a year. \nPresident Obama repeatedly promised he would not raise taxes on the \nmiddle class. Specifically, he promised that no family making less than \n$250,000 a year would see any form of tax increase.\n  Let me just quote. The President of the United States said:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making \n     less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase . \n     . .\n\n  The President went on to say ``not your income tax.'' He said ``not \nyour payroll tax.'' He said ``not your capital gains tax.'' He finished \nit by saying ``not any of your taxes.''\n  But when the President's lawyers went before the Supreme Court, they \ndid just the opposite. They argued that this mandate was indeed a tax. \nThe Solicitor General even stated that the Court had an obligation to \nconstrue the mandate as a tax. He said it could be upheld on that \nbasis.\n  As it turns out, a majority of the Supreme Court agreed that the \nmandate was constitutional, but only because it is a tax. In short, the \nSupreme Court confirmed that the President has broken his promise to \nmiddle-class families; and it is the promise that he made to not raise \ntaxes. In fact, the President's individual mandate tax will produce \nmore tax revenue for the government than the so-called Buffett rule \nthat this administration has been supporting.\n  While supporters of the health care law may support using the IRS to \nscare people into getting health insurance, most Americans do not think \nthis is the right policy for our country. Back when Congress was \ndebating this health care law, the American people were looking for \nreform, health care reform that would actually lower the cost of care, \nnot raise their taxes. They wanted a law that helped train more doctors \nand more nurses to take care of them, not more tax collectors to look \ninto their life and their records. The last thing they want is the IRS \nbreathing down their necks and banging down their doors. But that is \nwhat the American people have gotten through the President's health \ncare law, and that is what they are stuck with unless Congress and the \nWhite House repeal and replace this flawed and failed law.\n  As a physician with 25 years of experience taking care of families \nall around Wyoming, I believe there is a better way. We can implement \ncommonsense reforms in a step-by-step way that allows people to \npurchase insurance across State lines, reform medical liability laws, \nand strengthen State high-risk pools. These simple changes will help \nlower the cost of care without forcing millions of Americans to live in \nthe fear of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  That is why I am going to continue to come to the Senate floor and \ncall on Congress to repeal the President's health care law. It is time \nfor Americans to get what they were looking for in the beginning but do \nnot get as a result of the President's health care law. What they are \nlooking for is the care they need from the doctor that they choose at a \nlower cost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                        Global Warming Hysteria\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have to say that I enjoy these second \nopinions when they come from such a well-known doctor who knows what he \nis talking about. Quite often we in this body are forced to kind of \nassume we are experts in every area. It is nice to have a few who \nreally are. I think I don't say it very often, but I actually learn \nsomething when I hear him talk.\n  Anyway, that is not why I am here today. I hope to help provide some \nsense and balance and accuracy which is clearly lacking in the \nmainstream media trying to drum up support for the global warming \nhysteria again.\n  I have to say it is like we are back to the good-old days. We talked \nabout this for 10 years. There are different people coming up with \nlegislation, the cap-and-trade legislation. They found out, of course, \nthat the American people realized it was a gigantic tax and there were \nno benefits, so it kind of went by the wayside. But there is a new \nthing happening, and it was interesting because just last Friday one of \nthe Obama appointees to the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Association \nsaid to the Associated Press:\n\n       The wildfires and hot temperatures over the past few weeks \n     will likely convince Americans that global warming is real.\n\n  In other words, they are now trying to tie them together. They have \nnever tried to do this before because that is one of the few things \nthat all experts agree on: that one isolated case doesn't make a case \nfor major changes in the weather. This is kind of a dangerous game to \nplay because what are they going to say when winter comes and it is \ngoing to get cold? As soon as it gets cold I can tell you what they are \ngoing to say. They are not going to use global warming; they are going \nto use climate change.\n\n  As the season changes, the terminology changes, and they will start \nsaying just because the temperatures are freezing doesn't mean the \nplanet is not overheating--if you follow through the double negatives.\n  My good friend from Rhode Island commented on the famous igloo. This \nwas pretty prominent two summers ago. Let me tell you the story of \nwhere we got to the igloo. As most people know, because I brag about it \nall the time, I have 20 kids and grandkids.\n  This happens to be one family. You cannot see them as well. It is six \nof the most beautiful people we have ever seen. It happens to be my \ndaughter and her husband and their family of four kids.\n  Anyway this would have been in February 2010. Some of us remember how \ncold it was during that time. It happens that one of my kids--the only \none who is adopted is a little girl, an orphan from Ethiopia, whom we \nfound and nursed back to health. My daughter Molly, who had nothing but \nboys, adopted this little girl.\n  Put her picture up there. She is a pretty little girl. She has become \nkind of a hero.\n  Every February I sponsor something called the African dinner where \nabout 400 of our friends from Africa come over, and we are establishing \nclose, intimate relations with them. It happens that 12 years ago, we \nfound the little girl who is pictured on the poster. She is now a 12-\nyear-old little girl. She reads at college level. She is smart and she \nis the main speaker every time we have this dinner.\n  In February 2010, little Zegita Marie was up here and she brought her \nwhole\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\nfamily and made her speech. It was a beautiful thing. Afterwards, as \nthey were getting ready to take the plane back home, the blizzards \ncame, and all of the airports in the area shut down. There was no way \nthey could get back. So what do you do with a family of six when you \nare snowbound and there is nothing but snow and ice on the ground? You \nmake an igloo. So they did.\n  That is a real igloo. It sleeps four people. I know that; I was in \nit. It was right by the Library of Congress. The sign on the top said: \nAl Gore's new home. Actually, I think it may have said: Honk if you \nwant global warming--or something like that. Anyway, everyone was \nhaving a good time.\n  Some of my liberal friends were so upset. One of them was Keith \nOlbermann. Keith Olbermann, who was with MSNBC, designated my daughter \nMolly's family of six as the worst family in America. Now, there is her \nhusband who is very prominent in Fayetteville, AR. My daughter Molly is \na professor at the university. She was designated as Outstanding \nProfessor of the Year this year. She will be marching out during the \nhomecoming on November 3 to accept that award. It is quite an \noutstanding family, and the kids are all straight-A students and all of \nthat wonderful stuff.\n  So that is the famous igloo. It has been a long time since we had a \nchance to talk about it. There we have Molly, James, Jase, Luke, Jonah, \nand Marie enjoying that. Believe it or not, that is the worst family in \nAmerica.\n  Well, just after the igloo story broke, a reporter by the name of \nDana Milbank warned the alarmists. Keep in mind the terminology we use. \nThose people who think the world is coming to an end because \ncatastrophic global warming is coming is all due to manmade gases, so \nwe need to shut down America. Those are the alarmists.\n  The skeptics are people like me, those who look at it and say science \nhas been stripped out by the United Nations for an ulterior motive. \nDana Milbank has been very much on the other side of the issue and \nwarned the alarmists to stop using weather to justify global warming \nbecause then what do they do when the weather doesn't cooperate with \ntheir predictions of the melting planet.\n  He wrote:\n\n       In Washington's blizzards, the greens were hoist by their \n     own petard.\n\n  He said:\n\n       If the Washington snows persuade the greens to put away the \n     slides of polar bears and pine beetles and to keep the focus \n     on national security and jobs, it will have been worth the \n     shoveling.\n\n  But not everyone got that memo. In July 2010, the hot summer that \nfollowed the intense blizzards when my family put up the igloo, Jon \nKarl of ABC News asked me to do an interview outside in the heat. It \nwas obviously an ambush. People who know me well know I enjoy ambushes, \nso I went out there in the heat. They got ready with the cameras \nrolling, and they had a pan with an egg on it. They were going to fry \nit, but it didn't fry. Nice try, but it didn't work.\n  I am sure some here may have noticed that somebody else tried this \nlast weekend. Last weekend I happened to be in the Farnborough Airshow, \nwhich I go to every year. While I was at the airshow, I got a call from \nhome telling me that they have kind of resurrected the igloo, and they \nwere talking about that. They were planning a great big event on The \nMall, and in the event they were going to take the thing, called \n``Hoax''--let me go back to 2003.\n  In 2003 when I realized and I started hearing from a lot of the real \nscientists that it was a hoax, I made the comment that the notion of \ncatastrophic global warming is due to manmade anthropogenic \nCO2 and manmade gases. It is the greatest hoax ever \nperpetrated on the American people. So that is where ``Hoax'' came \nfrom.\n  So they had a great big thing made of ice. Apparently, it was the \nsize of a car. It said ``Hoax'' with a question mark. They were going \nto put it out there and it was going to melt and they were going to \nmake a big issue out of it.\n  The problem is nobody showed. So what did they do? They felt they \ncouldn't do this if there were no cameras, so they called it off. They \nused the excuse that there had been a storm, and they thought this \nmight be offensive to people who lost electricity in the storm. Anyway, \nthat thing went under too.\n  So in addition to the recent activity from my alarmist friends, the \nhot weather has also brought some of my favorite global warming \nreporters out of hiding, and they have been all too eager to link \ntoday's weather events to manmade greenhouse gases. Of course, many of \nthe most outspoken global warming alarmists and scientists have been \nhappy to play along. The important point is that no one, not even the \nmost committed alarmist, can claim that any percentage of the warm \nweather is due to manmade greenhouse gases. I will go into more detail \nin just a minute.\n  This is an inconvenient truth that global warming reporters have kept \nout of their headlines, and in some cases their stories as well.\n  Seth Borenstein of the Associated Press is a good guy. He is on the \nother side of this issue, but he is one of these guys I still like. He \nis one of the most prominent global warming reporters. He came out last \nweek with another scary headline proclaiming: ``This US summer is what \nglobal warming looks like.''\n  Some quotes and stories appeared in Reuters, The Hill, and Politico. \nYesterday morning Time magazine ran a piece by Bryan Walsh with the \nheadline, ``Now Do You Believe in Global Warming?'' I was happy to see \nthat Mr. Walsh began his article in Time magazine with a picture of my \nfamily in their igloo. He concluded his piece with:\n\n       We're living in an igloo in the summertime, and the ice \n     melting all around us.\n\n  It is kind of interesting that they try to talk about global warming, \nbut all of a sudden they changed it to cooling.\n  This was in the New York Times. They said:\n\n       This summer has been conspicuously different in New York \n     City, not one 99-degree day in Central Park. Not a single day \n     that the temperature even approached 90. For just the second \n     time in 140 years of record keeping, the temperatures failed \n     to reach 90 in either June or July.\n       The daily average last month was at or below normal every \n     day but two. The temperature broke 80 on 16 days in New York.\n\n  So it goes on to say that the problem they are having is it is \nunusually cool. But that didn't inure to the benefit of the alarmists, \nso that wasn't used.\n  So it is time to take a trip down Memory Lane. Don't forget that Time \nis the same publication that told us in 1974 that we should be very \nconcerned about the coming ice age.\n  There it is. Every magazine had it. Newsweek had the same thing. All \nthe other magazines said another ice age is coming, and we are all \ngoing to die.\n  Since there is time to do this, I will mention one thing which is not \nin my notes. Think about how many times this has happened. Let's look \nat the last 100 years. We will start with 1895. From 1895 to 1925, we \nwent through a 30-year period that was a cooling period. Everyone back \nthen was saying another ice age is coming, and we are all going to die.\n  From 1925 to 1945, for that 20-year period, we went through a warming \nperiod. That is when they coined the phrase ``global warming.'' That \nwas way back in the 1930s. From 1945 to 1975 we went into a cooling \nperiod. Again, we talked about how an ice age is coming. After that, we \nwent into a warming period that went up to the turn of the century. Now \nit is actually going down into a cooling period again, but that was \nactually a chart.\n  I guess what I am saying is every 20 or 30 years, we go through this. \nWe go through the same hysteria, and everyone goes crazy and says the \nworld is coming to an end. The interesting thing about this is that the \ntime in world history when we had the greatest surge of CO2 \nwas right after World War II. That was in 1945, and that precipitated \nnot a warming period with all of that CO2, but a cooling \nperiod that endured for 30 years. Those were the headlines in the \npaper.\n  Now 30 years later, during the height of the global warming movement, \nthey changed their tune. The image that is sealed in everyone's mind is \nthe Time magazine cover, which we have: ``Be Worried, Be Very \nWorried.'' There is the last polar bear standing on the last cube of \nice. Everything is melting, and we are all going to die. Again, that is \nTime magazine.\n  If I were on the board of directors of Time magazine, I would \nprobably do\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nthe same thing. It is a competitive business, and they have to sell \nmagazines. The truth is when we ask the alarmists directly, they will \nspecifically link the recent weather events to human activity. How do \nwe know this? We recently came across a reported conference held by a \ngroup called Climate Communication. This is a very liberal group. As \ntheir Web site confirmed, this call was held to spoonfeed talking \npoints to reporters on how to link the heat over the past few weeks to \nmanmade global warming.\n  To his credit, AP reporter Seth Borenstein asked the most important \nquestion of the call. He asked: What percentage of the recent warm \nweather can be attributed to manmade gases? I want to be completely \naccurate, so I would like to quote in full Borenstein's question as \nwell as the answers he got from Dr. Michael Oppenheimer and Dr. Steven \nRunning, two of the foremost global warming alarmist scientists. This \nis what Seth Borenstein said:\n\n       Let me try to put you more on the spot, Mike and Steve: I \n     know there's attribution--you haven't done attribution \n     studies, but if you ballparked it right now and had to put a \n     percentage number on this, on the percent that the heat wave, \n     the percentage of blame you can put on anthropogenic climate \n     change, on this current heat wave, and on the fires, what \n     percentage would the two of you use?\n\n  Dr. Oppenheimer, who is a scientist, said:\n\n       Come on, I'm not going to answer that. Yes, I will answer \n     it, and my answer is: I won't do it. You know, we have to do \n     things carefully, because if you don't, we are going to end \n     up with bogus information out there. People will start \n     disbelieving because you'll be more wrong, more often. This \n     is not the kind of thing I want to do off the top of my head. \n     Nor do I think it can be done, you know, convincingly without \n     really taking--doing careful analysis, so I'll pass on this \n     one and see if Steve has a different view.\n\n  Well, Dr. Steve Running said:\n\n       Well, I already got way too hypothetical on my last answer. \n     Yeah, it's . . . probably really dangerous for us to just lob \n     out a number.\n\n  Well, this goes on and on and on. I have all of this down. It is \nactually all in the record at this point, so it is redundant. He keeps \ntrying to get them to say there is a percentage of chance that this \nwarm weather is due to global warming.\n  Now, we have to stop for a minute because we have seen that Seth \nBorenstein was asking the inconvenient question. One of the moderators \ntried to step in and tell the AP reporter that his question was a bad \none.\n  Let me quote that one again, Susan Hossel, moderator for the event, \nsaid:\n\n       Seth, most of the scientists I talk to say it is a \n     contributing factor and that's what we can say and that it's \n     really not even really a well-posed question to ask for a \n     percentage, because it just--what you're asking really is for \n     a model to determine the chances of this happening without \n     climate change or with climate change and models are not very \n     good.\n\n  So we see how he responded. He said:\n\n       I understand, I've been covering this for 20 years, I \n     understand. I don't need a lecture, thank you very much. What \n     I'm asking for is--\n\n  And he went on. Obviously, he was never able to get it.\n  Here is the irony: Their Web site specifically explains that the \npurpose of the call is to give reporters a link relating hot weather to \nhuman-caused global warming.\n  It states:\n\n       Climate Communication hosted a press conference featuring \n     experts discussing the connections between extreme heat and \n     climate change.\n\n  But when pressed, they couldn't make the link. Again, Borenstein \nasked a great question, a question that badly needed to be asked. \nUnfortunately, none of the information appeared in his article for the \nAP. Without that link, Borenstein was forced to make his article about \nwhat global warming could look like in the future. But in doing so, he \nleft out any mention of uncertainty expressed by the scientist.\n  Borenstein quoted Chris Field, a leading author of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That is the United Nations \nthat started this whole thing, and they are the ones who were stacking \nthe scientists. He is one of the individuals. According to Field, this \nreport warns of ``unprecedented extreme weather events'' due to global \nwarming. But, as usual, Borenstein failed to mention that even the \nIPCC, which normally heightens the fear factor as much as possible, \nadmitted in that same March report that there is significant \nuncertainty regarding linking extreme weather events to human causes.\n\n  Also missing from the article was the mention of Borenstein's \ninterview from climatologist Judith Curry of the Georgia Institute of \nTechnology. Fortunately, she was good enough to post her answers on her \nblog since he didn't use it. Curry explained:\n\n       We saw these kinds of heat waves in the 1930's, and those \n     were definitely not caused by greenhouse gases. Weather \n     variability changes on multidecadal time scales, associated \n     with large ocean oscillations. I don't think that what we are \n     seeing this summer is outside the range of natural \n     variability for the past century. In terms of heat waves, \n     particularly in cities, urbanization can also contribute to \n     the warming.\n\n  There was another interesting part of the conference call that I \nthink is worth mentioning. When ABC News reporter Bill Blakemore asked \nabout the effect of La Nina and El Nino on today's hot weather, Dr. \nOppenheimer was again uncomfortable about this question and said it was \n``off message.'' Yet NOAA--that is, the N-O-A-A--came out yesterday \nwith a different opinion. Andrew Revkin of the New York Times explained \non his blog:\n\n       In a briefing and several postings today, the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reviewed the most \n     notable climate and weather events of 2011. Many of these \n     events--from an extreme East African drought to Australian \n     deluges--were significantly driven by a ``double-dip La \n     Nina'' cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean, agency \n     scientists said.\n\n  In other words, it is La Nina and El Nino that made the difference.\n  In yesterday's Tulsa World, there was an opinion piece that directly \naddressed this El Nino and La Nina debate and how it affects Oklahoma \nspecifically; that is, my State of Oklahoma. The editorial mentions an \ninterview in April of 2008 with Tulsa National Weather Service \nmeteorologist Nicole McGavock regarding Oklahoma's record rainfall that \nmonth. McGavock said:\n\n       Don't go blaming global warming, but rather blame El Nino's \n     counterpart, La Nina. La Nina happens when the weather is \n     cooler near the equator along the Pacific Ocean.\n\n  It has nothing to do with global warming.\n  That same opinion piece mentioned another article published in \nDecember of 2011 which was about Oklahoma's drought-filled summer of \n2011. In it, associate State climatologist Gary McManus said:\n\n       Did this hot summer happen due to global warming? [No.] I \n     think when we study this summer, we will find that we would \n     have had the warmest summer regardless of global warming.\n\n  With all this in mind, it is no wonder that when Time magazine asks \nthe question, ``Now do you believe in global warming?'' the answer is \nresounding: The American people are no longer buying it. As the \nWashington Post recently reported, global warming is no longer an issue \nof concern for Americans, and one of the reasons is that the public \ndoesn't trust those who try to use hot weather as proof of global \nwarming. The public has clearly grown weary of the alarmists' fear \ncampaigns. After all, they have been going on for 12 years.\n  Just how bad have things gotten for the global warming movement? \nWell, one indication is that no one is even talking about global \nwarming except for myself and Representative Markey over in the House. \nAs a Politico article said yesterday, Representative Markey accused \nRepublicans of being silent on the threat of global warming and called \nfor Republicans to hold hearings.\n  While Representative Markey is quick to accuse Republicans of \nsilence, he says nothing about the silence we are hearing from the \nDemocrats here in the Senate. We haven't heard anybody. I haven't heard \nthe term ``global warming'' coming from any Senator. When was the last \ntime anyone heard President Obama or the Democrats mention global \nwarming? In fact, their campaign has failed so miserably that President \nObama, running for reelection, is pretending to support oil and gas to \ngain votes.\n  The irony is that the President, who came into office promising to \nslow the rise of the oceans and all that, has presided over the \ncomplete collapse of the global warming movement. Since\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\nPresident Obama took office nearly 4 years ago, not one global warming \ncap-and-trade bill has been debated on the Senate floor. In fact, if \nanything, they are regressing in support for their pet issue. Last year \n64 Senators went on record as wanting to rein in the Obama EPA's global \nwarming regulations.\n  We have said several times that there have been numerous bills \nintroduced ever since the Kyoto Treaty was never submitted for \nratification. That was back in the early 1990s. Ever since that time, \nthere have been numerous bills that would be cap-and-trade bills and \nthey have gone down. Each time, they go down by a greater percentage \nthan the one before did. In fact, if anything, they are regressing in \ntheir support.\n  So the far-left environmental community has clearly been instructed \nto keep quiet, although sometimes they can't help themselves and they \nget into trouble, like 350.org that I referred to. They are no doubt \nassured that if President Obama is reelected, he will do everything he \ncan to achieve his global warming agenda through regulations because \nthe American people have rejected legislation. That is what has \nhappened. Actually, the cost of it, which is not controversial--it is \nbecause people recognize and nobody has actually refuted the fact that \nif it were to pass either by legislation or by regulation, it would \ncost the American people between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. \nSo people now realize that and know we can't afford to do something \nthat really is not going to accomplish anything.\n  Anyway, the Obama administration is already doing--we have identified \nright now some $68 billion that he has, through regulations, been able \nto have on all of his climate agenda. So it has already been very \nexpensive. Nobody is really aware of it, but nonetheless that is what \nis happening. He just doesn't want the American people to know it. How \ncan he convince them that so much economic pain is necessary now that \nthe global warming movement has completely lost its trust in the \npublic? That would stop some of the usual suspects from continuing to \ntry to drum up global warming hysteria, but we wouldn't count on Al \nGore coming out of hiding to help or President Obama saying anything to \nback him up--at least not now, before the election.\n\n  Just the other day, George Mason University, I believe it was, did a \npolling of all of the 480 TV meteorologists. Only 19 percent of them \nsaid we are having global warming due to manmade gases. Now, that is a \nmajor change from before. So the trendline is going back the other way. \nThe polling has definitely gone the other way.\n  Back to last weekend's failed effort to blame hot weather on global \nwarming, I would like to mention three things on which scientists \nagree.\n  First of all, we can't blame global warming on one event. Let me \nshare with my colleagues what Roger Pelke, professor of environmental \nstudies at the University of Colorado, said:\n\n       Over the long term, there is no evidence that disasters are \n     getting worse because of climate change.\n\n  Judith Curry, whom I already mentioned, is a well-established \nscientist. She said:\n\n       I have been completely unconvinced by any of the arguments \n     . . . that attributes a single extreme weather event, a \n     cluster of extreme weather events, or statistics of extreme \n     weather events to anthropogenic forcing.\n\n  Myles Allen, the head of the Climate Dynamics Group at the University \nof Oxford's Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics Department, \nsaid:\n\n       When Al Gore said . . . that scientists now have clear \n     proof that climate change is directly responsible for the \n     extreme and devastating floods, storms, and droughts . . . my \n     heart sank.\n\n  I was on ``The Rachel Maddow Show.'' She doesn't have Republicans on \nvery often. She is one of my favorite liberals, and I enjoy being on. I \nfound out then that Bill Nye, her science guy, actually is one--one of \nthe things he states is, don't fall into the trap of trying to say that \nbecause somebody is at some place that is very, very hot, that somehow \nthat supports global warming. In fact, Dana Milbank, a Washington Post \ncolumnist who is a major Maddow contributor, said:\n\n       When climate activists make the dubious claim, as a \n     Canadian environmental group did, that global warming is to \n     blame for the lack of snow at the Winter Olympics in \n     Vancouver, then they invite similarly specious conclusions \n     about Washington's snow . . . Argument-by-anecdote isn't \n     working.\n\n  That was Dana Milbank, who is really on the other side of this issue.\n  So I mentioned that there are three things. One is a fact that is \nincontrovertible, that people agree on, which is that one or two events \naren't going to reflect climate change or global warming.\n  The second thing is the cost. Years ago when the Kyoto Treaty was up, \nI wasn't sure which way to go. I assumed the scientists were all \ntogether on this, only to find out they weren't.\n  One thing we did find out when we got a report from several \nuniversities, including MIT, was that the cost of this, if we were to \npass any of the bills, would have been between $300 billion and $400 \nbillion a year. What I always do when I hear about billions and \ntrillions of dollars is I try to, if I can, find out how that affects \nmy family and the State of Oklahoma.\n  Back when we had the largest tax increase in 1993 called the Clinton-\nGore tax increase, they increased marginal rates, the death tax, \ncapital gains tax and all of that, and it was at that time the largest \ntax increase in three decades. We were all pretty outraged about it. \nYet that was a $32 billion tax increase. Here we are talking about a \n$300 billion to $400 billion tax increase.\n  The last thing I would say is that if we have a tax increase like \nthis, what do we get for it?\n  I sometimes appreciate--in fact, I always appreciate the \nAdministrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson. She is an appointee of \nPresident Obama. I asked her this question on live TV in one of our \ncommittee hearings: If you guys are going to do this by regulation or \nif you are going to have cap and trade and punish the American people \nwith all of the cost of this and everything else, if they are \nsuccessful, if that happened, would this reduce the CO2 \nworldwide? Her answer: No, it wouldn't. Because this isn't where the \nproblem is. The problem is in China and Mexico and India. One could \ncarry that argument on out further and conclude that if we have that \nkind of a regulation in this country and drive our manufacturing base \noverseas, they would go to places such as China and India where there \nare no emissions restrictions, so it would have the effect of actually \nincreased CO2.\n  Anyway, I appreciate very much Time magazine coming out and bringing \nup the igloo again. It is a thing of beauty, and it is very meaningful \nto me, and I think it told a story that a lot of people needed to hear, \nand they have heard it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition. I come to \nthe floor to briefly talk about the Supreme Court decision on health \ncare.\n  I was in Colorado last week. We had a wonderful time traveling across \nthe Western Slope of our State. We spent time in Gunnison County and \nother places. We fished in Hartselle. One thing people were not talking \nabout there was the Supreme Court decision on health care. What they \nwere talking about was how we get our economy moving again; how we \nrecouple our economic growth in this country to job growth and wage \ngrowth again; how we create a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to \nreducing our deficit and our debt; how we educate our kids for the 21st \ncentury; how we build this economy to make sure we leave our kids with \nsomething better than what we found. In short, they were talking about \nexactly what people inside the beltway are not talking about.\n  Today the House of Representatives--I don't know whether voting has \nstarted yet--in the wake of the Supreme Court decision, is voting to \nrepeal the health care reform bill for the 31st time. They have been \nsuccessful 30 times. They have voted to repeal the bill 30 times, but \nthey feel the need now to do it a 31st time.\n  I saw on the TV in my office today the Twitter traffic that was \nrolling at the bottom of the screen. One person after another announced \nthat they were voting to repeal the health care bill for the 31st time.\n  I thought about a Facebook post I saw last week from somebody I know \nin Denver named Mary Seawall. She is on the school board there, but she \nis not a politician. This is what she wrote\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\nthe day after the Supreme Court reached its decision on health care:\n\n       Yesterday's Supreme Court decision upholding the Affordable \n     Care Act came on a hard day for our family. Yesterday \n     afternoon, we learned that our 6-year-old Annie has type 1 \n     diabetes. She and I sat in a doctor's office crying through \n     her first finger prick, her first insulin shot. Our life is \n     now different.\n       She will have this disease for her entire life or until \n     there is a cure. A few years ago, our entire family might \n     have lost our insurance. She now has a preexisting condition \n     that likely would have made her uninsurable as an adult.\n\n  Mary wrote:\n\n       What I am saying is not political; it's a mother's sigh of \n     relief.\n\n  ``A mother's sigh of relief.''\n\n       When I heard the Supreme Court ruling, I was waiting for \n     the call--\n\n  ``I was waiting for the call''--\n\n     to tell me why my baby looked too thin, why she had to take \n     breaks walking up a flight of stairs, why she had started \n     wetting her bed. The ruling means she lives in a country that \n     won't leave her behind.\n       We are very lucky that we caught this early before she lost \n     consciousness or went into a coma, something that would have \n     likely happened in the next few days.\n       I know our luck came from health insurance that allowed her \n     worried parents to take her to the doctor because we had a \n     ``bad feeling.'' Many families, even insured ones, can't do \n     what we did. I was raised on the idea of ``better to be safe \n     than sorry.'' Our health care system has been ``better sorry \n     than safe'' for too long.\n\n  Mary goes on to say that this Supreme Court decision ``couldn't have \ncome at a better time, our family's worst day.''\n  I hope the folks who are twittering about their repeal for the 31st \ntime of this bill rather than working to try to improve it, rather than \nworking to try to fix it, incapable of actually telling us what they \nwould replace this with, would take a moment to read what a mother in \nDenver posted on Facebook last week.\n  I do not think this health care bill was perfect, and I said that \nfrom the day we passed it. There are issues around cost, in particular, \nthat I continue to be very concerned with because despite the rhetoric \naround this place, the reality is that we cannot solve our deficit and \ndebt problem without dealing with a restructuring of how we deliver \nhealth care in the United States. Maybe the bill is not perfect, and \nmaybe there are suggestions that could be made to improve it. I have my \nown. I tried, when we passed the bill, to put a fail-safe in place that \nwould actually hold this Congress to the numbers that it said it would \nsave, the dollars that we said we would save, and that if we did not, \nwe had to figure out how to cut or make other changes to get there. So \nthere is more work to be done. But the thing I find amazing--and this \nis why I wanted to come to the floor--is how far away this conversation \nis from the people I represent and what a masquerade so much of this \nconversation is.\n  I know there were a lot of people who were disappointed that the \nhealth care bill was declared constitutional by the Supreme Court, and \nthere were people who said they were going to declare it \nunconstitutional, and they did not.\n  So the next day--and really for the next week--what we heard was, \nwell, the bill imposes a tax on the middle class of this country, that \nthe President broke a promise because he said he would not raise taxes \non the middle class.\n  I want everybody to know what is being talked about when people talk \nabout this. They are talking about a piece of the legislation called \nthe health care mandate. Some people call it a penalty, and some people \ncall it a tax. That is something that has been debated around here for \nthe last week. It has not been debated before this.\n  I do not care what label you put on it, frankly, because people at \nhome are not talking to me about this. Do you know why they are not \ntalking to me about this? Because it applies to 1 percent--1.2 percent, \nto be precise--of the American people. That is what the Congressional \nBudget Office told us when we were passing this legislation. And if you \ndo not believe me, it is on page 33--I will not enter the whole opinion \ninto the Record--of the Supreme Court's finding of fact, where Justice \nRoberts finds as a matter of fact that the CBO said this mandate would \ncost $4 billion and that roughly 4 million people would be affected. \nThose are the 4 million people after Medicare and Medicaid and private \nemployers' insurance and personal insurance that people buy. That is a \ngroup of people, a sliver, 1 percent of the American people who can \nafford to buy insurance but do not and choose to pay the penalty or the \ntax or the mandate instead of buying their insurance--$4 billion; 4 \nmillion people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the portion of the \nSupreme Court Opinion of the Court that I referred to on page 33 of the \nopinion be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n       The exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those \n     without health insurance looks like a tax in many respects. \n     The ``[s]hared responsibility payment,'' as the statute \n     entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by ``taxpayer[s]'' \n     when they file their tax returns. 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5000A(b). It \n     does not apply to individuals who do not pay federal income \n     taxes because their household income is less than the filing \n     threshold in the Internal Revenue Code. Sec. 5000A(e)(2). For \n     taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by \n     such familiar factors as taxable income, number of \n     dependents, and joint filing status. Sec. Sec. 5000A(b)(3), \n     (c)(2), (c)(4). The requirement to pay is found in the \n     Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS, which--as we \n     previously explained--must assess and collect it ``in the \n     same manner as taxes.'' Supra, at 13-14. This process yields \n     the essential feature of any tax: it produces at least some \n     revenue for the Government. United States v. Kahriger, 345 \n     U.S. 22, 28, n. 4 (1953). Indeed, the payment is expected to \n     raise about $4 billion per year by 2017. Congressional Budget \n     Office, Payments of Penalties for Being Uninsured Under the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Apr. 30, 2010), \n     in Selected CBO Publications Related to Health Care \n     Legislation, 2009-2010, p. 71 (rev. 2010).\n\n  Mr. BENNET. What the health care bill was intended to do--and again, \nit may not have done it perfectly, and there may be other ideas we \nought to be legislating around--what it was intended to do is solve a \nproblem that confronted not 1 percent of the American people, not 4 \nmillion people, but a problem that conservatively--extremely \nconservatively--affects 50 percent of the American people and is a \n$58.5 billion problem, not a $4 billion problem, because it is 50 \npercent of the people who are covered today by their employers who have \nto pay $1,100 a year in additional premiums to subsidize the uninsured \nin the United States of America. That was one of the big objectives of \ndealing with this health care issue. And I say it is conservative \nbecause this number does not even include the people who are buying \ninsurance on their own. So maybe if you add those numbers together, you \nget to about 70 percent of the American people.\n  So we spent a week on cable television, on the floor of the Senate, \noccupied completely with this 1 percent number over here, with no \ntheory at all about what we are doing for 50 percent of Americans. That \nis how comical this conversation has become. I should not say comical. \nThat is how detached this conversation has become from what is actually \ngoing on in the real lives of the people whom I represent and others in \nthis Chamber represent.\n  What is so amazing to me, having watched this as somebody who has not \nbeen around here for very long and may not understand all the ways of \nWashington, is that when you look at the history of this so-called \nmandate or so-called tax, it is really puzzling to understand the \npolitics around this.\n  This is a chart, I show you in the Chamber, that is part of an \narticle that ran in the New Yorker a couple weeks ago called the \n``Unpopular Mandate'' by Ezra Klein. I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the New Yorker, June 25, 2012]\n\n     Unpopular Mandate--Why do politicians reverse their positions?\n\n                            (By Ezra Klein)\n\n       On March 23, 2010, the day that President Obama signed the \n     Affordable Care Act into law, fourteen state attorneys \n     general filed suit against the law's requirement that most \n     Americans purchase health insurance, on the ground that it \n     was unconstitutional. It was hard to find a law professor in \n     the country who took them seriously. ``The argument about \n     constitutionality is, if not frivolous, close to it,'' \n     Sanford Levinson, a University\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\n     of Texas law-school professor, told the McClatchy newspapers. \n     Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the \n     University of California at Irvine, told the Times, ``There \n     is no case law, post 1937, that would support an individual's \n     right not to buy health care if the government wants to \n     mandate it.'' Orin Kerr, a George Washington University \n     professor who had clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, said, \n     ``There is a less than one-per-cent chance that the courts \n     will invalidate the individual mandate.'' Today, as the \n     Supreme Court prepares to hand down its decision on the law, \n     Kerr puts the chance that it will overturn the mandate--\n     almost certainly on a party-line vote--at closer to ``fifty-\n     fifty.'' The Republicans have made the individual mandate the \n     element most likely to undo the President's health-care law. \n     The irony is that the Democrats adopted it in the first place \n     because they thought that it would help them secure \n     conservative support. It had, after all, been at the heart of \n     Republican health-care reforms for two decades.\n       The mandate made its political debut in a 1989 Heritage \n     Foundation brief titled ``Assuring Affordable Health Care for \n     All Americans,'' as a counterpoint to the single-payer system \n     and the employer mandate, which were favored in Democratic \n     circles. In the brief, Stuart Butler, the foundation's \n     health-care expert, argued, ``Many states now require \n     passengers in automobiles to wear seat-belts for their own \n     protection. Many others require anybody driving a car to have \n     liability insurance. But neither the federal government nor \n     any state requires all households to protect themselves from \n     the potentially catastrophic costs of a serious accident or \n     illness. Under the Heritage plan, there would be such a \n     requirement.'' The mandate made its first legislative \n     appearance in 1993, in the Health Equity and Access Reform \n     Today Act--the Republicans' alternative to President \n     Clinton's health-reform bill--which was sponsored by John \n     Chafee, of Rhode Island, and co-sponsored by eighteen \n     Republicans, including Bob Dole, who was then the Senate \n     Minority Leader.\n       After the Clinton bill, which called for an employer \n     mandate, failed, Democrats came to recognize the opportunity \n     that the Chafee bill had presented. In ``The System,'' David \n     Broder and Haynes Johnson's history of the health-care wars \n     of the nineties, Bill Clinton concedes that it was the best \n     chance he had of reaching a bipartisan compromise. ``It \n     should have been right then, or the day after they presented \n     their bill, where I should have tried to have a direct \n     understanding with Dole,'' he said.\n       Ten years later, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, \n     began picking his way back through the history--he read ``The \n     System'' four times--and he, too, came to focus on the Chafee \n     bill. He began building a proposal around the individual \n     mandate, and tested it out on both Democrats and Republicans. \n     ``Between 2004 and 2008, I saw over eighty members of the \n     Senate, and there were very few who objected,'' Wyden says. \n     In December, 2006, he unveiled the Healthy Americans Act. In \n     May, 2007, Bob Bennett, a Utah Republican, who had been a \n     sponsor of the Chafee bill, joined him. Wyden-Bennett was \n     eventually co-sponsored by eleven Republicans and nine \n     Democrats, receiving more bipartisan support than any \n     universal health-care proposal in the history of the Senate. \n     It even caught the eye of the Republican Presidential \n     aspirants. In a June, 2009, interview on ``Meet the Press,'' \n     Mitt Romney, who, as governor of Massachusetts, had signed a \n     universal health-care bill with an individual mandate, said \n     that Wyden-Bennett was a plan ``that a number of Republicans \n     think is a very good health-care plan--one that we support.''\n       Wyden's bill was part of a broader trend of Democrats \n     endorsing the individual mandate in their own proposals. John \n     Edwards and Hillary Clinton both built a mandate into their \n     campaign health-care proposals. In 2008, Senator Ted Kennedy \n     brought John McDonough, a liberal advocate of the \n     Massachusetts plan, to Washington to help with health-care \n     reform. That same year, Max Baucus, the chairman of the \n     Senate Finance Committee, included an individual mandate in \n     the first draft of his health-care bill. The main Democratic \n     holdout was Senator Barack Obama. But by July, 2009, \n     President Obama had changed his mind. ``I was opposed to this \n     idea because my general attitude was the reason people don't \n     have health insurance is not because they don't want it. It's \n     because they can't afford it,'' he told CBS News. ``I am now \n     in favor of some sort of individual mandate.''\n       This process led, eventually, to the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act--better known as Obamacare--which also \n     included an individual mandate. But, as that bill came closer \n     to passing, Republicans began coalescing around the mandate, \n     which polling showed to be one of the legislation's least \n     popular elements. In December, 2009, in a vote on the bill, \n     every Senate Republican voted to call the individual mandate \n     ``unconstitutional.''\n       This shift--Democrats lining up behind the Republican-\n     crafted mandate, and Republicans declaring it not just \n     inappropriate policy but contrary to the wishes of the \n     Founders--shocked Wyden. ``I would characterize the \n     Washington, D.C., relationship with the individual mandate as \n     truly schizophrenic,'' he said.\n       It was not an isolated case. In 2007, both Newt Gingrich \n     and John McCain wanted a cap-and-trade program in order to \n     reduce carbon emissions. Today, neither they nor any other \n     leading Republicans support cap-and-trade. In 2008, the Bush \n     Administration proposed, pushed, and signed the Economic \n     Stimulus Act, a deficit-financed tax cut designed to boost \n     the flagging economy. Today, few Republicans admit that a \n     deficit-financed stimulus can work. Indeed, with the \n     exception of raising taxes on the rich, virtually every major \n     policy currently associated with the Obama Administration \n     was, within the past decade, a Republican idea in good \n     standing.\n       Jonathan Haidt, a professor of psychology at New York \n     University's business school, argues in a new book, ``The \n     Righteous Mind,'' that to understand human beings, and their \n     politics, you need to understand that we are descended from \n     ancestors who would not have survived if they hadn't been \n     very good at belonging to groups. He writes that ``our minds \n     contain a variety of mental mechanisms that make us adept at \n     promoting our group's interests, in competition with other \n     groups. We are not saints, but we are sometimes good team \n     players.''\n       One of those mechanisms is figuring out how to believe what \n     the group believes. Haidt sees the role that reason plays as \n     akin to the job of the White House press secretary. He \n     writes, ``No matter how bad the policy, the secretary will \n     find some way to praise or defend it. Sometimes you'll hear \n     an awkward pause as the secretary searches for the right \n     words, but what you'll never hear is: `Hey, that's a great \n     point! Maybe we should rethink this policy.' Press \n     secretaries can't say that because they have no power to make \n     or revise policy. They're told what the policy is, and their \n     job is to find evidence and arguments that will justify the \n     policy to the public.'' For that reason, Haidt told me, \n     ``once group loyalties are engaged, you can't change people's \n     minds by utterly refuting their arguments. Thinking is mostly \n     just rationalization, mostly just a search for supporting \n     evidence.''\n       Psychologists have a term for this: ``motivated \n     reasoning,'' which Dan Kahan, a professor of law and \n     psychology at Yale, defines as ``when a person is conforming \n     their assessments of information to some interest or goal \n     that is independent of accuracy''--an interest or goal such \n     as remaining a well-regarded member of his political party, \n     or winning the next election, or even just winning an \n     argument. Geoffrey Cohen, a professor of psychology at \n     Stanford, has shown how motivated reasoning can drive even \n     the opinions of engaged partisans. In 2003, when he was an \n     assistant professor at Yale, Cohen asked a group of \n     undergraduates, who had previously described their political \n     views as either very liberal or very conservative, to \n     participate in a test to study, they were told, their \n     ``memory of everyday current events.''\n       The students were shown two articles: one was a generic \n     news story; the other described a proposed welfare policy. \n     The first article was a decoy; it was the students' reactions \n     to the second that interested Cohen. He was actually testing \n     whether party identifications influence voters when they \n     evaluate new policies. To find out, he produced multiple \n     versions of the welfare article. Some students read about a \n     program that was extremely generous--more generous, in fact, \n     than any welfare policy that has ever existed in the United \n     States--while others were presented with a very stingy \n     proposal. But there was a twist: some versions of the article \n     about the generous proposal portrayed it as being endorsed by \n     Republican Party leaders; and some versions of the article \n     about the meagre program described it as having Democratic \n     support. The results showed that, ``for both liberal and \n     conservative participants, the effect of reference group \n     information overrode that of policy content. If their party \n     endorsed it, liberals supported even a harsh welfare program, \n     and conservatives supported even a lavish one.''\n       In a subsequent study involving just self-described liberal \n     students, Cohen gave half the group news stories that had \n     accompanying Democratic endorsements and the other half news \n     stories that did not. The students who didn't get the \n     endorsements preferred a more generous program. When they did \n     get the endorsements, they went with their party, even if \n     this meant embracing a meaner option.\n       This kind of thinking is, according to psychologists, \n     unsurprising. Each of us can have firsthand knowledge of just \n     a small number of topics--our jobs, our studies, our personal \n     experiences. But as citizens--and as elected officials--we \n     are routinely asked to make judgments on issues as diverse \n     and as complex as the Iranian nuclear program, the \n     environmental impact of an international oil pipeline, and \n     the likely outcomes of branding China a ``currency \n     manipulator.''\n       According to the political-science literature, one of the \n     key roles that political parties play is helping us navigate \n     these decisions. In theory, we join parties because they \n     share our values and our goals--values and goals that may \n     have been passed on to us by the most important groups in our \n     lives, such as our families and our communities--and so we \n     trust that their policy judgments will match the ones we \n     would come up with if we had unlimited time to study the \n     issues. But parties, though based on a set of principles, \n     aren't disinterested teachers in search of truth. They're \n     organized groups looking to increase their power. Or, as the \n     psychologists would put it, their reasoning may be motivated \n     by something other than accuracy. And you can see the results \n     among voters who pay the closest attention to the issues.\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n       In a 2006 paper, ``It Feels Like We're Thinking,'' the \n     political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels \n     looked at a National Election Study, a poll supported by the \n     National Science Foundation, from 1996. One of the questions \n     asked whether ``the size of the yearly budget deficit \n     increased, decreased, or stayed about the same during \n     Clinton's time as President.'' The correct answer is that it \n     decreased, dramatically. Achen and Bartels categorize the \n     respondents according to how politically informed they were. \n     Among the least-informed respondents, Democrats and \n     Republicans picked the wrong answer in roughly equal numbers. \n     But among better-informed voters the story was different. \n     Republicans who were in the fiftieth percentile gave the \n     right answer more often than those in the ninety-fifth \n     percentile. Bartels found a similar effect in a previous \n     survey, in which well-informed Democrats were asked whether \n     inflation had gone down during Ronald Reagan's Presidency. It \n     had, but many of those Democrats said that it hadn't. The \n     more information people had, it seemed, the better they were \n     at arranging it to fit what they wanted to believe. As \n     Bartels told me, ``If I'm a Republican and an enthusiastic \n     supporter of lower tax rates, it is uncomfortable to \n     recognize that President Obama has reduced most Americans' \n     taxes--and I can find plenty of conservative information \n     sources that deny or ignore the fact that he has.''\n       Recently, Bartels noticed a similar polarization in \n     attitudes toward the health-care law and the Supreme Court. \n     Using YouGov polling data, he found that less-informed voters \n     who supported the law and less-informed voters who opposed it \n     were equally likely to say that ``the Supreme Court should be \n     able to throw out any law it finds unconstitutional.'' But, \n     among better-informed voters, those who opposed the law were \n     thirty per cent more likely than those who supported it to \n     cede that power to the Court. In other words, well-informed \n     opponents realized that they needed an activist Supreme Court \n     that was willing to aggressively overturn laws if they were \n     to have any hope of invalidating the Affordable Care Act.\n       Orin Kerr says that, in the two years since he gave the \n     individual mandate only a one-per-cent chance of being \n     overturned, three key things have happened. First, \n     congressional Republicans made the argument against the \n     mandate a Republican position. Then it became a standard \n     conservative-media position. ``That legitimized the argument \n     in a way we haven't really seen before,'' Kerr said. ``We \n     haven't seen the media pick up a legal argument and make the \n     argument mainstream by virtue of media coverage.'' Finally, \n     he says, ``there were two conservative district judges who \n     agreed with the argument, largely echoing the Republican \n     position and the media coverage. And, once you had all that, \n     it really became a ballgame.''\n       Jack Balkin, a Yale law professor, agrees. ``Once \n     Republican politicians say this is unconstitutional, it gets \n     repeated endlessly in the partisan media that's friendly to \n     the Republican Party''--Fox News, conservative talk radio, \n     and the like--``and, because this is now the Republican \n     Party's position, the mainstream media needs to repeatedly \n     explain the claims to their readers. That further moves \n     the arguments from off the wall to on the wall, because, \n     if you're reading articles in the Times describing the \n     case against the mandate, you assume this is a live \n     controversy.'' Of course, Balkin says, ``if the courts \n     didn't buy this, it wouldn't get anywhere.''\n       But the courts are not as distant from the political \n     process as some like to think. The first judge to rule \n     against the individual mandate was Judge Henry Hudson, of \n     Virginia's Eastern District Court. Hudson was heavily \n     invested in a Republican consulting firm called Campaign \n     Solutions, Inc. The company had worked with the Presidential \n     campaigns of John McCain and George W. Bush, the Republican \n     National Committee, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, and \n     Ken Cuccinelli--the Virginia state attorney general who is \n     one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits against the Affordable \n     Care Act.\n       The fact that a judge--even a partisan judge in a district \n     court--had ruled that a central piece of a Democratic \n     President's signature legislative accomplishment was \n     unconstitutional led the news across the country. Hudson's \n     ruling was followed by a similar, and even more sweeping, \n     ruling, by Judge Roger Vinson, of the Northern District of \n     Florida. Vinson declared the entire bill unconstitutional, \n     setting off a new round of stories. The twin rulings gave \n     conservatives who wanted to believe that the mandate was \n     unconstitutional more reason to hold that belief. Voters who \n     hadn't thought much about it now heard that judges were \n     ruling against the Administration. Vinson and Hudson were \n     outnumbered by other district judges who either upheld the \n     law or threw out lawsuits against it, but those rulings were \n     mostly ignored.\n       At the Washington Monthly, Steve Benen kept track of the \n     placement that the Times and the Washington Post (where I \n     work) gave to stories about court rulings on the health-care \n     law. When judges ruled against the law, they got long front-\n     page stories. When they ruled for it, they got shorter \n     stories, inside the paper. Indeed, none of the cases \n     upholding the law got front-page coverage, but every \n     rejection of it did, and usually in both papers. From an \n     editorial perspective, that made sense: the Vinson and Hudson \n     rulings called into question the law's future; the other \n     rulings signalled no change. But the effect was repeated news \n     stories in which the Affordable Care Act was declared \n     unconstitutional, and few news stories representing the legal \n     profession's consensus that it was not. The result can be \n     seen in a March poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which \n     found that fifty-one per cent of Americans think that the \n     mandate is unconstitutional.\n       What is notable about the conservative response to the \n     individual mandate is not only the speed with which a legal \n     argument that was considered fringe in 2010 had become \n     mainstream by 2012; it's the implication that the Republicans \n     spent two decades pushing legislation that was in clear \n     violation of the nation's founding document. Political \n     parties do go through occasional, painful cleansings, in \n     which they emerge with different leaders who hold different \n     positions. This was true of Democrats in the nineteen- \n     nineties, when Bill Clinton passed free trade, deficit \n     reduction, and welfare reform, despite the furious objections \n     of liberals. But in this case the mandate's supporters simply \n     became its opponents.\n       In February, 2012, Stuart Butler, the author of the \n     Heritage Foundation brief that first proposed the mandate, \n     wrote an op-ed for USA Today in which he recanted that \n     support. ``I've altered my views on many things,'' he wrote. \n     ``The individual mandate in health care is one of them.'' \n     Senator Orrin Hatch, who had been a co-sponsor of the Chafee \n     bill, emerged as one of the mandate's most implacable \n     opponents in 2010, writing in The Hill that to come to ``any \n     other conclusion'' than that the mandate is unconstitutional \n     ``requires treating the Constitution as the servant, rather \n     than the master, of Congress.'' Mitt Romney, who had both \n     passed an individual mandate as governor and supported Wyden-\n     Bennett, now calls Obama's law an ``unconstitutional power \n     grab from the states,'' and has promised, if elected, to \n     begin repealing the law ``on Day One.''\n       Even Bob Bennett, who was among the most eloquent advocates \n     of the mandate, voted, in 2009, to call it unconstitutional. \n     ``I'd group us''--Senate Republicans--``into three \n     categories,'' he says. ``There were people like me, who \n     bought onto the mandate because it made sense and would work, \n     and we were reluctant to let go of it. Then, there were \n     people who bought onto it slowly, for political advantage, \n     and were immediately willing to abandon it as soon as the \n     political advantage went the other way. And then there's a \n     third group that thought it made sense and then thought it \n     through and changed their minds.'' Explaining his decision to \n     vote against the law, Bennett, who was facing a Tea Party \n     challenger in a primary, says, ``I didn't focus on the \n     particulars of the amendment as closely as I should have, and \n     probably would have voted the other way if I had understood \n     that the individual mandate was at its core. I just wanted to \n     express my opposition to the Obama proposal at every \n     opportunity.'' He was defeated in the primary, anyway.\n       But, whatever the motives of individual politicians, the \n     end result was the same: a policy that once enjoyed broad \n     support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified \n     opposition--opposition that was echoed, refined, and \n     popularized by other institutions affiliated with the Party. \n     This is what Jason Grumet, the president of the Bipartisan \n     Policy Center, a group that tried to encourage Republicans \n     and Democrats to unite around policy solutions, calls the \n     ``think-tank industrial complex''--the network of \n     ideologically oriented research centers that drive much of \n     the policy debate in Washington. As Senator Olympia Snowe, of \n     Maine, who has announced that she is leaving the Senate \n     because of the noxious political climate, says, ``You can \n     find a think tank to buttress any view or position, and then \n     you can give it the aura of legitimacy and credibility by \n     referring to their report.'' And, as we're increasingly able \n     to choose our information sources based on their tendency to \n     back up whatever we already believe, we don't even have to \n     hear the arguments from the other side, much less give them \n     serious consideration. Partisans who may not have strong \n     opinions on the underlying issues thus get a clear signal on \n     what their party wants them to think, along with reams of \n     information on why they should think it.\n       All this suggests that the old model of compromise is going \n     to have a very difficult time in today's polarized political \n     climate. Because it's typically not in the minority party's \n     interest to compromise with the majority party on big bills--\n     elections are a zero-sum game, where the majority wins if the \n     public thinks it has been doing a good job--Washington's \n     motivated-reasoning machine is likely to kick into gear on \n     most major issues. ``Reasoning can take you wherever you want \n     to go,'' Haidt warns. ``Can you see your way to an individual \n     mandate, if it's a way to fight single payer? Sure. And so, \n     when it was strategically valuable Republicans could believe \n     it was constitutional and good. Then Obama proposes the idea. \n     And then the question becomes not `Can you believe in this?' \n     but `Must you believe it?' ''\n       And that means that you can't assume that policy-based \n     compromises that made sense at the beginning will survive to \n     the end, because by that time whichever group has an interest \n     in not compromising will likely have convinced itself that \n     the compromise position is an awful idea--even if, just a few \n     years ago, that group thought it was a great one. ``The basic \n     way you wanted\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\n     to put together a big deal five years ago is that the \n     thoughtful minds in one party would basically go off and \n     write a bill that had seventy per cent of their orthodoxy and \n     thirty per cent of the other side's orthodoxy and try to use \n     that to peel off five or six senators from the other side,'' \n     Grumet says. ``That process just doesn't work anymore.'' The \n     remarkable and confusing trajectory of the individual-mandate \n     debate, in other words, could simply be the new norm.\n       I asked Ron Wyden how, if politicians can so easily be \n     argued out of their policy preferences, compromise was \n     possible. ``I don't find it easy to answer that question, \n     because I'm an elected official and not a psychiatrist,'' he \n     said. ``If somebody says they sincerely changed their minds, \n     then so be it.'' But Wyden is, as always, optimistic about \n     the next bipartisan deal, and, again, he thinks he knows just \n     where to start. ``To bring about bipartisanship, it's going \n     to be necessary to win on something people can see and \n     understand. That's why I think tax reform is a huge \n     opportunity for the economy and the cause of building \n     coalitions.'' Perhaps he's right. Or perhaps that's just what \n     he wants to believe.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. I urge people to read this because what Mr. Klein does in \nthis article is chart the political course of this mandate from about \n1989 to the present. The red shown on the chart is the years in which \nthis was a Republican idea, advanced by Republican Members of Congress \nand by think tanks like the Heritage Foundation that actually came up \nwith the idea to begin with to deal with the fact that there were \npeople in this country who were not buying health insurance and whom we \nwere all subsidizing, and then when it became a Democratic idea in more \nrecent times.\n  It strikes me as one person watching all of this that this might have \nmore to do with the party that is in the White House or not in the \nWhite House than it does with respect to the merits of the idea. But it \nis, of course, the merits of these ideas that we should be debating and \ntalking about. But we should not be telling the American people that \nsomething that affects 1 percent of the American people is a broad-\nbased assault on the middle class, and we should be bringing to this \nfloor the ideas we have for improving what 50 percent of the American \npeople or 70 percent of the American people are already facing. That is \nwhat people in our States believe.\n  Here is part of an editorial from the Greeley Tribune, which I think \nwas published yesterday, where they wrote:\n\n       In 2010, the North Colorado Medical Center provided more \n     than $71 million in services to indigent patients who didn't \n     have health insurance. It wrote off another $29 million in \n     bad debt.\n\n  The Greeley Tribune writes:\n\n       Eventually, insured patients [must] pay for that, in higher \n     premiums and co-pays.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Tribune Opinion: Reforms From Affordable Care Act Will Improve Access \n                                to Care\n\n       Depending on who you talk to, the U.S. Supreme Court \n     decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act is either a great \n     step toward improving health care for millions of Americans \n     or it's the end of the world as we know it.\n       But we applaud the court's decision for many reasons. We \n     think the hysteria surrounding the Affordable Care Act is \n     generally unfounded and while not perfect, the Affordable \n     Care Act is a step in the right direction toward reforming \n     our health care system.\n       The Supreme Court specifically upheld the individual \n     mandate provision, which will eventually require everyone to \n     have health insurance. Those against the measure say it is an \n     example of a government mandate aimed at controlling what \n     should be a personal freedom to choose not to carry health \n     insurance.\n       We argue, however, that this really isn't that different \n     than being required to carry auto insurance if you drive a \n     car or being required to pay your taxes. It's something we \n     should all do to be contributing citizens of this nation.\n       But even more, those of us who do have insurance end up \n     paying for those who don't through higher health care costs.\n       In 2010, North Colorado Medical Center provided more than \n     $71 million in services to indigent patients who didn't have \n     health insurance. It wrote off another $29 million in bad \n     debt. Eventually, insured patients pay for that, in higher \n     premiums and co-pays.\n       This provision isn't meant to be a punishment. Programs are \n     being developed to help those who truly can't afford medical \n     insurance.\n       There are other aspects of the act that are also good, \n     including stopping insurance companies from denying coverage \n     for people with ongoing conditions and the provision that \n     will allow children to stay on their parent's insurance until \n     they are 26.\n       Frankly, in Colorado, where many aspects of the act have \n     already be instituted, the numbers are hard to ignore. \n     According to Gov. John Hickenlooper's office:\n       Because of GettingUsCovered, a high-risk insurance pool, \n     1,331 people with pre-existing conditions have received \n     coverage.\n       43,997 more adults have gained health insurance coverage.\n       Nearly 1 million residents of the state with private health \n     insurance now have coverage for preventative health care.\n       Nearly 2 million residents do not have to worry about \n     lifetime limits on coverage, freeing those suffering from \n     chronic diseases such as cancer of the threat of losing their \n     coverage, and their ability to receive treatments.\n       There are many more reforms that are needed in our health \n     care system. There needs to be more emphasis on preventative \n     care. There needs to be more access to treatment for some \n     patients who are suffering from chronic illnesses. The \n     skyrocketing cost of health care needs to be addressed.\n       We do believe this act will head the United States toward \n     some of those reforms that eventually will be a direct \n     benefit to patients.\n       Unfortunately, we also realize this is going to continue to \n     be a political issue, and that is unfortunate. Access to good \n     health care should be a right in this country for every \n     single citizen, regardless of their income level. It \n     shouldn't be a tool for politicians to use scare tactics and \n     myths to gain more power.\n       We hope this historic affirmation of the constitutionality \n     of the Affordable Care Act is just the first step toward \n     improving access, and our health care system as a whole.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I believe that folks in Colorado have \nmoved on here, that they want us to improve this legislation, that they \nwant us to get focused on the real matters at hand, which are getting \nthis economy going again, getting us into an environment where we have \nmore jobs and rising wages again, and they are a lot less interested in \nthese talking points.\n  I do not understand why people who are in politics can simultaneously \nmake such a big deal about this that affects 1 percent of the people in \nthis country and at the same time support legislation, for example, \nthat forces women, that mandates women to have procedures before they \ncan make a choice about their own reproductive health. It does not make \nany sense because it is completely inconsistent.\n  I have a daughter Anne who is 7, not 6 like Mary's daughter. But it \nis her health care and the certainty in her life and in her sisters' \nlives and the thousands of children across my State whose health care \nwe should be interested in.\n  I can see that other colleagues of mine have come to the floor, so I \nam going to move along here. But before I do that and before I yield to \nthe Senator from Maryland, I want to say that if this repeal happened \nin the House and then this repeal happened in the Senate and it were \nsigned into law, 932,000 Coloradans who have preexisting conditions \nwould lose their insurance, 50,000 young adults in Colorado who can now \nstay on their parents' insurance until they are 26 would no longer be \nable to, and women could once again be discriminated against simply \nbecause they are women. It is welcome to 696,000 women in Colorado who \nneed maternity care or other women's health services who are not going \nto be charged higher premiums since this law is in effect. And when \nthese exchanges are set up, 521,000 Colorado children will, for the \nfirst time, have better vision and dental coverage.\n  I want to work in a bipartisan way going forward to try to make sure \nwe are doing everything we can to follow the examples of places such as \nSt. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction or the University of Colorado \nHospital in Denver or Denver Health in Denver to drive higher quality \nand to drive lower costs. It is essential. It is essential for our \neconomy, and it is essential for our competitive position in the world. \nAnd it is essential that we put these talking points down and start \nactually dealing with the facts as they are.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you for your patience, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. First, Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennet for his \ncomments as they relate to the Affordable Care Act. I appreciate very \nmuch the\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\npoint the Senator made that what was passed by Congress and signed by \nPresident Obama was really an evolution of work that had been done and \nrecommendations that had been made by Democratic and Republican \nadministrations over a long period of time and that what the Supreme \nCourt did was uphold Congress's ability to move forward with a plan \nthat will give every American access to affordable quality health care.\n  I could not agree more with the Senator that we need to do work on \nthis. We need to improve the bill. There are different things we need \nto work on, and Democrats and Republicans should be working together to \nmove forward on the health care debate.\n  I also appreciate the point the Senator raised that the House of \nRepresentatives--I think it is the 31st time they are acting on \nlegislation that repeals all or part of the Affordable Care Act. But \ntheir strategy is to repeal the law, and they have nothing to move \nforward with. They do not have a plan. As the Senator pointed out, if \nthat were to become the case--and it will not; we are not going to pass \nit in the Senate--parents who now have their children on their \ninsurance policy, who are 23-, 24-, 25-years-old, would lose that \nopportunity, and parents who can now get their children covered by \ninsurance who have preexisting conditions would lose that protection.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights that we have incorporated against \nabusive practices of private insurance companies--so that if someone \ngoes into an emergency room with emergency conditions, they need to be \nreimbursed under prudent layperson standards--that could be lost. Our \nseniors could lose their wellness exams that are covered under \nMedicare. And we are closing the coverage gap on prescription drugs. \nThat could be lost.\n  Let me also point out that our seniors appreciate the fact that what \nwe did in the Affordable Care Act extends the life of Medicare for \nabout a decade. That would be lost.\n  Small businesses will be able, in 2014, to go into exchanges and not \nbe discriminated against by paying more for their insurance than a \nlarger company. That would be lost.\n  As the Senator knows, the attack on women's health care--this bill \nthat is now law allows women to be treated equally with men as far as \npremiums are concerned. That would be lost.\n  So I appreciate Senator Bennet taking the time on the floor to go \nover exactly what would happen if we were to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  What we need to do, and I think the Court gave us this opportunity--\nthey spoke to the fact that it is up to Congress to move forward on \nthis--it gives us a chance, Democrats and Republicans, to say: How can \nwe make sure our health care system is as cost-effective as possible.\n  In the Senate Finance Committee today, we had a roundtable discussion \nwith experts as to how we can do delivery system reforms, use ways we \ncan manage people with serious illnesses and bring down the cost. That \nis what we need to do.\n  But the Affordable Care Act itself reduced health care costs. Look at \nthe record. We will lose all that. We actually add to the deficit by \nrepealing the Affordable Care Act. As the Senator knows, the House \nchanged their rules so they can repeal the bill, even though it adds to \nthe deficit.\n  So I wanted to first thank the Senator for bringing this to the \nattention of our colleagues as to what is involved. I do think \nDemocrats and Republicans need to work together. The one comment I hear \nmore and more from my constituents is stop the gridlock in Washington. \nStop debating the old issues. Let's move forward. Let's create jobs. \nLet's work together. Let's get the job done for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Tourette Syndrome\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I rise to bring attention to Tourette syndrome, a \nneurological disorder that affects more than 200,000 Americans in the \nmost severe form and as many as 3 million more who exhibit milder \nsymptoms. Tourette syndrome or TS is characterized by repetitive \ninvoluntary movements and vocalizations called tics.\n  The disorder is named for a French neurologist who in 1885 first \ndescribed the condition in an 86-year-old woman. TS occurs in people \nfrom all ethnic groups and is present in males three to four times more \noften than in females.\n  The early symptoms are typically noticed first in childhood, usually \nwhen a child is between the age of 3 and 9 years of age. Although TS \ncan be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most \npatients experience the most severe symptoms in their early teens, with \nsome improvements occurring in the late teens and continuing into \nadulthood.\n  In May, a 13-year-old boy named Jackson Guyton from Parkton, MD, \nvisited my office to tell me about his experiences with Tourette. \nJackson first noticed symptoms 5 years ago during the summer of 2007. \nWhile on vacation with his family at the beach, his body started making \nstrange movements he could not control. First, came a head jerk, then \neye-squinting and rolling; later, he started emitting high-pitched \nsqueaking sounds. As Jackson put it: ``I was a regular kid one moment, \nwith good grades and very few problems, then in the next I was rolling \nmy eyes and making sounds. . . . like a fire alarm going off.''\n  In school, the sound was so loud his friends would cover their ears \nand avoid sitting near him in class, and parents of other children \nbegan complaining about his being in their children's class. With \nteachers who were uneducated on TS, the symptoms continued throughout \nthe school year.\n  So as to avoid ridicule, Jackson began skipping school or spending \nmore time in the nurse's office than in class. Fortunately, Jackson's \nparents found a physician who was able to quickly diagnose the \ncondition as Tourette Syndrome. Jackson changed schools and spent the \nnext few years in treatment, trying various medications prescribed by \nhis doctors.\n  Those medicines were somewhat helpful. Jackson tried other treatments \nand clinical trials at Johns Hopkins University, where he met Dr. \nMatthew Specht, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry who \nteaches children exercises to help control the tics.\n  That technique, cognitive behavioral intervention therapy or CBIT \nrequires patients to use a great amount of focus and it does not work \nfor everyone. But it did help Jackson control his squeaks. In the \nmiddle school, he encountered a guidance counselor named Mrs. Oates who \nhelped change his life. In Jackson's words:\n\n       She learned as much as she could about TS and helped me \n     learn how to deal with the kids better and talk to teachers \n     about what was happening. She also gave me a safe place to \n     hang out when things were bad. Through her and a group that \n     my mom started to help other families with TS in our area, I \n     made a few friends who understood me better.\n\n  She also helped Jackson develop a presentation for the 6th grade \nclass in his school. Jackson is now 13 years of age, and in September \nhe will enter the 9th grade at Hereford High School. He is no longer \nfeeling depressed, and he no longer retreats from others because of his \ncondition. Rather, he welcomes the opportunity to use his experiences \nto educate teachers and other students as a Youth Ambassador, a \nposition for which he was trained at the National TSA Conference with \nabout 40 other young people.\n  Recently, he presented information about TS to more than 400 \nelementary school students. He says he truly enjoys answering their \nquestions. He believes, as I do, it is important for people to \nunderstand that children with TS are not doing strange or disruptive \nthings on purpose, and he just wants to be treated like everyone else.\n  Jackson still has unpredictable and sometimes painful tics, but he \nknows now that TS will not stop him from accomplishing everything he \nwants to do in life. Last year, Jackson's little brother Davis was also \ndiagnosed with TS. Jackson says that having a teacher who understands \nthe problem and knows how to help is one of the most important things \nin the life of a child with TS.\n  He is preparing a special presentation for Davis's class that he will \ndeliver when the 2012-2013 school year starts. I am very proud of this \nyoung man. I am hopeful the examples set by him, his\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\nguidance counselor Mrs. Oates, and other TSA Youth Ambassadors are \nblazing a trial for those who are newly diagnosed.\n\n  I am also pleased Congress understands how important public awareness \nof Tourette is. In 2000, Congress created the Tourette Syndrome Public \nHealth Education Research Outreach Program at the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. The purpose of this program is to increase \nrecognition and diagnosis of TS, reduce the stigma attached to the \ndisorder, and increase the availability of effective treatment.\n  The program also includes a public-private partnership between the \nCDC and the Tourette Syndrome Association, or TSA, that provides \neducational programs for physicians, allied health professionals and \nschool personnel as well as those who have TS, their families, and the \ngeneral public. To date, the CDC-TSA outreach program has conducted \nmore than 520 educational programs for 32,000 professionals and \ncommunity members nationwide.\n  This program is working well. In addition, CDC has entered into a \ncooperative agreement with the University of Rochester and the \nUniversity of South Florida to better understand the public health \nimpact of tic disorders, including TS, for individuals and their \nfamilies and the community.\n  One of the areas being assessed is education, as they are looking at \nthe effect of TS on standardized test scores, grade retention, and the \npresence of an individualized education program. Significantly, they \nare also measuring teachers' understanding of TS, and this information \nwill be used to inform and improve outreach programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support full funding of this program again \nthis year so we might expand awareness of TS and lead to a better \nquality of life for people such as Jackson and families across the \nNation who are affected by this disorder.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have listened to some of my friends \nacross the aisle talking about the vote in the House to repeal what has \nnow come to be known as ObamaCare, which the official title is the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. But I think history has now \ndemonstrated it is not the Affordable Care Act; it is the \n``Unaffordable Care Act.''\n  My colleagues suggest the only way we can possibly protect people \nfrom preexisting disease exclusions under their insurance policy or \nmake sure young adults up to 26 years old can remain covered under \ntheir parent's coverage is to pass this $2.5 trillion monstrosity. That \nis not the case. We could easily address these other issues as well as \naffordability if we were to take a step-by-step approach to try to make \nsure the patient-physician decisionmaking process is preserved, while \nmaking health coverage more affordable for more Americans.\n  But unfortunately that was not the approach taken under ObamaCare. In \nfact, under ObamaCare, there was almost no attention paid to trying to \nmake coverage more affordable. The focus was on expanding coverage, an \nadmirable goal but one that ignored affordability almost entirely. We \nnow know ObamaCare was based, the vote in favor of and the public \nsupport, such as it is for ObamaCare, was based on a litany of what has \nnow proven to be broken promises. The promise that if someone likes \nwhat they have, they can keep it, we know that is not true. More and \nmore employers are dropping their employer-provided coverage for their \nemployees.\n  The President himself said a family of four would actually see their \npremiums reduced an average of $2,500 a year. What has happened? \nPremiums continue to go up, roughly at the rate of 10 percent a year.\n  The President said, and I heard my colleague from Maryland just say, \nObamaCare cuts the deficit. How they can spend $2.5 trillion and take \n$\\1/2\\ trillion more from Medicare, an already fragile, unsustainable \nprogram--unless we fix it--and that cuts the deficit is, I think, \nbeyond the understanding of most Americans. Certainly, it is beyond \nmine.\n  I would like to ask my colleague this question: What we know is that \nnow the Supreme Court has decided the constitutionality of ObamaCare. \nThe Supreme Court has said--and under our system of government it is \nthe Supreme Court that is the final word on these matters. It said the \nonly way ObamaCare could be constitutional is for the individual \nmandate to be considered a tax--a tax. Indeed, it is a tax, a broad-\nbased tax on the middle class.\n  I want to know how many votes in the House, how many of our \ncolleagues in the Senate would have voted for ObamaCare if it had been \ncalled what it is, a middle-class tax increase--a middle-class tax \nincrease. I think it is important to have a vote in the House today, \nand I think it is important to have a vote in the Senate, as Senator \nMcConnell has proposed to do, to see whether, based on the fact that \nthe Supreme Court has finally decided this is a tax on the middle \nclass, whether it would enjoy the support across the aisle it did in \n2009 and 2010.\n  But I wish to talk a moment more about taxes and indeed the \nchallenges that face small businesses and working families across the \ncountry and the need for the Senate to stop contributing to the class \nwarfare rhetoric and gamesmanship that seems to encompass us 118 days \nnow before the general election and the importance of actually \naddressing taxes in a constructive manner, in a way that will helpfully \nget our economy growing again.\n  To that end, it is my sincere hope that the majority leader will \nallow an open amendment process on this piece of legislation and allow \nit to go forward and give Senators the opportunity to offer ideas about \nhow to improve this legislation and help small business job creation.\n  What we do know for a fact is that unless Congress and the President \nact before December 31, 2012, American taxpayers will face the single \nlargest tax increase in American history. Why is that? Because the tax \nprovisions we passed in 2001 and 2003 and then again in 2010, under \nPresident Obama, will expire at the end of this year.\n  For example, in less than 6 months, the highest individual tax \nbracket will rise from 35 percent to just under 40 percent. I think it \nis important for everyone to realize we are just talking about Federal \ntaxes. We are not talking about State taxes or local taxes. Many \nStates--thank goodness not Texas but many States--have a State income \ntax which is added to the Federal tax burden. Of course, virtually \neveryone in the country pays some form of sales tax.\n  We need to think about, when we add to the tax burden of the American \npeople, what that means in terms of their cumulative tax burden, \nincluding Federal, State, and local taxes.\n  Unless Congress acts, people in the lowest tax bracket will see a 50-\npercent tax increase. Indeed, the marriage penalty will increase, the \nchild credit will be cut in half, and taxes on capital gains and \ndividends will increase.\n  Why are lower taxes on capital gains and dividends important? Well, \non capital gains it is important because we want to incentivize people \nto make long-term investments, to create jobs.\n  Why is the lower dividend rate important? Many seniors who are \nretired depend on dividend income from their retirement funds in order \nto help pay their cost of living.\n  The bottom line is unless Congress and the President act before \nDecember 31--and I submit it is important to act sooner rather than \nlater to send a signal to the markets and job creators about their tax \nburden on January 1--every taxpayer in the country will pay higher \ntaxes.\n  Unfortunately, instead of engaging in a serious manner on this issue, \nthe President earlier this week reverted to his old playbook of class \nwarfare and gamesmanship. He advocated again another policy which has \nfailed to pass the laugh test, if you think about it. The President \npreviously proposed the so-called Buffet rule--named for Warren \nBuffet--and said if we pass the Buffet rule and raise taxes, our \nproblems would all be solved.\n  Do you know how much revenue would be generated by the Buffet rule if \nit passed? It would be enough revenues to run the Federal Government \nfor 11 hours--less than half a day.\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\n  Well, I have to admit the President's recent announcement that he \nwants to raise taxes on small businesses has left me scratching my \nhead. I remember back in 2010, when President Obama said raising taxes \nduring a fragile economic recovery ``would have been a blow to our \neconomy.'' That is what President Obama said in 2010. But in 2012, he \nseems to be singing an entirely different tune. At the time, in 2010, \neconomic growth was roughly 3.1 percent. That is when President Obama \nsaid raising taxes would be a blow to our economy. Do you know what the \neconomic growth numbers are today? Our economy is growing at roughly 2 \npercent of GDP, gross domestic product. Instead of 3.1 percent, it is \ngrowing even slower right now.\n  Of course, as I mentioned, this tax increase the President and the \nmajority leader are proposing is on top of the ObamaCare taxes. It is \nnot just the individual mandate I alluded to earlier that will penalize \npeople who don't buy government-approved health care, but that is on \ntop of approximately 20 different other tax increases that are part of \nthe ObamaCare legislation. Not only do these new taxes break the \nPresident's own pledge not to raise taxes on individuals who make less \nthan $200,000 a year or families making less than $250,000 a year, but \nit also creates barriers to new investment and job creation.\n  Recently I attended a meeting downstairs with Bob Zoellick, head of \nthe World Bank, and the president of the New York Federal Reserve \noffice--a gentleman whose name escapes me. The president of the Federal \nReserve in New York said: When talking with business people across the \ncountry, I ask them what is your attitude, your mood? Are you going to \ninvest or sit back on the sidelines? He said almost universally the \nmessage is: We are done. We are not doing anything else until \nWashington--in other words, Congress and the President--figure this \nout.\n  Who in their right mind would want to start a new business with the \nuncertainty as far as taxes are concerned, or the burdens that are \nimposed upon individuals and small businesses because of ObamaCare? I \nmentioned that in addition to what the Supreme Court found to be a \ntax--the individual mandate--ObamaCare includes a new 3.8-percent \nsurtax on capital gains, dividends, rents, and interest earned by many \ntaxpayers. This new surtax goes into effect next year, in 2013.\n  Another thing I found amazing in terms of the audacity of those who \nsupported ObamaCare in 2009 and early 2010 is that a lot of the taxes \nthat were included in the bill didn't go into effect until after this \nnext election. Isn't that an amazing coincidence?\n  Enacting this permanent tax hike was a mistake then, and it continues \nto be a mistake now. It will discourage savings and investment, reduce \nproductivity, and it will depress wages and the standard of living for \nmillions of Americans.\n  According to one nonprofit economic policy research and educational \norganization, a 2.9-percent tax increase would depress economic growth \nby 1.3 percent. You heard me a moment ago say our economy is growing \nroughly at 2 percent. This think tank says they estimate a 2.9-percent \ntax increase would depress economic growth by 1.3 percent, and it would \nreduce capital formation by 3.4 percent. Those are numbers that come \nout of, obviously, a think tank, but that means fewer jobs and a lower \nstandard of living for many Americans. The damage to job creation and \neconomic growth would be even greater from a 3.8-percent investment \ntax. You don't have to be an economist or a rocket scientist to figure \nout that higher taxes are going to depress economic activity. Indeed, \nit is all about incentives. If we create incentives for people to be \nproductive, work hard, and make investments, then they will respond. If \nwe raise the bar and make it more expensive and harder, they are going \nto do less of it. It is that simple.\n  Taxpayers, including small businesses, are already scheduled to get \nhit with the largest tax increase in history at the end of the year, as \nI have already mentioned.\n  I will close on this, as far as this subject is concerned: We know \nthe key to job creation is to grow the economy and allow small \nbusinesses to flourish, invest, and create jobs. That is what we are \nmissing now. Government has grown and grown and grown. It has spent \nmoney it didn't have under the stimulus bill passed early in the Obama \nadministration. Do you know what the projection was at that time that \nunemployment would be today if we passed this spending bill using \nborrowed money? The President's administration said unemployment would \nbe at 5.6 percent. Yet it continues to persist at over 8 percent. So we \nknow that obviously didn't work.\n  I believe it is important that we put into place an insurance policy \nagainst any Senate effort to increase taxes on small businesses. For \nthat reason, I have offered time after time a proposal that would \nrequire a supermajority to raise taxes on small businesses. The last \ntime I raised this proposal, when we considered the 2010 budget--which \nis actually the last time the Senate passed a budget, but that is \nanother subject altogether--the amendment passed with the support of 82 \nSenators, including 42 Democrats, many of whom still serve in the \nSenate.\n  Raising taxes on small businesses that represent the primary engine \nof job growth in this country is not the answer to getting our economy \nback on track.\n  I know about 400,000 small businesses in Texas that employ 4 million \npeople especially cannot afford to pay higher taxes, particularly at \nthis time. We know it is small businesses that create the vast majority \nof new jobs.\n  Given that the administration has said it is committed to creating \njobs, I am left wondering why they would want to increase taxes on \nthose we are depending upon to do just that. I know the millions of \nAmericans who remain out of work are wondering the same thing today.\n\n\n                          Voter Identification\n\n  Mr. President, I want to make a brief comment about the voter \nidentification debate. This is particularly important in my State, but \nit is important across the country, because many States have passed \ncommonsense voter identification laws to protect the integrity of the \nballot and prevent dilution of the vote for majority and minority \nmembers and everyone across the board, and to protect against voter \nfraud.\n  Yesterday Attorney General Holder spoke in Houston, TX, at a \ngathering of the NAACP. I am sorry to say his remarks were completely \ninappropriate and misleading. Mr. Holder knows--or he should know--that \nthe Texas law that requires a photo ID in order to cast a ballot will \nbe issued free of charge to any voter who asks for one--free of charge.\n  He conveniently ignores the fact that the Supreme Court of the United \nStates has previously--in an Indiana case--dispositively held that \nvoter ID laws are constitutional and necessary to protect the integrity \nof the vote. This is the low point of the Attorney General's remarks. \nHe once again defamed my State and our State legislature by equating \nour commonsense voter ID law with a poll tax.\n  By invoking the specter of Jim Crow racism, the Attorney General is \nplaying the lowest form of identity politics. Mr. Holder knows better. \nThis rhetoric is irresponsible and a disgrace to the office of the \nAttorney General. Shame on him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Growing the Economy\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today because \nof the good news I have heard recently, that the Senate is going to \nspend the next couple of weeks, maybe the whole month, talking about \ntax policy. I think that is very encouraging, because this is one of \nthe issues I was hoping we would deal with early on, when I got here \nlast year. And I am, quite frankly, surprised it has taken this much \ntime, a year and a half, to pivot to this issue. I am hopeful--I don't \nknow if it has been determined yet--but I am hopeful on this \nlegislation currently before the Senate, the minority will be given an \nopportunity\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\nto introduce ideas. I think that is important for this place to work \nwell.\n  I have read the history of this distinguished place and it only works \nwell, it only functions when the ideas of both sides are allowed to be \nheard. I know we can count votes here, and from time to time we may \nhave a chance to pass a few things, but when one is in the minority, as \nI am, it is harder to get ideas passed. But I would love to at least \nget a vote on some of these ideas we are hoping to push forward, and \nour hope is that will happen. So let's hope that works out.\n  What I want to remind us all about a little bit today is what our \ngoal is. We can't arrive at the right solutions if we don't know \nexactly what it is we are trying to get to. Our goal, I believe--and \nthere is a consensus now throughout this country, and it is actually \nsomething that unites both political parties--needs to be to grow the \neconomy. That is our goal, to grow the economy. And what will result \nfrom growing the economy is that good will happen for everybody.\n  How does the economy grow is the first fundamental question we have \nto answer. The economy grows when two things happen: either someone \nstarts a business or someone grows their existing business. That is \nwhat leads to economic growth. It is that simple. Someone starts a new \nbusiness because they think they can make money at it or someone goes \ninto their existing business and says, I think we can make more money, \nlet's grow this thing. That is how the economy grows.\n  So the issue before us here as Federal policymakers has to be what \ncan the Federal Government do to help that kind of growth. In essence, \nwhat the Federal Government can do is to encourage people and make it \neasier for people to either start a business or to grow their business. \nSo if that is our goal, then every time a measure comes before this \nbody--tax policy, regulatory policy--what we should ask ourselves is, \ndoes this make it easier or harder for someone to start a business? \nDoes it make it easier or harder for someone to grow an existing \nbusiness? Does this measure make it easier or harder for the economy to \ngrow? Because if we are indeed united by this goal of growing the \neconomy, that should be the measure of anything we take on. And it is \nthrough that lens that I want to examine some of what we are talking \nabout right now. Because it seems to me, at least in some of the \npolicies I have heard proposed this week, that maybe some folks have \nthe goal wrong. Because if we closely examine some of these policies, \nit sounds as if the goal is, let's take a limited economy that isn't \ngrowing and let's divide it. And primarily it sounds like, let's take \nthis limited economy that isn't growing and let's allow us to take \nmoney from people who are maybe making a little too much, give it to \nthe government, and the government can then spend it on behalf of \npeople who maybe aren't making enough.\n  I know that may sound appealing to the folks who are among those \nAmericans who aren't making enough money, but I want you to know \nsomething: It never works. That idea never works. Here is why it never \nworks. It actually never works because, first of all, the money doesn't \nget to you. When you give government money to spend, it invariably \ndoesn't usually spend it very well. In fact, when you give government \nmoney to spend, the people who end up getting that money are the people \nwho can afford to hire people to come to Washington and influence how \nthe money is spent. So sometimes the money never even gets to you, if \nin fact you allow the government to do this.\n  But it is more complicated than that. It can actually cost people \ntheir jobs, and here is why. How you create businesses or how you \nexpand an existing business is pretty straightforward. Someone is in \nbusiness, someone makes some money or gets a hold of some money and \nthey decide to take that money and invest it. They use the money they \nhave made and they reinvest it in their business so the business grows \nor they use the money they have made to start a brandnew business. This \nstuff works. This is how the American economy has grown and how we \nbecame the most prosperous people on Earth.\n  I know this works not just because I read about it in a magazine. I \nknow it works because I have lived it. As I have detailed and talked \nabout in the past on this floor, my father was a bartender. He worked \nat a hotel as a bartender. My mother had a lot of different jobs, but \nfor a while she worked as a maid in a hotel. The reason I talk about \nthis is to explain how and why my mom and dad had a job that paid them \nmoney to raise us and give us a chance to do all the things my siblings \nand I were able to do. Someone made some money, they took that money \nand opened up this hotel. That is why my parents had a job. They didn't \nhave a job because the President of the United States back in 1965 or \n1975 gave them a job. They had a job because someone who made money \ntook that money and used it to start a new business or to grow an \nexisting business and hire them. They also had a job because other \npeople who had money decided to use that money to go on vacation and \nthey came to Miami Beach or to Las Vegas, when I lived in Las Vegas, \nand they spent that money at these hotels.\n  The point is, people had money, and they either invested it or spent \nit. And that allowed a bartender and a maid--my mother and father--to \nraise my siblings and me and to give us opportunity. That was true in \nthe 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1970s, in the 1980s, in the 1990s, and \nit is still true. That is what is needed to grow this economy. And the \nproblem is, if we go after these people, if we go after the money they \nhave made and give it to the government, maybe they will decide not to \nopen that new business or maybe they will decide this is not the year \nto take that vacation or instead of taking the 5-day vacation, they \ntake the 3-day vacation. And you know who gets hurt? The bartender and \nthe maid and the people who work in these places. Because money has to \ngo somewhere. If you are taking it out of the hands of the people who \ninvest it and spend it, they can't invest it or spend it, and it is \npeople who are trying to make it--like my parents were--who get hurt by \nit.\n\n  So we have to get our goal right. Because if our goal is to grow the \neconomy, we don't have to call trick plays. What we can do at the \nFederal level to grow the economy is pretty straightforward. All we \nhave to do is talk to the people who grow the economy. If we go out and \ntalk to the people who have a great idea and are trying to start a \nbusiness, they will tell us what they are looking for. It is pretty \nstraightforward stuff: tax reform.\n  What do we mean by tax reform? Simple. We want a Tax Code that is \nstable, predictable, and affordable. Of course we have to have taxes. \nGovernment needs revenue to be able to pay for what we all expect from \ngovernment. But it has to be a predictable system and it has to be an \naffordable system. If taxes get too high, people may decide not to \ninvest it in this country or to leave it in the bank, and that doesn't \nhelp anybody. So the point is we need to have a Tax Code that is \nstable, predictable, and affordable.\n  We need regulations that are the same: stable, affordable, and \npredictable. Look, we need regulations; right? I want this water to be \nclean. I don't want the water to poison me. We don't want to walk out \non the street and breathe in air that will hurt us. There is a role for \nregulation. The problem is that most Federal regulations are set by \nbureaucrats who work for the government, and all they think about is \ncan this regulation maybe help. They do not think at all about the \nimpact of that regulation on businesses. That is not part of the \nequation. When they sit down and write a regulation, that is not part \nof the equation at all. So we end up having these regulations that may \nnot even help that much but hurt a lot; that help wipe out entire \nindustries, but the impact on helping the environment or whatever else \nis nebulous at best. So we have to change that.\n  That is why we need to pass a law here like the REINS Act, which says \nany regulation that has an economic impact beyond a certain amount of \nmoney should have to be approved by elected people, who are \naccountable, who have to measure both the effectiveness of the \nregulation but also whether it is going to cost jobs or wipe out an \nindustry. Because that is important too. Protecting our industries and \nour sources of job creation is as important as some of these other \nthings we\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\nare trying to protect through regulations and they have to be balanced \nagainst one another. We do not want to simply be making decisions in a \nvacuum.\n  Along those lines, something that is both a tax and a regulation is \nObamaCare. Look, we have a health insurance problem in America. There \nis no denying that. But there are better ways to deal with it. The \nproblem is this bill that passed has created a tremendous amount of \nuncertainty. For example, it says if you have more than 50 full-time \nemployees, there are certain requirements you have to meet. So imagine \nif you are a company with 48 or 49 employees. This may not be the year \nto hire the 50th. And maybe you are going to be the 50th, but now you \ndon't get hired or, worse, maybe you will decide this is the year to \nturn all your employees into part-time employees. That is not good for \nthe workers. Yet that is the impact this law is having, not to mention \nthe fact it is a tax increase.\n  That is what the IRS does. The IRS collects taxes. And guess who you \nhave to prove you have insurance to. And not just any old insurance, \nbut insurance they deem to be acceptable. The IRS. Millions of \nAmericans now every year will have to prove to the IRS they have \ninsurance or they will owe the IRS money. That is a tax, and that is \nnot going to help job creation, especially if you are a small business.\n  I outlined this last week. Imagine a small business run by a husband \nand wife with two kids, and the business--not them, but their \nbusiness--makes $95,000 a year. It will cost them between $4,000 to \n$6,000 to buy health insurance. If they do not, they will owe the IRS \n$2,000. Tell me that is good for that business. Or imagine if you are \nthinking about going into business and you realize this is what is \ngoing to happen to you and you decide not to go into business. That is \nnot good for growth. That is why this law needs to be repealed and it \nneeds to be replaced.\n  Something else we need in this country is a pro-American energy \npolicy. Do people realize the American innovator has come up with this \ntechnology over the last 5 years that now has made us a very energy-\nrich country? I don't know if people fully understand how energy-rich \nAmerica is. If you want a small glimpse of what it can mean to our \nfuture, go to North Dakota. They are having a jobs boom. They can't \nfind enough people to work there.\n  Energy is important and we need to start behaving like an energy-rich \ncountry, with a true all-of-the-above strategy where the energies we \nchoose are decided by the marketplace and not by politicians. When \npoliticians decide which energy source to use, you know who wins? The \npeople with the best lobbyists. The people with the best lobby. The \npeople with the most political influence. That is how we got a \nSolyndra-type situation, where a company that was going to go bankrupt \ngot all this money--your tax dollars--and meanwhile America is sitting \non over 100-some-odd years of natural gas at our disposal and no \nconcise national energy policy to utilize it.\n  Let me tell you why energy matters. If we can get energy costs down \nand stable and predictable, manufacturing will start coming back to \nAmerica. That is one of the leading costs of manufacturing, energy. We \nare an energy-rich country. Some of those factories that closed, we can \nactually get them to come back here. Imagine what that would do for \neconomic growth, not to mention the fact that America could potentially \nnow begin to sell overseas as well, creating yet another industry and \nall the things that come with it.\n  How about free and fair trade? There is an emerging middle class all \nover the world now. One of the great things that has happened over the \nlast 20 years is that all over the world there are now people who a \ndecade ago were living in poverty and can now afford to buy the \nproducts we invent and build, people all over the world, by the way, \nwho can now afford to take vacations. And do you know where they want \nto come? To the United States of America. They want to come to Florida. \nThey also want to come here.\n\n  I think that is fantastic, that now there are millions of people all \nover the world who can afford to visit the United States and leave \ntheir money at our hotels, at our restaurants, and at our amusement \nparks. That creates jobs, that creates growth, free and fair trade, \nthat allows the American people to build things we can sell overseas to \nother places and lowers the cost of buying certain things here.\n  Last year, we ratified the free trade agreement with Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea. We are already seeing the economic benefits of \nthat in south Florida. Imagine if we were able do that with more \ncountries in a free and fair way. It has to be fair.\n  One last thing we could probably do to help grow this economy is deal \nwith the long-term debt. And that is what it is, it is a long-term debt \nproblem that hovers all over all of this conversation and creates \nuncertainty. People are afraid--especially people with lots of money \nare afraid--to invest in the American economy because they look at this \ndebt problem, they look at this political process's inability to deal \nwith it, and they think, Do you know what. That country is destined for \nconfiscatory tax rates. They are going where Europe is going. We don't \nwant to invest in a country that is going to wind up like Europe in 5 \nyears. That is why we have to deal with the long-term debt, and the \nsooner the better.\n  To deal with the long-term debt, by the way, you have to deal with \nwhat is causing it. That is why it is so important we save Medicare. \nMedicare is a very important program. My mother is on Medicare. I would \nnever support anything that hurts my mother or people like her. But \npeople in my generation need to understand that if we want to keep \nMedicare the way it is for our parents and if we want Medicare to even \nexist when we retire, Medicare is going to have to look different for \nus, for 41-year-olds. We have to save Medicare. And to deal with the \nlong-term debt, we have to deal with that. That is what is driving part \nof the debt. That is not being driven by foreign aid, which is less \nthan 1 percent of our budget. The debt is not being driven by food \nstamp programs. The debt is not being driven by defense spending.\n  Look, if money is being misspent or wasted, it is never a good idea \nto do that. If there are ways to save money on foreign aid, we should \nsave it. If there are ways to save money in the food stamp program, we \nshould save it. If there are ways to save money in the defense budget, \nwe should save it. But that is not what is driving our long-term debt. \nTo pretend we are going to get 100 percent of our savings from 25 or 20 \npercent of our budget leads to the kind of catastrophic cuts we talk \nabout in this town, because no one wants to touch the big issues that \nhave to be dealt with.\n  What would happen if we did these six things? Let's say that \ntomorrow, overnight, magically these things happened: We got real tax \nreform, real regulatory reform, we repealed and replaced ObamaCare, we \nhad a pro-American energy strategy, we expanded free and fair trade, \nand we had a plan in place that began to deal with the long-term debt \nin a serious and sustainable way. Let me tell you what would happen: \nexplosive economic growth, primarily by the creation of jobs.\n  Do you know what more jobs means? It means, No. 1, more taxpayers. It \nmeans you can now generate revenue for government to pay for what we \nall want government to do, and you don't have to raise tax rates to do \nthat. It means you have more taxpayers who are now paying into the tax \nsystem who give you the revenue you need to bring the debt under \ncontrol. Everything gets easier if the economy grows. The debt gets \neasier, our budgets get easier.\n  Jobs also mean more customers for your business. If someone is \nunemployed, it is hard for them to spend money. It is hard for them to \nbuy a house, much less the things that go in it. It is hard for them to \ntake vacations. More jobs means more stability for your business or for \nthe place you work in. More jobs means more taxpayers, it means more \ncustomers for your business. And, by the way, it means a more stable \nsociety, a place where hard work can earn them a decent wage so they \ncan save money for their kids' college, so they can save money for \ntheir retirement, so they can buy a home and furnish it, so they can \nafford to take a couple weeks vacation a year with their families. \nMillions of Americans can't do that anymore.\n  Millions of Americans have done everything we have asked of them. \nThey\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\nwent to school, they graduated. They were told if they did that, they \ncould find a job that paid them a decent wage, and they are struggling \nto do that now.\n  By the way, all of the strategies for growth aren't at the Federal \nlevel. It is important that States take on the issue of education \nreform. It is important for us as parents to be honest with our kids. \nIn the 21st century, it is going to be hard to find a job if all you \nhave is a high school diploma. It is that simple.\n  If you look at the unemployment rate between people who have a \ncollege degree or a post-high school degree and those who don't, it is \nstunning. It is stunning. If you don't have more than a high school \neducation, you are going to struggle to succeed in this new century. We \nhave to let our kids understand that. It is our job as parents and as a \ncommunity to do that.\n  By the way, it is important for us to work with the States, as I \noutlined earlier, to modernize our education system. Why have we \nstigmatized career education? Why can't we graduate kids from high \nschool with both a diploma and an industry certification and a career? \nWe need to begin to teach our kids to compete with the world, not just \nwith other States. These are other things that have to happen as well.\n  The point I wanted to drive today is we need to remind ourselves of \nwhat the goal is here. The goal is growth. The goal is, What can we do \nat the Federal level to help grow the economy? Ultimately, the economy \ngrows because of the private sector, because someone who has made some \nmoney takes that money and invests it by starting a new business or by \ngrowing their existing business. We should find ways to make that \neasier and encourage people to do that. That has to be our goal. It \ndoesn't require trick plays; it doesn't require some complicated new \ngimmick. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. The American people \nhaven't run out of good ideas. Americans haven't forgotten how to start \nbusinesses or even entire new industries. Even as I speak to you right \nnow, I am 100 percent convinced that within walking distance of this \nbuilding there is someone somewhere drawing up the great next American \ncompany business plan on the back of a napkin or a scrap piece of \npaper. And if we give them a chance to do it, they are going to do it.\n  We are still the same people we have always been. There is nothing \nwrong with the American people. They just need a little help from their \ngovernment. I think if we get our goals right around here, we can do a \nfew simple but important things that allow Americans to do, once again, \nwhat we do better than any country or any people in the history of the \nworld, and that is create prosperity and create opportunity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, before I get into the substance of my \nremarks, I heard the concluding remarks of my colleague, Senator Rubio, \ntalking about ideas and education and small business growth.\n  I agree with his basic concept that we are still the greatest country \nin the world, that we encourage entrepreneurs and people with great \nideas, that education means a great deal to making that happen; that no \nother country inspires young people, middle-aged people, even older \npeople to start new businesses. I hope it means he is going to vote for \nthe proposal that is now before us. Because what this proposal does is \ntake that young person within walking distance of Washington, DC, who \nhas a great idea and, once they start a business, allows them to get \nthat business to move more quickly. There are lots of those businesses, \nand probably some within Washington, DC, as well. So I hope my \ncolleague from Florida will vote for our Small Business Jobs and Tax \nRelief Act.\n  The proposal will spur economic growth. It will create nearly 1 \nmillion new jobs in this country. If my Republican colleagues care \nabout small business in America, they would work with us to pass this \ncommonsense bill immediately instead of playing procedural games that \nare thinly veiled attempts to block these tax cuts that spur hiring. \nThe bill is based on bipartisan ideas that have traditionally enjoyed \nRepublican support, yet they are obstructing their passage. Why are our \nRepublican colleagues changing their tune? The only explanation is that \nRepublicans continue to block proposals that will help create jobs and \nspur our economic recovery for their own political gain.\n  This is a simple proposal. It is a smart proposal. It is a tax cut \nproposal. In my home State of New York, small businesses from \nCattaraugus to Clinton County are poised to grow and make the jump to \nthe next level. These business owners know the economy is slowly \nturning a corner, but we are not there yet to full unthrottled growth, \nso they are looking for Congress to do more--not less--to spur hiring.\n  This initiative is aimed at the small businesses that are truly the \nlifeblood of our Nation, and we need to help them jumpstart expansion \nplans this year. There is simply no time to waste.\n  There is a business in Cortland, NY, central New York, called \nPrecision Eforming. It is a great small business that would use this \ntax cut to buy a new piece of equipment called a Dipcoater to help the \ncompany create high-end acoustics such as hearing aids. With the \nDipcoater, Precision Eforming will increase yield and need to hire new \nemployees.\n  There are stories like this throughout my State. Napoleon Engineering \nServices, a new ball-bearing plant in Olean, hopes to hire more \nemployees and will purchase new equipment for its growing business. \nQuinlan's Pharmacy and Medical Supply in Livingston County wants to add \nan additional location in Schuyler County. In Staten Island, the owner \nof a small restaurant chain recently told me this proposal could help \nhim expand to additional locations.\n  Simply put, this bill makes equipment purchases and capital \nimprovements for thousands of small businesses cheaper, and, by doing \nthat, provides a real jolt to the economy. In fact, it is estimated \nthat every $1 of tax cuts devoted to writing off the cost of a \nbusiness's purchases generates about $9 of GDP growth. Let me repeat \nthat. One dollar of tax cuts devoted to writing off the cost of a \nbusiness's purchases generates nine times that in GDP growth. Why \nwouldn't we do it? Economists of every stripe will tell you that hiring \nincentives like the ones in this bill are the best ways to kick-start \nan economy and get people back to work. Why wouldn't we do it?\n  In fact, a new nonpartisan analysis of the proposal before us has \ndetermined it will create nearly 1 million jobs this year. Look at your \nState: 22,000 in Washington State, 10,000 in Nebraska, 11,000 in Iowa, \n40,000 in Pennsylvania, 63,000 in my home State of New York, 77,000 in \nTexas. Huge numbers of new jobs will be created by this proposal. Why \nwon't our colleagues move forward on it?\n  It is estimated that 93,000 jobs will be added to the construction \nindustry, 61,000 new jobs added to manufacturing. The report concludes \nthat the proposal's impact would be felt across every State and in a \nrange of industries, with a significant jump in employment in \nconstruction and manufacturing. The proposal is targeted toward the \nmom-and-pop Main Street businesses that will benefit most from this \nrelief.\n  You want to talk about job creators? You want to help job creators? \nWell, these small business owners are real job creators and they are \nthe ones who make this country run. They come in early, they stay late, \nthey work hard, and they deserve a tax break.\n  Here lies an important contrast between what we are proposing and a \ndifferent tax cut proposal that the House Republicans have passed. The \nHouse Republican proposal is neither focused on true small business nor \ndoes it make the tax cut dependent on a company doing any hiring at \nall. Our proposal rewards actual job creation by true small businesses, \nrather than giving more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires who \nmay not create a single job. They have profits; they get a cut in their \ntaxes for their profits even if they fire people. Does that\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\nmake any sense? Our bill's commonsense measures have had broad \nbipartisan support. There is no reason Democrats and Republicans alike \nshould not support them now. The relief in this bill would be a grand \nslam for our economy as a whole. It puts more people to work, expedites \nthe expansion of successful small bills throughout the country, expands \nbusinesses to new communities, and keeps money flowing through local \neconomies. For too many business owners, this relief simply cannot \nwait. Let's get this bill to the President's desk and get our business \nowners started on the developments that will propel them into the next \ndecade.\n\n  Once we pass this bill, we must work together to give certainty to \nAmerican families that they will not see a mass tax hike at the end of \nthe year. We should all agree our small businesses deserve tax cuts and \na Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act that will help them hire \nworkers. We should all agree no middle-class families should face a tax \nincrease at the end of the year. Let's take care of our areas of \nagreement and then we can turn to debate on whether our country can \nafford to give more tax breaks to the wealthiest 2 percent.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, as chair of the Small Business \nCommittee of the Senate, I am pleased to come to the floor to give some \nsupporting remarks for Senator Schumer's small business tax reduction \nbill. The bill will invest, basically, $20 billion to the bottom line \nof small businesses--owners of businesses that are dynamic and that are \ngrowing. I would like to make that distinction. It is not all small \nbusiness that will get tax relief. It is small businesses that are \ndynamic and growing and adding employees or increasing wages.\n  The bill is smartly and narrowly targeted to motivate and to reward \nthose small businesses, a subgroup of the 28 million small businesses \nthat exist in the country today, many of which are in the Senator's \nState, Minnesota, that has some very high-growth, high-potential small \nbusiness development in the medical field, I understand. In my State, \nit would be those businesses that are growing because of the increased \ndemand for energy and the new technologies that are coming out, not \nonly for oil and gas production, which is important, but also other \nsources of energy. In Ohio and Michigan, it could be those small \nbusiness suppliers that are rallying around the emerging and \nstrengthening automobile industry, which President Obama and the \nDemocratic Members of this Congress had so much to do with salvaging.\n  Our business is not just throwing money against the wind. It is \ntaking precious taxpayer dollars and targeting them to those businesses \nthat are growing. That is why, as the chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, I strongly endorse Senator Schumer's proposal over the \nproposal that came from the House of Representatives.\n  The House of Representatives' bill basically is taking $40 billion \nthat we do not have--we do not have the $20 billion either but one is \nhalf the cost--taking $40 billion and throwing it at businesses, 50 \npercent of which, according to the CBO study, will accrue to the \nhighest income earners in the country--over $1 million. It is not \ntargeted. It is just about business profits, which are important. I \nknow businesses are in business to make profits. I have no problem with \nthat. We want our businesses to be profitable. But the Schumer \nproposal, relative to the Cantor proposal, is targeted to those \nbusinesses making a profit and reinvesting it in the business to grow--\nhiring workers and putting behind this recession we are coming out of--\na recession because of poor policies of previous administrations--\ncoming out of this recession to help grow the economy.\n  We can give tax cuts in a variety of different ways. If we had all \nthe money in the world, maybe we could afford to do both, but we are \nnot that fortunate. We have to make choices. That is what we do on the \nfloor of this Senate every day, make choices, make distinctions between \nwise ways to spend money and poor ways to spend money.\n  I suggest, if we have $20 billion to spend, if everybody agrees we \nhave at least that, that the Schumer approach is much more efficient, \nwill be much more effective, will get much more bang for the buck than \nthe Cantor approach.\n  I commend Senator Schumer for putting his bill on the floor, the \nSmall Business Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. According to \nthe National Economic Council, the tax credit would provide $20 billion \nin direct tax relief for businesses that hire new workers or increase \nwages, and it could encourage an additional $200 to $300 billion in new \nwages and jobs this year.\n  This tax credit, as I said, makes sense. It will help create jobs. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office report released last year, \nthe CBO report from November of 2011, policies that have the largest \neffect on output and employment per dollar of cost in 2012 and 2013 are \nthe ones that would reduce the marginal cost of hiring. That is exactly \nwhat the Schumer bill does.\n  Firms that make capital investments in 2012 would be allowed to \ndeduct the full value of the investment on their 2012 return. We know \nthis kind of targeted tax cut can spark demand that small businesses \nhave been clamoring for. This tax cut is an extension of a tax \nprovision that expires in 2011 and had yielded an estimated $50 billion \nin added investments and lowered the average cost of capital for \nbusiness investment by over 75 percent, according to the National \nCouncil of Economic Advisers.\n  We have had a lot of experience in the Small Business Committee and \nin the Finance Committee, on which Senator Schumer serves, in the last \ncouple years designing and implementing tax cuts for the middle class, \ntax cuts for the job creators. Again, if we look very objectively, \nconsidering the Schumer proposal costs half as much as the Cantor \nproposal and will probably do three times if not four times better, it \nis a no-brainer which one is more effective; that is, the Schumer \nproposal.\n  Our hope is if Senators come to the floor and begin to look more \ncarefully at the Schumer proposal versus the proposal that came from \nthe House, they will realize the benefit of the Schumer approach and \ngive it the 60 votes we need to move it forward and will reject the \nCantor approach as being too expensive relative to the other option \nthat is on the table and much less effective. In the event the Senate \ndecides to do neither, which might happen because there have been \nlogjams around here for a while now, I have to say I was very proud of \nmy colleagues Barbara Boxer and Jim Inhofe for working to break the \nlogjams in a spectacular way just 2 weeks ago on the Senate floor when \nthey finally negotiated a 2-year transportation bill, the flood \ninsurance bill, the RESTORE Act, and the student loan reduction bill, \nwhich is the remarkable work the Congress did last week.\n\n  In the event the Cantor proposal fails and the Schumer proposal \nfails, I am hoping to offer an amendment that the leadership is \nconsidering now that was put together by the Snowe staff and the \nLandrieu staff over the course of the last several weeks. The only name \non this right now is mine, but it has been put together by a variety of \nSenators who have been working across the aisle for months on items \nthat are very important to the small business community.\n  Again, we have 28 million small businesses in America; 22 million of \nthem are single employers. In other words, they are self-employed \nprofessionals who are doctors, lawyers, landscape architects, \narchitects, other service providers, network professionals, and IT \nprofessionals who are working in their own business and employ \nthemselves. They are very valuable. We encourage entrepreneurship in \nAmerica. We may have more entrepreneurs per capita than any place in \nthe world. We believe in it and we are excited.\n  We are also excited for our businesses that start with two or three \nemployees, and before we know it they have 200 or 300 employees. Then, \nwhen we close our eyes and open them, they have 2,000 employees. That \nis very exciting. We\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\ncall them the gazelles. We look for accelerating opportunities.\n  As I said, we put this package together with the significant input of \nSenator Snowe and her staff, along with input from Senator Kerry, who \nhas been an extraordinary leader in this way. Senator Merkley, Senator \nCardin, and a list of other Senators whom I am going to refer to have \nbeen working for years on some of these issues. I wish to make sure I \ngive them the credit for these issues.\n  First in our package is the very popular and very effective 100-\npercent exclusion of capital gains for investments in small businesses. \nIt was part of the small business tax extenders package. President \nObama has recommended this and Senator Kerry is the lead sponsor, along \nwith Senator Snowe, on the Finance Committee.\n  Let me give a little background. Until 2009, noncorporate taxpayers \nwere allowed to exclude 50 percent of the gain from the sale of the \nstock of a qualified small business if taxpayers held the stock for 5 \nyears. The Recovery Act increased the 50 percent to 75 percent and the \nSmall Business Act of 2010 subsequently increased it to 100 percent. As \nof January this year, it was reverted down to 50 percent and startup \ninvestments are no longer entitled to the preferred capital gain \ntreatment.\n  Our proposal would basically take this up to 100 percent exclusion \nfrom the sale of capital gains that noncorporate taxpayers purchased in \n2012 and 2013 and hold for 5 years. It has bipartisan support. As I \nsaid, Senator Kerry has been the lead advocate. Senator Snowe has \nworked side by side with him, and along with Senator Moran, Senator \nWarner, Senator Coons, and Senator Rubio have all called for this \nprovision to be permanent. I wish we could make it permanent. This bill \nwill not make it permanent, but we will extend it for another year and \na half.\n  According to the Kauffman Foundation paper published earlier this \nyear--and the Kauffman Foundation, for those who don't know, is the \nleading think tank. It is not political at all. It is just a middle-of-\nthe-road, well-respected think tank on small business development. They \npublished a paper earlier this year, the 100-percent exclusion ``boosts \nthe after-tax returns on such investments in startups and should induce \nsubstantial levels of new investments in startup firms.'' They further \nestimate that making this provision permanent would increase risky \ninvestments by, conservatively, 50 percent more than the overall cost \nof the provision. So they are supporting this provision very strongly \nand would like to see it permanent, but we can only afford in this \npackage to have it for the next year as we again build our way out of \nthis recession.\n  I guess, from a conservative point of view, one of the good things \nabout this provision--after we vote on the Schumer proposal and the \nCantor proposal--it only scores at $4 billion. We get a tremendous \nbenefit for a very small investment of taxpayer money, relatively \nspeaking. Not that $4 billion is chump change, but compared to the $20 \nbillion we are considering for the Schumer package and the $40 billion \nfor the Cantor package, we think we can take that $4 billion and, \nsimilar to yeast, make it stretch and grow to affect a lot of people \nand to spur a lot of investment.\n  The next provision is the small business tax extenders, the increased \ndeduction for startup expenditures. Again, this has been a Snowe and \nMerkley initiative. I think Senator Merkley has truly stood up to fight \nfor this.\n  Under current law, taxpayers can elect to deduct up to $5,000 of \nstartup expenditures in the taxable year in which they start a trade or \nbusiness. The $5,000 is reduced--but not below zero--by the amount by \nwhich the startup costs exceed $50,000.\n  Examples of potential startup costs: studies of potential markets, \nproducts, labor markets or transportation systems; advertisements for \nthe opening of a new business, et cetera; compensation for consultants \nwho help get one's business started.\n  The Small Business Jobs Act temporarily increased the amount of the \nstartup expenditures entrepreneurs could deduct from their taxes in \n2010 from $5,000 to $10,000, with a phaseout threshold of $60,000. \nSenator Merkley fought to have this provision in the Small Business \nJobs Act. This proposal has been repeatedly endorsed by the National \nAssociation for the Self-Employed and the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses.\n  As part of his ``Startup America'' legislative agenda, President \nObama has called for making this permanent. Again, my amendment doesn't \nmake it permanent, but it does make it effective through 2013.\n  According to a Kauffman Foundation survey, on average, new firms \ninject about $80,000 into their businesses during the first year of \noperation. The vast majority of small business owners--between 80 \npercent and 90 percent--also invest significant amounts of their own \nmoney. I wish to underscore this. The way this amendment came together \nis we conducted in the Small Business Committee--and had very good \nturnout--about three or four high-level roundtables, where instead of \njust having 2 or 3 people testify, we had 20 people at a roundtable \nshow up. For 2 hours, in a very informal setting, they were answering \nquestions, such as: What is the best thing we could do to help you now? \nWhat are the barriers to growth? What does a healthy ecosystem for \nsmall business look like and what could we do to strengthen and make \nhealthier that ecosystem in America? That is where these ideas came \nfrom.\n\n  Of course, Senator Merkley picked up on some of this and understood. \nThe Kauffman Foundation was there. They said that even though I have \ntalked a lot on the Senate floor about how small businesses need to \nborrow money--and many do--when they start a company, they don't want \nto borrow money unless they absolutely have to because the chances of \nit not working are pretty significant. Most new startups fail, and so \npeople do not want to go into debt unless they have to or unless they \nare a little bit more sure their idea is going to work.\n  The benefit of this proposal is that we are actually rewarding the \nrisk-takers who are digging into their savings and taking second \nmortgages out on their homes and putting some of their other savings at \nrisk behind their idea. What we are saying is if they do that, we will \ngive a significant tax break, considering it costs about $88,000 to \nstart an average business. So this is targeted to those risk-takers. It \nis not just taking money out of the Treasury and throwing it at all \nsmall businesses. It is taking that money--and this is only $4 billion \ntotal--and saying: Ok. Let's target it to those individuals who are \nputting their lives on the line. They are putting their livelihood on \nthe line and their future on the line. What can we do to support them? \nI am a very big believer in this provision, and I thank Senator Merkley \nfor bringing it to us.\n  I see Senator Casey and Senator Shaheen are on the Senate floor to \nspeak and that my time has expired. Since I am going to be on the floor \nmost of the afternoon explaining this amendment, I would be happy to \nyield the floor.\n  I see Senator Sessions is here and ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCasey speak for 10 minutes, Senator Sessions for the next 5 or 10 \nminutes and Senator Shaheen for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, if the Senator would make that 10 \nminutes, I think that will be fine.\n  Mrs. LANDRIEU. I will amend that to 10 minutes each in the order of \nSenator Casey, Senator Sessions, and Senator Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wish to commend the senior Senator from \nLouisiana not only for her work on this legislation but for her many \nyears laboring in the vineyard, so to speak, on small business issues \nand job-creation strategies to help our small business owners across \nthe United States.\n  I rise to speak about this legislation as well because when I go to \nPennsylvania and travel across our State, I get two basic messages from \nthe people of our State. They are very clear. They say two things: \nFirst, work on job creation. Put your time into putting in place ways \nto create and incentivize the creation of jobs. The second message is \nwork together and get things\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\ndone. Work with people in both parties to move a strategy forward to \ncreate jobs.\n  I think this legislation does both. It is focused on creating jobs, \nespecially as it relates to our small business owners and their workers \nand their communities, but it also is a way to bring Democrats and \nRepublicans together to create jobs. The Small Business Jobs and Tax \nRelief Act will, indeed, help small businesses hire people by reducing \nthe cost to small firms of bringing on a new worker or increasing their \nhours or pay. The economics of this are clear and compelling. By \nproviding small businesses with new incentives to hire, we can create \njobs and bolster economic recovery.\n  Small businesses are at the center of the economy of the United \nStates and are vital to our recovery. I know in Pennsylvania there are \nnearly 250,000 small businesses. Four out of every five firms in the \nState are small businesses. This legislation is commonsense legislation \nand I hope will have strong bipartisan support when we vote on the bill \nitself.\n  It includes a business payroll tax incentive similar to legislation I \nintroduced back in the year 2010 that will make it easier for small \nbusinesses to grow and to encourage economic growth throughout the \ncountry. It will give businesses a 10-percent income tax credit on new \npayroll for hiring new workers or increasing employee wages. It is, in \nfact, targeted legislation. It is targeted to small business owners. It \nis because it is capped at $500,000 per firm or 10 percent of a payroll \nincrease of $5 million.\n\n  In addition to being targeted, it is timely. It will be available \nimmediately for any new hires or increased wages for the remainder of \n2012.\n  Thirdly, it is very effective. The Congressional Budget Office, known \naround here by the acronym CBO, said a tax credit based on increased \npayroll would create the most jobs and have the greatest positive \nimpact on America's gross domestic product when compared to other job \ncreation policies that have been proposed. Under this legislation small \nbusinesses that hire a new worker would, on average, see more than \n$4,000 in tax savings per worker hired. That is a substantial help to a \nsmall firm, and people can just do the math as they hire more than one \nperson. That is a smart step in the right direction to help these small \nbusinesses themselves as well as boost job creation throughout our \ncountry.\n  As the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, our committee just \nproduced a report recently--I know my colleagues can't see all the \nlettering on this report I am holding, but it is a very simple report \nthat is just a couple of pages--outlining in very clear fashion the \nimpact that small businesses have on our economy in terms of the \npredominance of small businesses when we consider businesses across the \nboard. The name of the report is ``Tax Incentives for Small Business \nHiring and Investment: Strengthening the Backbone of the Economy.'' In \nfact, that is the truth. The backbone of the American economy is our \nsmall business sector.\n  The report finds that enacting a tax credit for businesses that hire \nadditional workers or increase the hours and wages of existing \nemployees will help both sustain and accelerate the recovery. Across \nthe Nation, 79 percent of business establishments are either single-\nestablishment businesses with fewer than 100 employees or are parts of \nmulti-establishment companies with total employment of under 100 \nemployees.\n  Small businesses are responsible for more hiring in the U.S. economy \nthan medium-sized or large businesses. As the labor market has begun to \nrecover, small businesses have led the way again and again. If we look \nat the time period of February 2010 to February 2012, small \nestablishments were responsible for 46 percent of the hires versus 34 \npercent for medium-sized businesses and 20 percent for large \nestablishments.\n  This is a critical point: Small firms accounted for nearly half of \nthe hiring from early 2010 to early 2012. Small businesses truly are \nthe engines that power our economy.\n  The recent monthly unemployment reports, which show job growth at a \nslower pace than earlier in the year, underscore the need to provide \nnew incentives to hire and invest in businesses. Many small firms want \nto hire more workers, and they also want to increase hours. This \nlegislation will help them do that.\n  In addition to the payroll tax credit, the legislation will extend \nthe 100 percent depreciation deduction for major purchases through the \nend of 2012 so that businesses that want to make a big investment--a \nnew building, a new significant piece of equipment--can get the benefit \nof that this year. An extension of this business expensing would reduce \nthe cost of investment and promote economic growth.\n  So, in summary, the Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act would help \ncreate jobs and strengthen the economy and move our recovery forward. \nThese are objectives we all share. I hope we can move forward in a \nbipartisan manner to pass this legislation because, in the end, it \nmeets that two-part test my constituents give to me every day; that is, \nthey want me to do everything I can to help create jobs, and they want \nme to do it in a bipartisan way. This legislation, in fact, does this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this afternoon the House of \nRepresentatives voted 244 to 185 to repeal the President's health care \nlaw, the Affordable Care Act. It was a bipartisan vote. A number of \nDemocrats voted in support of the law, although not as many as voted \noriginally to pass it, because a lot of the Democrats, even those who \nvoted against it, got shellacked in the last election, and it was a \npretty rough, intense debate.\n  The American people never felt comfortable with this legislation. I \nbelieve it will be repealed. I do not believe it will be implemented. \nThe reason is, whether one likes it or not, we simply do not have the \nmoney.\n  I wish to talk about that today. I am the ranking Republican on the \nBudget Committee, and I wish to share some thoughts with my colleagues \nas we wrestle with what to do on health care and how to undo the \nlegislation that passed by the narrowest single margin in this Senate \non Christmas Eve and was based on false accounting.\n  President Obama promised, before a joint session of Congress in 2009, \nto spend $900 billion over 10 years on the law. He said:\n\n       Now, add it all up, and the plan I'm proposing will cost \n     around $900 billion over 10 years.\n\n  $900 billion is a lot of money. It is almost twice the defense \nbudget.\n  The President went on to say in support of this health care \nlegislation that it would reduce the debt of the United States. We are \ngoing to add all of these new people to the insurance rolls, and it is \ngoing to pay for itself and reduce the debt. No one really believed \nthat, but that is what the arguments were and the representations that \nwere made.\n  But once we add up all the different spending provisions in the \nhealth care law, including closing the doughnut hole, implementation \ncosts, including all of those IRS agents and other spending in the \nlegislation, the total gross spending for the law over the 2010-2019 \nperiod--the 10-year budget window used at the time it was enacted--was \nactually $1.4 trillion. I will just show this to my colleagues with \nthis chart because it is very important. The President promised the \nAmerican people in his speech before a joint session of Congress that \nit would cost $900 billion. People knew it would cost more. But even \nthen, in the initial 10 year budget window, as he proposed, when we \ncount up all the spending in the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nof the legislation, including the enforcement mechanism through the IRS \nagents, closing the doughnut hole and other spending in the law outside \nof the major coverage provisions, the law spends $1.4 trillion over \nthat same 10 year period. That is almost 50 percent more right there. I \nthink that fact is indisputable. I will ask my colleagues to come tell \nme if I am wrong.\n  I would just note parenthetically, one of the most important \ncomponents of health care reform should have been resolving the doc \nfix. Under current\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nlaw, we are projected, without legislation that takes effect, to reduce \nMedicare payments to doctors by roughly 30 percent by the end of this \nyear.\n  At the time the health care law passed, the cost of a permanent doc \nfix added up to about $200 billion to $250 billion over a 10 year \nperiod. Democrats originally included the doc fix in earlier drafts of \nthe bill. But in the end when they looked at the numbers, if they \nincluded the doc fix--which is critical and needs to be fixed \npermanently; not continuing to hang out there every year and to be \nfixed by borrowed money--then the bill couldn't have continued in \nsurplus. In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it \nwouldn't continue to be paid for as the President was saying. So they \njust didn't do it. They just decided they wouldn't fix one of the most \nimportant issues in health care, and it remains that way today.\n\n  So, as I work through this, we are using nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office numbers.\n  Most of the major spending provisions in the law, as our colleagues \nshould know, do not take effect until 2014. So the true 10-year score \nshould be 2014 through 2023. That is the 10-year window of full \nimplementation. How much will the bill cost then? Each year it goes up \nbecause until 2014 we don't really see a 10-year full cost of the \nlegislation.\n  So what Democrats did was--and the President deliberately did, with \nhelp from his OMB Director, Mr. Peter Orszag--they manipulated CBO's \nscoring conventions. In the initial 10 year budget window they only \nincluded 6 years of spending on the major coverage provisions so that \nCBO would appear to score it over 10 years and say it would only cost \n$900 billion. That delay tactic was a pure budget gimmick. So we can \nlook at this chart and see that from 2014 through 2023, each year these \nred lines represent a situation in which we are closer and closer to 10 \nyears of full implementation and how much the cost will be.\n  So we go from 2014, and the next 10 years, as the bill is fully \nimplemented, and it will cost $2.6 trillion, almost three times the \namount the President promised it would cost.\n  So people ask: How do we get in a situation where we are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend? This kind of deception. A CEO in a \ncourt of law would go to jail if he proposed using that kind of \naccounting in his business practice and asked people to invest in his \nstock.\n  Analysis by my staff on the Budget Committee, based on the estimates \nand growth rates the Congressional Budget Office utilizes, finds that \nthe total spending under the law, including the other spending not \ndirectly related to the coverage provisions, will amount to at least \n$2.6 trillion, and could be much more.\n  Now, how did they get this done? It is a sad state of affairs, \nfrankly. The Obama administration, Mr. Orszag, the Office of Management \nand Budget Director who works directly for the President, also asserted \nthat ``health care reform is entitlement reform.'' In other words, this \nis going to fix an entitlement danger--the problems we have with \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid; entitlement programs, each one \nof which are growing at fast rates that are unsustainable, that will \nhead to bankruptcy in the years to come.\n  However, a simple comparison of the Federal Government's unfunded \nobligations for health care programs, before and after the health care \nlaw was enacted, clearly proves that the President's health care reform \nis not entitlement reform. It will not improve our long term spending \ntrajectory. It will not make these programs more viable in the future. \nIt did not put Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid on a sustainable \npath. Those programs remain disastrously unsustainable.\n  The President does not even talk about that any more. Here we are \nrunning into a reelection campaign and the country is facing a colossal \nfinancial danger from unsustainable debt, and the President would not \neven talk about it. He says things are getting along fine. I think it \nis a failure of leadership for him not to talk honestly with the \nAmerican people about our fiscal challenges.\n  So before the President's health care law was enacted, unfunded \nobligations for the Federal health care programs totaled $65 trillion \nover a 75-year period. That is how much we are going to run short in \nmoney to pay for the obligations we have incurred under Medicare and \nMedicaid--and some other programs, but those are the big ones. After \nthe recent passage of this health care bill, however, the figure, \naccording to my staff's estimates, has gone up to $82 trillion. So the \ndifference in the two numbers is what has been added to the unfunded \nliabilities of the United States. By the way, $17 trillion is 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes the unfunded liabilities of Social Security, which is $7 \ntrillion.\n  If my colleagues think I am in error about any of these numbers, I \nhope they will correct me. Perhaps I am, but we work hard to be \naccurate about them, and I don't believe I am off in any substantial \ndegree.\n  The bottom line is this: We cannot afford this law and the additional \nburden it places on our country's finances.\n  We must repeal this health care law in its entirety and replace it \nwith reforms that will improve our finances and reduce health care \ncosts for Americans, not drive up their costs. This bill, whether you \nlike it or not, will not be implemented. We simply do not have the \nmoney. At this time of high unemployment, and almost no growth, it will \nbe hard to do the things that are necessary, that we have to do: fix \nSocial Security, fix Medicare, provide for the common defense. Those \nthings have to be done. We have no money to pay for a $2.6 trillion \nprogram over a 10-year period. We have to save these programs we are \ncommitted to first.\n  The President's health care law will not be fully implemented until \n2014. It is not too late to stop it now. And we are going to have to, \nsimply because the finances of this country will not allow for it to go \nforward.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to come to the floor this \nafternoon to join my colleagues, Senator Landrieu and Senator Casey, in \ntalking about the importance of addressing some of the concerns that \nface small business.\n  Senator Casey said something that I think is very important. He said, \nwhen he goes around Pennsylvania, one of the things he hears from his \nconstituents is that they expect us to work together here in \nWashington, in the Senate, in Congress, to get things done for the \npeople of this country. I hear that from my constituents. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer hears that from her constituents. People throughout \nthe country expect us to work together, and they want to see us address \nthe economic challenges we are facing in this country.\n  Well, one of the best ways to address the fiscal issues we are facing \nis to be able to grow this economy. Nothing is more important to \ngrowing the economy, to creating jobs, than small businesses.\n  Senator Casey talked about the recent report that came out from his \ncongressional committee talking about the importance of small business. \nThe fact is that over the last decade, businesses with fewer than 250 \nemployees accounted for nearly 80 percent of all new hires. Economists \ntell us that about two-thirds of the jobs that are going to be needed \nto get us out of this recession are going to come from small \nbusinesses.\n  In New Hampshire, small businesses are particularly important. We are \na small business State. Over 95 percent of all New Hampshire companies \nhave fewer than 500 employees. About 85 percent of New Hampshire \ncompanies have fewer than 20 employees.\n  We have to look at how we can help those small businesses continue to \ngrow.\n  Yesterday afternoon, I met with a group of small business owners from \nNew Hampshire. They were all owners of construction companies. The \nconstruction industry in New Hampshire has been one of those industries \nthat has been hardest hit in our State, and these businesses still need \nhelp. These business owners need help if they are going to be able to \nkeep their businesses prospering and create jobs.\n  The legislation that is before us, the Small Business Jobs and Tax \nRelief Act, will help these small businesses.\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\n  The Landrieu amendment that I want to speak specifically to is \ncritical as we look at how we can provide additional help to these \nsmall businesses. I want to talk specifically to two provisions that \nare in the Landrieu amendment, also known as the SUCCESS Act.\n  The first one would deal with export issues. What I have learned, as \nI have been working with business and looking at how we can improve our \neconomy and help create jobs, is that giving those small businesses \naccess to international markets is critical.\n  What we know is that about 95 percent of the markets are outside of \nthe United States, and yet only 1 percent of our small and medium-sized \nbusinesses actually export. So what we have to do is help in every way \nwe can through our policies to give them access to those international \nmarkets.\n  Senator Ayotte and I both serve on the Small Business Committee. We \nrepresent New Hampshire. Last year we held a field hearing in New \nHampshire, and we heard from small businesses in our State about what \nwe can do here in Washington that might help them export. As a result \nof what we heard, we have introduced some stand-alone legislation. But \nprovisions in that stand-alone legislation have been incorporated into \nthe SUCCESS Act--the amendment that Senator Landrieu is going to be \noffering.\n  Those provisions would help our small businesses. One, they would \nimprove governmentwide export promotion. Right now we have a lot of \nindependent silos, independent efforts that exist in different agencies \nto help small businesses with exporting. What we want to do is provide \nmore coordination among those independent programs.\n  It would also increase State events that are targeted to help small \nbusinesses export. Both provisions, as we heard from our small \nbusinesses in New Hampshire, are important to them, as they think about \nwhat they can do to improve their chances of exporting, getting into \nthose international markets, and having the jobs that can be created as \na result.\n  So that is one of the provisions in the Landrieu amendment, the \nSUCCESS Act, that I think is very important. Senator Ayotte and I and \nour staffs have worked very hard on this.\n  Another provision that again is from stand-alone legislation that was \nintroduced by Senator Landrieu, Senator Snowe, Senator Isakson, and \nmyself--so it is also bipartisan legislation--would extend the 504 \nrefinancing program through the Small Business Administration.\n  As I go around New Hampshire, I still hear the small businesses in my \nState saying that they are still having challenges accessing credit. \nWell, extending the 504 refinancing program is to me a no-brainer as we \nthink about how we can give those small businesses access to credit. \nWhat these provisions would do is extend for a year and a half the \nability for the Small Business Administration to continue refinancing \nshort-term commercial real estate debt into long-term fixed-rate loans, \nagain, through the existing 504 loan program--something that makes \neminent sense, something that we ought to do.\n  So those are two provisions I have worked on specifically with other \nMembers of this body. They are provisions that are bipartisan. I think \nthey have a lot of support. If we can get this amendment to the floor, \nI think there will be a lot of support for it. And it reflects all of \nthe provisions of the SUCCESS Act that Senator Landrieu has been \nputting together.\n  Again, I want to end with where I started; that is, the people of New \nHampshire and the people of this country expect us to work together to \naddress the issues facing the country. Nowhere is that more important \nthan in what we need to do to help create jobs and helping small \nbusinesses have the support they need so they can create the jobs that \nare going to get us out of this recession. Providing long-term help to \nthose people who are unemployed is absolutely critical. This \nlegislation would help do that. I hope our colleagues, when it comes to \nthe floor, will decide this is one more way we can help small \nbusinesses create jobs and grow this economy.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for her leadership and Ranking Member Snowe \non the Small Business Committee for her leadership and hope we can move \nthis legislation forward this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire \nfor not only being such an aggressive and fine and thoughtful member of \nthe Small Business Committee, but for her constant encouragement to me \nand to Senator Snowe to try to pull together some of the ideas that we \nall can agree on and move forward.\n  It may not be the most perfect package, it may not be the most \nextensive package, but as the Senator from New Hampshire said, it is a \npackage that most all of us can agree to, and it has a pricetag of only \n$4 billion.\n  That is a lot of money. But compared to the Republican proposal that \nhas come over here from the House at $40 billion, and the Schumer \nproposal, which I support because it is much more targeted and much \nmore responsible at $20 billion, this $4 billion amendment could have a \ntremendous bang, a tremendous leveraging power for its cost. And the \ntwo proposals Senator Shaheen explained beautifully actually have zero \ncost because the 504 program is a program that pays for itself. All we \nare doing is extending its authorization so people--and there are \nthousands of them in Louisiana, in Rhode Island, in New Hampshire, and \nother States--who are caught paying higher interest rates on short-term \nloans for commercial buildings--and I am sure we all know someone in \nthat category--can now, if this amendment passes, go to their local \nbank--it is not a government program; it is a partnership with the \nlocal banks and through the SBA--and refinance their building and get a \nlonger term loan.\n  In fact, I am told that this program, this 504 program, is basically \ntaking up the majority of the space in this lending, that still the \nlenders are very weak. They are not extending credit out in a long \nfixed rate. They are lending short term. They are lending with \nadjustable rates. As the Presiding Officer knows, and many others, when \na person is starting a small business and taking so much risk, one risk \nthat can be eliminated is the cost of their money. It is very \ncomforting to a small business owner--who has to borrow, who does not \nhave the savings or has run through their savings or the equity in \ntheir home and they have to extend and take that risk--to be able to \nhave a fixed, longer term rate.\n  So again, this proposal came from Senator Isakson, who truly is \nacknowledged as the expert in this entire Chamber on commercial real \nestate and on residential real estate. He is known and respected on \nboth sides of the aisle. This is his proposal with Senator Shaheen. I \nthank him for his leadership.\n  Also, the Senator spoke about the export coordination. Again: zero \ncost; just smarter government, at no cost. We need more of that around \nhere: smarter government, less spending. That is what Senator Shaheen's \nproposal does, which is a portion of this amendment, the Small Business \nExport Growth Act.\n  Let me reiterate that 95 percent of the world's customers are located \noutside of the borders of the United States. It might be shocking to \npeople in America to realize this, but we represent only 4 to 5 percent \nof the population of the Earth. We think of ourselves as the biggest \nand the best, and we are the best. We are not necessarily the biggest \nwhen it comes to population, though.\n  So there are growing markets all over the world. Mr. President, 95 \npercent of our customers and a majority of the market are outside of \nthe boundaries of the United States. What we are recognizing is, right \nnow only 1 percent of the 28 million small businesses in America \nexport. Why would that be? One, it can be intimidating for a small \nbusiness, even though they have a great product, they have a great \nidea, they have great technology. And India needs that technology or \nsome countries in Africa might absolutely want that product or that \nservice. The small businesses are intimidated. They do not have the \naccountants, they do not normally have access to high-powered, \nexpensive lawyers and trade executives and experts. So that is what our \ngovernment--and, frankly, State governments are doing this. Smart \ngovernments at the State level--whether it is\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\nCalifornia, Oregon, Louisiana--all States are now recognizing: Gee, we \nneed to get behind our small businesses in our State and help them to \nexport.\n  I was very proud to put a substantial investment in the jobs act of \n2010, which gave competitive grants to States. And it is remarkable; \njust a little bit of investment at the Federal level is leveraging a \ntremendous amount of excitement at the State and local level as those \ngovernments accept those grants and then put them to work.\n  In Louisiana, our department of economic development has been very \naggressive in using its step grants. So, again, this is not an \nadditional grant program. This Shaheen-Ayotte proposal has no cost. It \nis perfecting, coordinating this export initiative by establishing an \ninteragency task force between the SBA, the USDA, and the Ex-Im Bank. \nIt is really encouraging cooperation that now does not exist at the \nFederal level and requires the SBA, in coordination with other \nagencies, to conduct one outreach event in each State per year, which I \nthink would really help to motivate our State governments and our \nstakeholders at the State level to be helpful.\n  Let me go back to the beginning. We have the SUCCESS Act amendment. I \ntalked earlier about 16 provisions in this amendment. We talked about \nthe 100-percent exclusion of capital gains. We have talked about the \nincreased deduction for startup expenditures, which is Senator \nMerkley's provisions.\n  Now I want to talk about the S corp holding period. This has come out \nof the Finance Committee. Senator Snowe and Senator Cardin have been \nvery strong advocates of this provision. Under current law, when a \ncorporation becomes an S corporation--and there are, of course, \nbenefits to becoming that kind of corporation--right now it is required \nto hold its business assets for 10 years or pay punitive taxes. In our \nmind, this 10-year holding period is too long. It ties up assets that \ncould be sold to raise capital. In 2010, in our small business bill, we \nreduced this holding period to 5 years so businesses would be better \nable to manage their planning cycles. So this proposal is to extend the \n5-year holding period through 2012 and 2013. You know, potentially, if \nwe could afford it, we would like to make this proposal permanent, but \nin the Landrieu SUCCESS Act amendment, it would extend it through 2012 \nand 2013 and has a minimal cost.\n  The next provision is a carryback provision--up to 5 years of general \nbusiness credits. This is a proposal about which Senator Snowe feels \nvery strongly. The proposal would extend the carryback period from 1 \nyear to 5 years for general business credits earned in 2012 and 2013. \nIt would provide tax refunds to businesses that were previously healthy \nbut are currently running losses.\n  The proposal would improve the effectiveness of business credits that \nare intended to expand investment and employment. The provision would \nallow businesses greater immediate benefit from credits designed to \nencourage specific types of activity. By providing businesses with \ngreater opportunity to claim business credits, the provision would also \ngive an infusion of cash to businesses, which might promote investment. \nSo that is another provision of our SUCCESS Act.\n  Section 179 is probably the most popular part of our amendment and, \nagain, Senator Snowe has championed this in the Finance Committee. Many \nFinance Committee members are completely aware of section 179 in the \nTax Code, which deals with expensing that many restaurants and \nretailers use. Basically, it provides a credit for them if a small \nbusiness buys machinery and equipment or property contained in or \nattached to a building other than structural components, such as \nrefrigerators, grocery store counters, office equipment, gasoline \nstorage tanks, pumps at retail service stations, even livestock, \nincluding horses, cattle, sheep, and goats, other fur-bearing animals--\nall of the equipment or products or purchases small businesses make to \nrun their businesses. This would allow an immediate writeoff of up to \n$500,000 for this kind of property. So, again, it is $2.3 billion over \n10 years. It is the most expensive part of this whole amendment, but we \nthink it is $2 billion well invested to encourage those small \nbusinesses to make these investments now, to get jobs and expansion \nopportunities underway.\n  Twenty-six national business groups, such as the NFIB, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Association of Home Builders, and the \nNational Association for the Self-Employed, have endorsed this and have \nsent a letter to us with very enthusiastic support.\n  The next section is expanding access to capital for entrepreneurs. \nThis was actually mentioned in President Obama's State of the Union \nMessage to us when he talked about his small business proposals. He \noutlined maybe half a dozen things, a few of which we have implemented \nand a few of which we have not yet implemented. This was on his bucket \nlist, if you will. And I am a strong proponent of this provision.\n  We created a small business investment company in a bipartisan way \ndecades ago. It has been one of the most successful programs created to \nspur business development in the country. It basically operates on a \nsustainable level and does not cost the Federal Government anything. It \nis like venture capital--not really like venture capital--it is like an \ninvestment; not a bank but a nonbank investment company that was \ncreated many years before I became chair of this committee. It is \nsomething that was done through Democratic and Republicans \nadministrations because it worked.\n  All this does is raise the statutory cap from $3 billion to $4 \nbillion, and it increases the amount of leverage of licensees from $225 \nmillion to $350 million. They are bumping up against that $3 billion \ncap. It has been very successful. We would like to take it to the next \nlevel. And, of course, some of the most successful funds within SBIC \nare bumping up against their $225 million cap per fund. So this is one \nof the great ideas that came out of our roundtable. Again, not only \ndoes President Obama support it, it has my strong support and Senator \nSnowe's, the ranking member of the Small Business Committee.\n  The next provision would be the SBA 504 refinance. This extends for a \nyear and a half the ability of the SBA 504 Loan Program. We talked \nabout this. Senator Shaheen spoke about this, and I have already \nexplained it. So this is really the Isakson-Shaheen-Snowe proposal.\n  The next is the small business lending activity index. This is \nsomething I have put forward. We have talked with the banks and the \nSBA. They are all on board and accepting of this concept. It is a way \nto measure the small business lending activity that is being done at \nthe city-State level through the 7(a) and 504 Lending Program.\n  It was very curious to me, when I became chair of this committee, \nthat we did not have the measurements in place to actually judge \nwhether some of our programs were really working. Were they working \nreally well or working moderately or were they very weak? So I have \ninstructed my staff and we have been working together to see in every \nway if we measure and really record the activities of the Small \nBusiness Administration. It is only a $1 billion agency, one of the \nsmaller agencies of the government, but that billion dollars comes from \ntaxpayers and we want to make sure that money is spent well and wisely.\n\n  So this legislation, again, is at no cost. It can be done within the \ncurrent budget. It will be called the lender activity index. It will be \nposted on the SBA Web site. It will have the name of the bank, the \nnumber of SBA loans made by each bank, the total dollar amount of SBA \nloans, the ZIP Code of bank activity, the industries lent to, so we can \nsort of see how our banks are lending and to what areas, the stage of \nthe business cycle, and then whether it was a woman-owned, minority-\nowned, or veteran-owned business, if that information can be obtained. \nIt is very simple. We made sure the language is easy for the banks. \nThey already have to report this data; it is just not in a useable \nformat. This will require them to put it in a useable format.\n  The next is access to global markets. This is what Senator Shaheen \nspoke about. So the major part of this bill is tax cuts to businesses \nand then some oversight of the SBA, tightening up, coordinating our \nexport strategy. And then the next and final part of this--or next to \nlast part of our amendment is basically access to mentoring, education, \nstrategic partnership.\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\n  In our roundtable--I am not going to go into all of the details of \nthese items, but the bottom line is that in our roundtable, experts--\nbusiness owners and the Kauffman Foundation and others--came to us and \nsaid: Senator, you are right, businesses need capital. You are right, \nwe need access to global markets. You are right that we need a fair tax \ncode. But what businesses also need is technical advice and support and \ntraining, and we need more education, entrepreneurship education.\n  The Small Business Administration is not the education agency, so we \nhave been very careful not to mission creep. We have designed a couple \nof proposals that can encourage better activity within the SBA to form \npartnerships with nonprofits and even for-profits, not-for-profits, and \nschools to promote entrepreneurship appropriately. The Federal \nGovernment can be a model. It is only one model. But we believe \ntechnical training is important. We have partners already established--\nthe women's small business centers and minority business centers. \nGetting them to be more effective and providing additional counseling \nis very important.\n  Finally on this amendment, access to government contracting is \nanother method for small businesses to be able to grow. Governments--\nwhether it is Federal, State, or local--are huge purchasers of goods \nand services, and if our contracting laws are right and if they are \nenforced, then small businesses in America will have an opportunity to \nget started by competing for government contracts or to grow by \nreceiving government contracts. And they are more likely to grow. If a \nbig business gets a contract from the government, they can sometimes \nabsorb that contact and make their company more efficient, giving more \nwork to the people who are already there. And there is nothing wrong \nwith that; that is business. But when a small business gets a \ngovernment contract, most of the time it results in additional hiring \nbecause small businesses have to be lean and agile. So they might have \nfive people but they have a lot of expertise. They land a contract from \nthe government that they are most certainly qualified to do, and then \nthey have to hire. So they have to hire 10 people to carry out that \ncontract, which is why I have been very supportive--Senator Cardin has \nbeen a champion on this issue and Senator Levin as well--of giving \nsmall businesses an opportunity for contracting. That will really help.\n  In conclusion on this amendment--I see other Members coming to the \nfloor. I wish to speak for another 5 or so minutes. I came to the floor \ntoday to support the underlying bill, which is the Schumer tax cut \nprovision that is targeted tax relief to small businesses in America. I \nhope our Members will support that.\n  If for any reason they don't support that, or even if we do, we will \nstill have an opportunity, I hope, to vote on the Landrieu amendment. I \nsay that humbly because this amendment has been put together by Senator \nSnowe and her staff with me and members of the Small Business Committee \non both sides of the aisle. We picked up some great ideas from \nindividual legislation that had been filed, and it got unanimous \nconsent and review, talking to many people.\n  So we don't believe it is controversial. We know it doesn't cost that \nmuch--$4 billion--and we believe it will have a tremendous and \nimmediate impact on small businesses in America.\n  I wanted to give that explanation. We have received a tremendous \namount of support today from a variety of organizations.\n  I see my colleague on the floor. I will yield the floor at this time \nand perhaps will take a few more minutes before 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am awaiting Senator Durbin and \nSenator Enzi. I will be happy to listen to the Senator from Louisiana \nif she would like to continue for a while until they come. I plan to \nspeak for a few minutes after they speak on a different subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there are a few other things I would \nlike to say.\n  I wanted to take a minute to respond to something that Senator Rubio \nsaid earlier, and Senator Sessions, while I was on the floor. I have \ngreat respect for those two Members, but he came to the floor with a \nfairly critical diatribe, if you will, against some of President \nObama's policies. I have not been a great supporter of the President's \nenergy policies, and I actually appreciate some of the views Senator \nRubio holds about the fact that we need to drill more in this country.\n  I want to show something I think Florida should be mindful of and \nsuggest that the Senator from Florida could start making that speech at \nhome in Florida because Florida is one of the States that virtually \nproduces no energy, from any source. It has been a bone of contention \nwith me for many years that we have had Senators come to the floor and \ntalk about what so-and-so doesn't do and what so-and-so doesn't do.\n  I want to remind the Senator from Florida that the gas that keeps the \nlights on in Florida actually comes from the Mobile Bay. These are the \npipelines that Mississippi and Alabama and Texas--9,000 miles of \npipelines and drilling--have off of our shore and onshore to provide \ngas and lights to Florida.\n  This is a chart that is very interesting. Before America can be \nenergy independent or energy secure, each State should be energy \nsecure, or each region. The country is not made up of smoke and \nmirrors; it is made up of 50 States. If every State and every region \nwould do its part, either producing or conserving or a little of both, \nwe could actually get there. But I get a little tired of the lectures \ncriticizing us--particularly from States that neither conserve nor \nproduce.\n  California gets a little bit of a break, even though they consume \nmore energy than any State. They are a net consumer of energy. We are \ndown here, a net producer. The States that produce more energy than \nthey consume are Wyoming, West Virginia, Louisiana, New Mexico, Alaska, \nKentucky--and North Dakota should be on here now because this was some \nyears ago. Probably Montana also would be on here now.\n  The Senator from Florida is coming and lecturing everybody about \nproducing, and his own State produces virtually nothing and consumes \neverything. I wanted to say that I find that offensive. California gets \na little bit of a pass from me because if we look at another chart, \nthey do more to sort of consume energy through government regulations, \nwhich I know the other side doesn't like. They think we don't need any \nregulations, and that is their view. California has a lot of \nregulations--maybe too much for me as well--but they are doing a lot to \nconserve. Florida doesn't. Maybe if Florida started doing a little \ndrilling, it would help the United States to be more energy \nindependent.\n  My second point: I want to answer something Senator Sessions said. I \nwill try to find my document on that in a minute. Senator Sessions came \nto the floor a few minutes ago and talked about the cost of the health \ncare bill. The health care bill has some expensive components to it. \nThe purpose of the health care bill, remember, Mr. President--because \nthe occupant of the chair was in the middle of that battle--was \ndesigned to reduce the overall cost of health care for the Nation \nbecause the percentage of the gross national product going to health \ncare was moving up dramatically and frighteningly--from 12 percent a \nfew years ago to 14 percent, to 16 percent, and it was on its way to 19 \npercent. It was on its way to 19 percent before Barack Obama got sworn \ninto office.\n  I am getting tired--and the American people are getting tired--of the \nsame diatribe coming from the other side of the aisle about how the \ncost of the Affordable Care Act is causing the country to go off the \nedge. This country was going off the edge before President Obama even \nbecame President. They know that. But they are just bound and \ndetermined to keep talking about the same old thing day in and day out, \nabout how the Affordable Care Act is wrecking America. The only thing \nwrecking America is their stubbornness.\n  I want to put this into the Record. When President Clinton was \nPresident, as you know, it was the last time we had a surplus. It was \nthe Republican President and the Republican leadership that turned that \nsurplus into a\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\ndeficit. The ship had already hit the iceberg before President Obama \ntook his oath of office. Now they want to blame the entire deficit on \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  When the Affordable Care Act is implemented--now that the Supreme \nCourt has said it is most certainly constitutional--instead of fighting \nit every step of the way, it would, in the long run, save money.\n  They want to talk about this tax, tax, tax, tax. I want to call what \nthey do the ``no care tax,'' because that is the Republican position. \nBefore there was the Affordable Care Act, people in America were losing \ncare rapidly. Small businesses were dropping their insurance. They \ncould not afford it anymore. These premiums have been going up for a \nlong time. The Affordable Care Act didn't drive the premiums up; they \nwere going through the ceiling. We had to do something to try to stop \nit.\n\n  When President Obama came into office, and we saw that the trends \nwere going up, in our efforts to try to get the budget back into \nbalance it was obvious that we had to do something with health care. \nBut they keep talking about tax, tax, tax. I remind them that before we \npassed the Affordable Care Act, there was a tax on every insurance \npolicy that people in America had because it was a tax for the \nuninsured. It was about $1,200. That tax was on the backs of the \nAmerican people before President Obama ever became President, before we \neven began debating the Affordable Care Act.\n  The other cost that was going on in this country was the people who \ndidn't have Medicare, who didn't have Medicaid, and didn't have \ninsurance--and it was a rising number of people without insurance. And \nas States cut back on their Medicaid, a rising number of people who \ndidn't have Medicaid went to our hospitals, our private hospitals, our \npublic hospitals, and our not-for-profit hospitals. Do you know what \nthe Republicans want to tell them. Just treat those people for free. \nThere is no one to reimburse you for this cost. Medicaid will not \nreimburse them because they are not 65. They don't have private \ninsurance. And the Governors cut back on Medicaid because they can't \nbear to go look for some tax loopholes that people might not need in \norder to provide working Americans with health care.\n  They are too busy campaigning for their next election, so they told \nall the hospitals: You all go ahead and take care of these people for \nfree. So when a non-paying customer went to a hospital, whom do you \nthink picked up the tab for that? The paying customer.\n  So before President Obama became the President, before we started \ntrying to figure out a way out of this terrible mess, there was a huge \ntax on the backs of the American people and a huge debt having to be \npaid every year by every hospital in America. Why don't they talk about \nthat? They don't.\n  I hope the American people will listen because I am so tired of that \nsame old speech. I have heard it for 3 years--before the debate, during \nthe debate, and I guess we are going to hear it up to the election. I \nhope the American people will listen. Don't let them talk about the tax \nthat is supposedly in this bill. The Affordable Care Act is alleviating \na tax burden. It alleviates a terrible tax burden, an invisible tax \nthat has been on the American people, and a heavy burden on the backs \nof the taxpayers--and immoral in some ways, as well--with working \nAmericans working 50, 60 hours a week, and when they get sick, they \nhave nowhere to turn.\n  Instead of putting their proposals on the table, they decided they \nwanted to block and tackle and stop and not contribute anything. I \nthink the country will make a good decision. I think the country likes \nthe fact that their kids can stay on their health care plan until they \nare 26, and they like the fact that when they get sick with cancer or \ndiabetes they cannot be kicked off their health insurance. Particularly \nbusinesses would like it if the States would step up and cover some of \nthese lower wage workers, and the burden would not fall on us.\n  For every Governor--and mine may be one--who rejects the expansion of \nMedicare, who do they think has to pick this up? It is the small \nbusinesses.\n  The burden should be shared for our lower income workers broadly, not \non the backs of businesses that are struggling. That is the way we \ndesigned this program. The Federal Government said: We know it is \ntough. We know it is an expansion. Do you know what. We will pick up \nthe 3 years 100 percent to give you some time, to help you so you can \nlook at your Tax Code, and you might be able to find out and let me get \nthis one more thing off my chest. Who made up the rule that the Federal \nGovernment is in charge of the health of every American citizen? Do \nGovernors have any responsibility for health? Are we supposed to just \ndo everything up here? Do mayors and Governors have any responsibility \nfor the health and welfare of the people they serve? I suggest the \nGovernors--some of them--get off the campaign trail, get back to their \noffices, and start putting health care legislation together--\nparticularly some of the Republican Governors.\n  I am glad I said that. I am happy to turn over the microphone. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Marketplace Fairness Act\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor in support of \nSenator Enzi of Wyoming, Senator Durbin of Illinois, and a group of \nother Senators and House Members who are working on legislation called \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  I am going to let them do their own speaking. I am their chief self-\nappointed cheerleader. Senator Enzi has been working on this ever since \nhe has been in the Senate. He has a special passion for it as a former \nowner of a shoe store in Wyoming.\n  Let me see if I can phrase it this way. If I were to ask the \nquestion, What do Governor Chris Christie, Governor Mitch Daniels, \nGovernor Jeb Bush, Governor Haley Barbour, Al Cardenas, chairman of the \nAmerican Conservative Union, Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia, and \nGovernor Paul LePage of Maine all have in common, one might say they \nare all Republicans, and that is true. One might say they are all \nconservatives, and that is true.\n  The other thing one could say about those Governors and Republicans \nand conservatives is that they all support the Enzi-Durbin Marketplace \nFairness Act. What is the Marketplace Fairness Act and why do they \nsupport it? The Marketplace Fairness Act is an 11-page bill about a \ntwo-word issue, and the issue is States rights.\n\n  The reason I am such a strong supporter and a cosponsor of what they \nare doing is because when I, in my former life, used to be Governor of \nTennessee, nothing would make me angrier than Washington politicians \nwho would try to tell me what to do about my own business. We have a \nlegislature in Tennessee and in Wyoming and we have a Governor and we \nknow what services we want and we have a range of options of taxes to \npay for that. It was always my position we could make our own decisions \nabout how to do that.\n  What Senators Enzi and Durbin and others of us are saying is that \nStates have a right to decide what taxes they impose and from whom to \ncollect them. If the States of Tennessee or Wyoming say: We are going \nto have a sales tax and we are only collecting it from half the people, \nit has the right to be wrong. That is what I mean by States rights.\n  If I were in Tennessee, I would say: Surely, you will not have a \nState sales tax and only collect it from some of the people. You would \ncollect it from all the people who owe it. Surely, you will treat all \nyour businesses that are in a similarly situated situation the same \nway. That would be my position if I were Governor or in the \nlegislature, but I will let them decide that.\n  What we have advanced in the Senate, which has 13 cosponsors, is a \npiece of legislation that makes it clear States can decide for \nthemselves whether to collect State sales taxes from some of the people \nwho owe it or from all the people who owe it. I will give an example \nand then I will sit down and listen to Senator Enzi and let him talk.\n  This past week I had a birthday, and my wife gave me an ice cream \nmaker\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\nfrom Williams-Sonoma, which I am sure is going to add a few pounds as \nthe months go on. So there we were over the Fourth of July holiday, and \nI wanted to get some of the stuff one needs to make ice cream. You can \nbuy ice cream starter from Williams-Sonoma and it comes in a can and it \nmakes the project a lot easier and you can buy chocolate syrup and they \nwill mail it right to your house. You can do all these things online, \nof course, or I could have driven back to Nashville and gone to the \nstore in Nashville and bought it all there. If I had bought all that \nstuff in Nashville, I would have paid Nashville's 9.25 percent sales \ntax. If I buy it online, I wouldn't have to pay the tax when I bought \nit, except that Williams-Sonoma collects it. So I went on the Internet, \nput it on my credit card, and there was the amount of money it cost to \nbuy the stuff for my ice cream maker. Right at the end of it, it added \nthe tax on, the same sales tax I owed and would have paid if I had been \nat Williams-Sonoma in Nashville. So I pushed the button, off it went, \nthey collected the tax from my credit card, sent it to the State of \nTennessee, and it was done.\n  Twenty years ago, that wouldn't have happened with an out-of-State \nseller. It was too cumbersome. The technology wasn't advanced, the \nInternet wasn't as fast, and the States had not gotten their acts \ntogether. It was all very confusing, and the Supreme Court said you \ncan't impose that on States--requiring an out-of-State seller to \ncollect the sales tax that is owed--even though it may be owed. Today, \nit is different. It is as easy to figure out the tax as it is to Google \nthe weather in your hometown. In fact, it is easier. It is easier to \nhave the tax collected online than it is to go into the store and do \nit.\n  In any event, in the State of Tennessee, Governor Haslam and the \nLieutenant Governor--and I can guarantee we are a conservative State--\nwant the right to decide that for themselves. I know what they are \ngoing to do, if they have the right to collect the sales tax from \neverybody who owes it instead of just some of the people who owe it. \nThey are going to lower the tax rate for everybody. They might get rid \nof the only vestige of an income tax we have, or the food tax might go \ndown. They might spend some more money for teachers' salaries. That is \ntheir business.\n  But I am here to say that Senators Enzi and Durbin and others have \nsolved a big problem for this country, and the reason why this bill is \ninevitable and why I hope it will pass this week or next week or the \nnext week--and why I believe the House of Representatives is going to \npass it as well--is because it is a simple 11-page bill about a 2-word \nissue: States rights. That is why Governor Christie and Governor \nDaniels and Governor Bush and Congressman Pence and many Republicans \nand many conservatives are saying let's pass it. Let's get out of the \nway and let States make their own decisions, and then the States can \ndecide from whom they want to collect their sales taxes.\n  I congratulate Senator Enzi--and Senator Durbin--on his work and I \nlook forward to working with Senator Enzi and I hope this year we can \ncontinue to turn this bill the Senator has worked on for more than a \ndozen years into a law.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, \nis far too modest. Yes, I have been working on this since I got to the \nSenate, but he is the one who got it shortened down to 11 pages and \nmade it a States rights bill. The States are realizing their rights \nanyway, and there are attempts at making changes in the sales tax law \nin order to cover this huge loss of revenue they are experiencing, but \nit doesn't work unless we do what the Supreme Court urged us to do when \nthey issued the Quill decision back in the 1990s, which is to pass a \nnational law that clarifies how this tax would be collected if the \nStates choose to do it.\n  I am very pleased Senator Durbin joined us on this issue. Practically \nevery State is losing money because of the tax that is only being \ncollected for people who buy instate, and when they buy out of State, \nthey are used to it being collected and it isn't collected. So half the \ntime the State is not getting its money, and we need to change that \nbefore States come to the Federal Government and say we need some money \nfor this project and then that sometimes gets worked into a bill. We \nare out of money at the Federal level. We have eliminated earmarks, so \nwe can't do what we used to do, and we probably shouldn't have done it \nthen. At any rate, we are borrowing 42 cents on every $1 we spend, so \nwe don't have any money to give to the States.\n  But the States do have this authority, an authority to do a sales \ntax. Of course, they didn't anticipate they were just going to tax the \nbusinesses that were in their State that were paying a property tax and \nwere hiring local people and were participating in all the community \nevents and telling everybody out of State they didn't have any \nresponsibility in it. There has always been an effort to get their \nresponsibility too. I am glad we have this opportunity to discuss the \nsmall business jobs and tax bill, but in this amendment to it--which \nwould be known as the Marketplace Fairness Act--we are talking about \nfairness. We do expect everybody will be treated fairly.\n\n  So let's start with a common-day practice that is happening in our \nNation's retail markets today. If someone buys the book ``The Hunger \nGames'' at the local bookshop in town, they will pay more for the book \nfrom the brick-and-mortar store than if they bought the book online. \nThere is nothing different about the brick-and-mortar store's book \nversus the book purchased on the Internet except the sales tax they \nhave to pay. If they choose to do so, States should have the \nflexibility and the ability to fix this inequality.\n  Sales taxes go directly to State and local governments. They bring in \nneeded revenue for maintaining our schools, fixing our roads, and \nsupporting our law enforcement. As I like to add, have you ever tried \nto flush your toilet on the Internet? If sales over the Internet \ncontinue to go untaxed and electronic commerce continues to soar, \nrevenues to State and local governments will plummet. But if Congress \nfails to authorize States to collect tax on remote sales and electronic \ncommerce continues to grow, we are implicitly blessing a situation \nwhere States will be forced to raise other taxes, such as income or \nproperty taxes, to offset the growing loss of sales tax revenue. Do we \nwant this to happen? No, we don't.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act was written in the aftermath of the \nSupreme Court's 1992 Quill decision. Congressional involvement is \nnecessary because the ruling stated the thousands of different State \nand local tax rules were too complicated and onerous to require \nbusinesses to collect sales tax unless they had a physical presence--\nstore, warehouse, et cetera--in the purchaser's home State.\n  The Supreme Court essentially stated Congress needs to decide how to \nmove forward. I strongly believe now is the time for Congress to act. \nMany Americans don't realize when they buy something online or order \nsomething from a catalog from a business outside their own State, they \nstill owe the sales tax. For over a decade, Congress has been debating \nhow to best allow States to collect the sales taxes from online \nretailers in a way that puts Main Street businesses on a level and fair \nplaying field with the online retailers.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act empowers States to make the decision \nthemselves. If they choose to collect already existing sales taxes on \nall purchases, regardless of where the sale was--whether it was online \nor in a store--they can. If they want to keep it the way they are, the \nStates can do that.\n  I have been working on this sales tax fairness since joining the \nSenate in 1997. As a former small business owner, it is important to \nlevel the playing field for all retailers--in-store, catalog, and \nonline--so an outdated rule for sales tax collection does not adversely \nimpact small businesses and Main Street retailers. As a State \nlegislator, I know we never passed a law, as I said, that discriminated \nagainst the instate people. We never put a burden on people who pay the \nproperty tax, who hire local residents and participate in the community \nevents while telling those out of State we want them to have our\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\nmoney, but they do not have to do anything in return. We never intended \nto give the out-of-State businesses a free ride. That is what the local \nlegislators are all concerned about.\n  On November 9, 2011, Senators Durbin, Alexander, Tim Johnson, and I \nintroduced, with six of our other colleagues, in a very bipartisan way, \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act to close this 20-year loophole that \ndistorts the American marketplace by picking winners and losers, by \nsubsidizing some businesses at the expense of other businesses and \nsubsidizing taxpayers at the expense of other taxpayers. All businesses \nand their retail sales and all consumers and their purchases should be \ntreated equally and fairly.\n  I wish to provide some highlights of what the Marketplace Fairness \nAct accomplishes:\n  The bill gives States the right to decide to collect or not to \ncollect taxes that are already owed. The legislation would streamline \nthe country's more than 9,000 diverse sales tax jurisdictions and \nprovide two options by which States could begin collecting taxes for \nonline and catalog purchases. The bill gives States two voluntary \noptions that would allow them to collect the State sales taxes that are \nalready owed if they choose.\n  The first option is the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, \nsupported by 24 States that have already passed laws to simplify their \ntax collection rules. The second option puts in place basic minimum \nsimplification measures States can adopt to make it easier for out-of-\nState businesses to comply.\n  The bill also carves out small businesses so they are not adversely \naffected by the new law by exempting businesses with less than $500,000 \nin sales online or out-of-State sales from collection requirements. It \nis very important there is an exemption for startup and small \nbusinesses if they have less than $500,000 of sales in 1 year. Once \nthey reach the $500,000, then the next year they have to begin \ncollecting the tax. This small business exemption will protect small \nmerchants and give new businesses time to get started.\n  Don't let the critics get away with saying this kind of \nsimplification cannot be done. In the early 1990s, when the Quill \ndecision was handed down, the Internet was still in diapers and cell \nphones came with bags and looked like bricks. Cell phones now have \nInternet capability, and software, computers, and technologies have all \nadvanced at an exponential pace. The different rates and jurisdiction \nproblem is no problem for today's programs.\n  As a former mayor and State legislator, I also strongly favor \nallowing States the authority to require sales and use tax collection \nfrom retailers in all sales, if they choose to do so. We need to \nimplement a plan that will allow States to generate revenue using \nmechanisms already approved by their local leaders. We need to allow \nStates the ability to collect the sales taxes they already require, if \nenacted. This would provide $23 billion in fiscal relief for the States \nfor which Congress does not have to find an offset. This will give \nStates less of an excuse to come knocking on the Federal door for \nhandouts and will reduce the problem of federally attached strings. It \nwill give States a chance to reduce property taxes or other taxes.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is not about new taxes. No one should \ntax the use of the Internet. No one should tax Internet services. I do, \nhowever, have concerns about using the Internet as a sales tax \nloophole. Sales tax collection is already required by my home State of \nWyoming no matter how or where we buy something, if it is not taxed by \nthe State we get it from. We are supposed to fill out our own form and \nsubmit the information. Nobody is used to filing that kind of form or \ndoing that kind of tax collection, and they never know whether the tax \nis owed or how much it is, particularly on small purchases.\n  It is always collected at the stores by the stores in state. We have \nto make the system simpler so they don't have to fill out forms. Under \nWyoming law, online purchases are already subject to a sales tax; it \njust can't be collected and given to our State. The situation is very \nsimilar to that of other States.\n  Senators Durbin, Alexander, and I have worked tirelessly to assist \nthe sellers, States, and local governments to simplify sales and use \ntax collection and administration. We have worked with all interested \nparties to find a mutually agreeable legislative package to introduce. \nMany hours have been dedicated to finding the right solution.\n  I want to publicly commend and thank Senators Durbin and Alexander \nfor taking a leadership role in working on this important policy issue.\n  Ten years ago, the bills we considered to try to close this loophole \nwere not adequate to solve the problem. Marketplace Fairness does solve \nthe problem. It is simple. It is about States' rights. It is about \nfairness. At a time when States' budgets are under increasing pressure, \nCongress should give State and local governments the ability to enforce \ntheir own laws. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support amendment \nNo. 2496, known as the Marketplace Fairness Act, and get it enacted \ninto public law this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Alexander of Tennessee and \nSenator Enzi of Wyoming, cosponsors of this measure and participants in \nthis colloquy on the floor today. I am sorry I wasn't here at the \noutset, but I am grateful for their participation and comments they \nhave made, and especially for their commitment to this cause.\n  I think Senator Enzi--and I would give special thanks to Senator \nAlexander, who stepped in at a very important moment and helped us \ncraft a part of this bill--helped us craft an agreement on this bill \nand brought some new approaches to it which have been extremely \nhelpful.\n  The notion of offering this as an amendment is a show of good faith \non our part and a show of commitment to the seriousness and the \nimportance of this issue. The fact that many Democrats and Republicans \ncan join together in this bipartisan manner is an indication that this \nbill cuts across party lines. I think it gets down to a basic issue, as \nit says, of fairness.\n  The economy is clearly getting better. There are better days ahead; \njobs are being created and our economy is growing stronger. There may \nbe times when the job numbers are disappointing and the stock market \nstumbles, and we continue to face challenges in Europe and other \nplaces, but we are improving.\n  Businesses in Illinois and across the country are starting to see \ncustomers come back. Small retailers in my home State of Illinois are \npushing the slogan ``buy local'' in their effort to urge consumers to \ncome back to local stores, farmers markets, and shoe stores, instead of \nbuying online. These efforts support local brick-and-mortar sellers who \ncontribute to the community in so many different ways. They sponsor the \nlocal baseball teams, they collect sales and use taxes that pay for \nservices such as fire, police, and trash collection, and they provide \ngood-paying local jobs.\n  While these efforts have been successful, many local retailers share \nwith me how frustrating it is to lose business because online retailers \nhave a built-in advantage that I have seen firsthand. While local Main \nStreet businesses collect State and local taxes and use taxes, their \nonline competitors don't. In Illinois, this can mean an 8-percent \ndifferential in price. This encourages customers to buy everything from \nelectronics to books online to avoid paying sales tax and use taxes.\n  A couple examples:\n  Bob Naughtrip, owner of Soccer Plus in Palatine and Libertyville, IL, \ndescribes how his biggest online competitor can offer a discount of \nmore than $10,000 because it doesn't have to collect sales and use \ntaxes. Bob sells sporting equipment to local sports clubs, and it is \nnot unusual for these clubs to make purchases that exceed $100,000 a \nyear. He can't compete when the competition has a $10,000 price \nadvantage, so he loses the business.\n  Matt Lamsargis, owner of the Springfield Running Center--a person I \nhave come to know--and Bob Thompson, owner of BikeTek, both in my \nhometown of Springfield, told me when I visited their small businesses \nlast year they are victims of ``showrooming,'' they call it. They lose \nbusiness when customers walk into the store, look around, maybe even \ntry on the clothing and shoes or even get fitted just right,\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\nwrite down a few numbers, then walk out the door and order the product \nover the Internet at a discount, because the Internet seller doesn't \ncollect sales tax and these local retailers have to. Ironically, some \nof the customers, dissatisfied with their online purchases, come back \nto the same store to complain about a product they didn't even buy \nthere. So we have got to find a way to make this a fairer marketplace.\n  Why can't State and local governments require online retailers to \ncollect sales and use taxes? For 20 years, State and local governments \nhave been prohibited from enforcing their own sales and use tax laws \nbecause of a Supreme Court decision in Quill v. North Dakota where the \nCourt clearly stated that only Congress has the authority to solve this \nproblem.\n  Last year, Senator Enzi, Senator Alexander, and I introduced the \nMarketplace Fairness Act with additional cosponsors. We now have 13 \nbipartisan sponsors. This bipartisan group of Senators understands that \nto truly help small businesses grow and create jobs, we need to make \nsure they compete on a level playing field. The Marketplace Fairness \nAct would do that. That is why it is being filed as an amendment to the \nSmall Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act.\n  Our amendment is about saving Main Street businesses and the jobs \nprovided by those businesses. This bill does not mandate the States but \nit allows States, if they choose, to require online and brick-and-\nmortar retailers to play by the same sales tax rules. The bill \neliminates the built-in price advantage that has distorted the market \nfor 20 years.\n  It includes, as Senator Enzi recently said, a small seller exemption \nfor those selling less than $500,000 worth of commodities a year. If \nGrandma Bennet's apple butter is being cased up and sold to the tune of \n$10,000 or $20,000 a year online because her smart grandson has given \nher advice on how she can retail this online, she doesn't have to start \ncollecting sales tax until she has sold $500,000 worth of goods; in the \nnext year, she collects sales tax. So we are trying to be sensitive to \nsmaller businesses and, as Senator Enzi said, startup businesses.\n\n  This bill includes 240 organizations. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe list of those organizations be printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is an issue where the International Association of \nFirefighters and AFSCME stand together with the National Retail \nFederation, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, and the Consumer \nElectronics Association. What an amazing coalition.\n  Amazon.com, the largest retailer online in America, supports our \nbill. Yet the largest online retailer, in supporting this bill, still \nhas Members of the Senate questioning whether they are going to react \npositively. They are on record in favor of this.\n  It is also supported by groups such as the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nthe National Association of Counties, and the National Council of State \nLegislators. The National Governors Association supports the \nMarketplace Fairness Act, because these State and local governments are \nlosing about $23 billion a year on uncollected sales tax. In Illinois, \nwe are losing about $1 billion a year, about 15 percent of our current \ndeficit. It would make a difference if we could collect this. Again, \nthe States would have to make that decision. We don't force it on them.\n  This has the support of eight Democratic Governors and 13 Republican \nGovernors, including Governor Quinn of Illinois, O'Malley of Maryland, \nMcDonnell of Virginia, Mitch Daniels of Indiana, and Haley from the \nState of South Carolina. Recently, Governor Chris Christie from the \nState of New Jersey publicly came out in support and said:\n\n       I too--along with Governors like Governor Daniels and \n     others--urge the federal government and Congress in \n     particular to get behind . . . legislation to allow states to \n     be able to make these choices for themselves. . . .\n\n  Governor LePage, a Republican Governor from the State of Maine, wrote \na letter of support saying, ``The Marketplace Fairness Act does not \nraise taxes.'' The point he makes and the argument here is this is not \na new tax.\n  So if this bill has such broad bipartisan support, why haven't we \npassed it? Well, we need 60 Senators. The majority leader has said to \nme and Senator Enzi, ``Show me the votes.'' And that is what we are \ntrying to do--bring together a bipartisan group that will support this, \nthat understands it is simple fairness for small businesses that create \njobs and opportunities all across America. And with the sales taxes \nthey collect, they provide for local police and firemen, for the sewers \nand streets, and the things in life that we come to take for granted in \nour cities across America. We want to make sure the online retailers \nare making the same contribution.\n  So I urge my colleagues, when this amendment comes before them, to \nsupport it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Support for the Marketplace Fairness Act\n\n       American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n     Organizations; Abbell Credit Corporation, Chicago, IL; Acadia \n     Realty Trust, White Plains, NY; AFL-CIO Department for \n     Professional Employees; Airgas, Inc.; Alabama College \n     Bookstore Association; Alabama Retail Association; Alaska \n     Veterinary Medical Association; Alliance of Wisconsin \n     Retailers; Amazon.com; American Apparel and Footwear \n     Association; American Booksellers Association; American \n     Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; American \n     Federation of Teachers; American Specialty Toy Retailing \n     Association; American Veterinary Medical Association; Arizona \n     Retailers Association; Arkansas Grocers and Retail Merchants \n     Association; Association for Christian Retail; Association of \n     Washington Business; AutoZone, Inc.; Balliet's LLC; Barnes \n     and Noble, Inc.; Beall's, Inc.; Bed, Bath, & Beyond, Inc.; \n     Ben Bridge Jewelers, Seattle, WA; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Blake \n     Hunt Ventures, Inc., Danville, CA; Build-A-Bear Workshops , \n     Saint Louis, MO; Buy.com; California Association of College \n     Store; California Business Properties Association; California \n     Retailers Association; California Veterinary Medical \n     Association; Carolinas Food Industry Council; CBL & \n     Associates Properties, Inc., Chattanooga, TN; Cencor Realty \n     Services, Dallas, TX; Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; \n     Certified Commercial Investment Member Institute; \n     Chesterfield Blue Valley, LLC, St. Louis, MO; Christian \n     Booksellers Association; City of Carrollton, Texas; College \n     Stores of New England (MA, CT, RI, ME, VT, NH); College \n     Stores Association of New York State.\n       College Stores Association of North Carolina; Colorado \n     Retail Council; Colorado Veterinary Medical Association; \n     Connecticut Retail Merchants Association; Consumer \n     Electronics Association; Consumer Electronics Retailers \n     Coalition; The Container Store, Dallas, Texas; The \n     CortiGilchrist Partnership, Ilc, Al Corti, Principal, San \n     Diego, CA; D.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 442, S. \n3364.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 3364, a bill to provide an \n     incentive for businesses to bring jobs back to America.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, right now the Senate is considering the \nsmall business jobs bill, a very important proposal that was part of \nPresident Obama's package to increase employment in this country. It \nwill create a million jobs. This legislation will give tax credits to \nbusinesses that grow and hire. Yet Republicans are looking for any \nexcuse to vote down the proposal for two reasons: No. 1, it has the \nsupport of President Obama and the Democrats in Congress. Second, it \nwould strengthen the economy, which would help President Obama.\n  We know Republicans will not do anything that helps President Obama, \neven if it is good for the economy, because their No. 1 goal is to \ndefeat the President. My friend Mitch McConnell has said that. So \nRepublicans are hiding behind their usual procedural trick, \nfilibustering with unrelated amendments. If there is any doubt about \nRepublicans' motivation to kill this legislation, take a look with me \nat the amendment proposed today by Senator Hatch of Utah.\n  The first thing Senator Hatch's amendment would do is eliminate all \nthe tax cuts, every tax cut we have in this proposal, every one of \nthem, the one that is now before the Senate, to create a million jobs. \nThe Hatch amendment would literally eliminate every provision in the \nbill designed to create jobs.\n  Senator Hatch's amendment eliminates the 10-percent credit for \nemployers to hire additional workers or increase their payrolls, a \nprovision that would create--that part alone--a half million jobs. It \nstrikes another deduction for businesses that invest in machinery and \nequipment which would create another half million jobs.\n  But the Republican amendment does not stop there. It goes on to \nincrease taxes for 25 million American families. The Republican \namendment, I repeat, increases taxes for 25 million American families. \nSenator Hatch's amendment would extend tax breaks for the top 2 percent \nof Americans, but it fails to extend a number of tax cuts that help \nmiddle-class families get by in a very tough economy. For example, \nSenator Hatch's amendment, a Republican amendment, would increase taxes \nby $1,100 for 11 million families trying to pay for college--11 million \nfamilies, in effect an increase of their taxes by $1,100.\n  The Republican amendment would make it harder for 12 million large \nfamilies to put food on the table. It would increase taxes by $800 for \nfamilies that have three children or more. Senator Hatch's amendment, \nthe Republican amendment, fails to extend the full childcare tax credit \nfor 6 million families, increasing their taxes by $500 each.\n  So no one is fooled by the Republican amendment. We see it for what \nit is, more Republican obstruction that comes with the added bonus of \nsticking it to the middle class. If that were not enough political \ntheater for 1 day, my Republican colleagues also claim they are anxious \nto vote on President Obama's plan to cut taxes for 98 percent of \nAmerican families. Once again, no one should be fooled. Republicans \nknow very well the Senate will vote on the President's proposal to give \nmiddle-class families the certainty they will not be hit with a tax \nincrease. We will vote on it this work period. I have already said so. \nThey say they want a vote sooner, so let's lock in an agreement sooner. \nThe President's plan to give 98 percent of Americans certainty their \ntaxes will not go up and Republican plans to raise taxes on 25 million \nAmerican families--Democrats are ready to have those votes right away \nand we will do it with a simple majority. Then we can get back to the \ntask at hand, cutting taxes for millions of small businesses that want \nto expand and put Americans back to work.\n  I have a consent agreement that I will go through with you.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2237\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that cloture be vitiated with \nrespect to the substitute amendment on S. 2237, that the motion to \ncommit be withdrawn and amendment Nos. 2525\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\nand 2522 be withdrawn; that at 2 p.m. tomorrow, Thursday, July 12, the \nSenate vote in relation to the following amendments: amendment No. \n2524, which is the Cantor language; substitute amendment No. 2521; that \nthere be no other amendments or motions in order to the amendment to \nthe bill prior to the votes other than motions to waive or motions to \ntable; that upon disposition of the two amendments the Senate proceed \nto a vote on passage of S. 2237, as amended, if amended; further, that \nat a time to be determined by the majority leader after consultation \nwith the Republican leader the Senate proceed to consideration of a \nbill to be introduced by Senator Reid or designee, extending the 2001, \n2003, and 2009 tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans and 96 percent of \nsmall businesses as outlined by President Obama; that the only \namendment in order to the bill be an amendment offered by Senator \nMcConnell or designee, which is identical to the text of amendment No. \n2491, as filed by Senator Hatch; that the amendment not be divisible; \nthat there be 4 hours of debate on the amendment and the bill, equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees prior to a vote in \nrelation to the McConnell or designee amendment; that upon disposition \nof the amendment the Senate proceed to vote on the passage of the bill, \nas amended, if amended; that there be no motions or points of order to \nthe amendment or the bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am glad my friend the majority leader has dropped \nhis earlier opposition and now wants to make an effort to set up these \nvotes on this important issue. On Monday, the President said that if \nthe Senate passes his tax hike on small businesses he would sign it \nright away. So I am glad the Senate will have a chance to beat that bad \nidea that will raise taxes on nearly 1 million small businesses.\n  I will be happy to take a look at what my good friend the majority \nleader is offering, but I cannot at this time agree to lock in a vote \nat an indeterminate time on a proposal that has not yet been written. \nMy good friend has had all day to come up with a written proposal, but \nI gather that so far they have been unable to do so or, if they have, \nwe certainly have not seen it. Our proposal is drafted and filed and \nhas been available for all to see.\n  My goal here--and it is one that I laid out several weeks ago--is \nthat we act now to ensure that no one's income taxes go up January of \nnext year. The mere threat of this tax increase is already a drag on \nour economy and I do not plan on standing by and letting that tax \nincrease go into effect.\n  So we would be happy to set up a vote on this issue as soon as the \nmajority leader produces a bill to show us what tax increases they have \nin mind. I want to make sure that everyone understands the differences \nin our positions. My goal--and I hope it is one that is shared by a \nmajority of Senators--will be to enact a bill that protects small \nbusinesses by extending current income tax rates for 1 year to ensure \nthat no one in America sees an income tax hike in January, and tasking \nthe Finance Committee to produce a bill that would enact fundamental \nprogrowth tax reform. Their goal will be the President's proposal to \nraise taxes on nearly 1 million business owners in the middle of the \nworst economic recovery in modern times.\n  The Senate ought to make absolutely clear which policy it supports. I \nlook forward to having the chance to do that, but until that time, \nuntil we actually have a product we can take a look at, I cannot agree \nto this request, and therefore I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be very brief. My friend the \nRepublican leader said this morning, and I quote directly: I am trying \nto get a vote, a vote on what he says he's for, on what the President \nsays he's for, and what the Republicans say they are for. That is what \nthis consent agreement does.\n  I am happy to let the Republican leader read the exact language. But \nlet no one be fooled by this. The Hatch amendment does not do anything \nto protect small businesses. It does everything to protect Grover \nNorquist and his pledge; that is, make sure the American people are not \nsatisfied. They believe--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--that \nthe top 2 percent of income earners in this country should contribute \nto solving the problems we have with the deficit and the debt in this \ncountry. That is what this is all about.\n  I look forward to working with my friend the Republican leader to see \nif we can come to a position here where we can vote on the bill that is \nbefore us. I am concerned because the Hatch language eliminates our \nbill, but I am happy to have staff, during the night, look and see if \nwe can arrive at some way to move forward. But I think I made my point \nclear.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one other brief observation. I have \nalready objected, but one other brief observation. The consent that I \nobjected to also chose for us the amendment we would get to have, and \nof course that is not an agreement the Republican side would feel we \nwould want to be a part of.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am only trying to do what they said they \nwanted to do this morning. Senator Hatch came and gave a big speech: \nThis is what they want to do. If they have something else they want to \npropose, I am happy to take a look at that, but I only am trying to do \nwhat they said they wanted to do this morning.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum unless my friend has \nmore to say?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/11/senate-section/article/S4886-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNET.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. John \nBowling of Laurel County, KY. ``Big John Bowling,'' as he is \naffectionately called by friends and family, not only served Laurel \nCounty as jailer during the 1970s, but has also lived a life of \nkindness and integrity. His legacy to Kentucky exceeds his public \nservice because not only was he a compassionate jailer, he also built a \nloving home for his family that welcomed all members of the Laurel \nCounty community.\n  John Bowling met his wife, Imogene, at a church dinner. After \ncommenting on the quality of a macaroni salad at the dinner, his pastor \nintroduced him to Imogene. At that time Imogene was married, but later, \nin 1964, her husband was tragically killed in a car crash and Imogene \nwas left with three children aged 7, 4, and 2 years old. Imogene began \nworking at Hoskins Grocery where, 5 years later, she and Mr. Bowling \nbecame reacquainted.\n  The couple began dating and they brought Imogene's children along on \nevery date. After 6 years, the couple married. In their first year of \nmarriage, Imogene had another daughter, Tammy Jo. The four children \nloved their parents and considered John to be an excellent father. Mr. \nBowling truly cared for the children, which he showed by ensuring \nchaperones came along on all of their dates which were only at church.\n  The family continued to grow when Imogene was approached to take in \nToni, a 21-year-old who did not have a palette in her mouth, had \nlimited hearing in one ear, and no hearing canal in the other ear. \nThough Toni could only communicate through sign language, she quickly \nbecame part of the Bowling family.\n  Crediting faith in God for their success in blending a harmonious \nfamily, John Bowling created a home atmosphere that was accepting of \nanyone who crossed his home's threshold. From adopting his wife's \nchildren, to taking in Toni, to allowing relatives and family friends \nto stay with the family, Big John made his home one of love.\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\n  It is an honor today to pay tribute to my fellow Kentuckian, John \nBowling. Mr. Bowling not only made a family and lovingly raised his \nchildren, but also opened up his home for those in need of a place of \nrefuge and comfort. He is an example of what it means to live by the \nGolden Rule. The Laurel County community is better off today because of \nthe impact ``Big John Bowling'' has made and the compassionate way in \nwhich he treated others.\n  At this time I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. \nJohn Bowling for his service to Laurel County, KY. An article from the \nSentinel Echo: Silver Edition magazine, published in Laurel County, \nrecently highlighted this humble man's invaluable contributions to his \nfamily and community. I ask unanimous consent that said article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [The Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Spring 2012]\n\n                  Jailer by Vocation, Father at Heart\n\n                           (By Nita Johnson)\n\n       Though known more commonly as ``Big John Bowling,'' a \n     former and extremely popular county jailer, John Bowling is \n     also remembered as an excellent father.\n       He was renowned for his kindness and humanity while serving \n     as Laurel County Jailer during the 1970s, traits he showed to \n     both jail employees and inmates and he also displayed to his \n     wife and children at home.\n       Although only one of the five children he raised with his \n     wife, Imogene, was his biological child, Bowling's other \n     children recall him as being a loving father to them.\n       Bowling met Imogene at a church dinner at Piney Grove \n     Holiness Church on Ky. 363 on an invitation from then-pastor \n     Bobby Medley. Bowling and Medley were good friends, and \n     Imogene, who was married at that time, and Medley's wife were \n     good friends, though Bowling and Imogene had never met. When \n     Bowling sampled some macaroni salad at the dinner that \n     Sunday, he was impressed.\n       ``He said he told Bobby that he didn't know who made that \n     macaroni salad, but if she was single, he was going to marry \n     her,'' said his daughter, Joyce Parker. ``So Bobby introduced \n     John to Mom.''\n       That meeting was one of the highlights of Imogene's life. \n     In 1964, her husband was killed in a car crash, leaving her \n     with three children--ages 7, 4, and 2--to raise alone. She \n     had no job, no car, no driver's license, and was herself very \n     ill.\n       ``The day after the funeral, she went to Good Samaritan \n     Hospital,'' Parker explained. ``She was in and out of the \n     hospital five times for 10 days with bleeding ulcers.''\n       ``She'd been eating vanilla wafers and drinking skim \n     milk,'' added Barbara Wells, another daughter.\n       ``She was actually healed from the ulcers,'' Parker said. \n     ``She came home to spend some time with us and went to a \n     revival. The preacher went to her and told her she needed \n     healing. When she went back to the doctor, she didn't have \n     the ulcers.''\n       Once back in good health, Imogene set out to obtain a job. \n     She got her driver's license, bought a car, and began working \n     at Warner's store in London around 1966. She later worked at \n     Hoskins Grocery on Ky. 363, where she met John again when he \n     came into the store one day.\n       The couple began dating, with Imogene insisting on taking \n     the children with her on dates, even though other family \n     members offered to keep the children.\n       ``When she and John dated, she wouldn't go without us,'' \n     Wells said. ``John had a truck with a camper on it and we'd \n     ride in the back and look through the window into the \n     front.''\n       Their union came six years later. The family consisted of \n     Imogene's children, Barbara, Joyce, and Gerald, as well as \n     Imogene's mother, who had lived with them since Imogene's \n     husband died. Eleven months after their marriage, John and \n     Imogene became the parents of Tammy Jo.\n       ``John was always good to us,'' Parker said. ``He hauled \n     trucks from GM dealers and he got us all a new watch so we \n     loved him.''\n       ``He never spanked us,'' Wells added. ``I guess that's why \n     we never resented him. Mom did all the discipline.''\n       ``The kids were never much trouble,'' Bowling said. ``They \n     were always good kids.''\n       Wells, the eldest of the brood, said rules were very strict \n     at the Bowling household, however.\n       ``We had curfews and rules. We had chaperones on our dates, \n     which was only going to church,'' she said. ``There was an \n     old lady that lived near us and, when I had a date, she \n     chaperoned us. Then later on, Joyce and Gerald chaperoned.''\n       ``Then I chaperoned when Joyce dated,'' chimed in Tammy Jo.\n       Children were always welcome at the Bowling household, with \n     nieces and nephews from both sides of the family often living \n     with the family. Imogene also took in disabled adults and \n     elderly persons, as she was certified to keep as many as \n     three at one time.\n       Then the family extended again with the arrival of Toni, \n     who has now lived with the Bowling family for 38 years.\n       ``She was an orphan and was born with deformities,'' \n     Imogene said. ``Her father wanted to just leave her at the \n     hospital (in Philadelphia) but her mother wouldn't do it. She \n     remarried and had another child and died. The stepfather kept \n     (Toni) around until the baby was big enough that he could \n     take care of her and he took her to a mental health office.\n       ``They called me and asked if I could take her,'' Imogene \n     continued. ``She cried every day, all day, for three weeks \n     and I told them I couldn't keep her. Then she started doing \n     better. She's been with us since she was 21 years old.''\n       Toni, who lacked a palette in her mouth and had only 20 \n     percent hearing in one ear and no hearing canal in the other \n     ear, can speak only partially and uses sign language to \n     communicate. But she is as much a part of the Bowling family \n     as the other four children, all of whom express their love \n     for one another.\n       While many question the success of blended families, the \n     Bowling family credits their faith in God and religious \n     background for their own success. They also credit the \n     demeanor of their parents.\n       ``John was not a typical stepfather,'' Parker said. ``He \n     took care of us, always worked hard and my parents never \n     raised their voices.''\n       ``I think one key to blended families is that Mom did the \n     discipline,'' Wells said. ``My husband, Mark, has three \n     stepdaughters and he never spanked them. I did the \n     discipline. I think that is one reason that our family \n     worked. We didn't have that jealousy or resentment or saying \n     that he wasn't the real dad.''\n       Whatever the secret of successfully blended families may \n     be, the Bowlings and their children all agree that staying in \n     church was a key factor. Now approaching their 43rd \n     anniversary in June, the couple continues to stay close to \n     their children, always showing their love and support for one \n     another and celebrating the true meaning of family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/11/senate-section/article/S4887-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4887-S4889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALICE HELTON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Mrs. Alice Helton \nof Laurel County, KY. Though she may have never held public office, \nMrs. Helton invaluably served her community through kindness, \nhospitality, and an unselfish desire to help those around her. On April \n26, 2012, she died at age 94. Her legacy of faith, generosity, and love \nwill survive her in the memories of her family, friends, and the \ncitizens of London, KY.\n  Mrs. Alice Helton, then-Miss Alice Hill, the last of eight children, \nwas born on May 2, 1917, in Keavy, KY, to farmers Mr. John and Mrs. \nSallie Hill. She was raised in the country and lived a simple life. The \nfamily would work together in the fields during the day and on Sundays \nbe visited by neighbors while the children played marbles. Alice, in \nher interview with the Sentinel-Echo for the London Living Treasures \nspecial series, recalled plucking duck feathers with her mother as a \nchild and walking for hours to find ducks to make feather beds and \npillows.\n  At age 7, Alice began attending Keavy School. One of her fondest \nmemories of grade school was spending time at recess with her friends \nthrowing horseshoes and watching boys play basketball. After elementary \nschool, she attended a boarding school called London School. Upon \nfinishing the eighth grade, she returned home, lived with her parents, \nand looked after her siblings' children while they were at work.\n  Alice met William Raymond Helton, a truckdriver from Corbin, KY, when \nshe was 22. Though her family didn't support the relationship, the two \neloped and were married. Mrs. Helton, during the first 17 years of her \nmarriage, had seven children. The family lived in a small house, near \nher parents, which soon became the place where the entire family would \nmeet and spend time together.\n  Her children have many colorful memories of growing up with Mrs. \nHelton. They never questioned her love or willingness to protect the \nfamily because during the week, when her husband was away driving a \ntruck, she would ward off thieves trying to steal the family chickens \nby shooting her rifle toward a row of trees behind the coop. In order \nto avoid becoming a victim of her unique security system, all family \nmembers would call out to her any time they passed the yard.\n  Mrs. Helton was described as a ``magnet'' that drew all of the family \ntogether. She would take on the role of mother to her nieces and \nnephews as her siblings passed away and loved them as if they were her \nown children. Her love also was shown by entertaining them at game \nnights, where\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\ncard games and Yahtzee were the main attraction.\n  Mrs. Helton was more than a wife, mother, grandmother, aunt, and \nmember of the Laurel County community. She was the matriarch of the \nHelton family and the glue that held it together. From talking on the \nphone for hours on end with her children and grandchildren to taking in \nfamily and friends in need, Mrs. Helton lived a life of compassion and \nkindness. After her death, a neighbor said that she tried to live the \nway Jesus lived, but if she only lived half as well as Mrs. Helton, she \nwould be satisfied.\n  It is a privilege to honor the legacy of Mrs. Alice Helton. A true \npillar of the Laurel County community, she was an example for all \nKentuckians of a woman who lived her life with integrity and love. I \nask my fellow colleagues in the Senate to join me in remembering this \nremarkable woman from Laurel County, KY.\n  A recent article published by a Laurel County publication, the \nSentinel-Echo, recognized Mrs. Helton's lifetime of contributions to \nher family and community. I ask unanimous consent that said article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [The Sentinel-Echo, May 16, 2012]\n\n                 Alice Helton Was Surrounded by Family\n\n                           (By Tara Kaprowy)\n\n       Before Alice Helton passed away a few weeks ago, just six \n     days shy of her 95th birthday, she said getting to see her \n     loved ones in heaven would be the best birthday present she \n     could ask for.\n       It was a Thursday afternoon, and Alice's family members had \n     gathered around her hospital bed, which she'd occupied for \n     just a few days. ``She said she was ready to go, and for us \n     to please just let her go peacefully,'' granddaughter Lisa \n     Alexander said. ``She made sure she held each family member's \n     hands, and told them how much she loved them. She told them \n     to love each other and to take care of each other.'' She \n     quietly slipped away around 2 in the afternoon, and the woman \n     who was the magnet that pulled her large family together, and \n     whose home was always described as Grand Central Station, was \n     gone.\n       She had a good, long life. One that started May 2, 1917, in \n     Keavy, ``right across the field'' from her current home on \n     German Lane. The youngest of eight siblings, she was born to \n     John and Sallie Ann Karr Hill. ``Our house was about like a \n     school, there were so many of us,'' Alice said. ``Mommy and \n     poppy were good people.'' John and Sallie were farmers, and \n     ``mommy would do the cooking and we would all come back in \n     from the field and eat dinner; plain old country meals of \n     beans, potatoes, and cornbread. Then we would go out in the \n     field and work and come back and have a cold supper, usually \n     milk and bread.''\n       In addition to farming, John Hill delivered the mail for \n     the U.S. Postal Service. ``Sometimes I'd go with him and he'd \n     deliver those packages on horseback from Vox to Lily. He'd \n     buy me a little candy to eat on while we was gone, that sugar \n     candy.''\n       The Hill home was a plain but happy one, with the kids \n     playing hide and seek and marbles while the adults visited \n     with neighbors on Sunday afternoons in between going to \n     church at Locust Grove and Level Green.\n       It was hot in the house in the summer, with no screens to \n     keep the flies ``and everything else there is to have'' away, \n     and so cold in the winter the dipper would freeze in the \n     water bucket overnight. On snowy days, ``we would pop popcorn \n     on the stove and piece quilts,'' Alice said. Once a week, the \n     family would head to a big spring ``and there was a great, \n     old big rock there we'd use to set our tubs on'' to do \n     laundry. Another tub was used for baths. ``It was a lot of \n     trouble,'' Alice said about bathing when she was a kid, ``but \n     the water stayed pretty warm.'' Alice, being the baby, would \n     always be the last one in the water.\n       One of the chores she keenly remembers was rounding up her \n     mother's paddling of ducks. ``Mommy would pick the feathers \n     off them and make pillows and feather beds,'' Alice said. \n     ``Here we'd go marching down the branch to find her ducks. \n     We'd have to gather them back up and drive them back home. \n     Some later, there they'd go again. We'd go up and down \n     through there catching them. And then we'd go and look for \n     wildflowers up and down the branch. My mom would walk us to \n     death.''\n       Alice's mother made all of her children's clothes, often \n     cobbling together feed sacks for the girls to wear. But Alice \n     didn't mind. ``They were just as comfortable and pretty as \n     store-bought,'' she said.\n       Alice started attending Keavy School at the age of 7--``I \n     didn't want to go when I was 6'' and she quickly made fast \n     friends with Georgia Alsip and Anna Lee Bunch. ``We'd get out \n     and roam around at recess. We'd watch 'em play basketball. \n     Sometimes we'd pitch horseshoe. Back then we had a recess \n     that lasted about half an hour of a morning. Then we had \n     another at dinner, then another half an hour in the evening. \n     We had time to play.''\n       The school was a ``big, white, two-story building with an \n     aisle up through the middle and rooms up each side. There \n     were stairs up each side of the front door.'' One of her \n     teachers, Oscar Parman, boarded with the Hills, and he ``was \n     just like a brother to me.''\n       Following elementary school, Alice went on to London \n     School, where, boarding with her sister in town, she stayed \n     until the eighth grade. She then returned to her parents' \n     house and, since several of her siblings had become teachers \n     and started raising their own families, the care of their \n     children during the day fell to Aunt Alice. She took on the \n     role naturally and was a loving, tender caregiver whose \n     influence long outlasted her babysitting days.\n       At the age of 22, Alice met a man by the name of William \n     Raymond Helton, a truck driver who lived in Corbin, with whom \n     she was soon taken. Though she didn't have the support of her \n     family--``They just didn't think he was the kind I should \n     marry''--Alice got up early one morning, washed a white dress \n     with pink flowers and told her sister, with whom she was \n     living, she was headed down to a revival. ``I got down there \n     at the foot of the hill and he's sitting there on a bench \n     waiting for me and we turned around and went back to Preacher \n     Grubb's house. In other words, we eloped.''\n       Alice and her husband moved into a tiny starter house, and \n     soon she and Raymond started a family. Over the next 17 \n     years, they had seven children--Freda, Herschel, Joan, Wanda, \n     Wayne, Debbie, and Danny--and during World War II moved into \n     their first real home a stone's throw away from her parents. \n     ``It wasn't much because you couldn't get lumber back then \n     because of the war,'' she said. ``They just threw it up as \n     good as they could make it.'' Still, Alice made it her own, \n     and soon it was a popular gathering spot for friends and \n     family.\n       Alice was an indulgent, kind mother, and her children have \n     fond memories of chasing lightning bugs in the twilight, \n     listening to the Grand Ole Opry, watching ``Lassie'' and \n     ``Rin Tin Tin,'' and heading out for ice cream cones at the \n     local dairy drive-in. Though Alice very rarely had a chance \n     to relax, when she did, she liked spending time ``watching \n     the kids play.''\n       But Alice was deeply protective too. ``Daddy would be gone \n     during the week and it was just us kids,'' daughter Joan \n     remembered, laughing. ``She would hear people trying to steal \n     her chickens. So she would make all of us kids get behind the \n     couch and she would get out there and start shooting at the \n     trees, to try and scare them off. My uncle worked for the \n     railroad, and he would have to walk to the end of our road to \n     catch his ride at night. And he'd start hollering, It's me, \n     Alice!' because he didn't want to get shot.''\n       In 1969, Raymond built the family a new, bigger home across \n     the street, and it's there Alice remained, even after Raymond \n     died from Alzheimer's at the age of 83. Though widowed, Alice \n     didn't stop ``being the glue that held us all together,'' \n     Joan said. As she'd done before she married, Alice continued \n     taking care of kids; this time it was her grandchildren whom \n     she would babysit. Her nieces and nephews would constantly \n     visit or call, and when her mother decided she no longer \n     wanted to live alone, she showed up at Alice's door and moved \n     in. ``As our parents passed on, Aunt Alice would say, I'm \n     adopting you now and I have a little job for you to do,' so \n     Aunt Alice became our surrogate mother and we all snuggled \n     under her loving wings to survive our tragedies,'' one of \n     Alice's nieces, Peggy Black, said.\n       During the week and every Sunday, Alice would get together \n     with her siblings for game night, entertaining, and \n     competitive evenings involving Yahtzee, Aggravation, Chinese \n     checkers, and a complicated game called Hand and Foot that \n     required seven decks of playing cards. ``We'd always come in \n     here and we'd hear the dice rolling and we'd say, `It sounds \n     like the casino is open today,' '' granddaughter Lisa \n     recalled. Alice and her brothers and sisters would gather in \n     the kitchen while their children and grandchildren would sit \n     outside to visit, the laughter and drama stemming from the \n     game wafting onto the porch. This tradition continued for \n     decades, with most of Alice's siblings living into their 90s.\n       In the end, Alice was the last of her siblings to survive \n     but continued to be surrounded by family. On the afternoon of \n     her interview, her phone rang nearly every 10 minutes, with \n     family members on the other end calling for a chat. One of \n     her daughters and a granddaughter sat on the couch to ask her \n     questions. And Alice sat in her recliner talking, remembering \n     and smiling at the past.\n       Thoughts from the family:\n       Alice's family said that when she first found out that she \n     not only had been nominated, but also chosen as one of \n     London's Living Treasures, the first thing she said was ``I \n     haven't done anything special to deserve this. I haven't \n     fought in any wars, or held any high positions in the \n     community. I don't know what they will find to write about \n     me.'' We assured her that yes, all the things she had \n     mentioned were indeed important, but that she too had done \n     some pretty important things in her life as well. We told her \n     that when someone needed her she was always there to help, \n     she was kind to people, she made people feel loved and \n     needed, she always made people feel welcome at her home, \n     people always wanted to be around her, she was a loving \n     caregiver, she indeed impacted peoples' lives in a profound \n     way. One example is something that was said about Alice by \n     one of her neighbors--she said\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\n     that she knew she was supposed to try to live her life \n     patterned by the way Jesus had lived his, but that she would \n     feel satisfied if she could just live her life the way Alice \n     Helton had lived hers. Another testimony of how much she was \n     valued by the community was when one of the preachers at her \n     funeral said that he felt as if he was officiating the \n     funeral of ``royalty.''\n       Alice was a special lady to many people, and those who knew \n     her, and loved her, and respected her, will miss her dearly. \n     Her family said that they were so thankful that she was able \n     to do her interview for the London Living Treasures project \n     before she passed. And during her final hours on this earth, \n     it was so clear to them how strong her faith in God was. They \n     said she wasn't scared; she knew where she was going. They \n     said that witnessing that kind of faith was one of the \n     greatest gifts she could have ever given them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/11/senate-section/article/S4889-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Mr. President, today I lift my hold on H.R. 3012, the \nFairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. This bill would eliminate the \nper-country numerical limitations for employment based immigrants and \nchange the per-country numerical limitations for family-based \nimmigrants. When I placed a hold on the bill, I was concerned that the \nbill did nothing to better protect Americans at home who seek high-\nskilled jobs during this time of record unemployment. Today, I lift my \nhold because I have reached an agreement with the senior Senator from \nNew York, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nImmigration, Refugees and Border Security.\n  I have spent a lot of time and effort into rooting out fraud and \nabuse in our visa programs, specifically the H-1B visa program. I have \nalways said this program can and should serve as a benefit to our \ncountry, our economy and our U.S. employers. However, it is clear that \nit is not working as intended, and the program is having a detrimental \neffect on American workers.\n  For many years, Senator Durbin and I have worked on legislation to \nclose the loopholes in the H-1B visa program. Our legislation would \nensure that American workers are afforded the first chance to obtain \nthe available high paying and high skilled jobs in the United States. \nIt would make sure visa holders know their rights. It would strengthen \nthe wage requirements, ridding the incentives for companies to hire \ncheap, foreign labor.\n  While I could not get everything that was included in the Durbin-\nGrassley visa reform bill, there is agreement to include in H.R. 3012 \nprovisions that give greater authority to program overseers to \ninvestigate visa fraud and abuse. Specifically, there will be language \nauthorizing the Department of Labor to better review labor condition \napplications and investigate fraud and misrepresentation by employers. \nThere is also agreement to include a provision allowing the Federal \nGovernment to do annual compliance audits of employers who bring in \nforeign workers through the H-1B visa program.\n  I appreciate the willingness of other members to work with me to \ninclude measures that will help us combat visa fraud, and ultimately \nprotect more American workers. I look forward to working with others as \nH.R. 3012 progresses in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/11/senate-section/article/S4889-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WENDY NELSON-KAUFFMAN\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am delighted to honor one of our \nNation's most dedicated, talented, and influential teachers. Wendy \nNelson-Kauffman, a humanities teacher at the Metropolitan Learning \nCenter in Bloomfield, CT, was recently named as the 2012 Magnet Schools \nof America's National Teacher of the Year.\n  The Metropolitan Learning Center is part of the Capitol Region \nEducation Council, which recognizes annually a teacher who \n``exemplifies excellence in academic achievement through innovative \nprograms that promote equity and diversity for students in Magnet \nSchools.'' This award spotlights the exceptional teachers and schools, \nespecially our Nation's magnet schools, dedicated to equal opportunity. \nThe Metropolitan Learning Center, open to students in 7th through 12th \ngrades in the Greater Hartford Area, is one of Connecticut's finest \ncenters for secondary education.\n  Since 1966, the Capitol Region Education Council has helped lead in \nreforming how we educate our Nation's children. Active in 36 areas of \nConnecticut, administering 120 programs in 20 facilities to more than \n100,000 students annually, this network of dedicated administrators, \neducators, and education reformers has made tremendous impact, \nespecially in underserved communities.\n  Ms. Nelson-Kauffman is renowned at the Metropolitan Learning Center. \nShe has received many awards, including 2003 Connecticut Teacher of the \nYear, 2005 State History Teacher of the Year, and 2011 Capitol Region \nEducation Council Teacher of the Year. But she is most respected for \nher generous energy and passion for changing the lives of our next \ngenerations. More telling than awards are the students who frequently \nshare stories about the time Ms. Nelson-Kauffman dressed up as Rosie \nthe Riveter or traveled with them to Africa and then formed the popular \nafterschool group Student Abolitionists Stopping Slavery.\n  For almost 20 years as an educator at Hamden and Bloomfield High \nSchools and adult education centers, Ms. Nelson-Kauffman has used \nproject-based learning with tremendous success. Her passion for \njournalism fosters an experiential, interactive teaching method. As \nMetropolitan Learning Center's social studies teacher and personal \nproject coordinator for the prestigious International Baccalaureate \nProgram, Ms. Nelson-Kauffman embraces a lifelong love of the past by \nplacing it into the context of the present.\n  She shares her own genuine love of history with her classrooms. In \n2003, invited to attend the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center Teacher \nInstitute, she studied primary resources that unearthed stories of \n19th-century women reformers. With this new background as inspiration, \nshe introduced sensitive topics like abolitionism and racism to her \nhigh school students with tact and grace.\n  As an ambassador to educators around Connecticut, Ms. Nelson-Kauffman \nhas demonstrated the effectiveness of multicultural teaching methods, \nto include travel, activities, group interactions, concerts, and dance. \nHer authenticity is rare and a real treasure. She is a stellar role \nmodel for anyone who mentors or teaches our future leaders. I hope my \nSenate colleagues will join me in congratulating Ms. Nelson-Kauffman, \nwho has helped mitigate apathy and promote enthusiasm for the study of \nhumanities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/11/senate-section/article/S4889-4", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4889-S4890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. BECKY PANEITZ\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dr. Becky \nPaneitz for her dedication, leadership and vision for providing a \nquality, affordable secondary education at NorthWest Arkansas Community \nCollege.\n  Having earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Arkansas \nat Monticello and her master's from the University of Arkansas at \nLittle Rock, Dr. Paneitz understands the unique education challenges in \nArkansas and faced that task head-on. As the President of NWACC for \nnearly a decade, she developed additional opportunities to reach \nstudents by establishing learning centers in the region. These efforts \nincreased student enrollment exponentially. In less than 10 years the \nstudent population nearly doubled, making NWACC one of the largest and \nfastest growing community colleges in the country.\n  To accommodate this record growth, Dr. Paneitz launched an aggressive \nbuilding expansion project on the NWACC campus including the Shewmaker \nCenter for Global Business Development, the Center for Health \nProfessions and the new Student Center.\n  Dr. Paneitz devoted her life to education and that took her across \nthe\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\ncountry from Pueblo Community College in Colorado to Hutchinson \nCommunity College in Kansas and Central Piedmont Community College in \nNorth Carolina. Along the way she found time to earn her doctorate in \nvocational education at Colorado State University.\n  Under Dr. Paneitz's guidance the community college established itself \nas an advocate of child welfare, partnering with the National Child \nProtection Training Center as a regional partner to provide training \nand technical assistance for child protection professionals. This is a \ngreat effort to better serve children in Arkansas and protect the \nwellbeing of children all across the country.\n  I congratulate Dr. Becky Paneitz for her outstanding contributions to \neducation and for her achievements at NWACC. I wish her continued \nsuccess in her future endeavors as she gets ready to move onto the next \nchapter in her life after she retires as the President of Northwest \nArkansas Community College in June 2013. I am grateful for her years of \nservice and leadership to Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/11/senate-section/article/S4890-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES COALITION\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nHealthy Communities Coalition of Lyon and Storey Counties, HCC, for its \ndedication to meeting Nevadans' healthcare needs. The HCC serves 8 of \nNevada's rural areas by partnering with local agencies to provide \nhealth and wellness resources to the Silver State's most remote \ncommunities. I am proud to honor the HCC's commitment to serving the \ncitizens of my home State.\n  Local residents created the HCC in 1995 to provide a safe environment \nfor Nevada's youth by reducing poverty and substance abuse. Adapting to \nNevada's evolving needs, the HCC expanded its resources to provide \nrural Nevadans of all ages with health and wellness resources they \ncould otherwise not access. Promoting healthy communities in Nevada for \nover a decade, the HCC remains dedicated to addressing local needs to \ncapitalize on local strengths.\n  Nevada has been one of the hardest-hit States in this difficult \neconomic climate. Far too many Nevadans are out of work and continue \nfacing great difficulties. I commend and appreciate organizations like \nthe HCC, which offers assistance to struggling Nevadans who depend on \ntheir local resources. The HCC is empowering the communities of rural \nNevada as we work to return America's economy back to a period of \ngreater prosperity.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the HCC for all \nit does for the Silver State. I wish the HCC staff continued success \nand thank them wholeheartedly for their efforts to encourage a healthy \ncommunity for all Nevadans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/11/senate-section/article/S4890-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING BROOKS TRAP MILL\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncommend the tremendous success of Brooks Trap Mill, a family-owned \nlobster trap manufacturer headquartered in Thomaston, ME. The lobster \nindustry is iconic of my home State and the hard work, perseverance, \nand success of everyone at Brooks Trap Mill is emblematic of the strong \ntradition of entrepreneurship in Maine.\n  As former chair and current ranking member of the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, I have had the tremendous privilege of hearing \ncountless small business success stories from hard-working \nentrepreneurs across the country. Simply put, Brooks Trap Mill is one \nof these extraordinary stories. Since its inception in 1946, it has \ngrown to become an indisputable leader in the fishing industry, while \nconsistently creating quality jobs for Mainers. As a critical supplier \nto the commercial lobster industry, as well as other trap fisheries, \nBrooks Trap Mill offers Maine fishermen a vast selection of products to \nhaul their catch. Their extensive inventory ranges from bait, buoys, \nfoul-weather clothing, and rope to traps for lobster, oysters, sea \nbass, and shrimp.\n  Like so many small Maine businesses, Brooks Trap Mill is rooted \nfirmly in family tradition. Founded by Michael Brooks over 60 years ago \nin a stock mill in Rockland, ME, Brooks Trap Mill has expanded \nconsiderably throughout the years but continues to be a family-owned \nand operated business. With three locations, the largest of which \nentails over 45,000 square feet of storage space, Brooks Trap Mill has \naccumulated one of the largest stocks of lobstering materials in the \nindustry. Currently run by the third generation of the family, siblings \nMark, Julie, and Stephen Brooks are fully involved in leading the \nbusiness' success. Under their watch, the company manufactures, sells, \nand distributes nearly 50,000 new lobster traps annually.\n  Brooks Trap Mill is also dedicated to serving its community through \nsupport and participation in a variety of organizations and events \nincluding the Maine Lobstermen's Association; the Maine Lobster \nFestival in Rockland, Maine; and the Festival of Lights Lobster Trap \nTree. Brooks Trap Mill has earned a reputation as a devoted and hard-\nworking fixture of the lobster fishing industry, and its community \nservice is admirable.\n  Through their remarkable growth, ingenuity, and dedication to its \ncustomers, the Brooks family has left an indelible mark on Maine \nmaritime history.

(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') that modifies the scope of the national \nemergency declared in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997, as \nmodified in scope in Executive Order 13448 of October 18, 2007, and \nrelied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13310 of July \n28, 2003, Executive Order 13448 of October 18, 2007, and Executive \nOrder 13464 of April 30, 2008, and takes additional steps with respect \nto that national emergency.\n  In Executive Order 13047, the President found that the Government of \nBurma committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in \nBurma after September 30, 1996, and further determined that the actions \nand policies of the Government of Burma constitute an unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States. To address that threat and to implement section 570 of \nthe Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Appropriations \nAct, 1997 (Public Law 104-208), the President in Executive Order 13047 \nprohibited new investment in Burma. On July 28, 2003, the President \nissued Executive Order 13310, which contained prohibitions implementing \ncertain provisions of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 \n(Public Law 108-61) and blocked the property and interests in property \nof persons listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13310 or determined \nby the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState, to meet designation criteria specified in\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\nExecutive Order 13310. In Executive Order 13448, the President expanded \nthe scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047, \nincorporated existing designation criteria set forth in Executive Order \n13310, blocked the property and interests in property of persons listed \nin the Annex to Executive Order 13448, and provided additional criteria \nfor designations of other persons. In Executive Order 13464, the \nPresident blocked the property and interests in property of persons \nlisted in the Annex to Executive Order 13464 and provided additional \ncriteria for designations of other persons.\n  While the Government of Burma has made progress towards political \nreform in a number of areas, including by releasing hundreds of \npolitical prisoners, pursuing ceasefire talks with several armed ethnic \ngroups, and pursuing a substantive dialogue with the democratic \nopposition, this reform is fragile. I support this reform in Burma and \nthe building of a democratic political process that will allow all of \nthe people of Burma to be represented. However, I have found that the \ncontinued detention of political prisoners, efforts to undermine or \nobstruct the political reform process, efforts to undermine or obstruct \nthe peace process with ethnic minorities, military trade with North \nKorea, and human rights abuses in Burma particularly in ethnic areas, \neffectuated by persons within and outside the Government of Burma, \nconstitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. To address this situation, the \norder imposes additional measures with respect to Burma.\n  The order provides criteria for designations of persons determined by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with or at the \nrecommendation of the Secretary of State:\n  To have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the \npeace, security, or stability of Burma, such as actions that have the \npurpose or effect of undermining or obstructing the political reform \nprocess or the peace process with ethnic minorities in Burma;\n  To be responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, \ncontrolling, or otherwise directing, or to have participated in, the \ncommission of human rights abuses in Burma;\n  To have, directly or indirectly, imported, exported, reexported, sold \nor supplied arms or related materiel from North Korea or the Government \nof North Korea to Burma or the Government of Burma;\n  To be a senior official of an entity that has engaged in the acts \ndescribed above;\n  To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in \nsupport of, the acts described above or any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to the order; or\n  To be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act \nfor or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property \nand interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order.\n  I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \npowers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry \nout the purposes of the order.\n  All agencies of the United States Government are directed to take all \nappropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions \nof the order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, July 11, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/11/senate-section/article/S4891-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 4:13 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2061.

A bill to amend section 704 of title 18, United States Code; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today in response \nto a recent Supreme Court holding that invalidated the provisions of \nwhat has become known as the Stolen Valor Act of 2006. The Supreme \nCourt decision regarded a place in the Stolen Valor Act that made all \nfalse statements about the receipt of military decorations a crime. It \nstates that this act, in the view of the Court:\n\n       . . . seeks to control and suppress all false statements on \n     this one subject in almost limitless times and settings \n     without regard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of \n     material gain.\n\n  Basically what the Supreme Court was saying is that we cannot freeze \nall first amendment rights to make claims about anything in this \nsociety unless there was a purpose at the end of it in terms of some \nsort of a material gain.\n  I understand and fully accept the Court's holding in this case about \nthe overly broad measures of the Stolen Valor Act of 2006. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is designed to remedy this issue and \nto bring criminal penalties to those who falsely claim military service \nor the receipt of unearned awards, medals, and ribbons if these \nstatements were made in pursuit of a tangible benefit or a personal \ngain.\n  This legislation is drafted under the guidance of the holding of the \nSupreme Court in this case. I am a strong believer in the first \namendment. I believe it is sacrosanct in our society. I believe the \nfreedom to speak one's mind and to dissent when one opposes a proposal \nor an issue or a government policy is the very foundation of a truly \nfree society.\n  At the same time, the very special reverence with the first amendment \nshould be measured against the equally special place our society holds \nfor military service. There are strongly emotional reasons that this is \nso and there are clearly other tangible benefits that derive from \nmilitary service.\n  I would point out something that for many of us seems obvious, but I \nthink it needs to be restated as we consider the Supreme Court decision \non the Stolen Valor Act and what the implications are for the \nlegislation I am introducing. The experience of military service, \nparticularly hard combat, is a unique phenomenon in our society. There \nwas a saying when I was in the Marine Corps many years ago that ``For \nthose who have fought for it, freedom has a flavor that the protected \nshall never know.'' Once someone has been in hard combat, they will \nnever see life around them in the same way again. That doesn't mean \nthey will be worse or particularly better or damaged or in some way \nempowered, but for the rest of their lives they will truly see a lot of \nthings differently. They will have seen horrible events that strain \ntheir emotions, yet increase their ability to understand tragedy and to \nvalue human courage in many different stripes and forms. They will have \nlearned to appreciate the inherent contradictions between the pristine \nintellectual debates about war and the reality of a blood-soaked \nbattlefield where decisions must be made in an instant while human \nlives hang precariously in the balance.\n  These lives comprise the burden and the value of military service. \nNeither the scars nor the lessons disappear when one leaves the \nbattlefield or when one leaves the military. The men and women who step \nforward to serve carry this burden and share these values for the rest \nof their lives. Our veterans have given a portion of themselves to our \ncountry, and our country has always been good at reciprocating. Our \nveterans love America and America loves our veterans.\n  It is important to understand the impact that military service can \nhave on one's life in order to comprehend what a disservice it is for \nothers to pretend to have served. There is an old country song that \nsays ``You've got to suffer if you want to sing the blues.'' Those who \nhave not served, have not paid the price that comes with earning that \nrespect. In many cases they are indeed attempting to gain tangible \nbenefits that have been designed to reward and honor military service \nwhen they pretend to have served.\n  Here are a few of those benefits that are in the legislation I am \noutlining: benefits relating to the military service provided by the \nFederal Government or a State or local government; the ability to gain \nemployment or professional advancement; financial remuneration, for \ninstance, receiving money for books or writings related to the notion \nof having served; seeking an effect\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\non the outcome of criminal or civil court proceedings; and seeking to \nimpact one's personal credibility in a political campaign. There are \nothers, but those are clearly tangible benefits that come from stating \nthat one served in the military when one did not.\n  The journey of this Stolen Valor legislation begins with one \nindividual whom I have known for a very long time. His name is Jug \nBurkett. He was a Vietnam veteran, like myself. He grew up in the \nmilitary. His father had a career in the military. He identified this \nproblem many years ago and looked at the impact of those who had \nclaimed to have served or who had claimed to have served in areas where \nthey did not on all the areas I just mentioned.\n  He wrote a book many years called ``Stolen Valor.'' He had quite a \njourney with this book and has pursued the issue of honesty and \nintegrity in our legal process and in other ways. It was largely \nbecause of Jug Burkett's effort that the Stolen Valor Act was passed in \n2006.\n  I do not believe the Supreme Court decision in any way invalidates \nthe concerns Jug Burkett and others have had. In fact, I think what we \nare doing with this legislation is to make sure proper concerns are \nlaid out without being overly broad so that any words said in a bar \nroom or someone sitting around personally is not going to have legal \nauthorities measuring every single word anyone says.\n  We have designed this very specifically with respect to the concerns \nthe Supreme Court laid out. I may be offering this bill as an amendment \nto the National Defense Authorization Act. My hope is this amended \nlanguage could gain the support of all of our colleagues and that we \ncould move this bill quickly, perhaps as an independent bill.\n  This bill respects the first amendment. It respects military service, \nand it assures a special place in our society that has always been \nreserved for those who have stepped forward and gone into harm's way on \nour behalf.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 3375. A bill to designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain National \nConservation Area in the State of California, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Berryessa \nSnow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. Congressman Mike Thompson \nrecently introduced companion legislation to this bill in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I thank him for all of the work he has done on \nadvancing this initiative.\n  This important legislation designates 319,000 acres of public lands \nin Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and Yolo Counties as the Berryessa Snow \nMountain National Conservation Area, or NCA. The area is a haven for \nhiking, camping, rafting, and horseback riding, and is home to a \ndiverse array of wildlife including black bears and bald eagles.\n  My bill does not add any new lands to the Federal Government--the \nlands included in this NCA are already managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Forest Service. A \nNational Conservation Area designation will require these three \nagencies to develop a multi-agency management plan in consultation with \nstakeholders and the public, improving coordination on wildlife \npreservation, habitat restoration, and recreational opportunities. \nCreation of the NCA will also help the agencies take a more coordinated \napproach to preventing and fighting wildfires, combating invasive \nspecies and water pollution, and stopping the spread of illegal \nmarijuana growth.\n  By unifying these individual places under one banner, my bill helps \nput the Berryessa Snow Mountain region on the map as a destination for \nnew visitors. This region is one of the most biologically diverse, yet \nleast known regions of California. By raising its profile, an NCA \ndesignation will boost tourism and increase business opportunities in \nthe region's gateway communities. The Outdoor Industry Association has \nestimated that outdoor recreation supports 408,000 jobs and contributes \n$46 billion annually to California's economy, underscoring the immense \npotential of sites such as the proposed Berryessa Snow Mountain NCA to \ndrive local economic growth. Additionally, the region will become \nrecognized by more people as uniform signage and publications are \ncreated to reach more diverse audiences, allowing them to learn more \nabout this beautiful area.\n  Finally, this designation enables more people to share in the \nmanagement of these wonderful resources through the creation of a \npublic advisory committee. Local citizens, outdoor enthusiasts, \nbusiness owners, and other stakeholders will be granted an official \navenue to provide input on how to best care for these beautiful rivers, \nridges, forests, canyons, and creeks, along with their diverse plant \nand wildlife species.\n  Creation of this proposed National Conservation Area has strong \nsupport from a large coalition of local governments, elected officials, \nbusiness owners, landowners, farmers, private individuals, and many \nconservation and recreation groups. This bill is the culmination of a \ngrassroots effort of concerned citizens taking the initiative to care \nfor the beautiful areas in their communities, and I am proud to support \ntheir work and commitment.
