Madam President, I am going to take a few minutes today to \ntalk about a friend of Nevada's and a friend of mine. This man is from \nthe other side of the world. His name is Manny Pacquiao. He is in \nWashington today. Every time I visit with him, I come away more \nimpressed than the last time.\n  Although those of us who serve here are close with our colleagues in \nthe U.S. Congress--and some even achieve celebrity status inside the \nbeltway itself, the so-called beltway bubble--few of our names and \nfaces are recognizable beyond our shores.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy was an exception to that rule with fame he earned \nthrough the decades he and his family dedicated to public service. So \nwas Senator Clinton--and in her current role as Secretary of State, \neven more of the world recognizes and respects her. I traveled to \nEurope with Senator John Glenn. He was a rock star all over Europe. He \nwas a global hero because he orbited the globe.\n  But no one in our national legislature comes close to the level of \nworldwide fame of the Congressman from the\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\nsouthern tip of the Philippines, Manny Pacquiao.\n  The bond between the Philippines and the United States is deep and \nstrong. During World War II, when the Pacific nation was a commonwealth \nof this country, brave and patriotic Filipino troops served under the \nAmerican flag. With the leadership of Senator Dan Inouye, who acted so \nheroically in the Second World War, we fought in the legislative \nbranches of our government to give those troops, those Filipino troops, \nthe well-deserved and long-overdue pensions they earned during a time \nof war.\n  Now Congressman Pacquiao is a Member of Congress from the \nPhilippines. He is also a boxer who holds many other titles than that \nof Congressman. He holds the title of Super Welterweight Champion. He \nis the only person in the history of boxing to hold eight world titles. \nHe is the first person in history to win 10 world titles in 8 different \nweight divisions. He started out being a champion at 106 pounds.\n  He has fought them all. He has fought people who outweighed him 35, \n40 pounds. He has been declared the fighter of the decade and three \ntimes the fighter of the year. He is rated the No. 1 pound-for-pound \nbest boxer in the world. From Flyweight to Light Middleweight Champion, \nWelterweight Champion, Lightweight Champion--no other boxer in history \nhas achieved what he has achieved.\n  He is an ambitious young man with a closet full of championship belts \nand the start of a promising political career already under his belt. I \nam most gratified, as I mentioned, that he is a friend of Nevada's, \nwhere his sport is a major player in our economic arena. He is someone \nI really admire.\n  Manny Pacquiao and I come from opposite sides of the globe, but in \nour hearts we come from the same place. Manny grew up with nothing. He \nwas just a kid when he had to leave his home and live in the streets. \nHe started fighting in the streets and went into the ring where he \ncertainly has been one of the all-time greats.\n  He fought for money when he was a mere boy. He has done so well in \nlife. He has fought to get an education he was not able to get as a \nyoung boy. He is married to a wonderful woman named Jinkee. They have \nfour children. He is a devout Roman Catholic. When he stepped into the \nring for the first time, it changed his life.\n  He is a fighter. I have talked about that. There is near unanimous \nagreement he is the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet today \nand perhaps ever, and that takes into consideration some great \nfighters--Sugar Ray Leonard, Sugar Ray Robinson.\n  He is a man who is so fun to watch. In his last fight--I watched that \nfight--he was outweighed by some 30 pounds. He won the fight. He won \nevery round of that fight, and the man he fought had been a champion. \nBut he knows it is not enough just to fight for yourself--and he does \nthat very well--or to be a world champion many times over. You have to \nbe a champion for others. That is what he believes.\n  He is very tough--we know that--not because he can take punches as \nforcefully as he gives one but because he fights for those who cannot \nfight for themselves.\n  The large and vibrant Filipino community in Nevada looks up to Manny, \nas do Filipinos and fight fans all over the world. He sets a welcome \nexample of an athlete who does good for many. He is someone who is not \nin public service for fame or glory or money but because he knows his \npeople need his advice and need his voice.\n  He is a friend, I repeat, of Nevada's, a friend of America, and--I am \nhappy to say--a friend of mine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S706-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, when President Obama released his budget \nyesterday, he made one thing very clear: getting our economy back above \nwater will require shared sacrifice.\n  Few documents are more intricate and complex than our national \nbudget. But beyond the numbers, what I found deep in this budget is an \naffirmation of our principles. Among those values is a commitment to \nrecognize and adapt to reality--investing in what works and changing \nwhat does not.\n  I appreciate the President's call for shared sacrifice and living \nwithin our means and, more than that, his willingness to do more than \njust talk but actually lead toward fiscal responsibility. He did not \njust talk about tough choices, he made them. I do not agree with all of \nhis choices. I disagree with some of his cuts. But I cannot deny that \nby making the difficult decisions he showed leadership.\n  I also found in the President's budget the recognition that we are \nnot in a competition to determine who can cut the most; rather, we need \nto cooperate to discover where we can cut the smartest.\n  This budget proposes a long-term plan to responsibly cut the deficit \nin half in President Obama's first term. It does not do that by blindly \nchopping zeros off bottom lines or eliminating programs wholesale. It \ninvests in that which will grow our economy--such as education, such as \ninnovation, and such as infrastructure.\n  It does not buy into the partisan talking point that there is no \ndifference between spending and investing, because there is. In other \nwords, it recognizes we can lower the deficit not just by subtraction \nbut also by addition. When we invest in education, we create a smarter \nand stronger workforce. When we invest in innovation, we create jobs \nbefore the rest of the world beats us to those jobs. When we invest in \nour infrastructure--from the interstates to the Internet--we lay the \nfoundation for prosperity.\n  I am disappointed the congressional Republicans seem to have learned \nnothing from recent history. They are again trying to slash the \nprograms that keep us safe and eliminate the programs that keep us \ncompetitive. They are still fighting for billions in special breaks for \noil and gas companies, the insurance industry, and billionaires.\n  In the last few days, the former president of Chevron oil said: We \ndon't need those subsidies. But yet Republicans are fighting for \nsubsidies for oil companies when the oil company executives say they do \nnot need them.\n  We have already tried it their way. They are fighting and \nsubstantiating billions in special breaks for oil and gas companies, \nthe insurance industry, and billionaires. We tried it. It does not \nwork. That is why we are in the mess we are in. But the Republican \nreaction to the President's budget has been an attempt to go back in \ntime.\n  If they want to time travel in search of fiscal responsibility, they \nshould not stop at President Bush's failed administration; they should \nkeep going to his predecessor's, when we balanced the budget with \nPresident Clinton.\n  We live in the present and we budget for the future. We have spending \nchallenges before us. We cannot afford to forget those challenges will \nnot be solved by extreme rhetoric or unrealistic idealism. They will be \nsolved only when reasonable partners are willing to come to negotiate \nwith responsible proposals that find a critically important balance: \none that brings down our deficit while keeping our economy moving in \nthe right direction.\n  When we find that middle ground, we will leave the next generation \nwith an economy they can count on, with the confidence we seek in our \nfuture, and with the knowledge that when difficult decisions need to be \nmade, Americans do not shirk that responsibility; when presented with a \ntough choice, we make it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S706-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the President presented to Congress a \nbudget. It is the annual process or ritual where the President makes \nthe first move, presenting a budget, and then Congress responds. The \nHouse and\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\nthe Senate come up with a budget resolution within the confines of the \nPresident's spending and decide how to spend money. We are now at that \nphase. But I want to say a word about what the President suggested and \nwhat we are hearing from across the Rotunda from the House Republicans.\n  The President understands we have two challenges as a nation. The \nfirst is to create more jobs because we have too many people out of \nwork. Secondly, we need to reduce our deficit. It seems they are cross-\npurposes, but they do not have to be.\n  The President is trying to chart a course that moves us forward in a \nresponsible way, cutting spending where it will not hurt economic \nrecovery and growth and investing with the Federal funds we will spend \nin programs that count. He has talked about an agenda for more \neducation, more innovation, more infrastructure, and economic growth. \nThat is the appropriate balance.\n  However, when we look at what the Republicans have done in the House \nof Representatives, we see they have ignored that balance. They believe \njust cutting spending by itself, without concern about the impact, is \nbest for America's future, but it defies our common human experience. \nIf we said to our family just starting out: There are going to be tough \neconomic times ahead; there are some things we will have to do without, \nbut is there one thing we want to make certain we invest in, most \nfamilies would say: Well, we want to get the kids educated. We want to \nmake sure our children go to school because that is their only chance. \nIf they don't get a good education, their lives are not going to be as \nfull. They will not make as great a contribution. The same thing is \ntrue at the national level. What the President has suggested is, we \nneed sound investment in education.\n  Unfortunately, the House Republicans, in their approach, cut some of \nthe most basic programs when it comes to education. The President \nunderstands--and I think all of us appreciate--the United States has \nslipped from first to No. 6 in the world in the percentage of high \nschool graduates going to college. How can we be more competitive in \nthis century? How can we expect to attract good businesses and the \nright kind of inventors and innovators who will spark growth in our \neconomy if we don't have more of our students attending and graduating \nfrom college?\n  We have also slipped from 1st to 12th in the percentage of people \nholding college degrees. America better wake up and look around the \nworld. I recently spoke at a commencement for a law school in Chicago, \nand I was surprised when it came to the master's degrees in law. Those \nare advanced degrees. Anyone with that degree has been in school at \nleast 20 years of their life. When I looked at the graduates with \nmaster's degrees from a law school in the city of Chicago, more than \nhalf of them were women from China. I thought to myself: I never would \nhave dreamed this. During my time--and this goes back quite a few \nyears--there weren't that many women in law school. Now they make up \nthe majority of law students. But who would have guessed that Chinese \nwomen would have the majority of graduate degrees from a law school in \nChicago? Wake up, America. That is what is happening.\n  China, India, and other countries are focused on promoting education \nfor those with the skills to lead their countries in the future. Can we \ndo anything less? Our Nation's strength lies in its ability to \noutcompete and outinnovate every other country in the world. We can't \ndo it if we are not preparing the next generation of scientists, \nentrepreneurs, and innovators.\n  Let's take a look at what the House Republicans did. They are \npromising we can cut off investments in education, even as quickly as \nthe remainder of this fiscal year, and still prosper. I question that. \nThey released their continuing resolution for the fiscal year on Friday \nnight. Their proposal cuts $4.9 billion in education programs from \nprekindergarten through college, the money that helps schools teach and \nhelps students get to college. Here is what they cut: $1.1 billion from \nHead Start, a program that helps low-income, disadvantaged kids enter \nkindergarten ready to learn. The Presiding Officer has seen these Head \nStart programs, and I have too. We think to ourselves: Where would \nthese kids be without it? Many of them come from single-parent \nfamilies, and many of their parents are struggling, making basic \nminimum wage and hardly any more, and this is where they send their \nkids during the day so the kids, at an early age--3, 4, and 5 years \nold--are exposed to socialization, getting to know other children, \nhaving mentors and teachers in the room, and learning the basics. Then, \nwhen the day comes when they are ready to go to kindergarten, they are \ntruly prepared and ready to go. The House Republicans' cut in Head \nStart would drop 127,000 low-income preschoolers from the program--over \n5,000 in Illinois. That means cutting the rolls by 20 percent and \nlaying off 55,000 teachers and staff. So is that where we start to \nbuild for the future, by taking these children out of the Head Start \nclassrooms and laying off 55,000 teachers? What does that say about the \nfuture of those children? Will it be as good or worse? I think we know \nthe answer to that.\n  Under the House Republicans' proposal, $700 million would be cut from \nschools serving more than 1 million disadvantaged students. We \nunderstand, because we are testing, that kids who go to school and who \nhappen to be from lower income families, disadvantaged families, many \ntimes don't do as well. We know it. We see it in the test scores. We \ntry to put money into the districts, for what purpose? To reduce the \nsize of the class, provide extra help, including mentoring and teaching \nafter school, and give these students who would otherwise fall behind \nand might drop out a chance to succeed. Well, the Republicans say: \nThere is an area to cut. They take $700 million out and end up firing \n10,000 teachers in these programs--over 280 of those from schools in my \nState.\n  Innovative programs that are working today to move our States toward \nreform in education would be seriously cut. Race to the Top gave to our \nSecretary of Education, Arne Duncan, incentives of millions of dollars \nto offer to States if they will do things that are bold, innovative, \nand successful in improving education. It is interesting that the first \ntwo States to be awarded, if I am not mistaken, were Delaware and \nTennessee. It is pretty clear the Department of Education wasn't \nlooking for any political agenda here; they were looking for States \ntruly committed to reform. I am sorry Illinois didn't make the cut. One \nwould have thought the President's State might have had an advantage. \nWe didn't make it. In fairness, there are things we could have done \nthat would have improved our chances. But other States changed the \nlaws, moved forward, to try to make sure there is accountability in \neducation as well as good results.\n  What did the House Republicans think about that? Well, they think we \nshould cut that, dramatically cut that program.\n  They would cut Pell grants by $845 per student. What does that mean? \nI know the Senator now presiding over the Senate, similar to myself, \nhas met many of the students receiving Pell grants. A lot of these kids \ncome from families where no one has ever gone on to college. Many of \nthem come from low-income families who can't give them any financial \nsupport, and many of them struggle to try to stay in school and still \ntake a job and earn enough money to get by. The Pell grant helps them. \nThe Pell grant says: If you are from a low-income family, we are going \nto give you a helping hand. To say we are going to cut that grant means \nmany of these students will not be able to continue in school. They \nwill quit. Some may return at a later time; many will not. We will have \nwasted an opportunity for young, ambitious students who use the Pell \ngrants and student loans to have an education that can lead somewhere.\n\n  I might say, in fairness, that I know a little bit about this subject \nbecause I went to college and law school borrowing money from the \nFederal Government. Had I not been able to do that, I am not sure I \nwould be standing here today. It gave me my chance. I still had to go \nto classes and take the tests and earn the grades and eventually pass \nthe bar exam, but the fact is that money made all the difference in the \nworld to me. There was no way my widowed mother was ever going to pay\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\nfor my education in those days. She couldn't do it.\n  That was my story. Now repeat that story millions of times across \nAmerica and ask ourselves: What are the House Republicans thinking? \nThey are going to cut Pell grants for these students who are struggling \nto go through college? Why would we do that when 80 percent of our \nNation's fastest growing jobs require higher education? In Illinois, an \nestimated 61,000 students are going to see their Pell grants \nsignificantly reduced or eliminated.\n  The House Republicans also want to eliminate $1.5 billion in grants \nto States for job training. When we think about the number of \nunemployed in America today and how few of them will be able to return \nto the same job they left, we understand they need new skills, new \ntraining. They have to move into new areas of opportunity. Job training \noffers that. The Republicans eliminate it.\n  Now take a look at what the President does. The President makes a \ndramatic cut in spending, freezing our spending, reducing our spending \nby over $400 billion over the next 5 years, and bringing domestic \ndiscretionary spending in America as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct down to a level lower than it was in the 1950s under President \nEisenhower. So he calls for sacrifice, as we should. But the President \nunderstands the importance of education. His budget includes $8.1 \nbillion for Head Start to serve nearly 1 million children and families. \nIt includes $1.3 billion to support almost 2 million children and \nfamilies through the childcare development block grant program.\n  The President's budget also includes $26.8 billion, an increase of \nabout 7 percent, for elementary and secondary education, focused on \nraising standards, encouraging innovation, and rewarding success.\n  Last week, the heads of many school districts in Illinois came to see \nme. They are struggling. We can understand why. With real estate prices \ngoing down and values going down, property tax receipts are not what \nthey used to be. Our State is in bankruptcy. It doesn't have the money \nto send back to school districts. A small amount--about 5 percent that \ncomes from the Federal Government--is important to them. If Republicans \nhave their way, that amount will be reduced. The President tries to \nmaintain that contribution from the Federal level to help local school \ndistricts.\n  There is something else the President does which I think is essential \nto better education. He invests $185 million for a new Presidential \nteaching fellows program which would provide scholarships to talented \nand aspiring teachers who commit to teaching for 3 years in a high-\nneeds school. It also invests $80 million to improve teacher training \nin the STEM subjects--science, technology, engineering, and math.\n  I think most would agree the success of an education depends, first, \nin my case and many others, on strong family support and encouragement \nbut also on the quality of the teacher in the classroom. We want to \nmake sure we have the best teachers so we have the best students, the \nbest graduates who are then in the best position to compete in the \nyears ahead.\n  The President's budget maintains a maximum Pell grant award of $5,550 \nper year, ensuring nearly 8 million students across the country can \ncontinue to pursue a college degree.\n  There is also money in the President's budget for worker training, \nwhich we desperately need.\n  There is also an investment of $1.4 billion in competitive programs \nto bring about reform in education, including the Early Learning \nChallenge Fund, spurring States to improve quality; the new Race to the \nTop, bringing resources to school districts willing to make reforms; \nand a new First in the World competition, which encourages colleges and \nuniversities to demonstrate success in graduating more high-needs \nstudents and preparing them for employment.\n  There are skeptics who believe that no matter what the government \ndoes, it is not going to create jobs or create opportunity in America. \nI think we can go too far in selling the government's role, and we \nshouldn't. But we can understand in education that the government's \nrole does make a difference.\n  I try to calculate in my mind. It has been barely 50 or 54 years \nsince we made a decision in Congress that we were going to invest in \nstudent loans to help young people go to college--the same program that \nhelped me go to college. It happened after Sputnik was launched and we \nwere concerned about the Russian effort to put satellites in outer \nspace, followed by missiles, followed by a Cold War face-off that we \nmight experience. So we said we need more engineers and scientists and \nmore college grads. We made the investment and it worked. We not only \nmade it to the Moon, but we moved the American economy forward to lead \nthe world in the last half of the 20th century. It was no accident. \nPart of it was the investment of our government in education for our \ncitizens. The President believes we have to keep that commitment. I \nagree with him.\n  I think the House Republicans have gone too far in their cuts. I \nthink they start with the skepticism that government cannot do anything \nright. Many of them were the beneficiaries of college student loans \nthrough the government, and they have forgotten. They shouldn't. \nFamilies across America count on it, and we should too. We have to make \nsure we have a strong budget that cuts deficits--and I agree we must--\nbut maintains essential economic investment. Congress needs to enact a \nplan that will lead to fiscal sustainability over the long term if we \nwant to ensure a strong economic future. The President has provided an \nexcellent starting point in that conversation.\n  Madam President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the time consumed in any quorum call during the period of morning \nbusiness be charged equally to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

ROGERS WADE\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise to speak for a few minutes about \na gentleman whose 70th birthday will be celebrated next Monday night in \nAtlanta, GA. He is a gentleman who has deep ties to the Senate. His \nname is T. Rogers Wade.\n  He came to the Senate in 1973 as an administrative assistant and \nlater chief of staff to Georgia Senator Herman Talmadge. During those \nyears, Senator Talmadge was chairman of the powerful Agriculture \nCommittee which, in my State of Georgia, is instrumental. Rogers Wade \nis one of those unique people whom all of us, such as the Presiding \nOfficer and myself, are lucky enough to have in our offices, somebody \nwho supports us, keeps us moving in the right direction, helps us back \nhome with our people--in other words, kind of drives our ship of State. \nMy chief of staff does. Rogers Wade did it for Herman Talmadge.\n  He took those talents and brought them back to Georgia after 1980 to \ndo a number of memorable and tremendous things. For example, when he \nfirst came back he founded a firm called Edington Wade & Associates, a \npublic affairs firm that represented many Fortune 500 companies \nthroughout the State of Georgia and their locations.\n  Following that, he did many other things in Georgia. He founded \nLeadership Georgia, a program today celebrating over 40 years in our \nState, generating new leaders for our State. It is a great program. He \ncame to the Fanning Institute of Leadership at the University of \nGeorgia and serves on its board. He serves on the board of the Richard \nRussell Foundation. Most importantly, he is a can-do guy who became \npresident of something known as the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, \nan organization that is nonpartisan and dedicates itself to opine on \nlegislation going through the Georgia Legislature or initiatives coming \nbefore the people on the ballot to give them an unvarnished, \nnonpolitical, straight-talk expression of what that law or what that \nissue would be. It has become one of the most respected foundations in \nour State and, in fact, around\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\nthe country. He served as president of that foundation from 1997 to \n2009 and today is a trustee of the foundation.\n  One of the interesting things T. Rogers Wade did--a lot of people \ntalk about what they want to do to reform education and help kids in \nneed. T. Rogers Wade did it. He founded something called Tech High in \nAtlanta, GA, a school in an old dilapidated building that he raised the \nmoney to rehabilitate. He brought in excellent faculty in STEM math and \nscience and opened it as a charter school approved by the State of \nGeorgia for the most in need, free-and-reduced-lunch kids in the \nmetropolitan city of Atlanta public school system. He began attracting \nthose kids to that charter school. So successful has Tech High been \nthat Arne Duncan, the Secretary of Education, chose it to be one of his \nfirst visits after he became Secretary of Education under President \nObama. It still is a guiding light today of what can be done, with a \nfocus on excellence and helping kids in need to brighten their future.\n  Just recently, with the election of Nathan Deal as the new Governor \nof Georgia, he picked one person out of our State to guide him in his \ntransition team. It was T. Rogers Wade.\n  T. Rogers Wade has touched the lives of American servicemen by being \non the board of the USO, Georgia businesses by being on the board of \nthe chamber of commerce, and citizens around our State by being the \npresident of the Public Policy Foundation.\n  Next Monday night, I am going to have dinner with a great Georgian \nand great American. And I rise at this moment on the floor of the \nSenate to pay tribute to T. Rogers Wade on the occasion of his 70th \nbirthday.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S709-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I realize we are in morning business, \nbut I rise to oppose the McCain amendment to the FAA bill, which will \nprobably come up later when we get to the bill.\n  The McCain amendment will eliminate the Essential Air Service \nProgram. I applaud my colleague for exploring ways to address our \ndeficit, and I want to join him in looking for opportunities to control \nspending, but this is one program we must preserve. We won't improve \nthe deficit by stifling local economies.\n  The Department of Transportation estimates that 1.1 million travelers \nfrom more than 150 communities rely on the Essential Air Service \nProgram. The Essential Air Service Program is a promise to rural \nAmerica, which absolutely needs airports for economic development, as \nnoted in the 2009 Journal of Rural Studies report entitled, ``The \nEconomic Importance of Air Travel in High-Amenity Rural Areas.''\n  Nearly half of the American West consists of publicly owned lands \ncontaining mountain ranges, forests, rivers, lakes, parks, and areas \nfor wilderness, wildlife, and grazing. Many people come to the West to \nvisit--especially from the East--especially in the summer, to go fly \nfishing, camping, for tourism, and in the winter for skiing. People \nenjoy public lands in the West. We have so many public lands in the \nWest, we don't have private land for development. This means we have \ntremendous distances between population centers, and we need reliable \nair travel to ensure jobs, private enterprise, and access to medical \nassistance.\n  Montana is primarily a rural State. We rank 47th in population--that \nis only three States with less populace than we--while being the fourth \nlargest in land mass. To put it differently, although we are slightly \nlarger than the country of Japan, we have fewer citizens than the State \nof Rhode Island, the smallest State in the Nation.\n  Montana has eight Essential Air Service communities: Sidney, \nGlendive, Wolf Point, Miles City, Glasglow, Havre, and West \nYellowstone. The first seven rely on industries such as agricultural \nand mineral extraction--industries that are vital to America's growth \nand industries which exist in rural America rather than in downtown \nmetropolitan areas. A couple of those airports also lie near Indian \nreservations where economic needs are paramount. Without the Essential \nAir Service all these areas risk isolation.\n  In 2008, Montana's Essential Air Service provider went out of \nbusiness. We lost air travel for months. At this point, I want to read \na passage from a recent Great Falls Tribune article to illustrate the \nimpact on jobs and the economy. It says:\n\n       When Havre, a city of about 10,000 people, lost its air \n     service . . . BNSF Railway closed its local office and moved \n     its operation to Billings.\n\n  Think of that. Think of the irony. The railroad needs reliable air \nservices. They didn't have them so they moved to another location. That \nshows how interconnected our economy is.\n  I want to take this opportunity to also announce that I have launched \na Senate Essential Air Service Caucus. Senator Collins from Maine is \ncochairman of the bipartisan caucus, and several other Democratic and \nRepublican Senators have already joined us, and I encourage my other \ncolleagues to join and stand with us.\n  It is important to rein in the deficit. That is clear. But let us be \nresponsible about how we do it. Pulling the rug out from under programs \nsuch as Essential Air Service will shrink the economy rather than \nshrinking the deficit. I will not turn my back on communities that rely \non this program as a lifeline.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank my friend from West Virginia. He is a good man.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the legislation \nthat is pending before us. We all know this country faces big \nchallenges. We face a declining infrastructure that is critical to our \nbusiness. We need safe, reliable transportation if we are going to keep \nthe flow of commerce moving. But as President Obama mentioned in his \nState of the Union Address, when American engineers took a look at our \ntransportation infrastructure, they gave us a ``D'' grade. That is not \nquite failing, but it is certainly not very good.\n  Our declining infrastructure threatens not only our safety but also \nour global economic competitiveness. America is falling behind economic \ncompetitors such as Europe and China which are making significantly \nmore robust investments in their infrastructure. In the United States, \nwe currently spend about 2 percent of our GDP on infrastructure. That \nis a 50-percent decline since 1960. China and Europe, on the other \nhand, spend close to 9 percent for China and 5 percent for Europe of \ntheir GDP respectively on infrastructure. We need to make the kind of \nsmart investments that will help keep America competitive.\n  That is why I am very glad we are moving forward with this bipartisan \nFAA reauthorization bill. It has been almost 4 years since Congress \npassed an FAA bill, and in that time our economic competitors have \ncontinued to invest in their 21st century aviation systems.\n  Airports are critical to commerce and economic activity in all of our \nStates. The major airport in my home State of New Hampshire, Manchester \nAirport, generates over $1.2 billion in economic activity every year. \nMuch of that comes from out-of-State residents and foreign travelers. \nWithout that airport, without that air infrastructure, we would not be \nable to generate that kind of economic activity. The aviation industry \nin New Hampshire and across the country also provides good jobs for \npilots, flight attendants, mechanics, air travel controllers, and so \nmany others. Manchester Airport alone provides over 1,900 jobs.\n  The FAA legislation that is now before us will accomplish the long \noverdue task of upgrading one critical component of our aviation \ninfrastructure, the air traffic control system. It will upgrade the \nsystem to an efficient 21st-century system called NextGen.\n  I do not think very many people realize that when they get into an \nairplane, the pilots and the air traffic controllers are using 20th-\ncentury technology to navigate the skies. I was just at a meeting of \nthe High Tech Council in New Hampshire and having this conversation \nwith them. They did not realize that that is the kind of aviation \nsystem we use to fly our planes.\n  So although our cell phones and cars have GPS systems, our \nmultimillion-dollar airplanes use World War II era radar systems. The \nsystem we have now is inefficient. It wastes the time and money of \neveryone involved in the aviation industry. As Chairman Rockefeller has \npointed out so many times, even Mongolia has a more advanced air \ntraffic control system than we do. That is unacceptable.\n\n  Not surprisingly, our outdated system is at capacity. According to \nthe FAA, delays resulting from the constraints on the system cost the \nUnited States over $9 billion every year. That number is going to \ncontinue to rise if we do nothing.\n  We need to take action. The FAA forecasts that the aviation system \nwill carry more than 1 billion airline passengers annually by 2023. We \ncannot afford to let such an important part of our 21st-century economy \nlanguish with 20th-century technology.\n  By investing in NextGen, our air traffic controllers will finally \nhave the 21st-century technologies they need to make our system more \nefficient. Let me give an example of the progress NextGen would make. \nRight now, air traffic controllers give all of their commands to pilots \nover the radio. They tell them when and where they will be landing. \nNow, because all of the pilots in the area are listening, there is the \npotential for miscommunication sometimes. Our pilots and controllers \nare very professional. They do their jobs well. But sometimes people \ntalk over each other and pilots hear the wrong information. This system \nwe currently have wastes time, and it puts the flying public in \njeopardy. Once NextGen is in place, controllers will be able to type a \ncommand and send it directly to the plane. To all of us who use e-mail, \nthis sounds pretty basic, but it is an example of the kinds of upgrades \nthat are needed to make our aviation system more efficient and safer.\n  By funding NextGen, this bill will bring our air traffic control \nsystem into the 21st century. NextGen will reduce congestion by \nallowing planes to fly more direct routes, it will conserve energy, and \nit will make flying safer for everyone.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n  Of course, some flight delays are unavoidable. We cannot control the \nweather, as we all know. But when delays cannot be avoided, we can make \nsure airlines are treating their customers fairly. That is another \ncritical component of this legislation. That is why this bill includes \nthe passengers' bill of rights.\n  I cosponsored the passengers' bill of rights after a businesswoman \nfrom Bedford, NH--a woman named Jennifer Shirkani--told me her stories \nof being stuck on tarmacs for hours without access to food or water. \nThese experiences were so frustrating to Jennifer that she became a \nleader in the movement to get this legislation passed. Unfortunately, \nher stories have been all too common in recent years. According to the \nDepartment of Transportation, hundreds of thousands of passengers have \nbeen stuck on a tarmac for more than 3 hours. This bill will codify \nprotections put in place last year by the Department of Transportation \nso we will not go back to the days when airlines left travelers on the \ntarmac.\n  I wish to commend Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison \nfor producing a strong bill, and I look forward to being able to \nsupport this legislation with all of my colleagues and pass it very \nsoon so we can upgrade our transportation system to compete with the \nrest of the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are working very hard to have an \namendment on the perimeter rule that would accommodate all the concerns \nof western Senators who do not have easy access to Reagan Washington \nNational Airport and the concerns of the Virginia Senators who are \nconcerned about congestion and other Senators from the Far West who \nwant to try to have a better chance at a direct flight.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I have filed an amendment that we think is a \nfair approach. We did this because we did not have enough consensus, \nand we are trying to drive that consensus. So I would like to ask that \nthe amendment be brought up. It is our intention then to set it aside \nfor Senator Nelson's amendment, which is scheduled for a vote. I have \ninformed everyone that I am going to ask the Chair to call up amendment \nNo. 84, the Rockefeller-Hutchison amendment on the perimeter rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I know my \ncolleagues, the ranking member and the chairman of the committee, have \nbeen working diligently to try to resolve this issue. It certainly is a \nthorny one, given the history of the Commerce Committee and previous \nvotes on this issue.\n  For me, the issue is that I certainly do want access to the West, and \nI certainly want to make sure the Nation's Capital is accessible to all \nparts of the country, but we also want to make sure there is a fair \nprocess, that a decision to open access to National Airport is run \nthrough the Department of Transportation in an FAA process, that we do \nnot handpick here on the Senate floor any of the people who would be \nwinners in this process but that we make the decision on how much \naccess is available.\n  I would say to my colleagues that the whole issue here about airports \nis that anytime you have a limited footprint, you have had discussion \nabout how to give access to that through a process of the FAA.\n  So I would say to my colleague, let's keep dialoguing and working on \nthis issue. But a process and an amendment that includes conversion; \nthat is to say, that a predominant carrier out of National Airport can \ncontinue to hold that dominance in the marketplace, I think is the \nwrong approach. I look at what is happening now with what the \nDepartment of Justice has said about the Delta-US Air swap between New \nYork and DCA. It basically said they have too much market share and \nthey ought to divest if they want to engage in that kind of swap \nbehavior. So any kind of conversion process that would allow slots to \nbe converted is like saying, if you own real estate around the Capitol, \nthen you can buy more real estate around the Capitol.\n  So I hope we can come up with a process that puts the FAA in charge \nof this, opens up how much access, but not make the decision here on \nthe Senate floor; allow the FAA and DOT to do their job, as they have \non this issue in the past. So at this point in time, I object to the \nSenator's proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nminute to respond to the objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the reason for the conversions was to \naccommodate the needs of the Washington National Airport people and to \nalso understand that the incumbent carriers--of which there are four--\nhave mostly paid the lion's share of the cost of the additions to \nWashington National Airport.\n  We do want a fair process. That is why we have separated the new \nentrants, which would be five, to accommodate carriers that have no \npresence but also have conversions of flights that are already in \nplace, so there would be fewer new flights into Washington National and \nthere would be a fair process with the incumbent carriers who have paid \nsuch a lion's share of the cost at the airport to keep it competitive \nand fair.\n  So, with that, we will continue to discuss. We hope we will have an \namendment that can be voted on, and I think it is imperative that we \nvote on this issue so there is a Senate position.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 58\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 20 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Nelson amendment No. 58.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the amendment which Senators \nSchumer, Akaka, Shaheen, Tester--our Presiding Officer--Whitehouse, \nMenendez, Bill Nelson of Florida, and I have offered, which we will be \nvoting on shortly, is a commonsense approach to addressing the serious \nissue of protecting an individual's privacy when they pass through \nsecurity checkpoints at airports and public buildings.\n  Nebraskans and Americans understand that every step must be taken to \nkeep Federal buildings and air travel safe in America, particularly \nafter the 9/11 attacks. However, as we promote security, safeguards are \nnecessary to protect everybody's privacy from misuse of images \ngenerated by body scanning machines.\n  Our legislation sends a commonsense message: We will not ignore \npeople's privacy as we make sure air travel and Federal buildings are \nsafe. The amendment is very straightforward.\n  It would, No. 1, make it a crime to photograph or record a body scan \nimage or distribute a body scan image, taken at either an airport or \nany Federal building, without express authorization to do so either by \nlaw or regulation.\n  Second, it imposes a penalty of up to 1 year in prison and $100,000 \nfine on violators.\n  Third, we provide an exception from prosecution if the actions taken \noccur while an individual is engaged in their official duties during \nthe course of an authorized intelligence investigation or criminal \nprosecution. This language, which was worked out with officials at the \nFBI and DNI, is important. This is not an abstract concern. There has \nalready been a case where these images have been taken and posted on \nline inappropriately. So it is my hope that by creating a very strong \ndeterrent and establishing criminal penalties for those who take and \ndistribute body scan images inappropriately, we will help prevent that \nfrom occurring again.\n\n  By adopting this amendment, we are telling our constituents we are \nnot going to ignore their privacy in the process of making sure we have \nsafe airports and Federal buildings.\n  I ask my colleagues to support our amendment.\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\n           Amendment No. 85, As Modified, to Amendment No. 58\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I call up my second-degree \namendment No. 85 which is at the desk and ask unanimous consent that it \nbe modified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 2 of the amendment, strike line 18 and \n     all that follows through page 3, line 21, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Exception.--The prohibition under subsection (a) \n     shall not apply to an individual who, while engaged in or on \n     account of the performance of official duties, distributes, \n     photographs, or otherwise records an image described in \n     subsection (a) during the course of authorized intelligence \n     activities, a Federal, State, or local criminal investigation \n     or prosecution, or other lawful activities by Federal, State, \n     or local authorities, including training for intelligence or \n     law enforcement purposes.\n       ``(c) Penalty.--An individual who violates the prohibition \n     in subsection (a) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned \n     for not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(d) Advanced Imaging Technology Defined.--In this \n     section, the term `advanced imaging technology'--\n       ``(1) means a device that creates a visual image of an \n     individual showing the surface of the skin beneath clothing \n     and revealing other objects on the body that are covered by \n     clothing;\n       ``(2) may include devices using backscatter x-rays or \n     millimeter waves and devices referred to as `whole-body \n     imaging technology' or `body scanning'; and\n       ``(3) does not include a device equipped with software that \n     produces a generic representation of the human form instead \n     of a visual image of an individual.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the second-degree \namendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  (The amendment (No. 85), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support \nour amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. I believe other \ncolleagues are here to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I believe other colleagues are \nhere to speak. I notice Senator Schumer is here. I appreciate very much \nhis support. Working together very carefully with total collaboration, \nwe have been able to, with our colleagues, bring about what I think is \nimportant privacy legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First I wish to congratulate my good friend and hunting buddy, the \nSenator from Nebraska, for the great work he has done. It has been a \npleasure to work with him. We have had parallel interests and his \namendment hopefully will solve a problem that has arisen lately because \nof the full-body scanners that are being installed at airports.\n  As everyone knows, late last year the TSA began installing full-body \nadvanced imaging scanners at airports across the country. These new \nscanners are better able to quickly and accurately detect explosives \nthan the older scanners and would likely have thwarted the Christmas \nDay bomber before he had even gotten on the plane.\n  But from the get-go, legitimate questions popped up about the \npotential for privacy violations from the use of these scanners. What \nhappens if a rogue TSA employee disseminates your full-body image? What \nhappens if a fellow passenger or reporter takes pictures of body scan \nimages with his phone and e-mails it to his friends or places the \npictures on a Web site or in a newspaper? Are there safeguards to \nprevent such abuses? If it happens, what are the consequences?\n  Obviously, airline safety is our paramount concern. We can \noftentimes, by carefully legislating, have our cake and eat it too--to \nmake sure safety stays No. 1, but to also make sure, as the Senator \nfrom Nebraska and I are trying to do, that privacy is protected \nwhenever possible. That is why Senator Nelson and I teamed up to work \nwith TSA and privacy advocates to devise a sensible solution to the \nproblem--a solution that would protect privacy without sacrificing \nsafety.\n  The legislation we came up with, which Senator Nelson is now offering \nas an amendment to the FAA bill, strikes just the right balance. First \nand foremost, the amendment makes it a Federal crime to record and \ndisseminate images from airport scanners. It provides a sentence of up \nto 1 year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000 per violation to \nanyone who is convicted of violating the law.\n  I should note the amendment not only covers the misuse of the \noriginal images recorded from the scanners but also photographs of \nscans taken by security personnel, airline employees, passengers, or \nanybody else.\n  Americans want to know when they take to the skies that every \npossible precaution has been taken for their safety. At the same time, \nthey want to know that precautions have been taken to ensure their \nprivacy. The amendment would offer the flying public that much-needed \nassistance.\n  Again, I applaud Senator Nelson, who is a member of the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities Subcommittee, for his leadership on this \nissue. I urge my colleagues to support the smart, practical amendment \nwe are offering today, and I urge that it be passed as quickly as \npossible by this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator Bill Nelson of Florida to amendment No. 58 as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Perhaps we can proceed with the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 4\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a few days ago I offered an amendment that \nwould eliminate the Essential Air Service Program, which is at least \nauthorized in this bill at about $200 million. I had no idea we would \napproach the end of Western civilization as we know it if we eliminated \nthis obviously outdated and unnecessary $200 million of the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  I am reminded of a comment once made by President Ronald Reagan. To \nparaphrase what he said: The closest thing to eternal life here on \nEarth is a government program. There is nothing that illustrates that \npoint more than the Essential Air Service Program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that three letters be printed in the Record. \nOne is from FreedomWorks, one from the National Taxpayers Union, and \nanother is from the Citizens Against Government Waste.\n  I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 FreedomWorks,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2011.\n       Dear Senator, On behalf of over a million FreedomWorks \n     members nationwide, I urge you to vote YES on Sen. McCain's \n     (R-Ariz.) amendment to S. 223 the Federal Aviation \n     Administration (FAA) Air Transportation Modernization and \n     Safety Improvement Act which would eliminate the Essential \n     Air Service (EAS). The EAS was created in the 1970's to help \n     a small number of rural communities retain access to air \n     service after airline deregulation. Like so many other \n     government programs, Congress initially enacted it to be a \n     relatively small and temporary ten year program costing \n     several million dollars annually. However, the needless \n     program has continued for 23 years while costing taxpayers \n     $200 million every year.\n       Along with many fiscally conservative groups, even the \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO) questioned the \n     usefulness of the EAS by stating ``current conditions raise \n     concerns about whether the program can continue to operate as \n     it has . . . the growth of air service especially by low-cost \n     carriers--weighted against the relatively high fares and \n     inconvenience of EAS flights.'' Los Angeles Times reports \n     that taxpayers are forced to subsidize airline service to \n     small communities at a loss. Most of the money provides \n     service to rural airports with fewer than 30 passengers a \n     day.\n       The ESA is a prime example of wasteful spending. A graph \n     produced by the FAA shows that 99.95 percent of all Americans \n     live within 120 miles of a major public airport. Airports \n     should operate where there are consumers to support such an \n     airport. Taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize rural \n     airports with too little demand to justify their existence. I \n     urge you to repeal the EAS to save taxpayers $1 billion over \n     the next five years. It's a step in the right direction to \n     cut excessive spending wherever we find it.\n       This, however, is a modest step and should be easily \n     supported by anyone serious about reining in the federal \n     government. In order to produce even more savings, Congress \n     should look into privatizing airports to allow private \n     capital to flow in. Many other countries have successfully \n     and fully privatized some of their airports including \n     Britain, Italy and Australia. The private sector has produced \n     more efficient airports which have led to an increase in \n     airport revenue. The privatization of airports has been \n     beneficial for consumers, airlines and taxpayers.\n       We will count your vote on Sen. McCain's amendment to the \n     FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement \n     Act as a KEY VOTE when calculating the FreedomWorks Economic \n     Freedom Scorecard for 2011. The Economic Freedom Scorecard is \n     used to determine eligibility for the Jefferson Award, which \n     recognizes members of Congress with voting records that \n     support economic freedom.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Matt Kibbe,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, February 15, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 362,000-member National \n     Taxpayers Union (NTU), I urge you to vote ``Yes'' on Senator \n     John McCain's amendment to S. 223, the Federal Aviation \n     Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Bill. Approving this \n     amendment, which would repeal the Essential Air Service (EAS) \n     program, is an ideal way for the Senate to demonstrate its \n     commitment toward eliminating low-priority expenditures and \n     beginning to restore fiscal responsibility to the federal \n     budget.\n       Created in 1978 as a 10-year venture that would ease the \n     transition to a more market-driven commercial aviation \n     sector, EAS has, like many other federal programs, engendered \n     constituencies that have kept the program alive far beyond \n     any demonstrable purpose. Indeed, NTU questioned the need for \n     EAS in the first place, given the fact that robust and \n     competitive air services would fulfill consumers' needs more \n     efficiently than any government subsidization scheme. \n     Unfortunately, many of the taxpayers' worst fears about EAS \n     have come true. The program now operates in more than 100 \n     areas of the country, even as air travelers' choices are \n     numerous. In fact, the Government Accountability Office \n     concluded in 2009 that many Americans are shunning EAS-\n     subsidized flights and airports in favor of lower-cost fares \n     offered at hubs that are still reasonably accessible by \n     automobile. This free-market evolution can be encouraged by \n     easing tax and regulatory burdens on airlines and customers.\n       Just as other federal transportation programs like Amtrak \n     pour tax dollars into unprofitable and low-traveled routes \n     which consumers bypass out of preference for other commercial \n     alternatives, EAS seems to operate more out of satisfying \n     political considerations than addressing any perceived market \n     defects. Your colleague Senator Coburn provided a vivid \n     illustration of these flaws in a report, Wastebook 2010, late \n     last year:\n       The cities of Macon and Athens, Georgia are both less than \n     a 90-minute drive from Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson \n     International airport. Despite this, the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation subsidized 26 flights per week to and from \n     each city at a clip of $464 per passenger for Macon and $135 \n     for Athens. Passengers pay $39 each for a seat on the 50-\n     minute flight. . . . The local newspaper reports that the \n     Macon [service] averaged 10 passengers a day, while Athens \n     averaged 12 EAS-subsidized flights. By law, the Department of \n     Transportation subsidies are capped at $200 for flights to \n     airports less than 210 miles from a large or medium hub, \n     which Atlanta is.\n       EAS's justification may always have been dubious, but in \n     today's fiscal environment its continued existence is even \n     less defensible. The savings at stake from passage of the \n     McCain Amendment--$200 million--certainly won't erase the \n     current fiscal year's projected $1.5 trillion deficit, but if \n     the Senate cannot eliminate this blatant example of low-\n     priority spending, taxpayers will have every right to \n     question Congress's sincerity in the vital endeavor of \n     bringing the budget back under control.\n       NTU has expressed concerns over several portions of the FAA \n     bill, including the threat of higher Passenger Facility \n     Charges and a lack of progress in moving toward a private \n     sector-driven model for air traffic control. Senator McCain's \n     proposal provides a key opportunity to break from the tax-\n     and-spend philosophy that has dominated past FAA legislation \n     and to recognize the role of commercial aviation in America's \n     economic recovery. Once again, NTU asks that you support the \n     McCain Amendment; roll call votes pertaining to this measure\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\n     will be significantly weighted in our annual Rating of \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Pete Sepp,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Council for Citizens Against\n\n\n                                             Government Waste,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2011.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) recently \n     introduced Amendment #4 to S. 223, the FAA Air Transportation \n     Modernization and Safety Improvement Act.

On behalf of the more than one \n     million members and supporters of the Council for Citizens \n     Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to support this \n     amendment.\n       Federal spending has ballooned out of control and taxpayers \n     are bracing themselves as the nation rapidly approaches its \n     statutory $14.3 trillion debt limit. Yet, Congress continues \n     to fund wasteful and unnecessary programs. The Essential Air \n     Service was created in 1978 to subsidize airline carriers \n     that provide service to small communities. Originally funded \n     at $7 million, the program has since grown to cost taxpayers \n     $200 million, subsidizing a dozen airline carriers in more \n     than 100 communities.\n       Ironically, this air service program is anything but \n     essential, as 99.95 percent of Americans live within 120 \n     miles of a public airport that accommodates more than 10,000 \n     take-offs and landings each year. CCAGW has been a long-time \n     proponent of eliminating funding for worthless, money-\n     draining airports that have long been protected under the \n     Essential Air Service. One such egregious example is the John \n     Murtha Johnstown-Cambria ``Airport for No One.'' This airport \n     services fewer than 30 people per day, yet it has received \n     more than $1.3 million under this program. This is hardly an \n     efficient use of taxpayer dollars, especially when the \n     government is facing a record-breaking $1.5 trillion budget \n     deficit.\n       The Essential Air Service program has been repeatedly cited \n     in CAGW's Prime Cuts, a proprietary database comprised of 763 \n     recommendations that would save taxpayers $350 billion in the \n     first year and $2.2 trillion over five years.\n       Congress cannot continue on a spending rampage while \n     ignoring the nation's balance sheets. Senator McCain's \n     amendment would cut a profligate, indefensible government \n     program that Americans do not need and taxpayers simply \n     cannot afford. All votes on Amendment #4 to S. 223 will be \n     among those considered in CCAGW's 2011 Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Thomas Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. FreedomWorks says:\n\n       The ESA is a prime example of wasteful spending. A graph \n     produced by the FAA shows that 99.95 percent of all Americans \n     live within 120 miles of a major public airport. Taxpayers \n     should not be forced to subsidize rural airports with too \n     little demand to justify their existence. I urge you to \n     repeal the EAS to save taxpayers $1 billion over the next 5 \n     years.\n\n  The National Taxpayers Union cites:\n\n       The cities of Macon and Athens, Georgia are both less than \n     a 90-minute drive from Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson \n     International Airport. Despite this, the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation subsidized 26 flights per week to and from \n     each city at a clip of $426 per passenger from Macon and $135 \n     for Athens.\n\n  Then, of course, the Citizens Against Government Waste points out \nthat:\n\n       Congress cannot continue on a spending rampage while \n     ignoring the nation's balance sheets.\n\n  Probably the loudest complaints have been from the State of Alaska, a \nState I love and enjoy. There is a great article that appeared in an \nAlaskan newspaper. It is called ``Self-Sustainability--Is it time for \nAlaska to grow up?''\n  Among other things I didn't know about is:\n\n       While the nation faces a $14 trillion fiscal hole and \n     Congress is looking to tighten its belt, it's inevitable that \n     Alaska is going to feel some of the pain.\n\n  But what is interesting is that the State of Alaska, he goes on to \nstate, has ``$12 billion in reserves and another $40 billion banked \naway in the permanent fund.''\n  Wow. I don't know of another State in the Union that is that well \noff. He, Andrew Halcro, goes on to say:\n\n       We Alaskans fancy ourselves as rugged individualists, who \n     are quick to eschew the long arm of the federal government \n     and Big Brother. However our actions sometimes don't match \n     our rhetoric.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       What about the amendment to eliminate essential air service \n     subsidies in small rural communities throughout Alaska? \n     Currently the feds subsidize air service to more than 44 \n     communities to the tune of $12 million per year.\n\n  The author goes on to say:\n\n       Is it really the federal government's role to subsidize air \n     service to Rampart, a community with 15 people?\n\n  An interesting question. He goes on to say:\n\n       We've known this day was coming but have done little to \n     prepare our communities for it. We have continued to live in \n     a subsidized world, where one of the biggest issues so far \n     this legislative session has been a debate over suspending \n     Alaska's measly gas tax. . . .\n       This past week, Alaska Senator Mark Begich, in response to \n     the announced ban on earmarks stated, ``I have said many \n     times Alaska is a young State with many needs, and we deserve \n     our fair share of Federal funding to develop our resources \n     and our infrastructure.''\n\n  The author goes on to say:\n\n       While I would absolutely agree that federal policies have \n     restricted Alaska's ability to develop its vast resources, \n     the ``young state'' argument has been used for decades to \n     justify growing demands on the Federal budget for things like \n     the Denali Commission and earmarks for controversial bridges.\n       This year Alaska turns 52, so arguably we are not kids \n     anymore. Is it time for us to grow up?\n\n  Is it time for all of us to grow up and eliminate these Federal \nprograms that cost billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money, which \noriginally may have--and I emphasize ``may have''--in 1978, when we \nderegulated the airlines, have had a legitimate reason? Obviously, it \ndoes not anymore.\n  I look forward to the fact that our conservative organizations are \nall judging these as a key vote. I also point out to my colleagues, if \nwe are serious, if we are serious about cutting spending and going \nabout making tough decisions, this is an easy decision. If we vote \nagainst my amendment, if the majority votes against my amendment to \neliminate essential air service, the message to the American people as \nof November 2 is, we aren't serious. We aren't serious. If we can't \neliminate a program like this, how can we make the tough decisions that \nare coming?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. I hope we will have a vote as \nsoon as reasonably possible, and I look forward to the continued debate \non this issue which seems to have created quite a large degree of \ncontroversy throughout the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 14, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 14 offered by the Senator from Mississippi, as modified.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, under the previous order I yield 4 minutes \nto the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment of Senator Wicker to provide additional workforce protections \nfor Transportation Security Officers while at the same time ensuring \nthe management flexibility that is vital to the operational efficiency \nof the TSA, and thus the security of the American people. Instead of \ndramatically changing the TSA personnel system in a way that could \ninterfere with TSA's ability to carry out its essential mission, as the \nadministration plans, we should, instead, make some targeted but \nimportant reforms in the system to ensure that TSA employees are \ntreated fairly.\n  First, we should bring TSA employees under the Whistleblower \nProtection Act, which safeguards the rights of whistleblowers \nthroughout the Federal Government.\n  Second, we should give TSA workers the right to an independent appeal \nof adverse personnel actions--for example, a demotion would qualify. \nWhat we are proposing is that a TSA employee so affected would be able \nto appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n  Third, we should make clear that TSA members can, in fact, join a \nunion. That is a different issue from collective bargaining. So our \namendment specifically provides that we are not depriving employees of \nthat choice--which they have right now.\n  I have just received a letter from former TSA Administrator Kip \nHawley, who was extremely well regarded and served as the head of TSA \nfor 4 years. He expresses support for the amendment that Senator Wicker \nand I are offering. Mr. Hawley knows firsthand how important it is for \nTSA to have\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\nthe flexibility in order to respond quickly and effectively to changing \nconditions, to emerging threats, to new intelligence, and to impending \ncrises. I note this is not theoretical. TSA has used this authority in \nthe past.\n  In 2006, for example, TSA had to respond virtually overnight to the \nliquids plot to blow up airplanes that originated in Great Britain. \nOvernight, TSA had to retrain its workers and redeploy them to \ndifferent airports. This is not a theoretical concern.\n  Another example was the blizzard that occurred in Denver, where TSA \nscreeners had to be flown in from another city to cover the shifts of \nTSA employees at that airport. This kind of management flexibility was \nalso used in the wake of the gulf coast hurricanes when there were \nmassive evacuations.\n  In his letter, Mr. Hawley states that although TSA's recent \ndetermination states that security policies and procedures will not be \nissues subject to collective bargaining, the dividing line between \nsecurity and nonsecurity practices ``is not a bright one.''\n  He makes the same point that former Homeland Security Secretary \nChertoff made the last time we debated this issue, and that is defining \nwhat is and what is not subject to collective bargaining undoubtedly \nwill be subject to subsequent litigation.\n  He further notes:\n\n       The resolution of these issues could rest with an \n     arbitrator with no direct knowledge of security issues, \n     intelligence, and transportation security. [This could] place \n     the performance of TSA's security mission in the hands of \n     someone who neither has the expertise to make these \n     decisions, nor [a person who] is accountable for them.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 15, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins, I am writing in support of the \n     Amendment to S. 223 offered by you, Senator Wicker, and \n     others that would exclude Transportation Security \n     Administration employees from collective bargaining.\n       This issue has a long history and the arguments are well \n     known, so I will focus on two specific elements of the \n     administration's recently released policy on collective \n     bargaining for Transportation Security Officers: (1) inherent \n     ambiguity in the definition of security activities; and (2) \n     the issue of performance management.\n       TSA's memorandum states that collective bargaining will be \n     ``within a framework unique to TSA that does not adversely \n     impact the resources and agility necessary to protect the \n     security of the traveling public.'' It further states that \n     within this framework, ``security policies and procedures,'' \n     or ``internal security practices'' will not be issues subject \n     to collective bargaining. Given that security practices and \n     procedures frequently change, this dividing line is not a \n     bright one and will likely be the subject to collective \n     bargaining and subsequent litigation. The resolution of these \n     issues could rest with an arbitrator with no direct knowledge \n     of security issues, intelligence, and transportation \n     security. This could result in the very thing that TSA does \n     not want, and that is to place the performance of TSA's \n     security mission in the hands of someone who neither has the \n     expertise to make these decisions, nor is accountable to \n     them.\n       Secondly, the decision document drives a stake through the \n     heart of what makes risk-based security work: meaningful \n     performance-based incentives. The decision here uses the \n     words ``high performance,'' ``engaged,'' describes an \n     organization that ``truly values and promotes initiative,'' \n     and vows that security will not be compromised. This \n     decision, however, imposes a wall between a TSO's job \n     performance and pay incentives.\n       Cash incentives are effective motivators to officers who \n     are willing to be accountable and base their personal success \n     on good security results--something air travelers should want \n     very much. ``The performance management process'' is \n     explicitly included among the issues subject to collective \n     bargaining, but at the same time in the next section, ``pay \n     and policies affecting pay'' are specifically excluded. In \n     other words, this decision means that better performance does \n     not mean better pay. The union will bargain to define \n     ``performance,'' probably seniority-based, and TSA agrees not \n     to use cash incentives to motivate employees' performance. \n     For an agency that depends on its security officers to \n     constantly adjust and improve their skills so that they are \n     prepared for ever-changing terrorist tactics, this disconnect \n     between pay and performance could be disastrous.\n       TSA has a robust pay-for-performance system in place today \n     and those who perform their security duties better get \n     significant bonuses and pay raises. Reversing the logic to \n     de-link pay incentives from job performance can only sap the \n     energy of TSOs who are motivated to be actively engaged, use \n     initiative, and strive to achieve high performance team \n     objectives. That cannot be good for security, or performance \n     of any kind.\n       There are many other issues worthy of discussion, but these \n     cut across philosophy and politics and gets to the issue of \n     the security of the flying public. Action is needed now to \n     stop the imposition of this flawed decision on TSA's fine \n     workforce and all of us who depend on them.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                       Kip Hawley,\n                                     TSA Administrator, 2005-2009.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I urge our colleagues to support this amendment. I think \nit is a balanced approach that will give these employees more rights \nthan they currently have without interfering with the essential mission \nof this law enforcement agency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, do I understand I have 6 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. WICKER. I was under the impression I had yielded 4 minutes to the \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the majority object to the Senator from \nMississippi taking 6 minutes? Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, if I can.\n  I listened carefully to the statement of my friend, the Senator from \nMaine. Frankly, I wonder if we are in parallel worlds and we are \ntalking about the same thing but in a different context. My friend, the \nSenator from Maine, seems to be ignoring the very careful limitations \nthat TSA has placed on collective bargaining rights. For example, under \nthe provisions of TSA, the transportation security officers cannot \nbargain over pay.\n  They cannot bargain over pay. They cannot bargain over deployment \nprocedures--who works where. The Senator mentioned the incident \ninvolving Great Britain; they had to train people overnight. Well, they \ncannot bargain on training either. That is not part of the bargaining \nrights they would have.\n  The Senator mentioned about the deployment of people to Denver \nbecause of a blizzard. Well, deployment procedures, who works where, is \nnot again subject to collective bargaining. Emergency response \nmeasures, that was the one dealing with Great Britain. On emergency \nresponse measures, who goes where, how long they have to be there for \nan emergency response, is not negotiable. It is not part of the \ncollective bargaining agreement.\n  So I am at a loss to understand what the Senator from Maine was \ntalking about. They cannot bargain over emergency response procedures, \ndeployments or other security issues. So, again, this is not something \nthat is part of the collective bargaining agreement.\n  Last week, the Transportation Security Administration said--the \nAdministrator, John Pistole, testifying before the House subcommittee, \nsaid that the employee morale is a security issue--employee morale. Why \ndid he say that? A recent survey ranked TSA 220 out of 224 Federal \nemployers as the best place to work. In other words, 224 would be the \nworst place to work in the Federal Government. TSA was rated at 220. \nThey have a high turnover rate, they have a high injury rate, and \nextremely low morale.\n  So what we are trying to do is give them that boost in morale. Here \nis what the TSA Administrator said last week:\n\n       The safety of the traveling public is our top priority, and \n     we will not negotiate on security. But morale and employee \n     engagement cannot be separated from achieving superior \n     security.\n\n  While some of my colleagues have suggested that providing collective \nbargaining rights could jeopardize security, nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Unionized security personnel are just as effective, \ndedicated, and willing to put their lives on the line in an emergency.\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\n  I point out, for example, Border Patrol personnel have collective \nbargaining rights. Immigration and Customs officials have collective \nbargaining rights. Our Capitol police officers who protect us have \ncollective bargaining rights. Why should TSOs be any different? To \nsuggest that unionized security personnel are somehow less effective, \nless dedicated, less willing to put their lives on the line in an \nemergency I believe is an insult to every man and woman in uniform in \nthis country who works under a collective bargaining agreement.\n  I only need to remind everyone, remember 9/11. Remember that image of \nall the people in New York running away from those towers as they came \ndown, the thousands of people running away from that calamity, and the \npicture was of other people running into it--our police, our \nfirefighters, our emergency personnel, who not only risked their lives \nbut gave their lives to help save people in that tragedy.\n  Every single one of them, every firefighter, every policeman, the \nemergency personnel, were all union people, belonged to a union with \ncollective bargaining rights. Yet look at what they did during that \nemergency.\n  So, again, I think it is important to add that under this agreement, \nthey get limited collective bargaining rights. They cannot bargain over \nsecurity procedures and policies, deployment, disciplinary standards or \n``any action deemed necessary by the administrator or his or her \ndesignees to carry out the agency mission during emergencies.''\n  They cannot negotiate on that. So, again, we just want to help raise \nthe morale there, to give these people bargaining rights so----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here is what they can bargain on: grievance procedures--\nthat helps on morale--nonemergency scheduling--that helps on morale--\nawards and recognitions, uniforms, bidding on shifts and procedures \nused for how they bid on shifts--who gets the 2 a.m. shift, who gets \nthe 7 a.m. shift--all nonemergency types of situations.\n  This will help give them better morale and will help in terms of \nensuring security. Do not take my word for it. Take the Administrator's \nword for it, Administrator John Pistole, who said this will help ensure \nthe safety of the traveling public.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I rise in support of the Wicker amendment. Senator Collins, who spoke \nearlier, is a cosponsor of this amendment. I might also note that \nSenator Coburn has joined as a cosponsor also. The Wicker amendment has \neverything to do with public safety. It has everything to do with \npreventing excessive litigation when it comes to the definitions of the \nroles of our TSA workers. It has everything to do with preventing \nincreased deficits here in the United States and in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  For that reason, groups that support the Wicker amendment today and \nurge an ``aye'' vote include the Heritage Foundation, the Workforce \nFairness Institute, and Americans for Tax Reform.\n  Just a little history for those who have not followed this debate \nover the last several days. Currently, TSA employees are not allowed to \ncollectively bargain. That has been the policy of the Federal \nGovernment since the inception of the Transportation Security \nAdministration. For a decade, TSA employees have not been allowed to \ncollectively bargain.\n  Their rights and considerations and morale issues have been taken \ncare of in other ways. Since the creation of TSA, its employees have \nbeen treated similar to those in the FBI, the CIA, and the Secret \nService, for purposes of collective bargaining. In fact, in a 2003 \nmemo, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security, which is now \nthe TSA Administrator, prohibited TSA security screeners from \nunionizing with collective bargaining rights.\n  The Under Secretary at the time made this decision ``in light of \ntheir critical national security responsibilities.'' That has been the \nregime under which we have operated the TSA for the entire existence of \nthe agency.\n  Now, however, the Obama administration is intent on dolling out \nrewards to campaign supporters and they are moving to reverse this \ndecades-long decision and to allow TSA workers to collectively bargain. \nMy amendment would prevent that and, as I say, would keep the TSA \nemployees under the same restrictions as the FBI, CIA, and Secret \nService.\n  Senator Collins, in her modification to my amendment, provided some \nvery important safeguards. It allows TSA workers to be under the Merit \nSystems Protection Board. It also provides Whistleblower Protection Act \nprotections for TSA employees.\n  We are told our concerns about safety have been taken care of because \nthe agreement or the decision by the TSA Administrator says we cannot \nhave collective bargaining over other security issues. It named \nseveral, and then it says ``other security issues.'' What does that \nmean?\n  Well, that is what the former Administrator was talking about in the \nletter to Senator Collins. This is going to require litigation to \ndetermine what ``other security issues'' are. I will tell you what, \napparently, is allowed under the Administrator's proposal. It does \nallow bargaining over the selection process for special assignment. It \nallows collective bargaining over the policies for transfers. It allows \ncollective bargaining for shift training, as my friend from Iowa just \nacknowledged. All of these are going to make the TSA less flexible and \nless efficient in going about their business of protecting America.\n  I would close by saying this: There is a budget debate also. At the \nother end of this building, we are having hour after hour of debate \nabout how to keep this deficit from ballooning, how to keep the cost of \ngovernment from going up.\n  Does anybody think that allowing collective bargaining for 50,000 \nadditional Federal employees is going to cut the cost of the Federal \nGovernment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. I yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. What is happening out in the States? State after State \nafter State is facing bankruptcy, and a large part of it is the cost of \ngovernment brought on by employee union contracts. That is just a fact. \nState after State, Governor after Governor, they are coming to \nWashington, DC and saying: We are going to have to do something about \nthis. We are going to have break these contracts and save us from \nfinancial ruin.\n  At a time when Governors are moving in that direction and trying to \nget out from under these public employee collective bargaining \nagreements, would it not be the height of irresponsibility, would it \nnot be the height of irony for the Federal Government to go in the \nother direction?\n  Vote for the Wicker amendment and save the taxpayers the additional \nmoney it will take to move to collective bargaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Wicker \namendment. This is the Republican's first of what I worry will be a \nsustained attack in the 112th Congress against Federal employees.\n  As the Senator from Maryland and for Maryland, I represent more than \n130,000 Federal employees. These men and women are dedicated and duty \ndriven. They are on the frontlines protecting America every day \nsecuring our borders inspecting our food, and performing critical \nhealth research. They deserve a decent wage, safe working conditions \nand our thanks and respect.\n  This amendment would deny TSA workers the collective bargaining \nrights that many other employees at DHS currently have, including the \nBureau of Prison Guards, Customs and Border Protection, and the Capitol \nPolice.\n  TSA currently suffers from low morale, high injury rates, and high \nstaff turnover. Giving these employees a voice at work representing \ntheir interests will lead to a more stable, more\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nexperienced, and healthier workforce. That would increase productivity, \nperformance, and safety for the flying public.\n  Like all Federal employees, the employees at DHS with collective \nbargaining rights must follow civil service rules that prohibit the \nright to strike and allows managers to move employees to different \nareas in the event of an emergency. They bargain in a way that does not \ncompromise the agency's mission and that does not endanger national \nsecurity.\n  Congress has been debating allowing collective bargaining for TSA \nemployees for a decade. Republicans have been vocally against it.\n  In 2001, Congress took up FAA. It gave the administrator the \nauthority to determine whether TSA employee would get collective \nbargaining rights.\n  In 2004, the 9/11 Commission recommended granting TSA workers \ncollective bargaining.\n  In 2006, the Senate passed a bill granting collective bargaining for \nTSA workers. But we couldn't get it across the finish line because of \nthe threat of a Presidential veto. Every Democratic Senator voted in \nfavor of collective bargaining for TSA.\n  Finally, this month, the TSA completed its review of the potential \nimpact of collective bargaining rights for TSA workers on the safety \nand security of American travelers. And the TSA Administrator announced \nthat TSA workers do have collective bargaining rights, and they will \nsoon be able to determine whether or not they wish to exercise those \nrights. In the coming months, TSA workers will be able to decide \nwhether or not they want to be represented by a union to bargain on \ntheir behalf on nonsecurity employment issues.\n  But the Wicker amendment would bring all of this to a screeching \nhalt.\n  We should not stand in the way of something that TSA employees want, \nand the Secretary of Homeland Security and the President support.\n  Federal employees serve their communities and country every day. They \nshould be empowered to fight for their rights on the job without any \nfear of retribution.\n  Whether you are at the IRS or the TSA, you deserve collective \nbargaining rights. And if anyone wants to block, or take away those \nrights, you will have to get through me first.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes four seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Let me just say that the TSA Administrator has the \nright to allow collective bargaining for TSA employees through the \nauthority he was provided in the original Aviation and Transportation \nSecurity Act passed in 2001.\n  When Congress passed that, we came to an agreement that left the \ndetermination of allowing collective bargaining rights for \nTransportation Security Officers to the TSA Administrator. I firmly \nbelieve this authority should remain with the TSA Administrator.\n  The current agreement was approved under the Bush administration and \napproved by a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. I see no \nreason to alter this compromise at this time. There are valid reasons \nto keep the authority with the TSA Administrator. He works firsthand \nwith the employees every day. The nature of his work is very hands on. \nHe is better qualified to determine the agency's mission, how it can be \nimproved, with or without collective bargaining--he more than anybody.\n  On Friday, Administrator Pistole announced his intention to allow \ncollective bargaining over workforce issues, but security and pay will \nnot be subject to negotiation. Most other Federal law enforcement \nagencies, including others housed within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, such as Customs and Border Patrol, have collective bargaining \nrights.\n  I do not believe the sponsors of this amendment would question the \ndedication of these law enforcement officers, despite their right to \ncollectively bargain. TSA employees must still follow civil service \nrules that prohibit the right to strike and allow managers to move \nworkers to different areas and roles in the event of an emergency and \nsecurity as needed.\n  I cannot support this amendment. I feel it could negatively impact \nsecurity if TSA permits collective bargaining rights to improve \nemployee retention. Finally, this amendment is a security issue, and \none that is better addressed when a TSA reauthorization comes to the \nfloor. This is our problem. We are not talking about security here, we \nare talking about other matters.\n  Accordingly, I urge my fellow Senators to oppose the Wicker \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield? How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 39 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, listening to my friend from Mississippi \ntalk about deficits--and we have to be concerned about deficits. The \nfirst thing on which they cannot bargain is pay. That is not something \nthey can bargain on. Generally, Federal employees do not bargain on \npay, I might add.\n  So I do not know what that means. I mean, he is talking about \ndeficits, but they cannot bargain about pay anyway.\n  Then he talked about the FBI and the CIA and the Secret Service, that \nthey did not collectively bargain. Those agencies all deal with very \nhighly sensitive national security information. What are we talking \nabout here? We are talking about the people who check your bags. We are \ntalking about the people at screenings and who do the patdowns, but we \nare also talking about an agency that has one of the highest turnovers \nof any Federal agency. I do not want a high turnover rate among those \npeople at the airport. I want them to be highly skilled, highly \ntrained, highly motivated. I want a good morale system there. Everyone \nsays it is one of the lowest in terms of morale and has one of the \nhighest turnovers of any Federal agency.\n  Giving these people the right to organize and to bargain collectively \non things that are not of national security measures--not pay, not \nemergency procedures, but other things that make life a little bit \nbetter for them so they know basically: What is the procedure for me \nbeing posted here, what is the procedure for me working at 2 a.m. or 7 \na.m., so they have a system whereby they know what is expected of \nthem--to me, that is the way to build morale.\n  Lastly----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just ask for 30 seconds. I gave him 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just gave him 2 minutes. I did not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The time that was given to \nthe other side was due to an error in the chair.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Wicker amendment No. 14, as \nmodified.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 21\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the pending Paul amendment will cut \nthe FAA's authorization levels for fiscal year 2011 to 2008 levels, \n$14.7 billion for the entire agency, representing a near $3 billion cut \nfrom the administration's introduced level of approximately $17.5 \nbillion. That does not sound like a lot of money--of course it does--\nbut let me explain.\n  Managing FAA at the 2008 levels would result in the immediate \nretrenchment of core functions to reduce operating costs; to wit, FAA \nwould eliminate services and furlough all air traffic organization \nemployees for at least 20 days. The primary services of the ATO is to \nmove air traffic safely and efficiently, and that for a period of 40 \ndays would cease. FAA would implement a hiring freeze for the ATO--air \ntraffic organization--which would force the ATO to focus on major \nairports with scheduled service resulting in service reductions at \nparticularly the smaller and rural airports, which affects some of us.\n  The Aviation Safety Office would eliminate 680 employees through \nattrition. It would also furlough all 1,015 operational support \nemployees an average of 2 days each week. It is pretty hard to carry on \n3 days and then 3 days the next week. That particular agency, Aviation \nSafety, is responsible for the certification, production approval, and \ncontinued airworthiness of aircraft and certification of pilots and \ncertification of mechanics and others in safety-related positions. That \nis what this amendment would do.\n  The FAA would have to defer major Next Generation Air Traffic Control \nSystem initiatives. That is extraordinarily painful. After all, we go \nback to our old story that we are behind Mongolia in this modernization \neffort. Just a thought.\n  In all of this we would be including next generation network-enabled \nweather, data communications, systemwide information management, safety \nsecurity and environmental security, information tool set. This means \naccurate weather forecasting would go down and pilots would have less \nrelevant information, resulting in increased delays and congestion as \naircraft would have a lot more difficulty navigating storms. Weather is \nthe associated cause of 7 percent of delays, much less accidents. It \ncuts Data Comm. It would impact pilot situational awareness and lead to \ndegraded air safety control, having an effect on safety.\n  It would cut FAA's research, engineering, and development, and \nrequire FAA to cancel or delay the NextGen and environmental research--\nI repeat, to cancel or delay NextGen.\n  Specifically, FAA will terminate all related programs that were \nstarted since 2008, including the Continuous Low-Energy Emission and \nNoise Program, which develops cleaner and quieter aircraft technologies \nand alternative aviation fuels. Safety research would also be impacted, \nincluding a 1-year delay for research on continued airworthiness for \nsmall aircraft, as well as research on emerging technologies for larger \naircraft.\n  Specific office impacts: Office of Human Resources. FAA would \nfurlough all employees for at least 46 days. Furloughing AHR employees \nwould impose a significant hardship on AHR's ability to provide human \nresources to FAA. Aviation safety and security hazard materials would \nbe reduced. This means fewer inspectors for airlines, fewer parts \ncertified as safe, and delays in producing new U.S.-manufactured \naircraft.\n  The Office of the Associate Administrator for Airports would also be \ncut. This would be an increased risk of runway incursions and delays to \ntechnology that would minimize such risks which have been widely \nreported in the press and often not reported in the press but \nnevertheless happen.\n  The FAA would implement a hiring freeze which amongst many things \nwould lead to a loss of support staff in air traffic control towers \nand, consequently, controllers would pick up administrative duties and \nwould have less time on the boards in front of them, the lights going \noff and on. This could lead to an increased number of severity of \noperational errors. You cannot make operational errors in the control \ntower. You cannot hand that off to other people. That is called \nessential air safety. This means fewer air traffic controllers and ones \nthat are less focused on directing airplanes. On the safety side and on \nthe maneuverability side, both would subside.\n  Elimination of all Federal contract tower funding will effectively \nshift the cost of operating these towers to the affected airports or to \nState and local government. I do not know what good comes of that since \nState and local governments do not do that stuff.\n  I could go through State by State what the effects would be, but what \nit does is a ham-handed approach to make a cut.\n  There is a very interesting thing about air traffic safety: It is \nhighly sophisticated. It is compartmentalized. You can't just shift \npeople from this to that as quickly as you can in other lines of work. \nLives are at stake, homes on the ground are at stake, crashes are at \nstake, collisions are at stake. So it is all well and good to do \nsomething which appears to be cutting the budget, but when you are \nputting the lives of Americans on the ground and in the air directly at \nrisk, that strikes me as something we should not do.\n  So I am extraordinarily unenthusiastic about this amendment,\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\nand I hope there are many eloquent speeches that follow me in this \nmanner.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will take such time as I may \nconsume, and I am sure Senator Paul will be here shortly.\n  Mr. President, the Paul amendment does reduce the aggregate \nauthorized spending level to the amount appropriated in fiscal year \n2008. So basically it is going back to the 2008 levels. I am going to \nsupport the amendment because I think we have to make a start at \ncutting back on spending in every area of government that is \ndiscretionary and where we can make responsible cuts. However, I do \nwant to say that the better approach, in my opinion, would be to have \nan overall cap on spending at the 2008 levels and then pick the \npriorities we must fund and take away the lesser priorities for \ngovernment funding. I believe we need a more measured approach on \ninfrastructure spending.\n  In the case of the FAA, I would point out that the agency is funded \nthrough a mix of aviation trust fund dollars and general fund dollars. \nSpecifically, three of the four main accounts in the FAA budget--\nairport improvement, facilities and equipment, and research--are paid \nfor entirely by the aviation trust fund. The aviation trust fund is \nfunded by revenue from various users of the U.S. aviation system \nthrough taxes and fees on the industry. So all capital investment in \naviation infrastructure is paid for by the users of that \ninfrastructure. The fourth account--operations--is then funded \npartially by the aviation trust fund and partially from the general \nfund.\n  So as we move toward conference, I think we need to make sure \ninfrastructure projects that increase airport capacity, improve safety, \nincrease the efficiency of our aviation system, and modernize our air \ntraffic control system are adequately funded. This should be especially \ntrue when the revenues used to pay for these projects are paid for by \nthe users of the aviation system.\n  I am certainly committed to restoring fiscal responsibility. I think \nwe have to choose the strategic places where we must invest to ensure \nour infrastructure serves the needs of our people. I believe Congress \nwould be much wiser to have an aggregate discretionary spending cap and \nthen allow us to debate the priorities that would be funded under that \ncap. But that means doing business not as usual. It means we don't take \neach bill individually, each department and agency individually. It \nmeans we set an overall cap for Federal spending and then decide which \nplaces in which agencies should be well funded and which ones should \ntake a pass for the present until we get our fiscal house in order.\n  So I am going to support the Paul amendment, but I do believe we need \nto have a more systematic approach going forward and fund what needs to \nbe funded. And I do believe FAA, aviation security, aviation \ninfrastructure and efficiency in our air traffic system should be \nfunded. But I think we have to do it in a bigger picture than each \nindividual bill that is going to go through here, and I ask my \ncolleagues to think about a better approach going forward than this \ntype of amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for the work they have done. As I said yesterday, it is fairly \nexceptional, considering the time it has taken to get to where we are.\n  I understand the amendment that is being proposed and the goal of it, \nand I have been one of those who have supported the deficit commission, \nwhich brought forward some recommendations on how to manage this \nbudget. I have supported multiple efforts on this floor to reduce and \nmanage the budget in the overall scheme of how we move down to \nsustainability regarding the finances of this country. But this is one \nbill where you have to take into account not only what is being \nproposed but what it does and what it will impact. I will use my State \nas an example. When you think about Alaska, there is no question that \nwhen it comes to air travel, no other State has the kind of rural and \nextended air travel as we have in Alaska. I talked about the Essential \nAir Service Program yesterday. Forty-four communities are affected by \nthe funding for this program, which serves people who are not next door \nto any airport and who are not only not just a few miles from an \nairport, but in some cases, from their airport to a hub, it might be \n1,200 miles. So the work and the resources of the Essential Air Service \nis critical for us to not only conduct business, to move people back \nand forth between communities, but for medical services. It is really \nthe lifeblood for our communities. This amendment would literally wipe \nthat out or reduce it to such a point that it would be impossible for \nus to make it economical for some of these airports to operate and some \nof these flight services that bring the only service to these \ncommunities, allowing them to survive.\n  When you think about NextGen, if we went to the 2008 levels, NextGen \nwas just in the beginning stages. This is an important investment. And \nit is not the Federal Government that was anxious to get it done right \naway. We had to actually push Congress--the chairman may remember \nthis--we had to push the Federal Government to move this forward. Why? \nBecause it was the private sector that came to us. The people in the \nprivate sector came to us and said: It is important that the Federal \nGovernment move this forward, expedite this resource, help us move this \nnew technology forward to help save fuel, save time, increase capacity \nat our airports, and make it a better business operation for the \nprivate sector airports.\n  So when I see this amendment, my view is that it is a job- killing \namendment. This wasn't a decision where the Commerce Committee said: \nWell, let's just move this up a few years because we think the \ngovernment should do this right away. The private sector came to us \nbecause they wanted to invest in this new technology. But they are not \ngoing to make the investment until there is certainty from the Federal \nGovernment on their part of the arrangement. So that is what we are \ndoing. We are doing that in this bill. So this amendment, in my view, \nis truly a job-killing amendment.\n  Then I look at the airport improvements, and I was listening to the \nchairman, who was talking about the contracted services. So I quickly \nlooked at the list affecting Alaska, and I saw Kodiak. Kodiak is where \nthe largest Coast Guard base in this country is. Kodiak is also the \ncontracted services tower. I don't know how that will affect the Coast \nGuard. I would be very nervous about what it might do.\n  This type of amendment may be well meaning in the sense of how we all \nare going to sit here--and I left the Budget Committee meeting to come \nhere. The Budget Committee is where we are now talking about how to \nplan this budget in a holistic way, not nitpick it like this. The \namendment may be well intended to get control of the budget, but it \ndoes not understand the impact.\n  Again, airport improvement is another piece. I would challenge the \nindividual who sponsored the amendment. If he has been to Alaska, \ngreat. I would love to take him to a couple of those airports. There is \nnow a great reality show about flying in Alaska. It is so dangerous to \nfly in Alaska that they had to make a reality show about it. So I would \nencourage everyone to turn that on and see why NextGen, which was \npioneered in Alaska, is so important and why this investment the \nFederal Government is making is so important for the private sector to \nhave a better tool to utilize in transportation in this country.\n  Again, airport improvements in my State are critical. It could be \nanything from refinishing a runway to just having a gravel runway--one \nthat brings food and supplies, medical provisions, and just moving \npeople in and out. It is a critical piece of the equation.\n  The phrase the Chairman used about the amendment was that he was less \nthan enthusiastic about it. I don't like the amendment as it is written \ntoday, specifically around this bill. I am anxious to get to the bigger \ndebate, and I hope, once this bill is cleared off, we will get to the \nbig debate of how we manage the deficit of this country, how we look at \nit long term. I know I will\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\nhear that this is a start, this is the way we have to start, and that \nwould make sense if this bill was started with that intent in mind. But \nin 2007, when this authorization expired, NextGen was just an idea. \nWell, this is a new investment we have to make in order to make our air \ntravel safer, more economical, save fuel, and respond to the private \nsector that has asked us to get off the dime and create certainty so \nthey can make the investments that will make their business model more \neffective.\n  Again, I had no intention to speak today. I was in the Budget \nCommittee, but I wanted to come down and say a few words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I again thank the chairman for the time, allowing me to \nsay a few words from Alaska's perspective. And I would again emphasize \nthat this amendment is a job-killing amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, everyone agrees that the FAA plays an \nimportant role in air safety. I don't think there is any real \ndiscussion or debate on either side in that regard. My amendment calls, \nthough, for having spending levels at 2008. This is actually what is \ngoing to be produced out of the House. The House has already published \ntheir spending proposals, and most of their spending proposals will be \nat the 2008 level.\n  This is a small downpayment on the debt. Some say this is the wrong \nplace to start, but you have to start somewhere. Everybody says they \nare going to be for balancing the budget or tackling the debt or doing \nthis or that, but you don't get there unless you cut spending.\n  Now, you can't create a situation where you make it an either/or \nsituation--either we have air safety or we don't have air safety--\ndepending on a spending level. Perhaps you can spend money more wisely. \nPerhaps the job of a legislator is to find out how you spend money, how \nyou find savings, and how you make do with less. If we don't, we are \nnever going to get out of this problem.\n  The deficit is an enormous burden on all of us--on our kids and \ngrandkids. The last election was about the deficit, about the mounting \ndebt, but the other side doesn't seem to have listened. They also need \nto understand what the deficit does to jobs. Our national debt now is \napproaching our gross domestic product. That means our debt is about \nequal to what we produce as an economy for a year as a whole country. \nWhen it does, there are estimates that it kills the rate of growth of \nour economy by 1 percent and costs 1 million jobs a year. This is from \nthe debt.\n  They are talking about what $2 billion will do within one agency. We \nare talking about what $14 trillion worth of debt does to an entire \neconomy. Remember, 1 percent loss of growth and 1 million jobs a year. \nThe national debt is killing us.\n  So we had an intervening election, and a message was sent. The \nmessage was, listen to the American people. They are upset about \npassing this debt on to our kids and our grandkids. So we got a \nresponse. The President laid out his budget this week. Do you know what \nhis budget will do? The President's budget will spend $46 trillion--I \nam not making that up, $46 trillion over 10 years. That tells me the \nother side didn't get the message.\n  Now, $46 trillion over 10 years, what does this mean? When President \nObama came into office, the debt was about $7 trillion, maybe $8 \ntrillion. We are now going to triple that debt if he wins a second \nterm. The President will have tripled the national debt in 8 years.\n  His 10-year proposal will double the debt in just 10 years. The \ndeficit this year alone will be $1.65 trillion.\n  The President said he is going to freeze spending. He is going to \nfreeze spending in this little, tiny percentage of the budget, about 12 \npercent of the budget. It is not enough. It doesn't do it.\n  Republicans want to go back to the 2008 level, which is what I am \nproposing. It is not enough either because you are only looking at one \ntiny sliver of the budget. Today we are looking at one small program.\n  The problem is that people are starting to recognize the problem of \nthe debt, but they are unwilling to do what it takes to look at the \nentire budget. We are going to have to look at military spending, we \nare going to have to look at nonmilitary discretionary spending, and \nultimately we are going to have to look at entitlements. But you have \nto say every program has something good about it. Everybody can stand \nand say we need NextGen. I am for NextGen. But the thing is, if you are \na legislator and you have less money, let's figure out where we find \nthe money in the existing budget.\n  I proposed some other alternatives. I proposed $500 million in \nsavings by saying: When we build airports, let's not make it be the \nunion wage or the prevailing wage, let's have the market wage. That \nwould have saved $500 million. That goes a long way toward funding \nNextGen. Another $500 million, $400 to 500 million is in the \nunprofitable airports that we are going to subsidize in this bill. \nThere are savings that can be found, but we never find them.\n  In Washington, what do we tend to do? If we want something, we just \nadd more money to the bill. There are always arguments for these \nprograms, but we also have to understand what are the consequences of a \n$14 trillion debt.\n  President Obama's 10-year plan that he released this week will change \n$14 trillion into nearly $27 trillion. The numbers are mind-boggling. \nIf we do not do something about it, it is a threat to our country. The \nPresident's own Secretary of Defense has said the No. 1 threat to our \nnational security is our debt. It is out of control. I don't think the \nproblem is fully grasped by either side, but I know if we are here \ntoday and cannot come to an agreement to save $2 billion--think about \nit. I am asking to save $2 billion out of a budget of $3.7 trillion. It \nis such a small number.\n  They might argue it is such a small number, why even do it? If you \ndon't start somewhere, how will we ever balance the budget? How will we \never get out of this mess if we are not willing to save $2 billion? It \nis a start. It is a downpayment. It is how we can say to the American \npeople we heard you in November. We realize we cannot pass this debt on \nto our kids and our grandkids. Something has to be done.\n  Instead, what we get from the other side is that we make this into: \nThe other side is not for progress. They are not for developing \nairports. They are not for GPS systems at the airport. It is not that \nsimple. I am for all those things, but I am for saying let's step up as \nlegislators and say: How do we find the savings in the existing budget? \nBecause the alternative is: How are we going to pay for $14 trillion in \ndebt? How are we going to pay for $26 trillion in debt that is going to \nbe added if the President gets his 10-year plan?\n  You can pay for debt in a variety of ways. You can tax people. But as \nyou can tell by the movement out there, most of us think we are taxed \nenough already. The average taxpayer is often paying 40 percent and 50 \npercent of his income. The average taxpayer is paying more in taxes \nthan they do for food and clothing and transportation and all their \nexpenses; they pay more in taxes. I don't think the general public \nwants to raise taxes.\n  The other way is, you stick your head in the sand and keep borrowing. \nThat is what we keep doing, borrowing and borrowing, but it threatens \nour very economy and threatens the country.\n  How does the country also pay for debt? Are we going to default on \nour debt? No. Ultimately, we will print money to pay for it, but there \nis a downside to that too. Countries have ruined their currency. \nGermany in the 1920s destroyed their currency.\n  If you look at the curve of what happened to the currency in the \n1920s, it happened over a period of about 6 months. You had bread that \nsold for 100 marks and then 1 million marks and then 100 million marks \nand then 1 billion marks. The money became so devalued it was of more \nvalue to actually burn as a fuel. People went around with wheelbarrows \nfull of money. The workers demanded to be paid two and three times a \nday.\n  That is what happens to a country that has a massive debt. You cannot \ntax people enough.\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\n  Greece just went through default recently. As Greece went through \ndefault, they tried to raises taxes, but everybody was paying too much \nalready, so everything was forced into the underground economy. You can \nraise the taxes by 90 percent, you don't get more money. When you \nincrease tax rates, you don't always get more money. The money went \nunderground.\n  You can print the money, but if you just simply print the money, you \ndestroy people's savings. You steal from those who have saved and take \nthe value of their dollar.\n  This bill is the beginning of the debate. It is the first bill we \nhave had to come forward with a new Congress that talks about money. It \nis a very small downpayment. I am asking for a little over $2 billion \nsavings. It is 2008 levels. It is what the House is asking for. You \nhave to realize also what happened between 2008 and 2011. Do you know \nhow much spending went up? Spending went up by 24 percent. Spending is \nout of control in this city, and we have to realize the consequences. \nIf we stood here and had an argument over whether NextGen is a good \nthing, there is no argument. It is a good thing. We should have GPS. We \nhave it in our cars. For certain, we should have it in our airports. I \nam all for modernizing the airports. But what I am saying is, it is \nirresponsible as legislators to stand here and just say more, more, \nmore. We are going to spend more money.\n  We cannot do it. The thing is, it is not just the program. We are not \ntalking about whether the program is justified or whether we should \nspend money. We are talking about what are the consequences of a \nmassive debt. I think that is where we are.\n  The American people know this. They instinctively know this. I think \nthere is a great danger to not stepping up. I wish the other side would \nhave come back and said: Why don't we split the difference and try to \nsave $1.5 billion. That is what compromise would be in this city. If \nthey don't want to save $2.5 billion, let's save $1.5 billion. But the \nthing is, we need to save money everywhere and it cannot be that every \nprogram you want to cut is somebody else's program and then when it \ngets to be your program that you are interested in, you can't cut it. \nEverybody has a self-interest in their program. Every special interest \nin this country has a special interest. They have an interest in their \nparticular spending.\n  I would say this is a small downpayment. This is a way to say to the \nAmerican people: We have heard you in the election. We know there is a \nproblem. We are going to start cutting spending.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to vote for this amendment. It is something \nthat has nothing to do with quality, has nothing to do with whether you \nbelieve in air safety. It has to do with whether you think the debt is \na problem, whether you think the debt is a threat to us as a country, \nand whether we are going to step up and do the responsible thing.\n  I reserve my time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, what is pending before the Senate at \nthis moment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment of the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding this amendment by the Senator from \nKentucky would establish a new authorization level for the Federal \nAviation Administration, which would revert to the level of 2008. I \nthink it is worth noting that this may cut spending in some regards, \nbut I do not believe it is a wise decision by the Senate to move in \nthat direction.\n  Our world has changed dramatically since 2008 and the world of \naviation even more so. The aviation industry is not the same today by \nany means. We debated the FAA bill on the Senate floor in 2008. At that \ntime, oil was $120 a barrel, and the airline industry was in the \ndoldrums.\n  Eight airlines either completely ceased operations or filed for \nbankruptcy that year. That cost 11,000 airline-related jobs in America. \nAirlines that weathered the financial storm lost millions of dollars \nbecause fuel costs were going through the roof.\n  United Airlines, based in Chicago, which I am honored to represent, \nreported a $538 million loss that year, driven by a $618 million \nincrease in fuel expenses. The airlines reacted to this market reality \nin 2008 by reducing capacity across the industry by 25 percent. Flights \nwere reduced at airports all around the country.\n  The point I am trying to make is, if we take a snapshot of the \naviation industry in 2008, we would find an industry devastated by high \nfuel prices, still recovering from some of the episodes that followed \nafter 2001, and dramatically cutting back its services across the \nUnited States.\n  We have a suggestion by the Senator from Kentucky to return to that \nlevel of spending by the government, when it comes to our \nresponsibilities related to the airline industry. I do not believe that \nis a thoughtful suggestion because it does not reflect the reality of \nwhere we are today and what we are likely to see in the future.\n  Today is a different day. The airline industry is seeing a major \nrebound at this point in America. Airlines have reported a $15 profit \nin 2010, and the industry is adding jobs. Airline activity is up \nconsiderably compared to 3 or 4 years ago. Today the FAA announced that \ntheir forecasts for aviation traffic for the next 20 years were too \nlow. The FAA now predicts U.S. airlines will reach 1 billion passengers \nper year by 2021, 2 years earlier than last year's prediction.\n  So the obvious question is, if the airlines are now going to move \nforward into a period of expansion with more flights, can we afford to \nsay to the American public and the flying public from around the world \nas they come to the United States that we are going to dramatically cut \ngovernment investment in aviation?\n  What the Senator from Kentucky would have us cut, unfortunately, is \nnot the fluff and the extras. It goes to the heart of the \nresponsibility of the Federal Aviation Administration. Madam President, \nyou and I and our colleagues get on these airlines every week. We put \nour fate and future in their hands, trusting that we have a qualified \nairline crew, a plane that is ready to fly, and air traffic controllers \nwho will move us safely from one spot to another.\n  Much of that is being done by those who are employees of the \nairlines. But a lot is being done by the employees of the Federal \nAviation Administration. What Senator Paul is suggesting is that we, at \na time of great expansion in this industry, need to cut back on the \ngovernment role.\n  It means fewer dollars and, equally important, fewer professionals \nwho would be inspecting these airplanes to make sure they are safe, \nfewer air traffic controllers, less of a role by our government in \nmaking certain the airlines are operating in a safe and efficient \nmanner at a time when the aviation industry is expanding.\n  Senator Paul's suggestion moves us in the wrong direction. If there \nwas ever a need for more vigilance, more oversight, and more \nprofessionalism at the FAA it is now. Cutting back to 2008 spending \nlevels will take away the professional men and women who make the FAA \nthe fine agency that it is.\n  We signed the last FAA reauthorization bill into law in December of \n2003. That bill expired in 2007, about the same time Congress was \nconsidering the fiscal year 2008 spending levels of the FAA. We have \nnow extended this law 17 times, lurching forward each time, waiting for \nthis moment when the bill came to the floor.\n  Congress used to reauthorize the FAA every 2 years just to keep up \nwith a changing aviation industry and to make sure our government \nagency, working with the airlines, was on top of its responsibility. \nNow we have been stuck with the same authorization bill we crafted 9 \nyears ago, and the Senator from Kentucky, with this amendment, would \nhave us go back to spending levels of 2008.\n  Almost all Senators agree we need to do more to make sure we have the \nbest\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\nmen and women working for the Federal Aviation Administration. We need \nto talk about a new generation of air traffic control. Almost all \nSenators understand we need to update an air traffic control system \nthat is based on World War II technology, technology from the 1940s--70 \nyears ago. It is good, but it could be dramatically better.\n  This bill before us makes that investment in a technology known as \nNextGen. These investments move us from radar-based systems to a GPS-\nbased system. It is incredible to me that I can stand on the floor of \nthe Senate and make this speech while I can carry in my pocket a cell \nphone which has a GPS device which some people could use to determine \nwhere I am at this very moment in time. Yet when I board an airplane to \nfly to Chicago, this technology is not being used. Instead, they are \nusing radar--not an ancient technology but a very old technology.\n  If a GPS is good enough for my cell phone, if it is good enough for \nso many other applications, such as the bus that travels back and forth \non the streets in the city of Chicago, why don't we have it in our \nairplanes? Well, because we have never moved from that old technology \nto this modern technology of GPS, using satellites to determine \nexactly, pinpointing, where the planes are at every moment.\n  The FAA bill before us moves us in this direction. The Paul amendment \nby the Senator from Kentucky would basically eliminate our development \nof this new technology. The amendment moves us back to the past and it \ndoes not save money. The Paul amendment, in fact, would basically deny \nus this new technology. The FAA Administrator under President Bush, \nMarion Blakey, was recently asked what she thought about the movement \nto roll back funding to the fiscal year 2008 levels--the Paul \namendment--when she was Administrator. She said: ``It's false savings \nbecause in the long run it'll cost us much more.''\n  She knows and we know we have to move to GPS from radar to make it \nsafer and more up to date. Senator Paul of Kentucky says: Let's stop \ntalking about the future. Let's focus on the past.\n  Can we afford that when it comes to the aviation industry, where \nevery single day we entrust our lives and the lives of the people we \nlove on these airplanes?\n  Ms. Blakey said that rolling out the NextGen system by 2018--which is \nthe goal of this bill--would save $22 billion, mostly because fewer \ndelays would mean less fuel burned.\n  But reducing FAA spending to the fiscal year 2008 levels, as Senator \nPaul suggests in this amendment, would amount, as Marion Blakey said, \nto a cut of $1.3 billion--the amount being spent this next year on \nNextGen. It would roll back and stop NextGen, this new technology, \nbefore we can move forward.\n  This amendment is not about saving money. This amendment is about \ncutting corners in an area where we should never cut corners. When it \ncomes to the safety of the American public boarding airplanes every \nday, you do not cut corners. You make sure you have the very best \nprofessionals working for the agency and the best technology being used \nby airports and airliners as well.\n  I am afraid Senator Paul's approach may have some appeal to those who \nwould cut blindly, but if you open your eyes and take a look at it, \nthis is a bad move--a move that invites some terrible consequences, \nwhich none of us want to envision. We need to keep America investing in \nmodern technology. We need to expand our national airspace safely and \nefficiently.\n  I urge my colleagues, this afternoon or early this evening, to vote \nagainst the Paul amendment. I know his goal is to save money. This is \nmoney that needs to be spent for the safety of the American flying \npublic.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, we are out here talking about the FAA \nbill, a bill to improve the transportation system in America dealing \nwith our airways. There are a lot of great things about this \nlegislation, everything from the passengers' bill of rights to \nimprovement in airport infrastructure that many of my colleagues have \nbeen out here on the floor talking about. Even the Acting President pro \ntempore articulated why it is so important to make improvements in our \nground-based system.\n  Practically every elected official in America knows that airports are \na cornerstone of economic development. No business is going to locate \nin a community without knowing what the air transportation system is. \nIf it is falling behind, if it is dilapidated, people are going to go \nsomewhere else for their economic development. So improving the ground \ntransportation system as part of the airport infrastructure is \ncritically important for improving jobs in America.\n  So I know my colleagues are out here offering amendments, and the \npending amendment is the Paul amendment, which is a very concerning \namendment from the prospects of what it would do to cut the innovation \nwe are about to implement in this FAA bill--the longstanding \nimprovements to the Federal aviation system that have to do with taking \nour airways from a 1950s technology to a 21st century technology that \nimproves both the situation for the pilots in the sky and the \nefficiency of our system and it improves and coordinates the \ncommunication system on the ground.\n  All that also increases jobs in America, high-wage jobs. It puts \nAmerica back in the driver's seat in the development of key technology. \nThose are the kinds of jobs in manufacturing we want to be creating in \nAmerica.\n  So when my colleague from Kentucky comes out and offers a proposal to \nbasically slow down the implementation by the FAA on key employees in \nthese areas that are part of the technology and infrastructure, what \nyou are going to do is slow down high-wage manufacturing jobs in the \nUnited States as well.\n  With this legislation--with both the improvements to the airport \ninfrastructure and what is, with the NextGen system, going to take \nplace with new technology--we are talking about thousands of new jobs \nin America. We certainly want those manufacturing jobs to be here in \nthe United States and to get the benefits of this NextGen system.\n  So I wish to take a moment to talk about that NextGen transportation \nsystem and why it is so important to us in creating jobs. Because my \ncolleague from Kentucky may not realize, when you actually cut people \nand you cut the number of programs that are geared toward this, such as \nin the NextGen system, you are talking about that the R programs \ncould be reduced by as much as $25 million and then funding for areas \nsuch as how to do self-separation, weather technology in the cockpit, \nweight turbulence.\n  I do not know about the Acting President pro tempore, but I fly a \nlot, back and forth across the country almost every week. Some of the \npilots I have been flying with have said this has been the most \nturbulent weather this winter that they have seen. So I know \npersonally. I want to know as much about this and the latest technology \nthat can help us. But under this proposal, the estimated loss of jobs \nand cutbacks in grant programs and targeted areas again could mean the \nloss of expertise in R that is critical for us in our flying \ntransportation system and safety.\n\n  So what are we talking about when we are talking about the NextGen \nsystem? We are talking about improvements in flight performance and \nimprovements in the passenger experience and improvements in basically \neven how we use fuel.\n  What I like about the NextGen system most is that it reduces total \nflight delays by 21 percent. That is not the day we pass the bill or \nwhen the President signs it. But over time, the implementation of this \nsystem--which, again, we have a very old 1950s system, so it is \nbasically radar. It is taking a picture in the sky and saying: Here is \nwhere planes are and having air traffic controllers talk to those \nplanes and control, even in pass-off movements, where those flights are \ngoing.\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\n  In fact, I would say to the Acting President pro tempore, I do not \nknow if she or anybody in her family has ever played Flight Simulator. \nThere is probably more certainty and predictability in the movement in \na flight simulator than in that radar system we have today. But we are \ngoing to change that.\n  What this does, by allowing for more accurate tracking and interface \nand information, is give us the ability to have flights fly on a more \ndirect path, to be able to coordinate better with flights in \ntransportation, and to have that system totally integrated on the \nground.\n  So even those kinds of flight delays that happen on the ground at \nairports, where you are waiting and taxiing at the airport--oh, this \nflight is here and that flight is there--all that will be more \nimproved. In fact, that improvement, estimates are, will reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions from the air transportation system by 12 percent. So \nthat is a very positive aspect of moving forward on Next Generation.\n  Obviously, if you are improving flight delays by 21 percent, I \nguarantee you, you are going to be improving the passenger experience. \nWhen they know we are trying to get them where they need to go on time, \nin a better coordinated fashion, with savings, it helps us.\n  But it also is going to improve the ground transportation system. If \nyou think about that, our ground transportation system is always in \nneed of coordination. We have actually had some accidents on runways. \nPeople have heard those in the news over the last several years.\n  So what this does--when you, again, have a GPS system, the GPS system \nis coordinating that, so you have better coordination of the taxiing of \nplanes and airport vehicles and the entire ground transportation \nsystem. That should not be minimized. The fact that we can imagine how \na GPS system can give us better data in the sky is important, but there \nis a lot that is lost on the ground with flights and the coordination \nof flights.\n  If you can imagine--just one of my personal pet peeves--you fly all \nthe way across the country and you end up at your destination after \n5\\1/2\\ hours, and no one is there to meet the plane or it takes an \nextra 10 minutes because somehow somebody did not know the plane was \nactually at the gate.\n  All that changes with the system. You know exactly where the plane \nis, and you know when they are going to be at that gate after they have \nlanded. You know exactly how long it is going to take for them to taxi \nand how long it is going to take to get there. So that is a great \nimprovement in this system and something that should not be \nunderestimated.\n  But the issue of safety is also of critical importance--the fact that \nsafety, in any kind of improvement to our system, has to be the \nparamount issue. To me, that is what NextGen delivers. It delivers \nbetter air traffic controller information. It means there is no routing \npass-offs, as we do now when you are flying in between cities. At some \npoint in time, Seattle is tracking you. When you leave Seattle, at some \npoint in time, it is handed over to another sector and then to another \nsector and then to another sector. This situation is going to have \naccurate information all the way across, including no pass-offs or \nchallenges with pass-offs, and it is going to give the pilots \nthemselves better situational awareness. It is giving them more \ninformation about how they fly and about the information on the runway. \nSo that is critically important for this system. We want safety. We \nwant advancement.\n\n  In a lot of ways my colleague may be well intentioned in trying to \nreduce our budget, but when we look at these numbers and we look at \nwhat the Next Generation system is going to deliver, we don't want to \ncut that out of the government system. These are things that are going \nto give us efficiencies, they are going to help our economy, they are \ngoing to create jobs, and they are going to improve the safety of air \ntransportation travel. I can tell my colleagues I certainly want to \nimprove the safety and the situational awareness of pilots.\n  I mentioned fuel efficiency. I wish to talk about fuel efficiency for \na second because I know fuel efficiency is an important issue. The \nflying public may think, Well, why do we want planes to be more \nefficient? The more the transportation system uses fuel, obviously, the \nmore we have seen gas prices go up. It means our transportation tickets \nand travel costs are more expensive. With this Next Generation system, \nif we can start driving more fuel efficiency in our air flights by 5 or \n6 percent, then we are going to help keep the efficiency in the \ntransportation system.\n  A program with something like Next Generation was done by Southwest \nAirlines in a pilot project in Texas, and it actually demonstrated a 6-\npercent fuel savings for flights between Dallas and Houston. By that I \nmean it showed that by giving pilots more information, being allowed \nbecause of a satellite system-like approach to transportation instead \nof radar, they are able to fly a more direct route from takeoff to \ndestination. That efficiency translates into savings in fuel costs. It \nalone is a very important aspect of the system.\n  The net-net of this is high-wage jobs for us in this particular \nsector. When we think about this, it means high-wage jobs in \nengineering, in software development, and for other high-tech workers \nwho are part of developing this system, as well as jobs for the flight \ncrews and maintenance and basically everybody who benefits from the \nfact that we have a traveling public and tourism in our economy.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote down the amendment by the Senator from \nKentucky. All of these things are very positive aspects of the Next \nGeneration system and the improvements to our air transportation. This \namendment would cut the viability of many of these programs within the \nNextGen system and the jobs that can be created from this particular \nlegislation. It is definitely long overdue and something the public is \nexpecting from us.\n  I mentioned there is a passenger bill of rights here which in and of \nitself is a very positive aspect of the legislation in terms of access. \nAny time there is a delay on the runway, we have to make sure there is \naccess to food and water and necessary medical treatment. Basically, \nthe Department of Transportation can issue fines for noncompliance of \nairlines. I know many of the traveling public will love this particular \naspect of this important FAA legislation.\n  I hope we can dispose of this amendment by my colleague from Kentucky \nand move on to passing this important legislation. It is about jobs. It \nis about safety. It is about fuel efficiency. It is about ontime \narrival. It is about not gutting this legislation when it is needed \nmost to be passed by this body.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I see my colleague from Washington is \nalso here to speak so I will yield the floor for her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to take 10 \nminutes of the Republican time unless a Republican Senator comes to the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we are here on the floor debating an \namendment by the Senator from Kentucky. It is very important for the \nAmerican public to understand. Everyone agrees we have to take some \nsmart steps to cut waste and reduce our debt and deficit, but cutting \nback doesn't mean cutting blindly. It doesn't mean indiscriminately \ncutting programs that not only create jobs but, importantly, keep our \ncountry and people safe. Make no mistake about it: The Paul amendment \nwe are considering and that we will be voting on shortly directly \nimpacts the safety of air travel in this country.\n  We all know the FAA has a very specific mission. It is responsible \nfor keeping air travel safe. It oversees the safety of our airline \noperations. It certifies the equipment they use to meet safety \nstandards. It is responsible for the air traffic controllers who guide \nour planes, and to make sure the pilots who are responsible for our \nsafety are fit to fly. That is what the FAA does. But under the \namendment we are considering this afternoon, the FAA's ability to do \nthat job would be dramatically hampered because under that amendment, \nthe FAA would lose hundreds of its safety inspectors and would have to \nuse furloughs to reduce the work hours of its entire safety inspector \nworkforce.\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\n  The FAA controls air traffic every hour of every day. Under the Paul \namendment, the FAA would have to furlough its air traffic controllers \nfor significant periods of time because we wouldn't be able to afford \nto pay for the controller workforce to make sure we have safety in the \nskies. That doesn't make any sense. It would mean stretching a thinner \nworkforce that bears the burden of keeping millions of air travelers \nsafe every day.\n  The Paul amendment would force the FAA to continue controlling air \ntraffic with outdated equipment. That is not what we should be doing \ntoday. We all know the FAA is currently in the midst of a long-term \ninitiative called NextGen to modernize our air traffic control system \nwhich the Senator from Washington just spoke about--a system that will \nincrease the capacity of our aviation system. It will reduce delays and \ncancellations that everybody knows are hampering our air traffic right \nnow. It saves fuel, and it lowers emissions. It is a modernization \neffort that is long overdue.\n  Right now, our air transportation system still relies on radar \ntechnology that was developed during World War II. That is right. If \nyou are flying today, you are relying on radar technology that was \ndeveloped during World War II. The cell phones in everybody's pockets \nmake use of satellite positioning, but we still haven't moved the FAA \nto a satellite-based system that could guide our planes with increased \nefficiency. Every one of us uses computer networks every day in our \nlives, but we are still making the investments to move the FAA to \nnetwork-enabled operations that will help the agency coordinate more \neffectively with Homeland Security and the Defense Department.\n  We all rely on our BlackBerries to communicate with each other \nthrough e-mail and text messages, but we are still making the \ninvestments necessary to help the FAA rely less heavily on voice \ncommunication between pilots and air traffic controllers. If you are on \na flight and if you listen on your headphones when the pilot is talking \nto the air traffic controllers, and you know they step on each other, \nwe know the system is not efficient. Under the Paul amendment being \noffered today, that entire modernization effort would face significant \ndelays. With goals for reduced delays and fuel savings in sight, we \nwould be stepping on the brakes. Ironically, that would increase the \ncost of these NextGen investments over the long term, forcing all of us \nas taxpayers to put in more money to reach those necessary goals.\n  This amendment would not only impact the safety of our travelers in \nthis country, it would create a major impact on our efforts to create \njobs and boost the economy. I told my colleagues this amendment would \nfurlough or eliminate the jobs of workers across the country, and they \nare not nameless, faceless bureaucrats. These are people who are air \ntraffic controllers who are right now controlling the planes in the sky \nas we speak. These are the safety workers who are responsible for \nkeeping watch over our airlines and certifying our pilots to make sure \nthat plane they are flying and any repair that is made is done \ncorrectly. They are the researchers who are working to find cleaner and \nquieter aircraft technology and alternative aviation fuels.\n  But this amendment wouldn't just impact those workers we all rely on, \nand that is because when we are forced to continue flying with fewer \nair traffic controllers in the tower under older technology, we are \ngoing to face huge delays and inefficiencies that will lead to billions \nof dollars in lost revenue. Ask anybody in the hotel business or \nrestaurant business or tourist business what happened after 9/11 when \nour air traffic was shut down. The impact on our economy is huge.\n  We need to make sure when we make cuts to our budget, we do it \nwisely. The Paul amendment that is before us affects our economy, \naffects jobs, and critically affects the safety of the American public. \nThat is not wise or responsible.\n  The most recent statistics show that civil aviation accounts for \nabout $1.3 trillion in economic activity in this country. Even more \nimportantly, aviation provides jobs for hard-working Americans. A few \nyears ago, 11 million Americans were employed in an aviation-related \nfield. They earned about $400 billion. This is not the time to put this \nvital job sector at risk by cutting back on our effort to modernize and \ninnovate, and we should never be willing to put the safety of our skies \nand our airports and Americans at risk.\n  This amendment is a misguided attempt at providing savings that comes \nat too high a cost. We all know and we all agree we need to be prudent \nabout our spending, but we can't undermine the FAA as our first attempt \nout here and put the American public at risk. That is not wise; that is \nnot prudent; it is not what we should be doing.\n  I urge the Senate to consider the very real danger this amendment \nposes to our safety and our economy and oppose this amendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \ntake 1 minute of the time remaining allocated to the other side of the \naisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I can say it in 1 minute. Why \ndo we not want to savage the FAA budget, cutting millions and millions, \nto go back to the 2008 level? Simply this: It is the safety of the \nflying public.\n  The airways are getting more crowded. The delays on the ground, in \nthe airports, are getting longer. That is the whole idea of creating a \nnew system of air traffic control--in order to handle more traffic \nsafely by having instruments in the cockpit that operate off our \nconstellation of satellites that can keep the separation between \nairliners, can fly more efficient direct routes, and it all be \ncoordinated instead of through radar from the ground. That is the whole \npurpose of the updating of the FAA air traffic control, called the Next \nGeneration of air traffic control.\n  If this amendment is adopted, all of that is savaged. That is not \nwhere America should be going.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I commend Senator Paul for his diligent \nwork to try to bring spending in line with our Nation's fiscal \nrealities.\n  His amendment reduces the overall authorization level for the Federal \nAviation Administration to $14.719 billion. That is the authorized \nlevel for fiscal year 2008. That is down from $17.526 billion, which is \nproposed under the 2011 bill. To put this in perspective, it is a 19-\npercent increase in just 3 years. If we continue to have those kinds of \nincreases, it is not going to be sustainable given our large and \ngrowing debt.\n  Holding spending to 2008 levels is not so outrageous or unworkable as \nhas been portrayed. By reducing the top line amount, the amendment \nprovides the Secretary of Transportation with the necessary discretion \nto make the appropriate reductions to the related FAA accounts. Not all \nof them, for example, are safety accounts. So priority could be given \nto those matters.\n  There is an argument that could be made that since this is an \nauthorizing bill rather than an appropriations bill, the overall \nfunding levels do not matter. But authorization bills do establish \nguideposts for the Appropriations Committee. In this case, the spending \nreductions reflect limits on how much will be appropriated out of the \nairport and airway trust fund.\n  Additionally, a portion of FAA's funding comes from the general fund \nof the U.S. Treasury. Imposing spending cuts to this authorization bill \nalso provides a tiny but still necessary signal to other Members of the \nbody, the administration, and the financial markets that the United \nStates is prepared to begin dealing with our pending budgetary \ncatastrophe.\n  The simple fact is that the United States is $14 trillion in debt and \nrunning an annual deficit of $1.6 trillion. Our record level of debt is \nequal to\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\n$45,500 per American citizen and $127,500 if we just count the \ntaxpayers in America. Each day the United States pays another $1.273 \nbillion in interest alone on this debt.\n  To be clear, the amendment could result in a reduction of some FAA \nservices. This is a reality that setting the tough spending priorities \nwill cause some services potentially to be trimmed and certainly \nunnecessary functions to be eliminated.\n  But I do not think the debate over this amendment can occur outside \nthe context of the difficult spending decisions that we are going to \nneed to consider in the next several weeks. We literally have to start \nsomewhere, and almost everywhere is going to require some sacrifice.\n  The House of Representatives will consider cuts to the FAA funding \nlevels this week and, likewise, this body will be required to do the \nsame.\n  I appreciate the work that Senator Paul has done and hope that my \ncolleagues will strongly consider supporting his amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \ndisposition of the Paul amendment occurs, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 514, which was received from the House and is at \nthe desk; that the Reid-McConnell substitute amendment, which is at the \ndesk, be agreed to; that there be up to 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees prior to the vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended; that there be no further amendments or \nmotions in order to the bill prior to the vote, and that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to everyone \ninvolved. It has been a difficult issue, but I will put on the record \nwhat I have told a number of Senators personally, and that is that we \nwill, prior to this expiration occurring, bring up the PATRIOT Act and \nhave an opportunity for an extended period of time--a week at least--to \noffer amendments and do whatever people feel is appropriate on this \nbill.\n  I have talked to a couple of Senators who have told me specifically \nthat they want to offer amendments. Although I didn't agree I would \nsupport their amendments--one was a Democrat and one was a Republican--\nI said that is what we should be able to do, to set this up so they can \noffer their amendments. And I will do whatever I can to make sure we \nmove forward on this legislation in ample time so that we can pass this \nPATRIOT Act for a more extended period of time, which is so important \nto the security of this country. I know people have problems with it, \nand that is why we are going to have the amendment process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 21 offered by \nthe Senator from Kentucky, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry) and the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Pryor) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a few minutes we are going to vote on a \n3-month extension of the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act. I will \nsupport this extension because it gives the Senate time to properly \nconsider this critically important legislation. But before I support \nany additional extensions of the PATRIOT Act, I believe we should have \nan honest discussion about changes and reforms that are necessary to \nprotect the constitutional rights of innocent Americans. It is worth \ntaking a moment to reflect on the history of the PATRIOT Act.\n  The PATRIOT Act was passed almost 10 years ago after the 9/11 \nterrorist attack. Ground Zero was still burning when President Bush \nasked Congress to give him new authority to fight terrorism. Congress \nresponded, passing the PATRIOT Act by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, \nincluding my own. It was a unique moment in our history.\n  But even then, many were concerned that the PATRIOT Act might go too \nfar when it came to our constitutional rights and freedoms. As a \nresult, we\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\nput an insurance policy in the law, a sunset clause on the PATRIOT \nAct's most controversial provisions. I believe that was a thoughtful \nmove on the part of the Senate and the House. We knew that we were in a \nvery emotional state because of the dramatic loss of life and fear that \nfollowed after the attacks on 9/11. We wanted to reflect on some of the \nchanges and authority given to the government at a later time.\n  I voted for the PATRIOT Act, but I soon realized it gave too much \npower to the government in some areas, without judicial and \nCongressional oversight. So 2 years after the PATRIOT Act became law, I \nled a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the SAFE Act, \nlegislation to reform the PATRIOT Act. The SAFE Act was supported not \nonly by the American Civil Liberties Union but also by the American \nConservative Union and Gun Owners of America. It was an extraordinary \ncoalition. Progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans came \ntogether across the partisan divide, with the understanding that \nAmericans believed we can be both safe and free. We wanted to retain \nthe expanded powers of the PATRIOT Act but place some reasonable limits \non those powers within the bounds of the Constitution.\n  In 2005, the first time Congress reauthorized the PATRIOT Act, some \nreforms of the SAFE Act were included in the bill. Many were not. So \nthere are still significant provisions in the PATRIOT Act which cause \nconcern to this Senator. The FBI is still permitted to obtain a John \nDoe roving wiretap that does not identify the person or the phone that \nwill be wiretapped.\n  In other words, the FBI can obtain a wiretap without telling a court \nwho they want to wiretap or where they want the place the wiretap \nitself. In garden-variety criminal cases, the FBI is still permitted to \nconduct what is known as sneak-and-peek searches of a home without \nnotifying the homeowner about the search until some later time.\n  We now know the vast majority of sneak-and-peek searches take place \nin cases that do not involve terrorism in any way. A national security \nletter, or NSL, is a form of administrative subpoena issued by the FBI. \nWe often hear NSLs compared to grand jury subpoenas. But unlike a grand \njury subpoena, a national security letter is issued without the \napproval of a grand jury or even a prosecutor. And unlike the grand \njury subpoena, the recipient of a national security letter is subject \nto a gag order at the FBI's discretion.\n  The PATRIOT Act greatly expanded the FBI's authority to NSLs. An NSL \nnow allows the FBI to obtain sensitive personal information about \ninnocent Americans, including library records, medical records, gun \nrecords, and phone records, even when there is no connection whatsoever \nto a suspected terrorist or spy.\n  The Justice Department's inspector general concluded that this \nstandard ``can be easily satisfied.'' This could lead to government \nfishing expeditions that target, unfortunately, innocent Americans.\n  For years we have been told there is no reason to be concerned about \nthis broad grant of power to the FBI. In 2003, Attorney General \nAshcroft testified to the Judiciary Committee that librarians who \nraised concern about the PATRIOT Act were ``hysterics,'' in the \nAttorney General's words, and ``the Department of Justice has neither \nthe staffing, the time, nor the inclination to monitor the reading \nhabits of Americans.''\n  But we now know, many years later, the FBI has, in fact, issued \nnational security letters for the library records of innocent \nAmericans. For years we were told the FBI was not abusing this broad \ngrant of power. But in 2007, the Justice Department's own inspector \ngeneral concluded the FBI was guilty of ``widespread and serious \nmisuse'' of the national security letter authority, and failed to \nreport those abuses to Congress and a White House oversight board.\n  The inspector general reported that the number of NSL requests had \nincreased exponentially from about 8,500 the year before the enactment \nof the PATRIOT Act to an average of more than 47,000 per year, and that \neven these numbers were significantly understated due to flaws in the \nFBI database.\n  I believe America can be both safe and free. We can retain the \nexpanded powers of the PATRIOT Act but place some reasonable limit on \nthem within our Constitution. I will support this extension so we have \ntime to produce legislation of which we can all be proud. I know the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee is on the floor to speak. I want to \nclose by saluting him. I think he has taken a very professional \napproach. He has been completely open to this discussion of the \nprovisions of this bill, and the offering of amendments. I plan to work \nwith him and other members of the committee in good faith. I think this \n3-month extension will give us time to expand the debate on this \nimportant constitutional issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for his comments.\n  In less than 2 weeks, the current short-term extension of three \nauthorities authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act will expire. I thank the \ntwo leaders for working to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to \nconsider the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, and to do so \nin a way that ensures that these authorities do not lapse while the \nRepublican majority in the House and new Senators consider these \nmeasures.\n  The bill I introduced on January 26, and that the Judiciary Committee \nis scheduled to consider this week, is based on the bill the Judiciary \nCommittee considered and passed with a bipartisan majority last \nCongress.\n  It includes additional adjustments made at Senator Kyl's suggestion \nafter the committee reported the bill in 2009. I will urge the \nJudiciary Committee to report that legislation again, and I will urge \nthe Senate to consider and pass the improvements to the USA PATRIOT Act \nthat we have proposed, during this short, additional 90-day extension.\n  The original USA PATRIOT Act included important sunsets that were \nsupported by both Republicans and Democrats. I believe that the sunsets \nsuggested by Dick Armey back in 2001 have been a good thing. I have \ntried to conduct aggressive oversight of USA PATRIOT Act surveillance \nauthorities since the bill was originally enacted in 2001. The sunsets \nhave been helpful in that process. Accordingly, I do not support \npermanent extension of these surveillance authorities.\n  Nor do I support undercutting important oversight and government \naccountability with respect to these intelligence gathering tools. \nInstead, I support strengthening oversight while providing the \nintelligence community the certainty it needs to protect national \nsecurity.\n  The bill I hope we will consider before May 27 would give the \nintelligence community the certainty it needs by extending these \nexpiring authorities while also strengthening congressional and \njudicial oversight. This legislation is the result of bipartisan \nnegotiations 2 years ago. It had the strong support of the \nadministration.\n  The House bill we are amending was not the product of bipartisan \nagreement, or even an open debate in the House. It would extend the \nPATRIOT Act without improvement for the rest of the year. That is too \nlittle for too long.\n  I do not begrudge our friends in the House time to do their work, and \nfor the new Republican majority to seek additional time to consider the \nexpiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act. But it should not take a year \nto pass improvements to these provisions. Importantly, we should not \nextend this debate into an election year and risk that some will play \npolitics with our national security.\n  With the 90-day extension that the leaders have proposed, we will be \nable to consider the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act of 2011 and \nimprove authorities that are otherwise set to expire.\n  Our bill can promote transparency and expand privacy and civil \nliberties safeguards in the law. It will increase judicial oversight of \ngovernment surveillance powers that capture information on Americans.\n  I hope that ours is a package of reforms that all Americans can \nsupport. A bipartisan group of Senators on the Judiciary Committee \nvoted in favor of\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nit in the last Congress, including Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn. \nSubsequent negotiations produced a package that was endorsed by the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence.\n  When Congress did not act on that negotiated package of reforms, but \ninstead passed an extension of the expiring authorities until February \n28, 2011, I took steps to see that key portions of the package were \nimplemented administratively by the Department of Justice.\n  It is my hope that during this short extension Congress will pass the \nUSA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act of 2011 to codify the steps \nforward that the Attorney General has taken to implement parts of our \nlegislative proposal administratively.\n  We can ensure that the progress in accountability and transparency \nthat we achieved last year is not lost simply because it was never \nwritten into the statute.\n  In addition, we will have the opportunity to enact the parts of the \nbill that the Attorney General did not or could not adopt because they \nrequire a change in the statute. Chief among these is adding a new \nsunset on National Security Letters.\n  Second is repealing the presumption in favor of the government that a \njudge must honor when he or she reviews an application for a section \n215 order for business records. The government does not need this \npresumption. In fact, the Attorney General endorsed the repeal of the \npresumption when he expressed his support for the bill in the prior \nCongress.\n  We can preserve the authorities that give law enforcement the tools \nit needs to protect national security. And we can ensure that \ninspectors general, Congress, and the public maintain vigilant \noversight of the government, making sure these authorities are used \nproperly and within constitutional bounds.\n  I urge all Senators to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 514 and \nthen to support the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act of 2011.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. I want to thank the majority leader for agreeing to allow a \ndebate on this important legislation. We will have time to amend it in \nthe next 3 months, discuss it fully.\n  When the PATRIOT Act was passed in the first place, it was passed in \na hurry, without committee hearings, and in a climate of fear and anger \nafter 9/11. Congress was sensitive to the fact that the fourth \namendment was being abridged. That is why these legislative proposals \nwere sunset. It was not just so we could pass them by unanimous consent \nwithout voting. It was done so we could review how well we are doing \nwith these, and whether we are abridging the freedoms guaranteed under \nthe fourth amendment.\n  There are a couple of things that bother me about the PATRIOT Act. \nNo. 1, the national security letters. These have been mentioned \npreviously, and I think the points are well taken. Some try to argue, \noh, these are simply subpoenas so you can do anything you want. I think \nthey are searches of private records and should be reviewed by a judge. \nBut even if you argue that they were subpoenas, if you have a subpoena, \nyour lawyer is allowed to make a motion to quash your subpoena, your \nlawyer is allowed to represent you.\n  In the craziness after 9/11, when the PATRIOT Act was passed, it was \nactually illegal to consult an attorney. If you were given a national \nsecurity letter saying you were being investigated, you could go to \njail for 5 years by telling your attorney. It is still in the law that \nyou can go to jail for 5 years if you tell others. This is being done \nagainst U.S. citizens.\n\n  Many people argue for this saying: Oh, it is just foreign terrorists. \nNational security letters have been written on 200,000 individuals and \nover 50 percent of them from the United States in the last 10 years.\n  In addition to the national security letters, this act expanded the \nuse of what are called suspicious activity reports, where they snoop in \nyour bank records. Not only does the government snoop in your bank \nrecords, they force the banks to do snooping for you. Two million \nrecords have been gone through, and we say: Well, are we getting \nterrorists? Yes; we are probably getting terrorists. But were we \ncapturing terrorists under FISA when we had a judge's review? Yes. It \nwas very rare that FISA ever turned down a warrant. But we just gave \nup. We blankly gave up the idea of judicial review.\n  This was a big deal. John Adams said this was the spark that got the \nRevolution going. When James Otis was talking about writs of assistance \nin the 1760s, the King was granting writs of assistance through his \nsoldiers. Now we have essentially government agents, akin to soldiers, \nwriting warrants.\n  It is ripe for abuse. Even the FBI, when they did their own internal \ninvestigation of the national security letters--they reviewed 1,000 of \nthese national security letters, and they found that 10 percent of them \nwere in error.\n  The other thing, for those who say: Oh, this is just a subpoena. It \nis just your bank records. No big deal, they should be weary of this: \nPeople have gone through the FISA Court and been turned down under \nsection 215 and not gotten a warrant and they have done an end-around \nand gotten national security letters.\n  I think it is something so basic to our constitutional Republic. I \ntell people on and on, I am a big defender of the second amendment. But \nyou cannot have the second amendment unless you defend the first \namendment. You cannot have the second amendment unless you defend the \nfourth amendment.\n  We need to defend the right to be free of search and seizure. People \nneed to look back and say: Did the FISA Court work? The FISA Court \nrarely turned anything down as far as getting warrants. But at the very \nleast, there was independent judicial review, which is a very important \npart of our historical jurisprudence and I think should be guarded and \nprotected.\n  I think, in the fear after 9/11, we did not debate these things \nfully. We should have a debate. There is a wide range of people on both \nthe left and the right who do believe in civil liberties. I think it is \ntime we do review these. I will stand in the next several months and \ntry to promote this discussion. I think it is a good time to review and \nrevisit the PATRIOT Act.\n  I will vote against the extension of the PATRIOT Act because I do not \nthink it is doing full justice to the fourth amendment, and I think it \nis very important we have judicial review before we allow government to \ninvestigate and search our private lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor as the chair of \nthe Intelligence Committee of the Senate and also as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, so I have been part of the PATRIOT Act and the \nFISA Act discussions.\n  Let me clear up one thing for the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky: Nothing in what is before us today affects national security \nletter sections of the act. Let me repeat that because I have heard \nthis presented on the floor, I have seen it in editorials in the \nnewspapers, and nothing in what is on the floor today affects the NSL \nsections--of which there are several in various statutes--of the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  There are three specific sections that are affected, and I will get \nto them in a moment.\n  Let me begin by saying I support the Reid-McConnell amendment to H.R. \n514. Let me point out that last Wednesday the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, Janet Napolitano, testified before the House Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and here is what she said:\n\n       In some ways, the threat today may be at its most \n     heightened state since the attacks nearly 10 years ago.\n\n  In testimony to the House Intelligence Committee last week, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, James Clapper, wrote that:\n\n       . . . it is impossible to rank--in terms of long-term \n     importance--the numerous, potential threats to the U.S. \n     national security. The United States no longer faces--as in \n     the Cold War--one dominant threat. Rather, it is the \n     multiplicity and interconnectedness of potential threats--and \n     the actors behind them--that constitute our biggest \n     challenge.\n\n  So it is clear the threat against the United States from terrorism, \ncyber attack, the proliferation of weapons of\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\nmass destruction, and others is at a very high level. Intelligence is \nour best tool in keeping America secure.\n  I see this intelligence day after day after day. The Intelligence \nCommittee hears testimony week after week after week. I believe all \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee are behind the Reid-McConnell \nbill.\n  So that is the framework in which these three expiring provisions \ncome before us. Without them, our law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies would lack important tools to protect this Nation. These are \ntools that have been used to great advantage over the past several \nyears.\n  I cannot speak here of the specific uses of the expiring authorities \nfor reasons of classification. The Director of National Intelligence, \nthe Director of the FBI, and the Director of the NSA described to \nMembers last night how they have been used. Here is what they have told \nus:\n\n       We have seen recent successful disruptions of terrorist \n     plots directed against the United States. Our intelligence \n     and law enforcement personnel were able to disrupt al Qaeda's \n     Najibullah Zazi terrorist plot to attack the New York City \n     subway system. These PATRIOT Act authorities, along with \n     other critical intelligence tools, are essential to our \n     ability to detect and disrupt such plots.\n\n  Let me talk about the three provisions, starting with the business \nrecords section that is expiring. This authority allows the government \nto go to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court--a special \ncourt with judges appointed by the Chief Justice that deals only with \nthese matters and meets 24/7. The provision allows the government to \nobtain business records if it gets a warrant from this court.\n  The second expiring provision, so-called roving wiretap authority, \nprovides the government with needed flexibility in conducting \nelectronic surveillance. We all know there are now throwaway cell \nphones. We have found that terrorists have attempted to evade \nsurveillance by using these throwaway cell phones and rapidly switching \ncell phones. This tool allows for surveillance on a particular target, \nnot the telephone. Again, you need to have that authority given to you, \nmuch as you would in a criminal wiretap by a court, but in this case by \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court. Again, the \nsurveillance is for foreign intelligence.\n\n  According to FBI Director Bob Mueller, this provision has been used \nmore than 190 times since it was authorized in 2001.\n  The third section--the final one--is the ``lone wolf'' authority that \nallows for court-ordered collection against non-U.S. persons who engage \nin international terrorism but for whom an association with a specific \ninternational terrorist group has not yet been determined.\n  This provision was enacted in light of the Zacarias Moussaoui case, \nin which the FBI suspected Moussaoui of engaging in terrorist activity \nand believed at the time it could not obtain a FISA order--in other \nwords, a FISA warrant--for lack of definitive connection to a known \nforeign terrorist organization.\n  I see Senator Kyl on the floor. He well knows this issue. So this is \na specific addition that was put in because of the Moussaoui case to \nget at someone who is a ``lone wolf'' who has no known association with \na terrorist operation.\n  These tools have been authorized for several years and have been \nsubject to strict scrutiny by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nCourt, the Department of Justice, and the Congressional Intelligence \nand Judiciary Committees.\n  Members have raised concerns that provisions authorized by the \nPATRIOT Act have been misused. The Judiciary and the Intelligence \nCommittees have held numerous hearings on this topic. I believe past \nproblems have been addressed, and we will continue to monitor the use \nof these provisions carefully.\n  Members have also noted past problems with the use of national \nsecurity letters, and that is what all the discussion so far that I \nhave heard on the floor has been. As I have said, the national security \nsections are not at issue at this time. So it is, in a sense, a \nshibboleth to raise them here.\n  It is business records, it is lone wolf, and it is roving wiretaps. \nThose are the three sections that expire on the 28th of February.\n  So let me be clear: This legislation does not address national \nsecurity letter authorities, as those provisions are not set to expire \nat the end of the month.\n  By extending these three provisions until May 27, the Congress can \nappropriately study and I hope enact long-term reauthorizations that \nthe intelligence community and law enforcement need to continue to keep \nus safe.\n  Let me just say, I see--and cannot go into here--but day after day \nuses of these expiring authorities and have come to believe that being \nable to have good intelligence is what prevents an attack against a New \nYork subway or air cargo plane. It is what keeps this homeland safe, \nand it is what allows us to get ahead of a terrorist attack. Without \nthem--without them--we put our Nation in jeopardy. I, for one, took an \noath of office to protect and defend, and I do not intend to be party \nto that. Everything I know indicates that there is jeopardy facing this \nNation, and these intelligence provisions are necessary to protect our \nhomeland.\n  I urge acceptance of the Reid-McConnell legislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to agree with the comments made by our \ncolleague from California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nand urge all our colleagues, in the time that will exist between now \nand the time we are able to take up this matter again, to accept her \ninvitation to be briefed and to appreciate some of the things that our \nintelligence community goes through in order to try to protect the \nAmerican citizens.\n  The points she made are all valid from my service on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I am aware of what she has been talking about. I would just \nlike to repeat three things. I will not bother to go into all the \ndetail because she made the points very well.\n  Roving wiretaps--the name does not sound very good--are simply the \nrecognition that today you have a lot of throwaway cell phones. It used \nto be you had one telephone hanging up in the kitchen or someplace, so \nwhen the police got a warrant to tap your telephone, that was the only \nphone you had.\n  Now these guys take phones, use them once, throw them away, and then \nget another one or they have access to lots of different phones. It is \nsimply a recognition that today people use lots of different phones \nrather than one, and, therefore, the warrant applies to any of the \nphones of a particular individual.\n  The ``lone wolf'' terrorist exception Senator Feinstein explained \nvery well. I wrote that provision. It applies to people who do not have \na card in their wallet that says: I belong to al-Qaida or I belong to \nsome other terrorist group.\n  We understood that in some cases there will be people such as \nMoussaoui who you are not sure are actually affiliated with any \nparticular group, but they are still planning a terrorist activity and, \ntherefore, you want the ability to check them out.\n  Third is the business records. This is the only one there has been \nany controversy about. It allows the government to get a court order to \nobtain business records that are either held or generated by third \nparties. You want to find out, for example, if Mohamed Atta stayed at \nthe such and such motel the night before he went to the airport to \nconduct the terrorist attacks of 9/11. That will help to prove the \nchain of evidence to prosecute other people or for us to be able to \nknow exactly how that attack occurred. So you go to the motel and say: \nCould we see who checked in last night. That is not a big deal.\n  For most agencies of the Federal Government, you do not even have to \ngo to court to ask the question. But out of an abundance of caution, \nbefore the government can actually go to the motel and say: Can we see \nyour record, they have to go to court to get approval to do that. So \nthe PATRIOT Act actually sets a higher hurdle in trying to get these \nbusiness records in terrorism investigations. In addition to that, \nthere are only three top officials at the FBI who are authorized to \nrequest court orders for the information.\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\n  So the point is this: These are the only three provisions that are \nsunsetted and that we have to reauthorize. If people have objections to \nother parts of the act, such as has been expressed here, then their \nargument is not with the reauthorization of these three provisions but \nwith the underlying law. In any event, I suppose they will have plenty \nof time to raise those questions when we debate this further in the \nnext couple of months.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this short-term extension. In the \nmeantime, prior to the rest of the debate we will have to check with \nthe folks at the Intelligence Committee who can answer any questions \ncolleagues may have about how this act is intended to operate and then \ncheck with the FBI and other law enforcement officials to see how it \nworks in its operation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, Montanans sent me to the U.S. Senate to \nbring accountability to this body, to make responsible decisions, and \nto protect America and the freedoms we all enjoy. I took the oath of \noffice to defend the Constitution.\n\n  That is why I am going to vote against the PATRIOT Act. I encourage \nothers to follow suit. I have never liked the PATRIOT Act. I still \ndon't.\n  Like REAL ID, the PATRIOT Act invades the privacy of law-abiding \ncitizens. And it tramples on our Constitutional rights.\n  We need to find a balance--making our country more secure and giving \nour troops, law enforcement and intelligence agents the tools necessary \nto get the job done. But we have to do it without invading the privacy \nof law-abiding Americans.\n  This extension doesn't address any of those concerns. It simply puts \noff the debate we need to have for another day.\n  There are some really troubling aspects that are not addressed by the \nextension of this law: Roving wiretaps which allow surveillance of a \n``type of person,'' instead of a particular person, over multiple phone \nlines. That is a slippery slope to eroding our constitutional \nprotection against government searches; Using the reasonable grounds of \nsuspicion standard to require libraries and businesses to report to the \ngovernment about what American citizens buy or borrow.\n  We don't have to sacrifice our privacy and lose control of our \npersonal information in order to be secure. And we should never give up \nour constitutional rights.\n  Voting for the PATRIOT Act is the wrong way to go. We have got a lot \nof smart people in this body. We can develop the policies we need to \nfight terrorists without compromising our constitutional civil \nliberties. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting against extending \nthis law today and in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think all time has either been yielded \nback or all time is up, so I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the amendment that is now pending, for \nwhich we have a cloture motion, is what we are going to try to continue \nto work on and hope that we can come to a consensus on the issue of the \nperimeter rule that has caused so much of this bill to be held up. This \nis a good bill. This is a bill that is going to give America the \nopportunity to start the next generation of air traffic control \nsystems. It is a bill that we must begin now if we are going to go to a \nsatellite-based system which will free airspace and make our air system \nwork more efficiently for aircraft in the air.\n  It has safety provisions. It has consumer protection provisions. It \nis so important that we also accommodate the needs of all of our \ncountry, the constituents we have, to have an airport system that \nworks--especially in the Washington area.\n  We will be able to debate this amendment as we go through the next \nfew days. We are waiting for other amendments to also be debated on the \nfloor. But I have stood very firm in saying we need a bipartisan \nsolution to access to the Nation's airport in Washington, DC. It is \nlocated in Virginia, but it is the Washington, DC-near airport, and all \nof the airports in this area now have a robust business. It is time for \nus to deal with this in a rational, bipartisan, and responsible way. \nThat is what Senator Rockefeller and I have attempted to do, and we \nwill continue to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Health Reform\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about health reform. \nI would like to start by telling you the story of a little boy named \nIsaac. From the day his parents brought him home as a newborn to \nIsanti, MN, he was sick all the time. He had everything from the flu to \nbronchitis to ear infections. But unlike most little boys, Isaac never \nseemed to get better. His parents, as any parents would, did everything \nthey could to help him. They brought him to every medical specialist \nthey could think of but no one could figure out what was wrong.\n  Finally, Isaac was diagnosed with a rare disease called common \nvariable immunodeficiency. This means every 2 weeks a nurse has to \nvisit his home to give him the medicine that lets his body fight off \ngerms. Without this medicine, Isaac's body cannot fight off even a \ncommon cold. The home visits and IV medications Isaac needs are \nexpensive. But Isaac's parents had health insurance, so Isaac was able \nto have a normal childhood.\n  Today, Isaac is a 19-year-old college student in Minnesota with \ndreams of becoming an English teacher. Here is a picture of him. He is \nthe one on the right. That is Isaac.\n  Because of the toll his illness takes, his family decided that Isaac \nshould go to school part-time. Unfortunately, before the health reform \nlaw was passed, young adults over 18 years of age generally had to be \nin school full time to stay on their parents' health insurance. If \nIsaac had not been able to stay on his parents' health plan, he would \nhave been in a tremendous bind. His disease is the definition of a \npreexisting condition, and it would have been nearly impossible for him \nto find affordable individual coverage. But because of the health \nreform law that we passed last year, Isaac can now stay on his parents' \nhealth insurance, regardless of his school status, through his 26th \nbirthday. He and his family were able to make the choices that made \nsense for their family without having to worry about Isaac's health \ninsurance. In fact, in a few years, when he turns 26, a key provision \nof health reform will have kicked in and insurers will no longer be \nable to discriminate against him or any American because of a \npreexisting condition.\n  Isaac's parents may not be doctors, but they are experts when it \ncomes to the needs of their family. They know the truth about what the \nhealth reform law has already done for their family. Just like Isaac's \nfamily, Minnesotans may not know every word of the health reform law, \nbut they are experts on what they need for their own families.\n  Let me tell you about another Minnesota family who learned about the \nbenefits of the new law. Maya, whom you can see right here, is one of 3 \nmillion Americans with epilepsy. She had her first seizure when she was \njust 3 years old. Modern medicine has not yet been able to find a way \nto stop her seizures, but by taking five medications per day she can \ncontrol them.\n  Recently, Maya's father was laid off and the family lost his health \ninsurance. Maya's family suddenly had to confront the possibility that \nthey would no longer be able to give Maya the medication she needs to \nfight her daily seizures. Without insurance, Maya's medications cost \nmore than $1,500 a month, which would quickly bankrupt her family. \nLosing a job is stressful enough, but before the health reform law \nMaya's parents would have\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\nhad to worry about buying health insurance on the individual market. \nBecause of Maya's preexisting condition that would have been almost \nimpossible.\n  Fortunately, the health reform law has banned insurance companies \nfrom discriminating against children with preexisting conditions. So \nher family was able to get on to another insurance plan without being \ndenied.\n  The diagnosis of a chronic illness can happen to anyone at any time. \nOften, like Maya, it doesn't happen because of a lifestyle choice or \ngenetic predisposition. It just happens. Maya was 3 years old when she \nwas diagnosed. Paying for essential medications and health care \nservices that can help control chronic conditions like Maya's can \neasily put a hard-working family into bankruptcy.\n  Medical costs are the cause, wholly or in part, of 62 percent of all \nbankruptcies in this country. That will change dramatically because of \nthis law. Americans will no longer be discriminated against because of \npreexisting conditions, and insurance companies can no longer impose \nlifetime limits on the dollar amount of care they will provide. This is \nan enormous, almost incalculable, benefit to Americans and their peace \nof mind.\n  The truth is, Congress listened to people across this country, people \nsuch as Isaac and Maya and their families. By allowing kids to stay on \ntheir parents' insurance longer, we listened by ending insurance \ncompanies' discrimination against women and people with preexisting \nconditions, and we listened when the American people said lifetime caps \non insurance benefits were forcing millions of chronically ill \nAmericans into bankruptcy.\n  The people of Minnesota believe, as I do, that a family who works \nhard should not be financially ruined if their kid gets sick. When I \nwas campaigning I heard this again and again from families across \nMinnesota--and I was listening. The people asked this Congress to find \na way to make health care affordable for everyone, and we did.\n  Now the insurance companies and their political allies want you to \nbelieve the only way to keep your premiums low is to cap the amount of \nbenefits you can receive in your lifetime. But this is just not true. \nIn the health reform law, we worked hard to slow the growth of health \ncare costs without abandoning the over one-third of American adults who \nstruggle with chronic disease.\n  The truth is, last year we passed a bill that will save the lives of \ncountless Americans and will save billions of taxpayer dollars. That is \nright. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the referee that \neveryone here in Congress agrees to abide by whether we like their \ndecisions or not--according to CBO the law saves us money, lots of \nmoney; in fact, hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Now, let me say a word about CBO to my colleagues. You cannot use \nCBO's numbers when you like them and then totally dismiss them when you \ndo not. CBO is directed to provide unbiased and independent analysis \nand estimates. Their analysts use the best research available for their \nscores and projections. In fact, they established an independent review \npanel of expert health care economists to advise them in their analysis \nof the health reform bill. Not only are the experts' names published on \nCBO's Web site, but their analysis of the law is public as well. CBO is \nnothing if not transparent and independent.\n  Of late, we have heard Members of this body frankly mischaracterize \nthe process by which CBO does its job. They have said that CBO must \nrely solely on information and data fed to them by the majority--\n``garbage in, garbage out.'' ``Garbage in, garbage out'' is how they \ndescribe it here on the floor. This could not be further from the \ntruth. Frankly, I find some of my colleagues' new refrain about CBO \ndisturbing and not a little disingenuous.\n  One of the things we tried to do in health reform was to take steps \nthat would lower the costs of health care in this country. Take for \nexample our efforts to reduce administrative costs by streamlining the \nway health care providers bill for their services. This is something I \npushed for because we recently did it in Minnesota, and it saved $56 \nmillion in the first year alone. Nationwide, that should translate to \naround $25 to $30 billion over 10 years. Actually, the health reform \nlaw went well beyond what Minnesota did. So it is not surprising that \noutside experts such as those at the Commonwealth Fund, Rand, and \nothers estimate much greater savings from administrative \nsimplification, in the range of $162 to $187 billion over 10 years. So \nwhen CBO made their analysis and estimated savings of less than $20 \nbillion in the same period, I admit I was a little miffed. But I did \nnot attack CBO. I accepted their results. And we are all duty bound to \ndo the same, even when CBO projects that the law as a whole will save \nover $100 billion in the first 10 years and over $1 trillion in the \nfollowing decade.\n  We accomplished the savings with a number of commonsense solutions, \nsuch as stopping insurance companies from padding their bank accounts \nwith profits from sky-high premiums. As part of health reform, we \nrequire insurance companies to spend at least 80 to 85 percent of the \nmoney they receive in premiums on actual health care, actual health \ncare services--85 percent for large group plans, 80 percent for small \ngroup or individual plans. This is a provision I championed. The other \n15 or 20 percent can be spent on administrative costs or marketing, on \nCEO bonuses, and on profits. This provision kicked in this year, and it \nwill hold insurance companies accountable for costs and help contain \nhealth care costs in this country.\n  We also changed the way health care is paid for in this country by \nstarting to reward quality of care, not quantity--value not volume in \nMedicare. I was proud to fight alongside Senator Cantwell and Senator \nKlobuchar for the inclusion of the value-based payment modifier in the \nMedicare reimbursement formulas.\n  Perhaps the most commonsense thing we did to control costs was making \nsure everyone has access to preventive care. In Minnesota alone, the \nlaw will give millions of people access to free preventive care. Women \nwill be able to get mammograms without any out-of-pocket costs. \nStarting this year, seniors now have access to free preventive checkups \neach year without cost. This is completely contrary to claims I have \nheard on this floor.\n  A large part of the cuts in Medicare spending--not cuts in benefits, \na large part of the cuts in Medicare spending--is cuts to wasteful \nsubsidies for insurance companies.\n  One of my colleagues has taken to the floor and said this law will \n``cut the funding, so people on Medicare Advantage who like it, who \nlike the preventive medicine activities of it, are going to lose those \nopportunities.'' He goes on to say about the seniors in his State that \n``once they lose this, they are going to lose preventive services.'' \nThis is simply not the case. Thanks to this law, everyone on Medicare \nwill enjoy preventive services, so their doctors will catch problems \nearly. Seniors know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of \ncure. That is why preventive services under this law will be covered \nfor everyone without copays, contrary to what my friend on the other \nside says.\n  This is what has bothered me about this debate--the constant stream \nof misinformation.\n  This same colleague said this on the floor about the law: ``It \ndoesn't solve America's doctor shortage. It does not even address it.'' \nIt does not even address it. Now, no one is claiming this bill solves \nthe doctor shortages we have in this country, but does not even address \nit? There is a whole title in the law that lays out a number of \nprograms--over 96 pages--that make significant investments in the \nhealth care workforce, especially in primary care physicians. Most \nnotably, it created a public health workforce loan repayment program \nthat helps recruit and place more doctors, nurses, and other health \ncare providers in medically underserved areas. That is important for \nStates such as Minnesota. And this was an integral and vital part of \nhealth reform. Anyone who states that this law did nothing to address \nthe shortfall of health care providers just has not read the law.\n  We have seen misrepresentations from opponents right from the \nbeginning with the so-called death panels, and it continues to this \nday: Medicare recipients are going to be denied preventive care; the \nlaw doesn't even address the doctor shortage; CBO is just\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\nfed garbage by the majority and is not allowed to look at anything \nelse.\n  In November, one of my colleagues cited an oft-discredited assertion \noriginally made by some Republicans on the House Ways and Means \nCommittee. According to one analysis, my colleague said here on the \nfloor, the Internal Revenue Service will need to hire 16,000 new IRS \nemployees to enforce the individual mandate. Well, that is just not \ntrue. Some new IRS employees will be needed but nowhere near that \nnumber, and overwhelmingly they will be there to administer the tax \nbreaks to small businesses for insuring their employees.\n  What my colleagues said on the floor is simply not true. No matter \nhow many times it is repeated, it will not become true.\n  There was a colloquy from June of last year between two of my \ncolleagues. The first Senator said that doctors are leaving Medicare. \nAnd that is true. Some are.\n  He said: The president of the State of New York Medical Society is \nnot taking new Medicare patients.\n  Then the second Senator said: As well as the Mayo Clinic.\n  The first Senator answered by responding: Mayo Clinic said, we cannot \nafford to keep our doors open if we are taking Medicare patients.\n  Then he moved on.\n  So is it true that the Mayo Clinic really is not taking new Medicare \npatients? Well, I called up Mayo, which happens to be in my State, to \nfind out, and they gave me the facts. Do you know what. Of course it is \nnot true. The Mayo Clinic has 3,700 staff physicians and scientists and \ntreats 526,000 patients a year. There is one Mayo Clinic, Arizona \nFamily Practice--one--that isn't accepting Medicare payment for primary \ncare services. Yet this is just part of a time-limited trial for this \none clinic with just five physicians on staff. That is it. But this \nbecomes, to quote my colleague: Mayo Clinic said, we cannot afford to \nkeep our doors open if we are taking Medicare patients. Well, the Mayo \nClinic is the largest private employer in Minnesota and, believe me, \ntheir doors are still open to new Medicare patients.\n  Medicare reimbursements are low, and Mayo has actually lost hundreds \nof millions of dollars in the last year alone because of this. Mayo, \nlike the rest of Minnesota, delivers higher value care at a lower cost \nthan clinics and hospitals in other States. That is because Mayo \nprovides coordinated integrated care. Mayo's outstanding doctors are on \nsalaries, so they are not incentivized to order and perform unnecessary \nand expensive tests and procedures. And Mayo's outcomes are second to \nnone. Yet Mayo is punished for all of this by receiving lower \nreimbursements for Medicare. That is why I pushed, with other \ncolleagues, for the value index. That is why we need to pass the so-\ncalled doc fix that cancels scheduled cuts to reimbursement rates every \nyear.\n  By the way, the doc fix is something we would have to do whether or \nnot we pass health reform.\n  Yet, despite all of this, the Mayo Clinic is keeping its doors open \nto new Medicare patients and should be commended for that. It should \nnot be accused of closing its doors to Medicare patients when it is \nnot. Mayo should not be used as a political football.\n  Look, I could go on and on with these, but the fact is, if we want to \nhave a debate about the health care law, we really should make an \neffort to present a case based on what is really in the law and what is \nreally happening on the ground. This is what the American people want \nfrom us. Health care is far too important to the lives of our \nconstituents for us to indulge in gross distortion, obvious omission, \nand absurd extrapolations. The American people do not want that, not \nfor something this important, not for something that affects their \nlives and the lives of people they love. The American people have given \nus all tremendous responsibilities.\n  Minnesotans worry that the floor could drop from under them at any \ntime and that no one will be there to catch them when it does. They \nworry about their families. They worry about their friends and their \ncommunity. We owe it to them to be honest with them and with each \nother, to be responsible, to be real. So let's get real.\n  As I mentioned in my story about Maya, the little girl with epilepsy, \nthanks to the new law, she can get health care because insurance \ncompanies now cannot discriminate against children with preexisting \nconditions. In 2014, insurance companies will not be able to \ndiscriminate against any American child or adult with a preexisting \ncondition. And in 2014, that is when the mandate kicks in.\n  Here is what one of my colleagues says about the provision in the law \nthat now allows little 3-year-old Maya to be treated for her epilepsy:\n\n       The health care law allows parents to wait until their \n     child is sick before buying a policy. When only sick people \n     buy health insurance, premiums have to go up. As the rate \n     increases, more people drop their coverage.\n\n  That is why we have the mandate. The mandate is crucial if you want \nto do things such as getting rid of denials for preexisting conditions. \nAnd, by the way, the mandate has been a Republican idea. The mandate \nwas a Republican idea in their 1993 health reform bill. Let me tell you \nwhy. The health care law is like a three-legged stool. The first leg is \naccessibility. Everyone needs to be able to buy insurance so that when \nthey get sick or hurt, they can access the care they need.\n  So we banned insurance companies from discriminating against people \nwith preexisting conditions. Banning discrimination against people with \npreexisting conditions is something that both parties say they like. In \nfact, in its Pledge to America, the document that Republicans ran on in \n2010, in the health care section there is the heading ``Ensure Access \nfor Patients with Preexisting Conditions.''\n  It goes on to say that they will ban insurance companies from \ndiscriminating against patients with preexisting conditions. That is \ntheir pledge.\n  That makes sense. Over one-third of all Americans have a preexisting \ncondition. Actually, at the Minnesota State fair, a woman in her early \n70s came up to me and said: You know, at my age, everything is \npreexisting. She was enrolled in Medicare, but Maya was not. And Maya's \nfamily should not have to choose between going without the care they \nneed and going into bankruptcy.\n  But as my colleague indicated, there is a risk that this provision \nwould incentivize people to buy health insurance only after they get \nsick or hurt which would drive everyone's costs up. So because of this, \nthis second leg of the stool is personal responsibility. We have an \nindividual mandate to make sure that people don't wait until they get \nsick to go get insurance and to create a pool of insured people that is \nlarge enough to support all the folks who had previously been unable to \nget insurance. If everyone has health insurance, everyone will be able \nto access care when they need it.\n  By the way, the rest of us who have insurance will benefit because \ntoday we are paying almost $1,000 a year per family in premiums to \ncover the emergency room visits of people who don't have insurance.\n  But for some people, buying health insurance is too expensive. So the \nthird leg of the stool is affordability. We provide assistance to those \nfamilies who need to buy health coverage on a sliding scale, all the \nway up to 400 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  So that is our three-legged stool: accessibility, accountability, and \naffordability. We don't discriminate against people with preexisting \nconditions, and so we have a mandate so people don't wait until they \nget sick or hurt to get insurance. Because you are mandated to get \nhealth insurance, we make sure everyone can afford it. A three-legged \nstool. If you take any leg out, the stool collapses.\n  When I have explained it this way to Minnesotans, I find they are no \nlonger confused about the law. They know how important it is to have \naccess to health insurance regardless of preexisting conditions, to \ntake responsibility for themselves and their families, and to have \nhealth care they can afford. But some of my colleagues have been \nadvocating that we cut off a leg or even two legs of the stool. But a \ntwo-legged stool collapses. And a one-legged stool? Maybe at best it is \na spinning plate.\n  The arguments for repealing this law remind me of an old Shalom \nAleichem story I heard from my dad when I was growing up. You don't \nhear much about Shalom Aleichem on the Senate floor. I will tell you a \nlittle bit about it.\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\n  Shalom Aleichem was a beloved 20th century writer who wrote stories, \nnovels, and plays in Yiddish. The Broadway hit ``Fiddler on the Roof'' \nwas based on his writings. In the story my dad told me, a man borrows a \nplate from his neighbor. The man takes the plate home and drops it \naccidentally and breaks it. He sneaks back into his neighbor's house \nand replaces the broken plate. The neighbor comes home, finds the \nbroken plate, and goes over to the guy's house. He basically says: What \nis the deal with the broken plate?\n  The guy says: Well, in the first place, I didn't borrow it. In the \nsecond place, when I borrowed it, it was already broken. And in the \nthird place, when I returned it, it was in one piece.\n  That is what I am hearing from the opponents of this bill who want to \nrepeal it. In the first place, we are for banning discrimination \nagainst people with preexisting conditions. In the second place, we are \nagainst banning discrimination against people with preexisting \nconditions because then no one would buy health insurance until they \nget sick or hurt. That would drive up the cost of health insurance. And \nin the third place, we want to repeal the law because it makes healthy \npeople buy health insurance or pay a fine in order to keep the cost of \nhealth insurance down. This is what I hear every day from the opponents \nof the health care bill.\n  Opponents of the bill, my colleagues on the other side, pledge that \nthey won't discriminate against people with preexisting conditions but \nthen they say they don't want to ban discrimination because they don't \nwant to encourage people to wait until they are sick to buy insurance. \nBut they don't want to mandate that people take personal responsibility \nby buying health insurance. Then they stand up and say the American \npeople are, to quote a colleague, ``sick of spin.''\n  I would like my colleagues to stand and admit that they broke the \nplate. We owe it to the people who elected us to this body to tell the \ntruth about the health reform law. We owe it to the millions of \nAmericans whose lives will be changed by the provisions in this law, \nsuch as Isaac, such as Maya.\n  Already we have seen the positive changes that such reform can bring. \nLook no further than the State of Massachusetts which, in 2006, passed \nits own set of health reforms. Its reforms were similar to what the \nAffordable Care Act is doing at the national level, including an \nindividual mandate, subsidies, and even an exchange. The result has \nbeen a huge increase in the number of people with health insurance, \nincluding an increase in the number of people who get insurance through \ntheir jobs. Let me put that another way: Because of the State's health \ncare reform, more people have health insurance from their employer.\n  At the same time Massachusetts has seen a decrease in the rate at \nwhich premiums are going up when compared to the rest of the country. \nAs the rest of the country saw insurance premiums go up by 6.1 percent \nfrom 2007 to 2008, premiums in Massachusetts only went up by 5.0 \npercent. That is more than 20 percent less than the rest of the country \njust a year after its health care reform was passed. That is not a \nsilver bullet, but it is certainly a step in the right direction for \nsmall business owners and for families. More than 98 percent of \nMassachusetts residents have health insurance, as compared to less than \n84 percent nationally.\n  The effects of health reform in that State are pretty clear. More \npeople are insured. Premiums are not going up as quickly as around the \ncountry. More people are getting their insurance through their \nemployer.\n  The health reform law is not a silver bullet but hopefully a series \nof steps in the right direction. You have to question the claims of my \ncolleagues who say that health reform will cause the sky to fall, \nbecause there is good evidence to believe they are crying wolf. Yes, \nyou heard me right, Chicken Little is crying wolf.\n  Ask the people of Massachusetts. In a recent poll, nearly 80 percent \nof Massachusetts residents said they wanted to keep the health reform \nlaw they passed in 2006; nearly 80 percent.\n  Here is another one. I have heard a colleague urging repeal of this \nlaw say:\n\n       We need to allow small businesses to join together, to pool \n     together, in order to offer affordable health insurance to \n     their workers, get better deals with insurance costs.\n\n  He said this as if it weren't in the law. In fact, he has said these \nexact words repeatedly here on the floor, each time creating the clear \nimplication that the health reform law does not allow small businesses \nto pool together to get better deals on health insurance. But in fact \nthis is exactly why we passed a health reform law that includes health \ninsurance exchanges.\n  We owe it to the American people to tell the truth about this. The \ntruth is that health reform created State insurance exchanges so that \nhealth care will be available to the 43 million workers employed by the \n5.9 million small businesses around the country. The exchanges will \nalso make affordable health insurance available to 22 million self-\nemployed Americans. Within these exchanges, insurance companies will \ncompete and offer multiple plans so that everyone can choose a plan \nthat works best for their family. And in all cases, they will be \nnegotiated on behalf of the combined pools of all participating \nbusinesses with fewer than 100 employees in the State. This will give \nunprecedented negotiating power and competition that will directly \nbenefit workers at small businesses. And not just the workers but \nespecially the owners of those businesses who, by the way, are already \nreceiving tax credits to help them pay for their employees' insurance.\n  The fact is, the majority of Americans are supportive of what this \nlaw is trying to do, and they don't want to go back to the broken \nsystem we had before it passed. They know it is crucial that American \nfamilies have health care when they need it. They know this law will \ngive millions more American families access to this care while creating \njobs and saving money.\n\n  The truth is, the people have spoken on health care. Unfortunately, \nsome of my colleagues have not been listening.\n  When you are talking about legislation, it is easy to fall into the \ntrap of either promising the world or warning that it will cause the \nsky to fall. Neither is right, and the reality is far more complex. The \ntruth is, the Affordable Care Act will change millions of lives but \nwill not fix a very broken health care system overnight. It was the \nresult of a lot of negotiation and compromise.\n  The truth is, the American people want us to move forward and \nimplement this law. They know some parts of it will work better than \nother parts. They want us to change what does not work and build on \nwhat does. They know provisions like the ban on discrimination against \nchildren with preexisting conditions are already helping families \nacross this country, including Isaac, including Maya.\n  I challenge my colleagues to talk to families with children like \nIsaac and Maya. Americans are experts on the health care needs of their \nown families. I have talked to families all over Minnesota, and they \ntell me they need accessible health care, they need affordable health \ncare, and they want to take personal responsibility to insure their \nfamilies. But the truth is, they need our help. They need us to make \nsure the stool keeps standing.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, last week we were all celebrating what would \nhave been the 100th anniversary of Ronald Reagan. There was a piece in \nthe Wall Street Journal by one of the economists who advised Ronald \nReagan, Arthur Laffer, which I think recounts and discusses probably as \ngood as any other summary I have ever seen the contribution Reagan and \nhis administration made to the economy of the United States.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \narticle from the Wall Street Journal dated February 10, 2011.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 10, 2011]\n\n                      Reaganomics: What We Learned\n\n                         (By Arthur B. Laffer)\n\n       For 16 years prior to Ronald Reagan's presidency, the U.S. \n     economy was in a tailspin--a result of bipartisan ignorance \n     that resulted in tax increases, dollar devaluations, wage and \n     price controls, minimum-wage hikes, misguided spending, \n     pandering to unions, protectionist measures and other policy \n     mistakes.\n       In the late 1970s and early '80s, 10-year bond yields and \n     inflation both were in the low double digits. The ``misery \n     index''--the sum of consumer price inflation plus the \n     unemployment rate--peaked at well over 20%. The real value of \n     the S 500 stock price index had declined at an average \n     annual rate of 6% from early 1966 to August 1982.\n       For anyone old enough today, memories of the Arab oil \n     embargo and price shocks--followed by price controls and \n     rationing and long lines at gas stations--are traumatic. The \n     U.S. share of world output was on a steady course downward.\n       Then Reagan entered center stage. His first tax bill was \n     enacted in August 1981. It included a sweeping cut in \n     marginal income tax rates, reducing the top rate to 50% from \n     70% and the lowest rate to 11% from 14%. The House vote was \n     238 to 195, with 48 Democrats on the winning side and only \n     one Republican with the losers. The Senate vote was 89 to 11, \n     with 37 Democrats voting aye and only one Republican voting \n     nay. Reaganomics had officially begun.\n       President Reagan was not alone in changing America's \n     domestic economic agenda. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul \n     Volcker, first appointed by Jimmy Carter, deserves enormous \n     credit for bringing inflation down to 3.2% in 1983 from 13.5% \n     in 1981 with a tight-money policy. There were other heroes of \n     the tax-cutting movement, such as Wisconsin Republican Rep. \n     Bill Steiger and Wyoming Republican Sen. Clifford Hansen, the \n     two main sponsors of an important capital gains tax cut in \n     1978.\n       What the Reagan Revolution did was to move America toward \n     lower, flatter tax rates, sound money, freer trade and less \n     regulation. The key to Reaganomics was to change people's \n     behavior with respect to working, investing and producing. To \n     do this, personal income tax rates not only decreased \n     significantly, but they were also indexed for inflation in \n     1985. The highest tax rate on ``unearned'' (i.e., non-wage) \n     income dropped to 28% from 70%. The corporate tax rate also \n     fell to 34% from 46%. And tax brackets were pushed out, so \n     that taxpayers wouldn't cross the threshold until their \n     incomes were far higher.\n       Changing tax rates changed behavior, and changed behavior \n     affected tax revenues. Reagan understood that lowering tax \n     rates led to static revenue losses. But he also understood \n     that lowering tax rates also increased taxable income, \n     whether by increasing output or by causing less use of tax \n     shelters and less tax cheating.\n       Moreover, Reagan knew from personal experience in making \n     movies that once he was in the highest tax bracket, he'd stop \n     making movies for the rest of the year. In other words, a \n     lower tax rate could increase revenues. And so it was with \n     his tax cuts. The highest 1% of income earners paid more in \n     taxes as a share of GDP in 1988 at lower tax rates than they \n     had in 1980 at higher tax rates. To Reagan, what's been \n     called the ``Laffer Curve'' (a concept that originated \n     centuries ago and which I had been using without the name in \n     my classes at the University of Chicago) was pure common \n     sense.\n       There was also, in Reagan's first year, his response to an \n     illegal strike by federal air traffic controllers. The \n     president fired and replaced them with military personnel \n     until permanent replacements could be found. Given union \n     power in the economy, this was a dramatic act--especially \n     considering the well-known fact that the air traffic \n     controllers union, Patco, had' backed Reagan in the 1980 \n     presidential election.\n       On the regulatory front, the number of pages in the Federal \n     Register dropped to less than 48,000 in 1986 from over 80,000 \n     in 1980. With no increase in the minimum wage over his full \n     eight years in office, the negative impact of this price \n     floor on employment was lessened.\n       And, of course, there was the decontrol of oil markets. \n     Price controls at gas stations were lifted in January 1981, \n     as were well-head price controls for domestic oil producers. \n     Domestic output increased and prices fell. President Carter's \n     excess profits tax on oil companies was repealed in 1988.\n       The results of the Reagan era? From December 1982 to June \n     1990, Reaganomics created over 21 million jobs--more jobs \n     than have been added since. Union membership and man-hours \n     lost due to strikes tumbled. The stock market went through \n     the roof. From July 1982 through August 2000, the S 500 \n     stock price index grew at an average annual real rate of over \n     12%. The unfunded liabilities of the Social Security system \n     declined as a share of GDP, and the ``misery index'' fell to \n     under 10%.\n       Even Reagan's first Democratic successor, Bill Clinton, \n     followed in his footsteps. The negotiations for what would \n     become the North American Free Trade Agreement began in \n     Reagan's second term, but it was President Clinton who pushed \n     the agreement through Congress in 1993 over the objections of \n     the unions and many in his own party.\n       President Clinton also signed into law the biggest capital \n     gains tax cut in our nation's history in 1997. It effectively \n     eliminated any capital gains tax on owner-occupied homes. Mr. \n     Clinton reduced government spending as a share of GDP by 3.5 \n     percentage points, more than the next four best presidents \n     combined. Where Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton \n     slipped up was on personal income tax rates--allowing the \n     highest personal income tax rate to eventually rise to 39.6% \n     from 28%.\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\n       The true lesson to be learned from the Reagan presidency is \n     that good economics isn't Republican or Democrat, right-wing \n     or left-wing, liberal or conservative. It's simply good \n     economics. President Barack Obama should take heed and not \n     limit his vision while seeking a workable solution to \n     America's tragically high unemployment rate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S740-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S740-S741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the committee clerk, a witness may request \n     changes in testimony to correct errors of transcription, \n     grammatical errors, and obvious errors of fact. The Chairman \n     or a staff officer designated by him shall rule on such \n     request.\n       8. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his or her character or \n     adversely affect his or her reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record; and\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf.\n       9.

Such request must be made before the completion of \n     the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to call the \n     minority witnesses, no later than three days before the \n     hearing.\n       10. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his or her counsel, or any spectator conducts him or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing the \n     Chairman or presiding Member of the Committee present during \n     such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, \n     his representative or any law enforcement official to eject \n     said person from the hearing room.\n\n            III. Closed Sessions and Confidential Materials\n\n       1. Procedure. All meetings and hearings shall be open to \n     the public unless closed.

Immediately after such discussion, \n     the meeting or hearing or portion thereof may be closed by a \n     vote in open session of a majority of the Members of the \n     Committee present.\n       2. Witness Request. Any witness called for a hearing may \n     submit a written request to the Chairman no later than \n     twenty-four\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\n     hours in advance for his or her examination to be in closed \n     or open session. The Chairman shall inform the Committee of \n     any such request.\n       3. Confidential Matter. No record made of a closed session, \n     or material declared confidential by a majority of the \n     Committee, or report of the proceedings of a closed session, \n     shall be made public, in whole or in part or by way of \n     summary, unless specifically authorized by the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member.\n\n                            IV. Broadcasting\n\n       1. Control. Any meeting or hearing open to the public may \n     be covered by television, radio, or still photography. Such \n     coverage must be conducted in an orderly and unobtrusive \n     manner, and the Chairman may for good cause terminate such \n     coverage in whole or in part, or take such other action to \n     control it as the circumstances may warrant.\n       2. Request. A witness may request of the Chairman, on \n     grounds of distraction, harassment, personal safety, or \n     physical discomfort, that during his or her testimony \n     cameras, media microphones, and lights shall not be directed \n     at him or her.\n\n                         V. Quorums and Voting\n\n       1. Reporting. A majority shall constitute a quorum for \n     reporting a resolution, recommendation or report to the \n     Senate.\n       2. Committee Business. A third shall constitute a quorum \n     for the conduct of Committee business, other than a final \n     vote on reporting, providing a minority Member is present.\n       3. Hearings. One Member shall constitute a quorum for the \n     receipt of evidence, the swearing of witnesses, and the \n     taking of testimony at hearings.\n       4. Polling:\n       (a) Subjects. The Committee may poll (1) internal Committee \n     matters including those concerning the Committee's staff, \n     records, and budget; (2) other Committee business which has \n     been designated for polling at a meeting.\n       (b) Procedure. The Chairman shall circulate polling sheets \n     to each Member specifying the matter being polled and the \n     time limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so \n     requests in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held \n     for meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a \n     record of polls. If the Chairman determines that the polled \n     matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule III(1), the \n     record of the poll shall be confidential. Any Member may \n     request a Committee meeting following a poll for a vote on \n     the polled decision.\n\n                           VI. Investigations\n\n       1. Authorization for Investigations. All investigations \n     shall be conducted on a bipartisan basis by Committee staff. \n     Investigations may be initiated by the Committee staff upon \n     the approval of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member. \n     Staff shall keep the Committee fully informed of the progress \n     of continuing investigations, except where the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Minority Member agree that there exists temporary \n     cause for more limited knowledge.\n       2. Subpoenas. Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or \n     the production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials shall be issued by the Chairman, or by any other \n     Member of the Committee designated by him. Prior to the \n     issuance of each subpoena, the Ranking Minority Member, and \n     any other Member so requesting, shall be notified regarding \n     the identity of the person to whom the subpoena will be \n     issued and the nature of the information sought, and its \n     relationship to the investigation.\n       3. Investigative Reports. All reports containing findings \n     or recommendations stemming from Committee investigations \n     shall be printed only with the approval of a majority of the \n     Members of the Committee.\n\n                    VII. Depositions and Commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness's failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule II(6).\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he or she may refer the matter to the Committee or \n     the Member may order and direct the witness to answer the \n     question, but the Committee shall not initiate the procedures \n     leading to civil or criminal enforcement unless the witness \n     refuses to testify after he or she has been ordered and \n     directed to answer by a Member of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall \n     return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes, \n     if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule \n     II(7). If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the \n     staff shall note on the transcript the date a copy was \n     provided and the failure to return it. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his or her presence, the \n     transcriber shall certify that the transcript is a true \n     record to the testimony, and the transcript shall then be \n     filed with the Committee clerk. Committee staff may stipulate \n     with the witness to changes in this procedure; deviations \n     from the procedure which do not substantially impair the \n     reliability of the record shall not relieve the witness from \n     his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the Committee regulating their use.\n\n                          VIII. Subcommittees\n\n       1. Establishment. The Committee will operate as a Committee \n     of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish \n     temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The \n     Chairman of the full Committee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member shall be ex officio Members of all subcommittees.\n       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction as described in \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is \n     authorized to conduct investigations, including use of \n     subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.\n       3. Rules. A subcommittee shall be governed by the Committee \n     rules, except that its quorum for all business shall be one-\n     third of the subcommittee Membership, and for hearings shall \n     be one Member.\n\n                              IX. Reports\n\n       Committee reports incorporating Committee findings and \n     recommendations shall be printed only with the prior approval \n     of a majority of the Committee, after an adequate period for \n     review and comment. The printing, as Committee documents, of \n     materials prepared by staff for informational purposes, or \n     the printing of materials not originating with the Committee \n     or staff, shall require prior consultation with the minority \n     staff; these publications shall have the following language \n     printed on the cover of the document: ``Note: This document \n     has been printed for informational purposes. It does not \n     represent either findings or recommendations formally adopted \n     by the Committee.''\n\n                         X. Amendment of Rules\n\n       The rules of the Committee may be amended or revised at any \n     time, provided that not less than a majority of the Committee \n     present so determine at a Committee meeting preceded by at \n     least 3 days notice of the amendments or revisions proposed.\n\n\n                                endnote\n\n       \\1\\ As amended by S.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Idaho Small \nBusiness Development Center for its 25 years of supporting small \nbusiness in Idaho. The Idaho Small Business Development Center has a \nrich tradition of service to small business all over Idaho.\n  The mission of the Idaho Small Business Development Center is to \nenhance the success of small businesses in Idaho by providing high-\nquality consulting and training. The staff has delivered up-to-date \nconsulting, training, technical assistance and environmental regulatory \nassistance in all aspects of small business management since 1986. \nTheir primary goal is to help small business owners and entrepreneurs \nmake sound decisions for the successful operation of their business.\n  Each year, Idaho Small Business Development Center consultants meet \nwith clients to provide guidance in developing and growing a successful \nbusiness. Statistics show that on average, Idaho Small Business \nDevelopment Center clients achieve greater than 10 times the sales and \nemployment growth of the typical Idaho small business.\n  At the Idaho Small Business Development Center, client satisfaction \nand success are the ultimate measures of the work they do. They strive \nto deliver high quality, innovative programs and services in a \nconsistent and timely manner and take great pride in the success of \nthose served.\n  Under the long-time leadership of Jim Hogge, the Idaho Small Business\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nDevelopment Center has become the go-to shop for the Idaho \nentrepreneur. Their hands-on approach has meant the difference between \nclosing their doors or turning a profit for hundreds of Idaho \nbusinesses.\n  Through the ups and downs of the economy, the Idaho Small Business \nDevelopment Center has always been there with an open door and a \nhelping hand. Today, they partner with Idaho's colleges and \nuniversities to teach the principles of business and cultivate the next \ngeneration of Idaho entrepreneurs.\n  It is my privilege to recognize the 25th anniversary of what is truly \none of Idaho's bedrock institutions, the Idaho Small Business \nDevelopment Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S742-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING ALICE A. PETERS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Alice A. Peters, a philanthropist who, along \nwith her late husband Leon S. Peters, generously supported many \neducational, cultural, and community causes in Fresno, CA. Mrs. Peters \npassed away on January 24. She was 97 years old.\n  Born Alice Apregan, Mrs. Peters was the daughter of Armenian \nimmigrants who immigrated to Lynn, MA, in 1907 to escape the \npersecution of Ottoman Turks. In search of a better place to call home, \nthe family moved in 1911 to the San Joaquin Valley of California where \nmany people from their native Bitlis province of Armenia had settled. \nThe Apregan family made their home in the farming community of Del Rey, \nand Alice attended high school in nearby Selma.\n  She met her future husband during a visit to Del Rey Packing. Their \nfriendship blossomed into marriage in 1943. Leon Peters learned \nmechanical engineering on the job while working for Valley Foundry, \nbecame sales manager before purchasing the company in 1937. He and his \nbrothers turned Valley Foundry into one of the region's most successful \nbusinesses. This success allowed the Peters to become stalwart \nsupporters of community causes that have greatly benefited the people \nof Fresno and the Central Valley. Over the years, Leon and Alice Peters \nwould become synonymous with philanthropy and charity in the Greater \nFresno Area.\n  Since its establishment in 1959, the Leon S. Peters Foundation has \ngiven to many worthy causes and projects that continue to positively \nimpact the lives of Fresno residents. Mrs. Peters and her late husband \ndonated millions of dollars to local institutions such as the Community \nRegional Center, the Fresno Chafee Zoo, and the Fresno Art Museum and \nCalifornia State University, Fresno.\n  Mrs. Peters made sure that the vision of the Leon S. Peters \nFoundation endured after her husband's passing in 1983. In 2002, she \ndonated $300,000 to the Community Medical Foundation, which made \npossible an Extern Work Study Program for nursing students at community \nmedical centers. She summed up her commitment to philanthropy by saying \n``charity work is part of life, we all have to do some of it . . . this \nis our legacy.''\n  A woman of great conviction and vision, Mrs. Peters leaves behind a \nlegacy of philanthropy and community service and the admiration of \nthose whose lives she touched over the years. She has made indelible \ncontributions to make Fresno a better place.

Mr. President, I want to recognize the important \nwork and accomplishments of City of Hope as it reaches its 10,000th \nbone marrow transplant, becoming one of the first institutions in the \nworld to reach this milestone.\n  Founded in 1913, City of Hope has helped to improve the quality of \nlife for thousands of men, women, and children by leading research to \ndevelop new treatments and cures for cancer, diabetes, and other life-\nthreatening diseases.\n  Nearly 35 years ago, City of Hope helped pioneer the development of \nbone marrow transplantation as a treatment for diseases such as \nleukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma; this January, City of Hope performed \nits 10,000th transplant.\n  City of Hope performed its first successful bone marrow transplant in \n1976 on a college student from Indiana who was diagnosed with acute \nmyeloid leukemia. Thanks to City of Hope's pioneering bone marrow \ntransfer program, the college student's cancer has remained in \nremission for more than 35 years, allowing him to live a full life. \nMore than three decades later, City of Hope performed its 10,000th bone \nmarrow transplant on January 13, 2011 on a patient battling leukemia.\n  About 500 bone marrow transplants procedures are now performed each \nyear, and each year thousands of cancer survivors and their families \nattend a bone marrow transplant reunion coordinated by City of Hope. \nThis reunion serves as a celebration of life and the positive changes \nthat City of Hope's Bone Marrow Transplant program have created in the \nlives of so many cancer patients and their families, who truly found \ntheir hope again when they turned to City of Hope.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in commending City of Hope \nfor reaching its 10,000th bone marrow transplant and for its dedication \nto the advancement of health care services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S742-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SAADALLA MOHAMED ALY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to \nmark the quiet passage of a Washington institution a gentle and elegant \nman named Saadalla Mohamed Aly, but who was known to most of us simply \nas ``Mr. Aly.''\n  Few Americans outside of Washington have heard of ``Mr. Aly,'' and \nMr. Aly was just fine with that--but for 35 years he was a very \nwelcomed sight to everyone and anyone who appeared on ``Meet the \nPress'' and spent time in what was very much ``his'' Green Room.\n  From 1976 until his death last month at age 79, Mr. Aly was a proud \nfixture off-camera at America's longest-running news program. He was \nthe tuxedoed figure who greeted the guests, and implored them and their \nstaffs to dig into coffee or orange juice before the show--and to stay \nfor the post-show meal afterwards. He was the quiet, supportive \npresence who always put you at ease before the grilling interviews and \nroundtable discussions began. And he was a kind man who--in gestures \nlarge and small--harkened back to a time when Washington was more \ncivil, back to an era when people here in Washington really took the \ntime to know each other.\n  In the 22 years that I knew him, from my very first appearance on the \nshow as a very junior Senator in 1988, to the cold winter morning in \nDecember of 2002 when I went on with Tim Russert to announce for \nPresident, I never once asked Mr. Aly his political affiliation. He was \njust a gentle soul in a tuxedo who was unfailingly kind to all the \nguests, Democrat or Republican.\n  But I will never forget how he greeted me when I came back to the \nshow in January of 2005 after I lost. When I arrived at the studio, \nwith the snow falling, Mr. Aly was waiting at the front door, and the \nfirst thing he did was give me a great big hug. He asked my staff how I \nwas doing. I still don't know whether he cast a vote in that election, \nbut I do know that I was lucky to have a friend like Mr. Aly, who in \nhis quiet, considerate way voted with his actions, not his words.\n  Like many of us, I learned in the Washington Post that Mr. Aly passed \naway in December after contracting pneumonia on a trip to his native \nEgypt. It is fitting that his daughter Dalia arranged for his burial in \nWashington, because Washington is the place he loved. And Washington is \nthe city that came to love him.\n  These are years which have seen us lose some special friends at \n``Meet the Press,'' starting of course with Tim Russert. But if Tim was \nthe soul of ``Meet the Press,'' Mr. Aly was its heart. Through all \nthese years, as Tim said, if it was Sunday, it was ``Meet the Press.'' \nAnd if it was ``Meet the Press,'' it was a warm and friendly greeting \nfrom a true gentlemen, ``Mr. Aly.'' Mr. President, I will miss \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S742-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S742-S743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO RAY FLYNN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Ray Flynn has been a towering figure \nin the\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\ncity of Boston and in our politics, honored for more than four decades \nof public service and activism.\n  But on Saturday, he will be honored in a different city where he left \nanother legacy deserving of celebration. At last, this weekend Ray's \nbeloved Providence College will retire the No. 14 Ray wore as one of \nthe greatest backcourt players in the history of Friars basketball. \nAnd, as any Friars fan can attest, this is a well-deserved honor for \none of the school's greatest athletes.\n  Before he turned to politics, Ray Flynn was an All American at \nProvidence College, leading the Friars to the National Invitation \nTournament championship in 1963, his senior year. And what a tournament \nit was for Ray. He scored 38 points in the opener against tournament \nfavorite Miami. He followed that with 25 points against Marquette. And \nin the final against Canisius, he scored 20 points. He was named the \ntournament's Most Valuable Player. And when the announcer introduced \nhim as Ray Flynn from Boston, he corrected him by saying, ``I'm from \nSouth Boston, sir.''\n  Indeed, he was--and has always been-- a proud son of South Boston. As \na three-sport star athlete at South Boston High School, he achieved a \nlevel of success rarely seen at any school. In 1956, as a sophomore, he \nled South Boston's basketball team to its first ever Tech Tournament \nChampionship. In 1958, he pitched South Boston to a State championship \nin baseball and quarterbacked the football team to an undefeated \nseason. Oh, and by the way, he was named All Scholastic in all three \nsports that year.\n  Similarly, at Providence College, Ray Flynn earned All American \nhonors and was voted an Academic All American. He was drafted in 1963 \nby the Syracuse Nationals of the old American Basketball Association, \nnow the Philadelphia 76ers. But upon graduation, Ray joined the Army \nNational Guard, serving at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and \nFort Dix in New Jersey.\n  By the time Ray returned home to Boston, the Celtics had bought his \ncontract. And during the 1965 exhibition season, he showed that he had \nnot lost his touch as a shooter. In the final exhibition game, he \nscored 28 points, more evidence of why his coach at Providence College, \nJoe Mullaney, considered the best outside pure shooter he had ever \ncoached. But the Celtics needed more defense than offense, so Coach Red \nAuerbach made Ray the final cut in order to keep K.C. Jones on the \nroster.\n  Red Auerbach didn't know it then, but in that difficult decision he \nwas launching one of the most distinguished political careers. From \n1971 to 1979, Ray Flynn represented his South Boston neighborhood in \nthe Massachusetts House of Representatives. From 1978 to 1984, he \nserved on the Boston City Council. He then was elected mayor of Boston \nthree times, in 1983, 1987 and 1991. And in 1993, he was appointed by \nPresident Clinton to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See.\n  But Red Auerbach eventually realized the role he had played in Ray \nFlynn's life. In 1984, as mayor, Ray hosted a rally at city hall for \nthe Celtics, who had just won another championship, this time under \nK.C. Jones. In his remarks to the crowd, Red Auerbach said, ``If I had \ncut K.C. Jones instead of Ray Flynn in 1965, K.C. might be mayor of \nBoston and Ray Flynn might be coach of the Celtics.''\n  Even if Ray Flynn had been on the Celtics, he couldn't have won the \nNo. 14 he wore at Providence College. The Celtics No. 14 had belonged \nto Bob Cousy and would soon be retired. But it is a fitting honor that \nProvidence College is also retiring No. 14 because in Friars \nbasketball, No. 14 was Ray Flynn, All American, Academic All American, \nNIT MVP and recipient of the NCAA's prestigious Silver Anniversary \nAward honoring former student-athletes for their career \naccomplishments.\n  I join Providence College in saluting Ray Flynn's outstanding \naccomplishments as a member of the Friars basketball team. And we all \ncongratulate him for his dedication as a public servant. His life--in \nall its facets--reflects the ideals of basketball founder James \nNaismith--to ``be strong in body, clean in mind, lofty in \nideals.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S743-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S743-S744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JOE McDONALD\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to praise a great \nMontanan, Dr. Joe McDonald. Dr. McDonald's life achievements, work \nhistory and professional honors are large and impressive. He is a \nfather, husband and friend who will always be remembered as a community \nleader, tribal council member and college president. What I appreciate \nmost about Joe, though, is his remarkable ability to bring people \ntogether to work toward a common goal. Whether it is to create an \ninstitution of higher education, lead his tribal council or raise a \nhealthy family, Joe has been patient, respectful and productive. I look \nup to Joe and consider him a friend.\n  Dr. McDonald recently retired as president of the Salish and Kootenai \nCollege after a remarkable career and a lifetime of public service. \nJoe's career, indeed his entire life, is an inspiration not just to \npeople living on the Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana, \nbut also to thousands of students and others he touched over the years. \nAs the local newspaper reported in a downbeat tone, ``Dr. McDonald \nretires. They say all good things must come to an end.''\n  Dr. McDonald, a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai \nTribes, was born in St. Ignatius, MT. His good family gave him self-\nconfidence and other tools to become a role model in an increasingly \ndivided world. Western Montana College recognized Joe's potential \nearly. They gave the gifted student athlete a scholarship to play \nfootball and baseball, and the platform to fly. Joe turned the \nopportunity into an associate degree in education in 1953, a bachelor's \ndegree in education from the University of Montana in 1958, an M.S. \ndegree from UM in 1965, and an Ed.D. in 1981. Higher education gave him \nthe foundation to make history.\n  After college, Dr. McDonald mentored many reservation youths as \ncoach, principal and superintendent at Ronan High School from 1968 \nthrough 1976. While there, Joe began to bridge a divide he saw between \nIndian and non-Indian students. Wanting to do more than just complain, \nhe created the first Native American Studies program in Montana Public \nSchools. Today, all Montana public schools include a curriculum \nentitled ``Indian Education for All.'' Although many good people had a \nhand in it, we can thank Joe McDonald for leading the way.\n  Success as a teacher, coach and administrator gave him dreams of \nhigher education on the Flathead Indian Reservation. In the 1970s, he \nbegan to lay the foundation for SKC. And in 1977, Congress passed the \nTribal College Act. The new law opened the door for Dr. McDonald to \ncreate SKC, but didn't include any money to make it happen.\n  With no money, no classrooms, no teachers and no students, Joe became \npresident of SKC and served for over three decades. Beginning with \nliterally nothing, he built the institution from the ground up. \nEducators around the Nation now credit him for building SKC into one of \nthe, if not the flagship tribal college in the United States. When he \nretired last year, the college had a 130-acre campus with modern \ninfrastructure. Administrators can now thank him for growing the \nschool's endowment from just $5 in 1978 to more than $8 million today. \nThey can also thank him for the $26 million operational budget, 58 \nfaculty members and more than 180 operational employees who educate \n1,100 students. Remember, none of it existed before Dr. Joe McDonald \ntook the initiative to create it.\n  And believe it or not, he did even more for his community. In \naddition to growing perhaps the most dynamic tribal college in the \nNation, Dr. McDonald also served as an elected representative on the \nCSKT Tribal Council from 1974 to 1982. In terms of coaching, Joe is \namong the best. He has coached track, football and basketball--\nmentoring high school and college students, at-risk kids and groomed \ncollege athletes. Not only did his athletes succeed in sports, but \nbecause of his lessons, they succeed in life, too.\n  Joe married Sherri, the love of his life, when he was 19 years old. \nDuring their remarkable time together, Joe and Sherri raised four \nchildren, nine grandkids and six great-grandkids. As an example of his \nkeen perception about people, he recognized how valuable she was. \nThroughout the years, he\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\nselflessly gave her credit for everything he accomplished.\n  Some of his career and personal highlights include: 1951, Montana \nClass C, All State Basketball Team; 1959, Montana Class C Basketball \nCoach of the Year; 1989, National Indian Educator of the Year, National \nIndian Education Association; 1996, Montana Governor's Humanity Award \nRecipient; 2000, Michael P. Malone, Educator of the Year Award of 2000; \n2005, U of Montana's Highest Recognition, Honorary Doctorate of Humane \nLetters; 2005, University of Montana Foundation, Selected as one of the \n50 greatest Grizzlies; 2008, American Indian College Fund President of \nthe Year; and 2008, Inducted into the Montana Indian Athletic Hall of \nFame.\n  He holds honorary doctorate degrees from Gonzaga University in \nWashington State and Montana State University and was named \ndistinguished alum of the University of Montana and Western Montana \nCollege.\n  Joe served on the Board of the American Indian College Fund, the \nAmerican Indian Higher Education Consortium Board of Directors, and the \nBoard of the American Indian Business Leaders.\n  In 2009, CSKT created the ``Dr. Joseph F. McDonald Educational \nExcellence Award'' so others may aspire to the greatness embodied by \nits namesake.\n  In 2010, in conjunction with his retirement event, CSKT designated \nthe day officially as Joe McDonald Day.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in acknowledging this fine man and \nwishing him the best of luck in a well-deserved retirement. Knowing his \nlove of family, I am sure those great-grandkids will keep him happy for \nyears to come. But knowing Joe, I bet we haven't seen the last of him. \nMy bet is that his dedication to public service is just too strong for \nhim to fade into the sunset.\n  We look forward to whatever challenges Dr. Joe McDonald decides to \ntake on next. The world will be a better place because of it. It is \nalready a better place because of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S744-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MR. URSULO ORTIZ\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, my home State of New \nMexico lost a great man this month with the passing of Mr. Ursulo \nOrtiz. Mr. Ortiz was 92 when he died on February 5, surrounded as he \nwas throughout his life by his loving family. I would like to take a \nfew moments to honor him today.\n  The word ``dedicated'' comes to mind when recalling Mr. Ortiz \ndedicated to his family, his country, and his faith. Mr. Ortiz was part \nof a generation that witnessed some of our country's most historic and \nall too often difficult moments firsthand. And he took away from that \nexperience an appreciation for all the small joys life has to offer.\n  Mr. Ortiz was an entrepreneur with a strong work ethic, but he will \nbe remembered most as a loving husband and proud father, grandfather, \nand great-grandfather.\n  Mr. Ortiz's dedication to our country is self-evident. He enlisted in \nthe Army within weeks of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Coming from a \nland-locked State, he did not even know how to swim when he put aside \nregard for his own life to rush up the beaches and soaring cliffs of \nNormandy on D-Day.\n  Mr. Ortiz and his unit went on to liberate Paris and, later, \nconcentration camps in the former Czechoslovakia. He was a hero and \nbringer of freedom, and served with honor.\n  For those closest to Mr. Ortiz, it is his dedication to his family \nand his love of life that will be missed most. He left a legacy for \nfuture generations through the family's weaving business, which he \nsupported from the time he graduated high school until the day he \npassed it onto his daughter.\n  But more than that, his legacy is in the lasting memories held by \nthose dearest to him memories of lighter moments spent listening to \nmusic and dancing. It is in those simple, everyday moments that Ortiz's \nspirit will live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/15/senate-section/article/S744-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 514.

A bill to require restitution for victims of criminal \nviolations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I reintroduce the Environmental \nCrimes Enforcement Act, ECEA, to help ensure that those who destroy the \nlives and livelihoods of Americans through environmental crime are held \naccountable for their actions. This common sense legislation was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee with overwhelming support last \nyear. I hope the Senate will act on it in this Congress.\n  The tragic explosion of British Petroleum's Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig \nlast year is just one example of why this legislation is needed. Eleven \nmen died in that explosion, and oil flowed into the Gulf of Mexico for \nmonths, with deadly contaminants washing up on the shores and wetlands \nof the Gulf Coast. The catastrophe threatened the livelihood of many \nthousands of people throughout the Gulf region, as well as precious \nnatural resources and habitats. The people responsible for this and \nother catastrophes should be held accountable, and wrongdoers--not \ntaxpayers--should pay for the damage they have done. This bill will \nhelp to deter environmental crime, protect and compensate victims of \nenvironmental crime, and encourage accountability among corporate \nactors.\n  First, the ECEA is drafted to deter schemes by big oil and others \nthat damage our environment and hurt hardworking Americans by \nincreasing sentences for environmental crimes. All too often \ncorporations treat fines and monetary penalties as a mere cost of doing \nbusiness to be factored against profits. To deter criminal behavior by \ncorporations, it is important to have laws that result in prison time. \nIn that light, this bill directs the United States Sentencing \nCommission to amend the sentencing guidelines for environmental crimes \nto reflect the seriousness of these crimes.\n  Criminal penalties for Clean Water Act violations are not as severe \nas for other white-collar crimes, despite the widespread harm the \ncrimes can cause. As last year's crisis in the Gulf of Mexico makes \nclear, Clean Water Act offenses can have serious consequences in \npeople's lives and on their livelihoods. These consequences should be \nreflected in the sentences given to the criminals who commit them. This \nbill takes a reasonable approach, asking the Sentencing Commission to \nstudy the issue and raise sentencing guidelines appropriately, and it \nwill have a real deterrent effect.\n  This bill also aims to help victims of environmental crime--the \npeople who lose their livelihoods, their communities, and even their \nloved ones--reclaim their natural and economic resources. To do that, \nECEA makes restitution mandatory for criminal Clean Water Act \nviolations.\n  Currently, restitution in environmental crimes--even crimes that \nresult in death--is discretionary, and only available under limited \ncircumstances. Under this bill, those who commit Clean Water Act \noffenses would have to compensate the victims of those offenses for \ntheir losses. That restitution could help the people of the Gulf Coast \nrebuild their coastline and wetlands, their fisheries, and their \nlivelihoods should criminal liability be found.\n  Importantly, this bill will allow the families of those killed to be \ncompensated for criminal wrongdoing. The explosion on the Deepwater \nHorizon oil rig brought to light the arbitrary laws that prevent those \nkilled in such tragedies from bringing civil lawsuits for compensation. \nThis bill would ensure that, when a crime is committed, the criminal \njustice system can provide for restitution to victims, allowing the \nfamilies of those killed to be given the means to carry on.\n  This bill takes two common sense steps--well-reasoned increases in \nsentences and mandatory restitution for environmental crime. These \nmeasures are tough but fair. They are important steps toward deterring \ncriminal conduct that can cause environmental and economic disaster and \ntoward helping those who have suffered so much from the wrongdoing of \nbig oil and other large corporations. I hope all Senators will join me \nin supporting this bill and these important reforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the exploration, leasing, development, \nand production of oil and gas in and from the western portion of the \nCoastal Plain of the State of Alaska without surface occupancy, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two separate \nbills, S. 351 and S. 352, to open a small portion of the Arctic coastal \nplain, in my home State of Alaska, to oil and gas development. I am \nintroducing these bills because new production in northern Alaska is \nvital not only to my State's future, but also to our Nation's energy \nand economic security.\n  It has been known for more than 3 decades that the 1.5 million acres \nof the Arctic coastal plain that lie inside the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge present the best prospect in North America for a major \noil and gas discovery. The U.S. Geological Survey continues to estimate \nthat this part of the coastal plain--which represents just 3 percent of \nthe coastal plain in all of northern Alaska--has a mean likelihood of \ncontaining 10.4 billion barrels of oil and 8.6 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas, as well as a reasonable chance of economically producing \n16 billion barrels of oil. Even the relatively recent major finds in \nNorth Dakota's Bakken field pale in comparison, as ANWR is likely to \nhold over four times more oil than any other on-shore energy deposit in \nNorth America.\n  In the 1990s, opponents dismissed ANWR's potential and argued that \nthe nearby National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was forecast to contain \nalmost as much oil. Just last fall, however, the U.S. Geological Survey \nsignificantly reduced its oil estimates in the 23-million-acre reserve. \nInstead of containing somewhere between the 6.7 to 15 billion barrels \nforecast in 2002, the USGS now forecasts a mean of 896 million \nbarrels--a dramatic downward revision.\n  I still believe oil production must be allowed to proceed in NPRA and \nthat development of satellite fields west of Nusqiut must be allowed to \noccur, since I suspect its forecast is now too conservative. My office \nis working to hold this Administration to its word on NPRA by allowing \nleaseholders to access the CD5 development which the EPA and Corps of \nEngineers has now stalled. But the reduced forecast for northwest \nAlaska also means that opening a small area due east, along the coastal \nplain, is now more vital than ever for America's economic and national \nsecurity interests.\n  America today receives over 10 percent of its daily domestic oil \nproduction from fields in Arctic Alaska. You heard correctly, \nproduction already occurs in Arctic Alaska, and for more than 30 years, \nwe have successfully balanced resource development with environmental \nprotection. Alaskans have proven, over and over again, that those \nendeavors are not mutually exclusive.\n  Today, however, we face a tipping point. Alaska's North Slope \nproduction has declined for years and, with new development blocked at \nevery turn, it is now forecast to decline to levels that are \nthreatening the continued operation of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nSystem. A closure of TAPS would shut down all northern Alaska oil \nproduction. This would devastate Alaska's economy, drag global oil \nprices even higher, and deepen our energy dependence on unstable \npetrostates throughout the world.\n  Anyone who takes the long view on energy policy recognizes that no \nmatter what energy policy our Nation pursues, we will use substantial \namounts of oil well into the future. The more of that oil we produce \nhere, at home, the better off our economy, our trade deficit, our \nemployment levels, and the world's environment will be. Even the \nPresident's handpicked oil spill commission advocates that the U.S. \ntake the lead on environmental and safety standards for oil development \nin areas like the Arctic and Gulf of Mexico, but we cannot honestly \nexpect to take a leadership role if we are viewed as foolishly leaving \nour resources in the ground. We are still more than 50 percent \ndependent on foreign nations for our supply of oil, and no combination \nof alternative technologies and conservation can appreciably diminish \nthat number in the near future.\n  The Energy Information Administration, in its recent preliminary 2011 \nEnergy Forecast, predicts that U.S. crude production may increase by \nroughly 10 percent by 2019 because of enhanced oil recovery, increased \nshale oil production, and higher oil prices, which make marginal \nproduction more attractive. That will hardly be enough to break our \nimport dependence, but even more alarming is the forecast that U.S. \ndomestic production will decline less than a decade from now unless \nthese new areas are opened for development. To help meet future demand \nboth here in America and throughout the rest of the world--and to help \navoid a tremendous price spike in the event of a supply disruption--we \nneed to take steps today to ensure new production is brought online as \nsoon as possible.\n  In fact, we already face a supply disruption--a shortage of our own \nmaking. Not one permit for deepwater exploration has been granted since \nthe Deepwater Horizon disaster last April, even though the moratorium \nwas officially ended in October. Depending on how long this de facto \nmoratorium lasts, our Nation could ultimately be deprived of millions \nof barrels of oil each day. Make no mistake: we are facing a serious \ndownturn in offshore oil production from the Outer Continental Shelf, \nand that has made production in ANWR even more important for consumers.\n  ANWR development will also provide huge benefits for the U.S. \nTreasury. Let us examine this with some simple math. ANWR's mean \nestimate of over 10 billion barrels, at approximately $100 per barrel, \nmeans that there is a trillion dollars worth of oil locked up beneath \nthis small area in northern Alaska. That is a trillion taxable dollars \nand it is difficult to calculate or even fathom the corporate and \npayroll taxes that this would generate for our treasury. But we do know \nthat there is hundreds of billions of dollars in pure federal royalties \nsince my bill devotes 50 percent of the value to a Federal share, \nrather than the 10 percent which current law allows. This is because \ndeficit reduction has to be a priority.\n  As our Nation grapples with a $1 trillion budget deficit, $14 \ntrillion in national debt, and a lack of capital to incentivize \nrenewable and alternative energy, it is folly for America to further \ndelay new onshore oil development from Alaska. Production in ANWR will \nlower our unsustainable debt; improve our national security; reduce our \ntrade deficit; create well-paying American jobs; and provide a long-\nlasting source of funds that can help us\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\ndevelop the next generation of energy technologies. The question is no \nlonger, ``should we drill in ANWR?'' Today, it has become, ``can we \nafford not to?''\n  I understand that no matter what happens, some will remain opposed to \ndevelopment in this region. There are Senators who wish to not only \nprohibit oil and gas development onshore in the coastal plain--who wish \nto forever lock the area up into formal wilderness--but who also wish \nto impede oil and even natural gas development from vast portions of \nNPRA and from the offshore waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. \nThis mindset ignores Alaska's economic realities, it ignores the \nnation's looming energy challenges, and it ignores the fact that Arctic \noil production can proceed without significant environmental harm. Our \ndevelopment has coexisted productively with polar bears, and will not \nharm the Porcupine caribou herd or any other form of wildlife on the \nArctic coast. The groups who oppose my legislation seem totally \noblivious to strides made in directional, extended reach drilling, \nthree- and four-D seismic testing, and new pipeline leak detection \ntechnology, all of which permit Alaskan energy development to proceed \nsafely without harm to wildlife or the environment.\n  Yes, this Nation needs to improve its inspection and regulation of \nthe oil and gas industry to make sure that America's high environmental \nstandards are followed on every well, every day. I offer a means to \nadvance that. Because without domestic oil and gas production, America \nwill import more oil and gas from troubled global regions. In exchange \nwe will export our jobs and economic future, as well as simply \nexporting environmental risk and ultimately damage, since foreign oil \nand gas development regularly fails to meet the standards that American \noperators are held to and held accountable for.\n  For all these reasons, I am reintroducing legislation to open the \ncoastal plain of ANWR to full development. At the same time, I am \nfocusing and narrowing and limiting that development so that just 2,000 \nacres of the 1.5 million acre coastal plain can be physically disturbed \nby roads, pipelines, wells, buildings or other support facilities. At \nmost, just one-tenth of one percent of the refuge's coastal plain would \nbe physically disturbed. For comparison's sake, 2,000 acres is much \nsmaller than our local Dulles Airport--compared to an area roughly \nthree times the size of the State of Maryland. It is hardly a blip on \nthe map.\n  Limiting development to such a small area is important, however. It \nwill help guarantee--beyond any shadow of doubt--the preservation in a \nnatural state of more than sufficient habitat for caribou, muskoxen, \npolar bear, and Arctic bird life. My legislation also includes \nstringent environmental standards that will allow the designation of \nspecific areas for full protection.\n  The full opening bill, named the American Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act, AEIS, also includes guaranteed funding to mitigate any \nimpacts in the region, and guarantees that the federal government will \nreceive half of all revenues generated, with nearly half going for the \nfirst time in the history of ANWR legislation to directly reduce the \nFederal deficit. The bill allots other money to fund renewable and \nalternative energy development, wildlife programs and fishery habitat \nprograms, energy conservation efforts, and money to subsidize the \nrising cost of energy for lower-income residents through funding of the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program, also called LIHEAP. Think \nabout this--by producing more of our own oil, we can conserve more of \nour most spectacular lands, improve the standard of living for \nthousands of Americans, and, in one fell swoop, reduce our overall \ndependence on oil by creating new, cleaner alternatives.\n  Despite these remarkable benefits, I understand that many of my \ncolleagues will forever oppose all development in ANWR., That is why, \nin 2009, I worked with my fellow Senator from Alaska to introduce a new \napproach that would allow the coastal plain's resources to be accessed \nin an even more sensitive manner. Our legislation precludes any \npossibility of any disturbance to any creature on the coastal plain by \nrequiring that all oil and gas in the refuge's coastal plain be \nsiphoned from underneath the land, with no surface roads, wells, or \npipelines to assist. Not a single structure would be erected on the \nsurface of the refuge under our bill. There would be literally no \nchance of marring the beauty of the coastal plain--it would look and \nfeel and be just as it is today both during and after full production.\n  Today, and again in the spirit of bipartisan compromise, I am \nreintroducing, with Senator Begich, that legislation. The title is \nself-explanatory--we call it the No Surface Occupancy Western Arctic \nCoastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act--because it would allow oil \nand gas production only through extended reach directional drilling \nfrom outside of the refuge. The bill would also permit oil and gas to \nbe tapped using subsurface technology that may someday allow for full \ndevelopment of the refuge with no sign of such activities visible to \nanyone or anything in the refuge.\n  While I was deeply disappointed that many in the environmental \ncommunity did not embrace or even for a moment consider this proposal \nas a genuine attempt to end the quarter century fight over Alaskan \nenergy development, I continue to believe that it is an acceptable, \ndeeply sensitive way to pursue development in the Arctic. Given the new \nextended reach drilling technology being developed for use all over the \nworld, including Alaska, it could be possible to start producing oil \nand gas from ANWR even faster under the subsurface bill than might be \nthe case under the full leasing bill.\n  Admittedly, while current technology will only permit wells to reach \n8 miles into refuge's boundary, that should still allow us to reach up \nto 1.2 billion barrels of oil and 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. \nAs technology improves in the years ahead, so too will the volume of \nresources that we can safely recover.\n  My no-surface occupancy bill will require that 3- or 4-dimensional \nseismic and other tests be conducted by mobile units on ice pads when \nno wildlife will be in the area. But the bill prevents any disturbance \nthat can even be seen by migrating caribou. There is precedent for this \nproposal. Congress in 2007 approved a Wyoming wilderness lands bill S. \n2229, the Wyoming Range Legacy Act, which permits subsurface resource \nextraction, provided no surface occupancy occurs. There is also clear \nlanguage in the original statute, the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, which calls for seismic studies of the coastal plain.\n  My ANWR subsurface legislation will guarantee that royalties from any \noil and gas produced are split equally between the Federal and State \ntreasuries, and provides for full environmental protections and project \nlabor agreements for any development that results. The bill includes \nthe same provisions for local adaptation aid as does my bill to fully \nopen ANWR. Both guarantee that any Alaskan community impacted by \ndevelopment, especially residents of the North Slope Borough and the \nnearby Village of Kaktovik, will be fully protected.\n  My subsurface proposal offers a way for America to gain the oil and \nnatural gas that will be crucial until a new era of renewable energy \ncan power our lights and propel our vehicles. It also ensures that none \nof the Arctic Porcupine caribou herd that migrates across the coastal \nplain between June and August will ever see, hear, or feel oil \ndevelopment. Combined with the environmental safeguards the Secretary \nof the Interior is allowed to establish, there is no danger that any of \nthe few species that overwinter on the coastal plain will ever be \nimpacted by seismic or other activities. Out of an abundance of \ncaution, my legislation further protects subsistence resources and \nactivities for Alaska Natives.\n  I truly do not believe that limited surface coastal plain development \nwill harm Alaska's environment or hurt its wildlife. But my subsurface \nbill offers us another way to develop ANWR--and even those who oppose \nsurface development cannot honestly disagree with its approach. My \nsubsurface bill would lower the odds of environmental harm from \nincredibly miniscule to zero. It would set a precedent for development \nthat should be welcomed by the environmental community. And if it is \nnot actively supported, it will be clear that some oppose ANWR solely \non political and philosophical, rather than substantive, environmental \ngrounds. Such\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\nopposition would undermine the case against the full opening of the \ncoastal plain for energy development, because it will show that the \nopposition to ANWR is based on the sands of old fears, ignoring new \ntechnology and ignoring reality.\n  For decades, Alaskans, whom polls show overwhelmingly support ANWR \ndevelopment, have been asking permission to explore and develop oil in \nthe coastal plain. Finally, technology has advanced so that it is \npossible to develop oil and gas from the refuge with little or no \nimpact on the area and its wildlife. We must seriously consider this \noption. Without this level of seriousness about our energy policy, \nthere will be no chance for us to stabilize global energy markets and \navoid paying extremely high prices for fuel in the future. Our lack of \ndomestic production endangers our energy security and our strategic \nsecurity, especially given that ANWR development could supply more than \nenough oil to fully meet our military oil needs on a daily basis.\n  Last year, shortly after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the \nPresident stated that ``part of the reason oil companies are drilling a \nmile beneath the surface of the ocean'' is ``because we're running out \nof places to drill on land and in shallow water.'' A better \nexplanation, however, was offered by the columnist Charles Krauthammer, \nwho said that ``We haven't run out of safer and more easily accessible \nsources of oil. We've been run off them . . .'' The truth is that we \nhaven't run out of oil--onshore or offshore. We've simply tied our own \nhands by locking up our own lands.\n  At this time of high unemployment and unsustainable debt, we need to \npursue development opportunities more than ever. My ANWR bills offer us \na chance to produce more of our own energy, for the good of the \nAmerican people, in an environmentally-friendly way. With oil hovering \nnear $100 a barrel, with so many of our fellow citizens out of work, \nand with our Nation still more than 50 percent dependent on foreign \noil--we would be foolish to once again ignore our most promising \nprospect for new development.\n  I hope this Congress will have the common sense to allow America to \nhelp itself by developing ANWR's substantial resources. This is \ncritical to my state and the nation as a whole. And with this in mind, \nI will work to educate the members of this chamber about ANWR. I will \nshow why such development should occur--why it must occur--and how it \ncan benefit our Nation at a time when we so desperately need good \neconomic news.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 353. A bill to provide for improvements to the United States \nPostal Service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The U.S. Postal \nService Improvements Act of 2011. This legislation would help the U.S. \nPostal Service regain its financial footing as it adapts to the era of \nincreasingly digital communications.\n  The storied history of the Postal Service pre-dates our Constitution. \nIn 1775, the Second Continental Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin as \nthe first Postmaster General and directed the creation of ``a line of \nposts . . . from Falmouth in New England to Savannah in Georgia.'' The \nConstitution also gives Congress the power to establish post offices \nand post roads.\n  Today, the Postal Service is the linchpin of a $1 trillion mailing \nindustry that employs approximately 7.5 million Americans in fields as \ndiverse as direct mail, printing, catalog companies, paper \nmanufacturing, and financial services.\n  Postal Service employees deliver mail six days a week to hundreds of \nmillions of households and businesses. From our largest cities to our \nsmallest towns, from the Hawaiian Islands to Alaskan reservations, the \nPostal Service is a vital part of our national communications network \nand an icon of American culture.\n  But the financial state of the Postal Service is abysmal. The numbers \nare grim: the Postal Service lost $8.5 billion in fiscal year 2010 and \nrecently announced that it posted a net loss of $329 million in the \nfirst quarter of fiscal year 2011 alone. The ``Great Recession,'' high \noperating costs, and the continuing diversion of mail to electronic \nalternatives have undermined the Postal Service's ability to remain \nsolvent.\n  Faced with this much red ink, the Postal Service must reinvent \nitself. It must increase revenues by increasing its value to its \ncustomers and by becoming more cost effective.\n  Unfortunately, many of the solutions the Postal Service has proposed \nwould only aggravate its problems. Filing for enormous rate increases, \npursuing significant service reductions--including elimination of \nSaturday mail delivery--and seeking relief from funding its huge \nliabilities are not viable long-term solutions to the challenges \nconfronting the Postal Service. These changes will drive more customers \nto less expensive, digital alternatives. That downturn in customers \nwill further erode mail volume and lead to a death spiral for the \nPostal Service.\n  The Postal Service must chart a new course in this digital age. It \nmust adopt a more customer-focused culture. It must see the changing \ncommunications landscape as an opportunity.\n  The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, which I \nauthored with Senator Carper, provided the foundation for these long-\nterm changes, but the Postal Service has been slow to take advantage of \nsome of the flexibilities afforded by that law. And, to be fair, the \nPostal Service has encountered problems not of its making, such as a \nsevere recession.\n  The legislation that I introduce today would help the Postal Service \nachieve financial stability and light the way to future cost savings \nwithout undermining customer service.\n  The legislation would help remedy an enormous overpayment by the \nPostal Service into retirement funds used by both Federal and postal \nemployees alike. Based on an independent actuarial analysis, the Postal \nRegulatory Commission estimates the Postal Service has overpaid in \nexcess of $50 billion into the Civil Service Retirement System, CSRS, \nand nearly $3 billion into the Federal Employees Retirement System \npension fund. Another independent actuarial firm, commissioned by the \nPostal Service Inspector General, estimates that the overpayment into \nthe CSRS pension fund is even greater, perhaps topping $75 billion. It \nis simply unfair--both to the Postal Service and its customers--not to \nrefund these overpayments.\n  To address these inequities, the bill would allow the Postal Service \naccess to the amounts that it has overpaid into these pension funds. It \nis essential that the Postal Service be permitted to use these funds to \naddress other financial obligations, such as its payments for future \nretiree health benefits and unfunded workers' compensation liabilities \nand for repaying its existing debt.\n  I have pressed the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, to change its \ncalculation method for Postal Service payments into the CSRS fund \nconsistent with the 2006 Postal Reform law. OPM officials, however, \nhave stubbornly refused to change this methodology or even to admit \nthat the 2006 postal law permits them to do so. This has created a \nbureaucratic standoff that is unfair to the Postal Service. The OPM \nholds the life preserver--it could help rescue the Postal Service, but \nit simply refuses to throw it.\n  This legislation directs the OPM to exercise its existing authority \nunder the 2006 postal reform law and to revise its methodology for \ncalculating the Postal Service's obligations to the CSRS pension fund. \nOnce OPM exercises this authority, my legislation would allow the \nPostal Service to use any resulting overpayments to cover its annual \npayments into the Retiree Health Benefits Fund, rather than having to \nwait until after September 30, 2015, to access the CSRS overpayment.\n  Additionally, the legislation would allow the Postal Service to \naccess the nearly $3 billion it has overpaid into the Federal Employees \nRetirement System, FERS, pension fund. The legislation would grant OPM \nthis authority by adopting language, similar to Section 802(c) of the \n2006 postal reform law, that allows OPM to recalculate the methodology \ngoverning Postal Service payments into the FERS pension fund to \ndetermine a more accurate contribution.\n  As with the CSRS overpayment, the Postal Service would be permitted \nto use the FERS overpayment to meet its\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\nstatutory obligations to the Retiree Health Benefits Fund. These fund \ntransfers would greatly improve the Postal Service's financial \ncondition.\n  While I was pleased to see that the proposed budget the President \nreleased yesterday addresses the FERS overpayment, I was disappointed \nthat it did not direct OPM to update its methodology to allow the \nPostal Service to access the significant CSRS overpayment. Moreover, I \nam concerned that the 30-year repayment period proposed by the \nPresident to refund any FERS overpayments is too long given the \nimmediate financial needs of the Postal Service.\n  If the CSRS and FERS overpayment amounts are sufficient to fully fund \nthe Postal Service's obligations to the Retiree Health Benefits Fund, \nthis legislation would allow the Postal Service to pay its workers' \ncompensation liabilities, which top $1 billion annually. The Postal \nService may also choose to use these funds to pay down its existing \ndebt, which currently is $12 billion.\n  Second, the legislation would improve the Postal Service's \ncontracting practices and help prevent the kind of ethical violations \nrecently uncovered by the Postal Service Inspector General.\n  Several months ago, I asked the Postal Service Inspector General to \nreview the Postal Service's contracting policies. The IG found stunning \nevidence of costly contract mismanagement, ethical lapses, and \nfinancial waste.\n  In its review of the Postal Service's contracting policies, the IG \ndiscovered no-bid contracts and examples of apparent cronyism. The \nPostal Service's contract management did not protect against waste, \nfraud, and abuse. Indeed, it left the door wide open.\n  In fact, the Postal Service could not even identify how many \ncontracts were awarded without competition. Of the no-bid contracts the \nIG reviewed, 35 percent lacked justification.\n  In one of the more egregious examples of waste and abuse, the IG \ndiscovered that more than 2,700 contracts had been awarded to former \nemployees since 1991. At least 17 of those contracts were no-bid \ncontracts given to career executives within one year of their \nseparation from the Postal Service.\n  Some of these former executives were brought back at nearly twice \ntheir former pay to advise newly hired executives--an outrageous \npractice that the IG said raised serious ethical questions, hurt \nemployee morale, and tarnished the Postal Service's public image. In \none example, an executive received a $260,000 no-bid contract in July \n2009, just two months after retiring. The purpose? To train his \nsuccessor.\n  My legislation would help remedy many of the contracting issues the \nIG identified. Specifically, the bill would direct the Postmaster \nGeneral to establish a Competition Advocate, responsible for reviewing \nand approving justifications for noncompetitive purchases and for \ntracking the level of competition.\n  Earlier this month, the Postmaster General recognized this as an \nessential position by naming a Competition Advocate. My bill would help \nclarify and codify the Competition Advocate's role to ensure that the \nposition continues. Under my legislation, the Competition Advocate \nwould also be required to submit an annual report on Postal Service \ncontracting to the Postmaster General, the Board of Governors, the \nPostal Regulatory Commission, and the Congress.\n  To improve transparency and accountability, the bill also would \nrequire the Postal Service to publish justifications of noncompetitive \ncontracts greater than $250,000 on its website. This transparency would \nimprove the Postal Service's contracting practices and promote \ncompetition.\n  To resolve the ethical issues documented by the IG, the bill would \nlimit procurement officials from contracting with personal or business \nassociates for private gain. In a June 2010 report, the IG identified \nseveral contracts that a former top executive awarded non-competitively \nto former business associates, totaling nearly $6 million. These \ncontracts included at least two business associates he hired to manage \nhis personal finances and outside business interests. These sorts of \ninappropriate, unethical contracts are unacceptable, and this \nlegislation would help prevent similar conflicts of interest in the \nfuture. In addition, the bill would require the Postal Service's ethics \nofficial to review any ethics concerns that the contracting office \nidentifies prior to awarding a contract.\n  Third, the legislation includes several provisions that would enhance \nefficiency and reduce costs. While the Postal Service has made efforts \nto reduce costs over the past several years, more must be done.\n  One such area is in the consolidation of area and district offices. \nThe IG found that the Postal Service's regional structure--which at the \ntime of the report consisted of eight area offices and 74 district \noffices and cost approximately $1.5 billion to maintain in fiscal year \n2009--has significant room for consolidation. The Postal Service \nrecently announced the closure of one area office, but it needs to \nconduct a more comprehensive review. My bill would require the Postal \nService to create a strategic plan to guide consolidation efforts--a \nroad map for future savings.\n  The bill also would require the Postal Service to develop a plan to \nincrease its presence in retail facilities, or co-locate, to better \nserve customers. Before co-location decisions could be made, however, \nthe bill would direct the Postal Service to weigh the impact of any \ndecision on small communities and rural areas. Moreover, the Postal \nService would be required to solicit community input before making \ndecisions about co-location and to ensure that co-location does not \ndiminish the quality of service.\n  Fourth, the bill would require the arbitrator to consider the Postal \nService's financial condition when rendering decisions about collective \nbargaining agreements. This logical provision would allow critical \nfinancial information to be weighed as a factor in contract \nnegotiations.\n  Fifth, the bill would require the Postal Service to provide notice of \nany significant proposed changes to mailing rules, solicit and respond \nto comments about the proposed changes, and analyze their potential \nfinancial impacts. Mandating that the Postal Service adhere to these \nnotice-and-comment requirements would help ensure that the Postal \nService has fully considered the effect that significant changes might \nhave on customers and on the Postal Service's bottom-line.\n  Sixth, the bill would reduce workforce-related costs government-wide \nby converting retirement eligible postal and Federal employees on \nworkers' compensation to retirement when they reach age 65, 5 years \nbeyond the average retirement age for postal and Federal employees. \nThis is a commonsense change that would significantly reduce expenses \nthat both the Postal Service and the Federal Government cannot afford.\n  From July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010, the Department of Labor paid \napproximately $2.78 billion to employees on workers' compensation. \nThese workers' compensation benefits serve as a crucial safety net for \nFederal and postal employees who are injured on the job so they can \nrecuperate and return to work.\n  But, the Department of Labor indicates that postal and Federal \nemployees across the government are receiving workers' compensation \nbenefits into their 80s, 90s, and even 100s. Because of its benefits \nstructure, the workers' compensation program has morphed into a higher-\npaying alternative to Federal and postal retirement.\n  The Postal Service stands out as an unfortunate example of how \nFederal workers' comp is misused as a retirement system. From July 1, \n2009, to June 30, 2010, postal employees accounted for nearly half of \nall workers' comp benefit payments--about $1.1 billion for 15,470 \nrecipients. Of that number 2,051 were aged 70 or older; 927 were 80 or \nolder; and 132 were 90 or older. Amazingly, three of these postal \nemployees were 98 years old.\n  I must ask the obvious question: Is there any likelihood that these \nrecipients will ever return to work? No.\n  Then why aren't they transitioning to the retirement system when they \nreach retirement age?\n  This bill reforms the law by converting postal and Federal employees \non workers' compensation to the retirement system when they reach age\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\n65. This is a commonsense change that would save millions of dollars \nthat the Postal Service, the Federal Government, and American taxpayers \ncannot afford to spend.\n  The Postal Service is at a crossroads; it must choose the correct \npath. It must take steps toward a bright future. It must reject the \npath of severe service reductions and huge rate hikes, which will only \nalienate customers.\n  I have already received letters of support for my bill from various \norganizations, including the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers, Greeting \nCard Association, Magazine Publishers Association, American Catalog \nMailers Association, National Newspaper Association, PostCom, National \nPostal Policy Council, Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, and \nthe National League of Postmasters. I expect to receive more as postal \nstakeholders learn more about how my bill would help the Postal Service \ntransform its operations.\n  The Postal Service must re-invent itself. It must embrace changes to \nrevitalize its business model, enabling it to attract and keep \ncustomers. The U.S. Postal Service Improvements Act of 2011 will help \nspark new life into this institution, helping it evolve and maintain \nits vital role in American society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 354. A bill to amend the Classified Information Procedures Act to \nimprove the protection of classified information and for other puroses; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the Classified Information Procedures Act, \nCIPA, was enacted in 1980 with bipartisan support to address the \n``disclose or dismiss'' dilemma that arose in espionage prosecutions \nwhen a defendant would threaten the government with the disclosure of \nclassified information if the government did not drop the prosecution. \nPreviously, there were no Congressionally-mandated procedures that \nrequired district courts to make discovery and admissibility rulings \nregarding classified information in advance.\n  CIPA has worked reasonably well during the last 30 years, but some \nissues have arisen in a number of notable terrorism, espionage, and \nnarcotics cases that demonstrate that reforms and improvements could be \nmade to ensure that classified sources, methods and information can be \nprotected, and to ensure that a defendant's due process and fair trial \nrights are not violated. In 2009, when the Congress enacted the \nMilitary Commissions Act, MCA, the Congress drew heavily from the \nmanner in which the federal courts interpreted CIPA when it updated the \nprocedures governing the use of classified information in military \ncommission prosecutions. At that time, however, the Congress did not \nupdate CIPA. Indeed, since its enactment in 1980, there have been no \nchanges to the key provisions of CIPA.\n  As the former Chairman of the Senate Judiciary's Terrorism and \nHomeland Security Subcommittee, I chaired a number of hearings during \nwhich witnesses testified about the capacity of our civilian courts to \ntry alleged terrorists and spies. The first Subcommittee hearing that I \nchaired was on July 28, 2009, and was entitled ``Prosecuting \nTerrorists: Civilian and Military Trials for GTMO and Beyond.'' The \nsecond Terrorism and Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing that I \nchaired was on May 12, 2010, and was entitled ``The Espionage Statutes: \nA Look Back and A Look Forward.'' The testimony I have heard in regard \nto terrorism, espionage and our civilian courts, has convinced me that \nwhile our courts have the capacity and the procedures in place to try \nalleged terrorists and spies, reforms and improvements could be made to \nCIPA to codify and clarify the decisions of the federal courts.\n  As a result, today I am reintroducing the Classified Information \nProcedures Reform and Improvement Act, CIPRIA. CIPRIA contains reforms \nand improvements to ensure that the statute maintains the proper \nbalance between the protection of classified sources, methods and \ninformation, and a defendant's constitutional rights. Among other \nthings, this legislation, which includes the applicable changes that \nthe Congress made when it enacted the Military Commissions Act of 2009, \nwill: codify, clarify and unify federal case law interpreting CIPA; \nensure that all classified information, not just documents, will be \ngoverned by CIPA; ensure that prosecutors and defense attorneys will be \nable to fully inform trial courts about classified information issues; \nand will clarify that the civil state secrets privilege does not apply \nin criminal cases. CIPRIA will also ensure high-level DOJ approval \nbefore the government invokes its classified information privilege in \ncriminal cases and will ensure that the federal courts will order the \ndisclosure and use of classified information when the disclosure and \nuse meets the applicable legal standards. This legislation will also \nensure timely appellate review of lower court CIPA decisions before the \ncommencement of a trial, explicitly permit trial courts to adopt \nalternative procedures for the admission of classified information in \naccordance with a defendant's fair trial and due process rights, and \nmake technical fixes to ensure consistent use of terms throughout the \nstatute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Classified \n     Information Procedures Reform and Improvement Act of 2011''.\n       (b) In General.--Section 1 of the Classified Information \n     Procedures Act (18 U.S.C.

A bill to improve, modernize, and clarify the espionage \nstatutes contained in chapter 37 of title 18, United States Code, to \npromote Federal whistleblower protection statutes and regulations, to \ndeter unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the current framework concerning the \nespionage statutes was designed to address classic spy cases involving \npersons who intended to aid foreign governments and harm the United \nStates. The current framework traces its roots to the Espionage Act of \n1917, which made it a crime to disclose defense information during \nwartime. The basic idea behind the legislation, which was upheld by the \nU.S. Supreme Court as constitutional in 1919, was to stop citizens from \nspying or interfering with military actions during World War I. The \ncurrent framework was formed at a time when intelligence and national \nsecurity information existed primarily in some tangible form, such as \nblueprints, photographs, maps, and other documents.\n  Our nation, however, has witnessed dramatic changes to nearly every \nfacet of our lives over the last 100 years, including technological \nadvances which have revolutionized our information gathering abilities \nas well as the mediums utilized to communicate such information. Yet, \nthe basic terms and structure of the espionage statutes have remained \nrelatively unchanged\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\nsince their inception. Moreover, issues have arisen in the prosecution \nand defense of criminal cases when the statutes have been applied to \npersons who may be disclosing classified information for purposes other \nthan to aid a foreign government or to harm the United States. In \naddition, the statutes contain some terms which are outdated and do not \nreflect how information is classified by the Executive Branch today.\n  Legal scholars and commentators have criticized the current \nframework, and over the years, some federal courts have as well. In \n2006, after reviewing the many developments in the law and changes in \nsociety that had taken place since the enactment of the espionage \nstatutes, one district court judge stated that ``the time is ripe for \nCongress'' to reexamine them. United States v. Rosen, 445 F. Supp. 2d \n602, 646, E.D. Va. 2006, Ellis, J. Nearly 20 years earlier in the \nMorison case, one federal appellate judge stated that ``[i]f one thing \nis clear, it is that the Espionage Act statutes as now broadly drawn \nare unwieldy and imprecise instruments for prosecuting government \n`leakers' to the press as opposed to government `moles' in the service \nof other countries.'' That judge also stated that ``carefully drawn \nlegislation'' was a ``better long-term resolution'' than judicial \nintervention. See United States v. Morison, 844 F.2d 1057, 1086, 4th \nCir. 1988.\n  As the former Chairman of the Senate Judiciary's Terrorism and \nHomeland Security Subcommittee, I chaired a Subcommittee hearing on May \n12, 2010, entitled ``The Espionage Statutes: A Look Back and A Look \nForward.'' At that Subcommittee hearing, I questioned a number of \nwitnesses, which included witnesses from academia as well as former \nofficials from the intelligence and law enforcement communities, about \nhow well the espionage statutes have been working. And since that \nhearing, I have been closely and carefully reviewing these statutes, \nparticularly in the context of recent events. I am convinced that \nchanges in technology and society, combined with statutory and judicial \nchanges to the law, have rendered some aspects of our espionage laws \nless effective than they need to be to protect the national security. I \nalso believe that we need to enhance our ability to prosecute spies as \nwell as those who make unauthorized disclosures of classified \ninformation. We don't need an Official State Secrets Act, and we must \nbe careful not to chill protected First Amendment activities. We do, \nhowever, need to do a better job of preventing unauthorized disclosures \nof classified information that can harm the United States, and at the \nsame time we need to ensure that public debates continue to take place \non important national security and foreign policy issues.\n  As a result, today I am reintroducing the Espionage Statutes \nModernization Act, ESMA. This legislation makes important improvements \nto the espionage statutes to make them more effective and relevant in \nthe 21st century. This legislation is narrowly-tailored and balanced, \nand will enable the government to use a separate criminal statute to \nprosecute government employees who make unauthorized disclosures of \nclassified information in violation of the nondisclosure agreements \nthey have entered, irrespective of whether they intend to aid a foreign \ngovernment or harm the United States.\n  This legislation is not designed to make it easier for the government \nto prosecute the press, to chill First Amendment freedoms, or to make \nit more difficult to expose government wrongdoing. In fact, the \nproposed legislation promotes the use of Federal whistleblower statutes \nand regulations to report unlawful and other improper conduct. \nUnauthorized leaks of classified information, however, are harmful to \nthe national security and could endanger lives. Thus, in addition to \nproposing important refinements to the espionage statutes, this \nlegislation will deter unauthorized leaks of classified information by \ngovernment employees who knowingly and intentionally violate classified \ninformation nondisclosure agreements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The Espionage Statutes \n     Modernization Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As of 2011, the statutory framework with respect to the \n     espionage statutes is a compilation of statutes that began \n     with Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 217, chapter 30)(commonly \n     known as the ``Espionage Act of 1917''), which targeted \n     classic espionage cases involving persons working on behalf \n     of foreign nations.\n       (2) The statutory framework was formed at a time when \n     intelligence and national security information existed \n     primarily in a tangible form, such as blueprints, \n     photographs, maps, and other documents.\n       (3) Since 1917, the United States has witnessed dramatic \n     changes in intelligence and national security information, \n     including technological advances that have revolutionized \n     information gathering abilities as well as the mediums used \n     to communicate such information.\n       (4) Some of the terms used in the espionage statutes are \n     obsolete and the statutes do not fully take into account the \n     classification levels that apply to national security \n     information in the 21st century.\n       (5) In addition, the statutory framework was originally \n     designed to address classic espionage cases involving persons \n     working on behalf of foreign nations. However, the national \n     security of the United States could be harmed, and lives may \n     be put at risk, when a Government officer, employee, \n     contractor, or consultant with access to classified \n     information makes an unauthorized disclosure of the \n     classified information, irrespective of whether the \n     Government officer, employee, contractor, or consultant \n     intended to aid a foreign nation or harm the United States.\n       (6) Federal whistleblower protection statutes and \n     regulations that enable Government officers, employees, \n     contractors, and consultants to report unlawful and improper \n     conduct are appropriate mechanisms for reporting such \n     conduct.\n       (7) Congress can deter unauthorized disclosures of \n     classified information and thereby protect the national \n     security by--\n       (A) enacting laws that improve, modernize, and clarify the \n     espionage statutes and make the espionage statutes more \n     relevant and effective in the 21st century in the prosecution \n     of persons working on behalf of foreign powers;\n       (B) promoting Federal whistleblower protection statutes and \n     regulations to enable Government officers, employees, \n     contractors, or consultants to report unlawful and improper \n     conduct; and\n       (C) enacting laws that separately punish the unauthorized \n     disclosure of classified information by Government officers, \n     employees, contractors, or consultants who knowingly and \n     intentionally violate a classified information nondisclosure \n     agreement, irrespective of whether the officers, employees, \n     contractors, or consultants intend to aid a foreign power or \n     harm the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 51\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States, many of \n     whom read Greek political philosophy in the original Greek, \n     drew heavily on the political experience and philosophy of \n     ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', \n     includes the words, ``Most heartily was gladdened George \n     Washington's brave land'';\n       Whereas the people of the United States generously offered \n     humanitarian assistance to the Greek people during their \n     struggle for independence;\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete, which \n     provided the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians were \n     killed in Greece during World War II in defense of the values \n     of the Allies;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was one of a \n     few countries that allied with the United States in every \n     major international conflict;\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     more than $20,000,000,000 in the countries of the region, \n     thereby helping to create more than 200,000 new jobs, and \n     having contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid \n     for the region;\n       Whereas Greece actively participates in peacekeeping and \n     peace-building operations conducted by international \n     organizations including the United Nations, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, and the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympic Games of more \n     than 14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat Greece handled efficiently, securely, and \n     with hospitality;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps \n     in recent years to further cross-cultural understanding and \n     rapprochement with Turkey, as seen by Prime Minister of \n     Greece George Papandreou's trip to Turkey, just days after \n     being elected and the Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip \n     Erdogan's visit to Greece in May 2010, during which Greece \n     and Turkey established a Joint Ministerial Council, made up \n     of 10 ministers from each country, to discuss tangible ways \n     to enhance cooperation in various fields of interest;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and similar ideals have forged a close bond \n     between Greece and the United States;
