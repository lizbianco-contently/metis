Mr. President, I would like to start today on a \npositive note. Later this very day, the two parties will come together \nto do something we haven't been doing enough of around here: we will \npass a jobs bill on a bipartisan basis, and then we will send it back \nto the House, where we hope it will pass shortly. In other words, we \nare going to legislate. I know that might sound a little like a \ngroundbreaking idea to some of my colleagues on the other side who \nwould rather spend all of their time putting together legislation aimed \nat sending a political message, but hopefully today's votes will help \nchange that.\n  As I have been saying for weeks now, we have two choices: We can \neither acknowledge the fact that we live in a two-party system and work \ntogether on legislation both parties can embrace or we can spend our \ntime, as Democrats have for the past 2 months, putting together \nlegislation that is designed to fail.\n  House Republicans have chosen the former approach. Since taking over \nthe\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\nmajority earlier this year, they have searched for common ground when \nit comes to jobs legislation, and they have found it, passing more than \n20 bills aimed at spurring the economy and creating jobs that have \nattracted strong bipartisan support.\n  Meanwhile, the Democratic majority here in the Senate has opted for \nthe latter approach. Taking their cues from the political team down at \nthe White House, Senate Democrats have spent most of their time trying \nto make Republicans look bad instead of looking for ways to work with \nus on meaningful jobs legislation.\n  But today they have taken a break from all that, and I am pleased to \nsay the two parties will pass two important pieces of jobs legislation: \nSenator Brown's 3 percent withholding bill, which eases the burden on \ngovernment contractors, freeing up more money they can use to expand \nand to hire, and a veterans bill sponsored by Senator Murray that not \nonly helps returning veterans but the businesses that hire them.\n  On their own, these bills won't solve our jobs crisis--far from it. \nNo single piece of legislation can. But this attempt at bipartisanship \nthat has been used to get them over the finish line represents our best \nshot at making progress on jobs and the economy as long as Republicans \nhave the majority in one half of Congress and Democrats have the \nmajority in the other. We can still improve on the process, of course, \nthrough greater consultation within the committee of jurisdiction, but \nit is a good start nonetheless. This is how divided government works--\nthrough genuine cooperation and a search for common ground. It is what \nRepublicans on the joint committee have been doing these past several \nweeks, and it is what House Republicans have been doing for the past \nyear on legislation of the kind we will actually pass today.\n  This isn't to say we shouldn't have open, full-throated debates that \nshowcase our differences. The two parties clearly have different points \nof view when it comes to restoring the economy and creating jobs. That \nis why we will also have a vote today for the McCain-Paul-Portman bill, \nwhich aims at unleashing the private sector instead of shackling it \nwith more government, as our Democratic friends propose. The McCain-\nPaul-Portman bill is a clear alternative to the President's failed \nmodel of endless stimulus. Members should have a chance to express \ntheir support for it, and I am glad we will, even as we vote on things \non which we can all agree.\n  So my message is this: Let's keep it up. Let's build on today's \nsuccess and move on to some of the other jobs bills that have already \npassed the House on a very broad bipartisan basis. I have highlighted \ntwo of them already. Today, I will highlight two more: the Access to \nCapital for Job Creators Act, H.R. 2940, and the Entrepreneur Access to \nCapital Act, H.R. 2930--two bills that make it easier for small \nbusinesses to raise money in innovative ways from small donors, \ngenerally over the Internet, often through social media. Here is a way \nto enable the little guy to raise money for his or her business and let \nsmall investors get into the game too. We all know access to capital is \none of the key ingredients to economic growth. Here is a way to make it \neasier for folks to get that capital that also creates new avenues for \nthe little guy to invest. Senators Thune and Scott Brown have companion \nbills here in the Senate. We should take them up and we should pass \nthem.\n  You don't hear a lot about Republicans and Democrats agreeing on \nlegislation these days, but here is some on which we do actually agree. \nSo I would say let's take them up, pass them, and send them to the \nPresident for his signature. The Obama administration has already said \nit supports these ideas, and 169 Democrats in the House voted for one \nof these bills last week, with 175 voting for the other. Republicans \nsupport both overwhelmingly as well. So let's do it. Let's build on the \nmomentum we have today, after passing the 3-percent withholding and the \nVeterans bill. Let's show the American people we have discovered and \nembraced a formula for success around here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7308-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS DAY 2011\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, tomorrow is a very important day--\nVeterans Day--a day we set aside to honor the service and sacrifice of \nthe heroic men and women who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. \nAmerica remains a beacon of freedom throughout the world today because \nof the commitments and sacrifices they have made. Over the years, many \nbrave Americans donned their country's uniform to ensure we would \nremain safe and free here at home.\n  My own State of Kentucky has a proud and honorable military history \nand today is home to both Fort Knox and Fort Campbell, which together \nhouse thousands of soldiers. The Commonwealth is also home to scores of \nbrave National Guard members and reservists. The efforts of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines from Kentucky and all 50 States \ncontinue today, as our fighting forces courageously defend freedom from \ndangerous enemies all around the world.\n  I have been honored to meet with the families of Bluegrass State \nservicemembers who have been lost in war. I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a little of what they have told me about how proud they are \nof their loved ones' service.\n  One soldier's son said:\n\n       Nobody wants to see their father die . . . but to have it \n     be while doing something of this significance, we're proud of \n     him.\n\n  Another soldier's widow told me:\n\n       There are no great words in a time of deep tragedy. But \n     surely there are great men in the midst of great tragedy.\n\n  And I will never forget what a preacher said of his lost congregant:\n\n       [He] didn't want to die, he didn't intend to die. But he \n     was willing to lay down his life. That's what a hero is.\n\n  On Veterans Day, we pay tribute to everyone who ever bore arms in \nservice of this Nation. We can express our thanks and our gratitude to \nthose who are still with us. And we must honor in our memories those \nwho did not return home.\n  We pay tribute to the families of our servicemembers, too, because \nthey have made a sacrifice as well by loaning America their sons, \ndaughters, husbands, and wives.\n  And we pay tribute to the indomitable American spirit that is \nessential to the survival of liberty. It is thanks to America's \nveterans and their exceptional service that we have upheld this spirit.\n  Lastly, I would like to offer best wishes for a happy birthday to our \nmarines deployed across the globe, especially to our Kentucky marines \nwho have been such a source of pride to the Commonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7308-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7308-S7309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING EASTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On a related matter, Mr. President, I would like to \nrecognize Eastern Kentucky University, located in Richmond, KY, for all \nthe school has done on behalf of Kentucky's Veterans. EKU has been \nnamed one of the top two universities in the Nation for veterans for \nthe second consecutive year. The recognition was given to EKU by the \nMilitary Times EDGE magazine for the university's commitment to helping \nmilitary veterans advance their education.\n  EKU has made a concerted effort over the past several years to make \nthe institution more hospitable to America's brave veterans. These \ninitiatives include dropping admission fees for undergraduate veterans, \ngranting in-state tuition to all out-of-State veterans, giving priority \nregistration to veterans, designating housing specifically for student-\nveterans, and creating a helpful withdrawal and readmission process for \nveterans.\n  EKU's commitment to better education for our Nation's heroes has, by \nall accounts, been a huge success.\n  In addition to receiving national recognition from the veterans \ncommunity, the university has seen its veteran population grow by some \n40 percent in the last year.\n  So today, on the eve of Veterans Day, I wish to honor Eastern \nKentucky University for its dedication to better serving our country's \nbrave veterans, and to congratulate the university and President Doug \nWhitlock on this well-deserved recognition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7309-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, and their implementing a \ncap-and-trade program for what is called cross-State air pollution. I \noppose this new regulation and I support the resolution of disapproval \nthat we will be voting on later today.\n  Led by the EPA, Washington bureaucrats are tying up America with \nredtape. They are tying up our Nation and they are tying up the \nAmerican people. This year alone, the EPA has issued over 400 final \nrules. These are rules that do have the effect of law. Well, that is \nover two rules per day so far this year for each day the Federal \nRegister has been open for business in 2011.\n  Imagine any business in the United States, in our home communities--\nbusinesses having to comply with two new EPA rules each day you are \nopen for business. And, of course, if you don't comply, then you face \nthousands of dollars in fines. This is business as usual for the EPA. \nThousands of rules are filling the Federal Register, 70,000 pages this \nyear alone. The costs of rules issued this year are estimated to \neclipse the $100 billion mark. It is time to stop Washington \nbureaucrats. They are issuing excessive rules without considering their \nimpact on our economy.\n  The problem is that this administration does not believe there is a \nregulations problem. They think more regulations actually create jobs \nrather than harm jobs. Fortunately, a previous Congress passed, and \nPresident Clinton signed into law, what is called the Congressional \nReview Act. This law gives us our best tool to dismantle bad \nregulations, and we should use it when appropriate.\n  Majority Leader Reid, one of the authors of this Congressional Review \nAct, described the process as a reasonable, sensible approach to \nregulatory reform. I believe the Senate should use it here today. The \nSenate should take back some responsibility, instead of letting \nunelected, unaccountable bureaucrats continue to harm our economy.\n  I am standing here today to support Senator Rand Paul's resolution to \nnullify the EPA's cross-State air pollution rule. The EPA's cross-State \nair pollution rule was finalized approximately 3 months ago. It is \nalready costing Americans jobs. Over the summer, officials at a Texas \nutility threw up their hands and said they can't comply. They said it \nwas too costly, too burdensome, and 500 jobs in Texas were lost as a \nresult. The EPA's own estimates say another 2,500 jobs will be lost \nbecause of this very regulation. Private sector analysis puts the job \nand cost numbers much higher.\n  The cross-State air pollution rule puts limits on electricity \ngeneration for over half the country. It forces Washington's heavy hand \non over 1,000 coal, gas, and oil-fired facilities across 28 States. \nOriginally designed for States in the East, the EPA now continues to \nexpand the rule to capture more and more States in the West. The newest \nversion of the rule imposes new requirements for Kansas, Oklahoma, \nNebraska, Texas, Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The compliance costs \nare very high. By the EPA's own estimate, the rule will cost over $2.4 \nbillion.\n  The EPA also notes that part of these costs will be passed on to U.S. \nhouseholds in the form of higher electricity rates. The cross-State air \npollution rule demonstrates how bureaucrats simply do not understand \nhow job creators work and operate their businesses all across this \ncountry.\n  The implementation timeline the EPA has proposed is nearly impossible \nto follow. The rule was finalized on August 8, which leaves less than 6 \nmonths for companies and States to act and meet the new mandates by \nJanuary of 2012. The Office of Management and Budget even warned that \nthere would be consequences of such a drastic change in such a short \namount of time.\n  In conclusion, this resolution of disapproval will tell the \nbureaucrats to do their job but do it following the rules of the road. \nWe all want clean air, and we want it done in a responsible way. This \nEPA is rushing through rules, causing a train wreck in our economy, our \njobs, and our competitiveness as a nation will suffer as a result. \nSenator Paul's resolution will save at least 3,000 American jobs and \nalso prevent a rise in electricity costs for American families. By \nadopting this resolution today, we will help our job creators, and help \nthem be more competitive in the global marketplace. It is common sense \nto rein in the EPA.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleague who \njust spoke but disagree with him, and I urge my colleagues to take a \ncareful look at the Rand Paul resolution of disapproval when it comes \nto this issue of air pollution. I would commend the remarks of our \ncolleague Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire who spoke this Tuesday \non the floor of the Senate, urging the same opposition to Rand Paul's \nresolution. She said she could not support that resolution. I quote \nfrom Senator Ayotte's floor statement:\n\n       The cross-State air pollution rule is designed to control \n     emissions of air pollution that cause air quality problems in \n     downwind States, and New Hampshire is a downwind State.\n\n  She went on to argue that this rule, which was first implemented 6 \nyears ago--this is not a new idea coming through this administration; \nit has been here for years--is simple justice. Why in the world should \nthe people downwind of a polluting State have their lifestyle and \nopportunity to expand businesses affected? Shouldn't we have reasonable \nstandards that, if the air pollution you put in the air is going to \ncross over the border--which it naturally will--and affect the air \nquality in a neighboring State, you have a responsibility? Well, of \ncourse you do. But, unfortunately, the position Senator Paul is taking \nis that we shouldn't have any standards, we shouldn't have any rules.\n  I would also suggest that there are utility companies--one that \nvisited my offices yesterday--that agree with my position. They want to \nhave a good rule when it comes to this cross-State air pollution.\n  John Rowe is the executive of a company named Exelon. Exelon, \nCommonwealth Edison, has been around for a number of years. They have \nacquired plants in many different locations. He was here on the Hill \nyesterday as a utility executive lobbying against Rand Paul's \nresolution of disapproval. If you believe the earlier statements made \nby my colleague and friend Senator Barrasso, you would assume the power \nindustry is opposed to the EPA in this position. Not true. Many \nforward-looking utility executives have made decisions to lessen air \npollution. If the Paul resolution is enacted, all of their investment \nwill have been for nothing other than their own self-satisfaction. They \nhave tried to live up to a standard in the law which Senator Paul now \nwants to eliminate. That is a mistake. And it is a mistake because it \nrewards bad conduct.\n  When we come up with new standards to make America healthier and \nsafer, it is interesting, the reaction. Some corporate leaders, when \nthey hear of a new standard that might make the air cleaner or water \npurer, say, That is it, we have heard from the government, we have got \nto go out and hire a lawyer and a lobbyist to fight it. Others say, \nThat is it, we believe the standard is reasonable, we are going to hire \nthe engineers to make it work.\n  The second approach is one we should reward. The first approach will \nbe rewarded if Senator Paul has his way and eliminates this air \npollution standard.\n  Yesterday, Lisa Jackson, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, came in my office and I talked to her. I said that \nmany times\n\n[[Page S7310]]\n\nwe speak about air pollution in the most general and theoretical terms. \nTo me, it is a very personal thing. I invited her and every one of my \ncolleagues, including my colleagues from Wyoming and Idaho and other \nStates, to step forward the next time they visit a classroom in a \nschool and ask a simple question to the students assembled there, a \nquestion I ask every time I visit a school. I ask the students: How \nmany of you know someone who is suffering from asthma? Without fail, \nhalf of the students or more will raise their hand.\n  It is a mistake for us to ignore this epidemic of pulmonary disease \nwhich is literally claiming lives every single day in our country. It \nis a mistake for us to ignore the fact that this public health hazard \nof air pollution makes asthma sufferers suffer even more.\n  Two weeks ago, I was at the University of Illinois Children's \nHospital and met with some of the parents of asthmatic children. It is \na heartbreaking situation. I cannot imagine what it is like to be \nsitting there on the bedside of your daughter or son when they say, I \ncan't breathe. That is the reality of asthma in its worst situation.\n  Maybe that is not the worst situation. I can recall visiting \nemergency rooms at children's hospitals in Chicago and having emergency \nroom physicians say, I have had teenagers walk in here and say, I have \nasthma, I can't breathe, and I sat there and watched them die. There \nwas nothing I could do about it. That is the reality of asthma and \npulmonary disease. That is the reality of pollution. And if Senator \nPaul and his followers have their way, we will reduce the standards for \nclean air in America, we will endanger more people with asthma and \npulmonary conditions, and we will pay a heavy price--not just in the \nhuman suffering and death but in the health care costs associated with \nit.\n\n  Why is it, when the Republicans are asked to come up with a way to \ncreate jobs in America, their first stop is to eliminate the EPA? Why \nis it that the House of Representatives, Republican-dominated House, \nboasts that they have a jobs bill, and you look and find they on 168 \nseparate occasions this year tried to take away the authority of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to protect the air and the water that \nwe drink? Is that the path to economic prosperity in America? The \nfilthy skies we see in some cities around the United States and the \nsmog that is attendant to it? And of course, if you go overseas to \nChina, you can cut the air with a knife 24/7. That is the reality of an \nunregulated business environment. It is a reality we can change. We can \nchange it with thoughtful regulation, we can change it by dedicating \nourselves to public health and safety, and we can change it by \nsupporting those rules which are consistent with improving public \nhealth.\n  I want to salute Senator Ayotte for her statement on the floor. \nSenator Alexander of Tennessee joined her. We believe there will be a \nhandful of stalwart Republicans who will step forward with us today to \ndefeat the Paul amendment. They believe, as we do, this is not a \npartisan issue. It does our country no good to declare war on the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and to leave ourselves vulnerable to \nall the death and disease that will follow if we don't do something \nmeaningful to deal with air pollution. I think we can, and I think we \nshould, and I hope we can do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  When I listen to the suggestions about creating jobs, I think many on \nthe other side overlook the obvious. When we are looking for more \nenergy efficiency and cleaner energy, we are pushing the envelope on \ntechnology. We are asking for innovation, entrepreneurship, and new \nemployment to reach it. It is an exciting opportunity for us across \nthis country.\n  Two weeks ago I visited a new coal-fired plant in southern Illinois \nnear my home area where I was born. It is across the road from a coal \nmine, and they have put on that plant $1 billion worth of scrubbers and \ncleaning devices to reduce air pollution dramatically from where it \notherwise would have been in a coal-fired plant. They made the \ninvestment because it was the right thing to do, and it is a standard \nthat is moving us forward as a country so we can say to the American \npeople we can produce the energy we need for our economy to create jobs \nand grow, but do it in a sensible fashion.\n  If the Republican leadership in the House has its way, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency will all but disappear. Maybe that is \ntheir way to expand the economy, but it is not mine. I would rather be \ncreating jobs for energy efficiency and new energy technology right \nhere in the United States, so that we end up with cleaner air and purer \nwater. I would rather do that than watch the Rand Paul approach pass, \nand find ourselves creating jobs, sadly, on the backs of those who are \nsuffering from asthma. I don't doubt, if there are more asthmatics, \nthere will be need for more medical professionals, more emergency \nrooms, more nebulizers, more medical treatment. Those aren't the kinds \nof jobs we should pointedly try to create. We need those folks, but we \nshouldn't make their tasks any harder or more difficult by increasing \nthe number of children and young people in America who are suffering \nfrom asthma that is the direct consequence of watering down the air \npollution laws in a way that Senator Paul will try to do later today on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Let's have respect for the people who live in this country and the \nhealth of their children. Let's vote down this Rand Paul resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to S.J. Res. 27.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint \n     resolution (S.J. Res. 27) disapproving a rule submitted by \n     the Environmental Protection Agency relating to the \n     mitigation by States of cross-border air pollution under the \n     Clean Air Act.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders or their designees.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of clean air, clean \nwater, electricity, and jobs. I think we can have a clean environment \nand jobs, but not if we let this administration continue to pass job-\nkilling regulations. These new regulations will cost over $2 billion, \nand over the course of a decade or more may well exceed $100 billion. \nWe add these new regulations to over $2 trillion worth of regulations \nalready on the books. The President is adding $10 billion worth of \nregulations every month, and we wonder--we have 14 million people out \nof work, 2 million new people out of work since this President took \noffice. Yet we continue to add regulation upon regulation.\n  So far this year President Obama has added $80 billion worth of new \nregulations. If this President is serious about job creation, he needs \nto cease and desist from adding new job-killing regulations. The vote \ntoday has nothing to do with repealing the Clean Air Act. I am sure we \nwill hear hysterics on the other side. We will hear from environmental \nextremists. But this has nothing to do with repealing the Clean Air \nAct. We have rules in place to control emissions from our utility \nplants. We are not arguing against that. In fact, we are arguing for \ncontinuing the same rules that have been in place for some time.\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\n  Over the decades our environment has become cleaner and cleaner. \nEmissions have gone down with each successive decade. We are simply \nasking that the clean air regulations already on the books stay in \nplace and that we do not make the regulations so onerous that we put \nutility plants out of business so we have an inability to supply \nelectricity to this country.\n  Over 50 percent of our electricity comes from coal-fired plants. If \nwe shut down the coal-fired plants or if we bankrupt them--as the \nPresident explicitly said in his campaign, that would be the desire of \nhis policies--if that should occur, be prepared for brownouts in our \nbig cities, be prepared for days when there will not be electricity, \nbut also be prepared for rising unemployment as these job-killing \nregulations put a stranglehold on the economy.\n  The question is, Can we have clean air and jobs? Absolutely. But to \nhave clean air and jobs we must have balance. We are at the point of \nbecoming so overzealous and of overreaching to such a great extent that \nwe are killing jobs. We are killing industry. We are going backwards in \ntime.\n  Before we add new regulations we must ask, Are the current \nregulations working? The answer is an unequivocal yes. Emissions from \nutility plants have been declining for decades. In fact, while coal-\nbased power has nearly doubled in the last several decades, emissions \nhave been reduced by 60 percent.\n  I need to repeat that because if we listen to the hysterics, we would \nthink otherwise. We would think the Statue of Liberty will shortly be \nunderwater and the polar bears are all drowning and that we are dying \nfrom pollution. It is absolutely and utterly untrue. All of the \nstatistics--and these are statistics from the EPA--all of the \nstatistics from government, from the EPA, show declining pollution. \nEverything about this argument shows that the environment has been \nimproving for decades. In fact, John Stossel has done a program on \nthis, and he asked fifth graders: Do you think the environment is \ncleaner now or 30 years ago? All of our schoolchildren have been \nbrainwashed by these environmental hysterics who say, oh, it is a lot \nworse now. It is actually much better now.\n  Here are some statistics. We are talking about regulating two \nemissions that come from utility plants. The first is sulfur dioxide. \nWe can see in the midst of the range, the average has been going down \nevery decade. We have reduced sulfur dioxide just in the last 6 years \nby 45 percent under the current regulations.\n  If we look at the nitrous oxides, which are also regulated under this \nseries of regulations, we can also see they have been in decline. The \nexisting rules are working. Nitrous oxides, which can create ozone, are \ndown 45 percent in the last 5 years. The existing rules are working. \nAll we are arguing for is that we not become overzealous, that we not \noverreach, that the regulators and the regulations not become job-\nkilling regulations. That is where we are headed.\n  This administration has proposed a series of radical changes to our \nenvironmental law. These are regulations that are being written by \nunelected bureaucrats in which we in Congress are not having a say. \nWhat I am asking for today is that Congress vote approval or \ndisapproval of these radical, extremist regulations, these job-killing \nregulations that are coming down the pike.\n  If we look at jobs and look at what will happen to jobs, we will see \nthat these regulations--simply this regulation alone--could cost as \nmuch as 50,000 jobs. Indirectly, the people who work for them who would \nbe losing their jobs. As much as 250,000 indirect jobs could be lost.\n\n  We do need to ask the important question: Are the existing \nregulations working or do we need to make the regulations more strict? \nThis is a balancing act. On the one hand we have our environment, which \nwe all care about. No matter what the other side will say, Republicans \ndo believe in clean air and clean water. But we also believe in jobs. \nIt is a balancing act in our country and in all of our communities to \ntry to have both jobs and a clean environment. But we have to look at \nthe facts. We cannot become hysterical and say the other side is for \npollution. That is the kind of stuff we are hearing.\n  We are all for clean air, we are all for clean water, and we are \nall--or we should all be for jobs. My concern is that the President has \nallowed radicals to take over the administration. He has allowed \nenvironmental extremists to take over policy. As a consequence, we are \nlosing jobs.\n  It is important to note that people think they will plug their \nelectric cars into the wall and that has nothing to do with coal. Fifty \npercent of our electricity comes from coal. Does that mean it is \nperfect? No. But we have to look at the emissions from coal-fired \nutilities. The emissions have been declining decade after decade.\n  While coal-fired power has nearly doubled in the last several \ndecades--we are having to produce more electricity from coal in the \nlast several decades--emissions have declined 60 percent. We are doing \na good job with the current rules. Let's not kill off industry. Let's \nnot kill off jobs. Let's not put our citizens at risk during the height \nof the summer and the height of a heat wave of not having electricity \nor during the height of cold waves in the winter of not having \nelectricity to heat their homes.\n  The alarmists, such as Al Gore and others, would have us believe \neverything is worse and the world is on the edge of some sort of \ncataclysm. If we allow them to control our debate, if we do not talk \nreasonably and rationally about the facts, if we do not look at the \nstatistics of what has been occurring to control emissions, we are not \ngoing to get anywhere. I am asking we base our discussion on rational \nfacts and not on emissions.\n  To give an idea of where some of these extremists are coming from, \nthere is one of them who is a prominent extremist in this debate. She \nhas called for a planetary law, whatever that is. She wants a planetary \nlaw of one child per family because she is worried about the carbon \nfootprint of the worst polluters in the whole world.\n  But who do we think the worst polluters in the world are? Humans, for \nbreathing. She says we have far too many breathers on the planet and \nthe way we reduce breathers on the planet is we will have one child per \nfamily mandated worldwide. We know how China does that.\n  I don't think we can let the debate get out of control. Today's \ndebate is about overreach. I would like to give an example. Think about \nwhat cities looked like in 1900. We have a picture of Pittsburgh, where \nI was born, in 1905, and then a picture of Pittsburgh today. You may \nnot be able to see the picture from the distance, but we can get an \nidea.\n  Throughout Pittsburgh it was smog and pollution. It was heavy. They \nsay at noon on a day in Pittsburgh you could go out and your white \nshirt would become black. They say at noon in Pittsburgh the street \nlanterns were on because you could not see through the smog and the \nsmoke.\n  Here is Pittsburgh today. We are not arguing for no rules. The rules \nwe have in place have been working. What we are arguing is not to let \nthe rules become so overzealous, so onerous, that we kill jobs and we \nkill industry.\n  We want a clean environment and jobs. We have to have a balanced \napproach, and we cannot let hysteria and environmental extremism take \nover our country. The West led the industrial revolution. Life \nexpectancy has doubled since the discovery of electricity. Childhood \ninfectious mortality has become one-hundredth of what it was before \nelectricity. For all the advances of civilization, there are advantages \nand there are disadvantages. As we have advanced from an industrial \nsociety, there have been problems, but we have been ironing out those \nproblems for 100 years now. We are doing a good job at that, and we \nshould not allow the regulations to become so onerous that we begin to \nlose jobs.\n\n  One of the other things people argue about and one of the big health \nconcerns they have with pollution is with regard to asthma. The \ninteresting thing is, if we look at all the statistics on all the \nemissions from our powerplants, all these declining lines are \nemissions. Emissions have been going down decade upon decade. The \nincidence of asthma has been rising. If we were looking at this chart, \nwe would say maybe emissions declining is inversely proportional to \nasthma. The other argument could be maybe they\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\nare not related at all, but they definitely are not proportional. We \nare not seeing rising incidents of asthma because we are having \nincreased pollution. We have decreased pollution and rising incidents \nof asthma. Either they are inversely proportional or not related at \nall.\n  This is an important point because what comes out of the hysteria of \nthe environmental extremists is--we will hear people stand and say half \na million people are going to die if this goes through. The Vice \nPresident recently said Republicans, because they didn't vote for his \njobs plan, were for murder and rape. The ridiculousness of these \nstatistics that are trotted out as truth should be spurned. We should \nthink about things calmly and rationally and decide: Can we have clean \nair and jobs? When we hear these statistics, let's be very careful not \nto get carried away.\n  Joel Schwartz has written about asthma and the environment and \npollution and he notes that: As air pollution declines, the asthma \nprevalence continues to rise. One possible conclusion is that air \npollution is not a cause of asthma or not even related. Every pollutant \nwe measure has been dropping for decades pretty much everywhere while \nasthma prevalence has been rising pretty much everywhere.\n  The other side will say, but the American Lung Association says \npollution is making asthma worse. You know what. The EPA actually gave \nthe American Lung Association $5 million, so I think their objectivity \nhas been somewhat tainted.\n  If we look at asthma incidence and we say: Where is asthma the worst, \ninterestingly, asthma is worse in the countries that have the lowest \nincidence of pollution and asthma is actually lowest in the countries \nthat have the highest evidence of pollution.\n  As we look through these statistics, we need to be concerned about \nthe costs of these new regulations. We need to be concerned about \nhaving balance between job creation and job-killing regulations. I am \nafraid what happened is we have opened the White House and this \nadministration to environmental extremists, the kind of people who say: \nThe polar bears are drowning. The whole thing on the polar bears \ndrowning was based on the sighting of two polar bears on an iceberg and \nthey all of a sudden maintain this. Once we start counting the polar \nbears, apparently they are not in decline.\n  So the statistics and hysteria over whether within 50 years the \nStatue of Liberty will be underwater, this is the kind of hysteria we \ndon't want to drive policy. It is the kind of hysteria that when our \nbrother-in-law is out of work and when 2 million new people are out of \nwork since this administration came into power, we need to be concerned \nabout regulatory overreach.\n  Another issue we are concerned about is what will happen with these \nnew regulations with electricity rates. We have a map that shows across \nthe United States what will happen. When we think about our electricity \nrates going up and the expense to this, think about who gets hit worse, \nthe working class and senior citizens on fixed incomes. They are the \nones who will suffer from rising electricity rates. It is the person \nwho depends only on their Social Security check and has no other means \nof supporting themselves and is trying to pay for their electricity.\n  In some regions, electricity could go up almost 20 percent with this \nseries of regulations this administration is proposing. This is \nthroughout the country. It is more in some areas than others, but it \nwill go up dramatically, and that is the danger of allowing these new \nregulations--what will happen to electric rates and will poor people in \nthe winter or heat of the summer be able to afford their electricity? \nThe cost of these regulations is real. The cost of these regulations \nwill be passed on to the consumer and there are significant dangers of \nthere being periods of times in large cities where there is not enough \nelectricity to go around and the electrical grid is overwhelmed.\n  As we go forward and as we begin to hear some of the hysteria that \nwill occur from the other side, be aware that what we are arguing for \nis not the elimination of regulations. We are arguing for continuing \nthe existing regulations, with the two emissions we are talking about \nhave declined significantly over decades. Sulfur dioxide has declined \nover 70 percent over the last three decades. Nitrous oxide has declined \nover 50 percent over the last several decades. So the question is, if \nwe are doing an adequate job, if we are doing a good job, if emissions \nare going down, why would we want to impose new rules that will cause \nloss of jobs and will cause an increase in rate of electrical costs?\n  If one is cynical, one of the reasons might be because the President \nwants to reward some of his campaign contributors; for example, \nSolyndra. The owners of Solyndra, which makes solar panels--or did. \nThey have now gone bankrupt after they ate up $500 million worth of our \nmoney. Perhaps this is more of a political argument that he doesn't \nlike certain industry but he likes other industry. So he is willing to \nspend our money, $500 million worth, on one company.\n  Solyndra went bankrupt recently, and $500 million is still a \nconsiderable amount of money. I will put that in perspective. In \nKentucky, we get over about $420 million to pave our roads annually out \nof the gas tax that we pay. There are 35 States that get about the same \namount, somewhere under $500 million. Yet the President saw fit--\nbecause he has been consumed with this environmental extremism--to give \n$500 million. That is more than 35 States get for their highway funds. \nHe saw fit to take that money and give it to one political contributor \nbecause he has decided he wants more expensive electricity. He wants \nelectricity that comes and is produced by people who have been his \ncampaign contributors.\n\n  As we look at adding these new regulations, these need to be put in \ncontext. We need to look at and seriously think about whether we want \nour country to be taken over by environmental extremists, whether we \nwant or care about can we have a clean environment and jobs. I think we \ncan have both. I think we can have clean air, clean water, and jobs, \nbut it will require a balanced approach. My fear is, if these \nregulations go forward, the balance will become imbalanced, that there \nwill be job-killing regulations that cause electrical rates to go up \nand cause us to have significantly more economic problems than we are \nalready in.\n  At this time, I call on my colleagues to consider supporting this \nresolution, which will be a disapproval of these new and onerous \nregulations, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, would the Chair let me know when I have \nused 5 minutes, and then I am going to yield to Senator Reed for up to \n8 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to be clear about this. If the Paul \nresolution passes--which I don't think it will, it is so extreme--\npeople in 38 States, 248 million people, will be adversely impacted \nwith filthy, dirty air.\n  In the Senator's own State of Kentucky, the prediction is, based on \nscience, that between 530 people and 1,400 people will succumb to \npremature death. So we are not talking about some political argument. \nWe are talking about the very life and death of the people we \nrepresent. I wish to thank Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, Lautenberg, \nShaheen, and Ayotte for already speaking out on the floor against the \nPaul resolution.\n  I hope we will have a big vote because we are dealing with the health \nof the people, with the health of the children, with the ability of \npeople to work--because if we cannot breathe, we cannot work--and we \nare dealing with jobs, many jobs, over 1 million jobs that are created \nas a result of clean technology.\n  Senator Paul insulted the people of America. There was a poll just \ntaken last month where 67 percent of voters support the cross-state air \npollution rule. That is 85 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of \nIndependents, and 48 percent of Republicans. Are they extremists? No. \nThey are mainstream. Are the groups who support this rule extremists?\n  I think the Senator owes an apology to the American Lung Association \nfor making it sound as if they are for air pollution rules because they \nare getting some kind of payoff. It is an outrage, a complete outrage. \nDoes he\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\nthink the National Association of County Health Officials is extremist? \nHe said the American Lung Association. He already attacked them. How \nabout the American Nurses Association, does he think they are \nextremists? Does he think President Richard Nixon was an extremist when \nhe signed the Clean Air Act and he said: ``Clean air, clean water, open \nspaces--these should once again be the birthright of every American.'' \nDoes he think Richard Nixon was an extremist?\n  Let's talk about what he wants to do. He wants to repeal a very \nimportant rule that is going to clean up the air, that is going to \nreduce toxic poison soot and smog-forming air pollution that impacts \nair quality for over 240 million people.\n  Let me say this. I know all 100 of us in this Chamber would condemn \nit if somebody took all their garbage and put it on the lawn of the \nnext-door neighbor. That is what this cross-air pollution rule is \nabout. It is about States that don't crack down on pollution. They have \nsmokestacks that blow the pollution into other States and they say: \nIsn't it wonderful? We don't have any problem here; it is your problem.\n  When I made this analogy, Senator Carper corrected me. He said: The \nSenator is right. It is a good analogy as far as it goes, but garbage \nis not usually poison. I will amend my analogy to say this: If we knew \nthat someone had garbage that included poison and they took that \ngarbage that included poison and put it on someone else's front lawn, \nthat would be a terrible thing to do, and it would be the moral \nresponsibility of that party to clean it up and not do it again. That \nis what this rule is about.\n  I wish to talk about specifics rather than be vague. This rule that \nSenator Paul seeks to cancel and repeal prevents up to 34,000 cases of \npremature death, 19,000 emergency room and hospital visits, 400,000 \ncases of aggravated asthma attacks, and 1.8 million lost work and \nschooldays. It is estimated to provide up to $280 billion in annual \nbenefits by 2014.\n  So all this flailing around of arms and calling people extremists \nsimply cannot erase the fact that what Senator Paul is doing is extreme \nand is hurtful to our people.\n  How many people feel good when they look at a child such as this who \nis desperately seeking air? Here is the exhaler, this plant, and here \nis her inhaler. Exhale from these dirty plants and inhale clean air.\n  It reminds me of a story I just read in the New York Times that talks \nabout China.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute, and then I will \nyield 8 minutes to Senator Reed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In China, the leaders there are arrogant and they are \nelitists and they surround themselves with air purifiers in their \noffices, in their homes, in the great hall of the people where they \nwork, which is opulent, but the rest of the people in China have to \nbreathe filthy, dirty air. In a recent trip there, our group did not \nsee the sun for 7 days.\n  ``Chinese leaders are largely insulated from Beijing's famously foul \nair.'' That is the story in the Times. ``The privileges of China's \nelites include purified air.'' Well, I don't think anybody ought to be \nable to insulate themselves from the quality of the air. We have to \nclean up the air for everybody, not just an elite few. So I think \nSenator Paul's resolution under the CRA should be soundly defeated.\n  At this time, I yield 8 minutes to Senator Jack Reed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator yielding, \nbut I think the custom is that we are going back and forth, if the \nSenator from California would like to finish her statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to address that, if I could for a \nmoment, for the benefit of Senator Coats. I was going to speak for a \nmuch longer block, but I didn't. I yielded the time to Senator Reed, \nand I retain the time I have. So I only did it because he was trapped \nin a hearing. But it is up to the Senators, however they want to \nproceed.\n  Mr. REED. I think if the Senator from California wishes to finish her \nstatement and then recognize Senator Coats, that would be appropriate. \nThat is the procedure. I think it is appropriate to alternate back and \nforth.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to do that. I will retain my time and yield to \nthe Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from California. I agree with the \nSenator from Rhode Island. If the Senator from California wants to \nfinish her time, I am happy to----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am retaining my time.\n  Mr. COATS. My understanding is that we are going back and forth, and \nI think we should stay with that order. So I appreciate the support of \nthe Senator from Rhode Island for that agreed-upon procedure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Paul's \nresolution. The word ``extreme'' has gotten thrown around here an awful \nlot. I just walked on the floor.\n  What is being sought here is not extreme. Under the Clean Air Act, \nthere have been extraordinary gains in terms of air pollution controls, \nand there have been hundreds of billions of dollars spent over the last \ncouple of decades to provide some much needed and much appreciated \nclean air all across the country. Are we 100 percent there yet? No. Are \nwe a long way toward getting there? Yes. The issue before us today is, \ncan we allow sufficient time for utilities that are spending these \nhundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars to continue the \nprocess of retrofitting their plants and providing energy to consumers \nand businesses at a reasonable rate.\n  In the Midwest where a lot of these plants exist--although this \ncovers 27 States--we make big stuff. We make cars and we make trains \nand we make automobiles and heavy machinery. It takes electricity to do \nthat. Our economy is not based on maple syrup or wine from Napa Valley, \nit is based on major, huge industries producing what America needs to \nmove people around and to create the kind of economy all of us have \nenjoyed. It also provides a lot of jobs. We have spent literally \nhundreds of billions of dollars in complying with Clean Air Act \nregulations, and we have come a long way.\n  There is nothing extreme to talk about here on either side, I \nbelieve, because the record speaks for itself. The question is, Do \nthese utilities that produce this energy needed to run this economy \nhave time to finish what they have started? Senator Paul has basically \nsaid: Look, this EPA rule basically says companies have until January \n1, and that is it.\n  I have a plant down on the Ohio River that is spending hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in retrofit, but they can't meet this deadline. \nThey are now in a position of having to decide whether to throw this \nmoney away and to waste everything they have already put in when they \nare halfway through the process or close the plant down completely.\n  Six plants will close down in Indiana, it is projected, with an \nincrease in utility rates not just to consumers but to our \nmanufacturers at the level of 20 to 25 to 30 percent. At a time when \nour economy is struggling, is this something we want to add, \nparticularly for an industry that is committed to going forward but \njust needs a little bit more time?\n  That is the purpose of this resolution before us, and I am hoping we \nwill take a reasonable view of the gains we have achieved over the \ndecades we have been at work, the clean air we have achieved, the \ncommitment to the final goal of the Clean Air Act but doing it in a \nreasonable timeframe in a cost-effective way that doesn't throw our \neconomy into a further level of distress in terms of the number of jobs \nwe need and the amount of money that has to be spent to achieve that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the proposal \nby Senator Paul to preempt the implementation of the cross-state air \npollution rule.\n  We recognize throughout this country our extraordinary employment\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nchallenges--in Rhode Island particularly but in every State. These are \nchallenging times. But our focus should not be on undermining \nprotections for the public health, rather our focus should be on job \ncreation, as the President has suggested through his jobs act. That is \nwhat we should be doing.\n  This is one of a series of proposals--and I have seen many of them as \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior--to \nessentially eviscerate the ability of the EPA to protect the health of \nthe country and its people.\n  What has struck me during these debates is that we are, in a way, \nvictims of our success. I am old enough to remember when the Cuyahoga \nRiver in Cleveland was on fire because there was no control, \neffectively, of what was being dumped into rivers and streams \nthroughout this country, and when clean air was something that was a \nsought-after goal, not a reality, in so many parts of the country.\n  We can look at the experience of the State of California, Senator \nBoxer's State. In 1976, there were regular health advisories because of \nthe poor air. But a combination of EPA regulations and California \nregulations has seen the average of these health alert days in which \nthe frail and elderly couldn't go outside, young children were advised \nnot to play outside, and it was very difficult to put up with the smog \nand the congestion, fall from an average of 173 days a year--half the \nyear--in the 1970s to about 6 days per year in the late 2000s. That \nwasn't an accident; that was because of effective implementation of the \nClean Air Act, which, as Senator Boxer pointed out, was spearheaded by \nPresident Nixon in the 1970s. This attempt by Senator Paul is one of \nmany attempts to reverse that progress on the assumption that things \nwill stay the same. No, they will get much worse, actually.\n  This rule has been carefully evaluated. It has been through several \ndifferent procedures and rulemaking processes. It has been estimated \neffectively and carefully that between 13,000 and 34,000 lives would be \nsaved that would otherwise be affected and shortened because of smog \nand soot pollution. This rule would help avoid 15,000 heart attacks, \n400,000 more asthma attacks, 19,000 hospital emergency room visits, all \nof that tremendous health cost. And indeed the estimated yearly costs \nto industry of about $2 billion to $3 billion pales in comparison to \nthe estimates of the benefits of between $120 billion to $280 billion \nif this rule goes into effect.\n  The essence of this rule effectively, though, as Senator Boxer also \nsuggests, makes us all better neighbors. We have a 10-percent \nunemployment rate in Rhode Island, and we do not specialize in wine or \nmaple syrup. We used to be a manufacturing center. Manufacturing \nrequires electricity. We have very high electricity costs. Why? Because \nour State has to compensate for the pollution coming from these other \nStates. This is a tax. The present situation, without this rule, is a \ntax on small business, and particularly manufacturing, in Rhode Island. \nWe want a rule that requires the polluters to pay the full cost of \ntheir pollution, so if it is emanating from the Midwest and being \ntransported to Rhode Island, those people creating it should be paying \nfor it. That is the way the market should work. We are paying for it. \nWe are effectively subsidizing lower electricity rates in parts of this \ncountry that are taking jobs from Rhode Island. It is not only unfair, \nit is bad policy.\n  In Rhode Island specifically, only 5 percent of ozone pollution is \nfrom local or instate sources--5 percent. Ninety-five percent comes \nfrom outside of our borders, particularly the Midwest. It is \ntransported. That is at the heart of this rule--to give us a chance not \nonly to protect ourselves and to control our own pollution but to not \nbe subject to the additional cost as this pollution moves across the \ncountry.\n  We are in a situation where we are essentially being imposed upon \ndramatically, and this rule will try to strike the proper balance. It \nwill try to incentivize those producers of pollution to prevent the \npollution. It will let us be more competitive. It will allow us to go \nahead and essentially have a much more level playing field when it \ncomes to what we are all talking about: creating jobs.\n  It is awfully tough to go up to Rhode Island and look at businesses \nthat are making progress and being told that one of the key costs is \nelectricity and one of the key factors driving up those costs is all of \nthe pollution control that we have to put in place, not because of what \nwe are generating, but because 95 percent of our pollution is coming \nfrom other States.\n  This rule makes sense in every dimension, and I think to undercut \nthis rule would do a great injustice to the health of the American \npublic and the economic potential of States throughout this country.\n  Let me say something else too. I think we often see this erroneously \nas a one-sided cost: Oh, these polluters, these utilities are going to \nhave to put all of these controls on. Well, guess what, they are hiring \nskilled American workers to put in place products that I hope are \nproduced in America. All that contributes to our economy.\n  So for many different reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nrule. It is efficient. It is effective. It will actually help our \neconomy. It will certainly help the quality of life for Americans in \nthose States that are suffering from the pollution of other States, and \nthat are essentially paying for the pollution of States throughout the \ncountry. If the winds were blowing another way, I daresay many of my \ncolleagues would be standing up and arguing exactly the opposite.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7314, November 10, 2011, the record reads: . . . my \ncolleagues to oppose this rule. It is . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . my \ncolleagues to oppose this resolution. The rule is . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Senator Paul's \nwork to avail himself of and make use of the Congressional Review Act \nwhich establishes a process for Congress to review and nullify \nunwarranted Federal regulations.\n  The Congressional Review Act process is rarely used--only \nsuccessfully on one other occasion since it was created in 1996--but it \nis a legitimate process, and it is of increasing importance today. This \nis an opportunity for Members of Congress, who are concerned that \nregulations are taking over the country, to try to see some of those \nunwarranted regulations pulled back. It is an opportunity for people to \nprove they mean what they say when they say that.\n  The Heritage Foundation published a chart identifying the ``Obama \nRegulation Tsunami.'' Heritage identified 144 new regulations that were \npending in 2011--this year. All of those were expected to cost more \nthan $100 million--all of them. In 2006, there were 69 such regulations \npending. The average number of rules over $100 million pending during \n2001 through 2006 was about 72. Now, during this administration, the \naverage number is not 72; it is about 130. That is an 80-percent \nincrease in the number of pending regulations with costs over $100 \nmillion. So this is a tsunami of costly regulations falling on our \neconomy.\n  Senator Paul's resolution seeks to nullify just one of the EPA rules \naimed at reducing the use of affordable coal-fired powerplants in 27 \nspecific States, including my State of Alabama.\n  The rule will increase power bills for people and businesses. There \nis a range of other new EPA rules that will raise the price of \nelectricity in addition to that rule. This increases the cost of doing \nbusiness, and it makes our businesses less competitive and results in \njob losses.\n  Higher energy costs make American businesses less competitive and \nless able to create jobs and more likely to invest in other countries \nthan in this country. In an EPW hearing--the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee--last month, we heard testimony that over 180,000 jobs \nwill be lost each year--each year, 180,000 jobs--from 2012 through 2020 \nas a result of just 4 EPA rules that impact the electric utility \nsector--just the electric utility sector. One of those four rules is \nthe Cross-State Air Pollution Rule that Senator Paul's resolution \naddresses. This is net jobs lost. The evaluation takes into account \nalleged job gains from the four rules.\n  Together, the four rules would result in $21 billion in annual \ncompliance costs and raise residential energy prices by 12 percent in \nAlabama and even more in other States. A 12-percent increase in \nresidential energy costs is significant. These are working people. If \nyour bill is $150 a month, it is now\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\ngoing to be $168 a month. If it is a $200 bill, it is going to be $224 \na month. That is real money and for gaining not one thing that adds to \nthe productivity of a business or a residence. It is a really \nsignificant cost.\n  Do not think it does not fall on people. We have gotten our mind set \nin Washington that we can impose a rule and it has costs on businesses \nbut it does not cost us. But in truth, it is the equivalent of a tax. \nFor example, if the government wanted to clean up the air, we could tax \nthe American people, use that money to go to all the powerplants, add \nextra costly techniques to it, and clean up the air that way. That \nwould be a tax. We would have to defend that to the American people. We \nwould have to justify that this cost we have extracted from them \nthrough increased taxes was worth the benefit. But we can wash our \nhands of it, the way we do business today. We simply pass a law that \nmandates that these businesses do that, and we pretend it does not \nimpose costs. But the experts say these rules will result in a 12-\npercent increase in utility rates in Alabama alone. Those are my \npeople--working-class people, middle-class people, poor people who have \nto have electricity.\n  An analysis of all the new EPA rules impacting the electric utility \nsector is even more astounding. Southern Company, which operates in the \nSoutheast, estimates that the capital costs of complying with the full \nrange of proposed EPA rules for coal-fired electric generation would be \nbetween $12 billion and $15 billion. Costs for Alabama Power, which \nprovides electric power for much of our State, are estimated to be \nbetween $5 billion and $7 billion. Alabama's general fund budget, not \ncounting education, is $2 billion. This adds to one power company $5 \nbillion to $7 billion in costs. The President and Senate Democrats like \nto talk about raising taxes on the rich, but their regulations are, in \neffect, a huge tax increase on everyone, poor and rich alike, in the \nform of higher energy prices and fewer job opportunities. With \nunemployment at 9 percent, we need to ask ourselves, Can we afford this \nkind of increase now?\n  Nucor Steel pointed out in recent testimony that a 1 cent per \nkilowatt hour increase in the electricity they buy to make steel would \nadd $120 million in costs to their company. That was the testimony they \ngave a few weeks ago at an EPW hearing.\n  But let's talk for a moment about the specific rule Senator Paul's \nresolution would nullify. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule mandates \nthat 27 States reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions by 20 percent by \n2012 and nitrogen oxide, NOX, emissions by 50 percent by \n2014. Remember, we already brought down emissions of NOX and \nsulfur dioxide significantly. Our air is cleaner in virtually every \ncity in America than it was just a few years ago and much cleaner than \nit was 20 or 30 years ago. We can be thankful that Congress mandated \nthat. And there certainly were objections raised at that time. It did \nimpose costs, as said, but it also has helped clean our air. That is a \nfact. But I would just say this to you: The lower hanging fruit has \nalready been achieved. America's electric utility industry is operating \nmore efficiently and more effectively today than ever. But a 50-percent \nreduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by 2014? An additional 20-percent \nreduction of sulfur dioxide by next year? Utilities will be forced to \neither install expensive technologies such as scrubbers or shut down \ntheir units.\n  This rule, in combination with other new EPA rules, will be the nail \nin the coffin for a lot of coal-fired powerplants. They will just \nclose. It will also close coal mines where we produce American energy--\nnot imported energy, American energy. In Texas, one of the State's \nlargest power producers, Luminant, has said the rule would result in \n500 job losses due to the closing of units at one of its coal-fired \nplants and the closing of three nearby coal mines.\n\n  There are serious concerns about the new Cross-State Air Pollution \nRule. Over 70 parties have challenged it in Federal court, including \nAlabama's attorney general, Luther Strange, a fine attorney general who \nworks hard every day for the people of Alabama. So have his colleagues \nin Kansas, Texas, Nebraska, Florida, Oklahoma, South Carolina, \nVirginia, Georgia, Louisiana, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan. \nMany labor unions are opposing the rule. They know it will hurt jobs.\n  Before concluding, let me say this: EPA is too often using scare \ntactics and statistics to push its regulatory agenda. I think that is \ndangerous. One reason we have seen such a surge in EPA regulations is \nbecause in 1 year they got a 35-percent increase in their budget--more \nthan virtually any other agency in Washington.\n  EPA claims their Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, for example, is \nnecessary to prevent up to 34,000 premature deaths per year--34,000. \nEPA is actually claiming that without this rule, 34,000 people would \ndie each year. But EPA's basis for this assertion is fundamentally \nflawed.\n  First, EPA assumes in its baseline that existing rules are not in \nplace to protect public health. That is absolutely not true. The Bush \nadministration issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule that requires \nreductions in the same emissions targeted by this new rule. I am told \nsulfur dioxide emissions are already down more than 40 percent over the \nlast decade. The same is true for NOX emissions. This new \nCross-State Rule would add even more layers of requirements on top of \nexisting protections and rules, but EPA does not acknowledge that when \nthey do their analysis of the casualties they find. That is the first \nway they overstate the benefits.\n  Second, EPA assumes in its baseline that 320,000 deaths per year in \nthe United States are attributed to particulate matter pollution from \nsources like powerplants. That would be more than 10 percent of all \ndeaths in the United States in a year. Are we to believe that 10 \npercent of all U.S. deaths are attributable to pollution from \npowerplants? We have taken extensive testimony in the EPW Committee on \nthis topic, and it is clear that EPA is playing fast and loose, and \nthey are manipulating data, it seems to me pretty clearly. EPA is \noverstating the benefits of their rules.\n  Third, EPA does not seem concerned about establishing any direct \ncause-and-effect relationship; they just rely on statistical \nrelationships. A simple statistical correlation alone does not support \na causal connection. For instance, a statistical correlation between \nice cream sales and heatstroke does not mean there is a causal \nconnection between them. On hot days, more ice cream is consumed. More \npeople have heatstrokes on hot days. That does not mean there is a \ncause-and-effect relationship between the two.\n  So let me conclude by saying this: This administration is \noverregulating our economy. It is raising the price of energy. These \ncosts and regulations are costing us jobs.\n  They are using scare tactics to justify their rules with dubious \nstatistics. I know my colleagues will say these statistics are \naccurate, but I do not believe that these statistics that are coming \nout of EPA, our government environment and protection agency--the \nagency we depend on for honesty and integrity--can be defended as \naccurate. They are exaggerated, and it will be shown sooner or later \nthat is a fact.\n  I know we want to have cleaner air. We are on a path to having \ncleaner air. We have been reducing NOX and SOX \nand particulates for years. We can continue to do that. But to talk \nabout a 50-percent reduction in NOX by 2014 and a 20-percent \nreduction in SOX by next year--these are huge changes. After \nthe low-hanging fruit has already been achieved, I do not believe that \nis justified, and I do not believe it should be pressed down on the \nbrow of an economy that is struggling mightily to get off the mat and \nbegin to grow again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if my colleague would withhold for just 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  I would like to make a quick point before my colleague, Senator \nSessions, leaves the floor.\n  I want to first of all thank the Senator very much for working with \nus in the EPW Committee. As I said to the Senator privately, in our \ncommittee,\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\nwhen it comes to infrastructure, we are all very closely tied, and we \nsupport each other. When it comes to the environment, we see things \ndifferently.\n  I want to say to my friend who is very wise in many ways, I do not \nknow why he would question--he has a total right to question the EPA's \nassertion--that if we pass the Rand Paul repeal, it would result in \n34,000 premature deaths. I want to point out he is not a cardiovascular \nspecialist or a lung specialist. Neither am I. But I think it is \nimportant to rely on those who are, such as the American Association of \nCardiovascular Pulmonary Rehab, the American Association of Respiratory \nCare, the College of Preventive Medicine, the Lung Association, the \nNurses Association, and I will not go on because I only have 1 minute. \nBut I will list these. I would hope we would look to these groups \nbecause I do not know of anyone in this body who is a specialist in \ncardiovascular or lung conditions. And these groups oppose the Paul \nresolution because they think people will get ill and they will die \nprematurely.\n  I yield 8 minutes to Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BROWN of Ohio). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Boxer has done a great job of moving the \nlegislation in committee. I have enjoyed her leadership in committee \nand the collegial way she has conducted the committee.\n  I will say to Senator Boxer that the 320,000 number is not correct. \nEPA should not be using it. We will challenge that. I intend to look at \nthat more, and if they are wrong, I will expect them to acknowledge \nthey are wrong. I believe they are wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe I have 8 minutes. I would ask \nthe Chair to let me know when I have 1 minute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Kentucky wants to overturn a clean \nair rule which would limit the amount of soot and ozone, the pollution \nthat causes smog, from blowing from Kentucky and other states into \nTennessee or that blows from Tennessee into North Carolina. This is no \nsolution to a serious problem.\n  I want to give the four reasons why I am going to vote no, and why I \nbelieve Senator Pryor of Arkansas and I have a better solution, which \nis to put the rule into law and give the utilities enough time to \ncomply with it.\n  Reason No. 1, auto jobs. The first thing Nissan did when it came to \nTennessee 30 years ago was to go down to the Air Quality Board and get \nan air quality permit so it could operate its paint plant. Fortunately, \nour air was clean enough to allow that to happen. Nissan came, and so \ndid tens of thousands of jobs. If it had not gotten the permit, the \njobs would not be there.\n  Volkswagen has come to Tennessee. We want to make sure its suppliers \ncan get an air quality permit so they do not have to go to other \nStates. So the first reason we need to stop air from blowing into \nTennessee from other States is auto jobs.\n  Second, the Sevier County Chamber of Commerce, right next to the \nGreat Smoky Mountains--that is where Dolly Parton grew up--I walk in to \nsee them, and they say their No. 1 goal is clean air. That is because 9 \nmillion tourists come to see the Great Smoky Mountains, not the Great \nSmoggy Mountains. This is not a group or a hotbed of liberal \nregulators. These are the most Republican counties in Tennessee. Where \nI come from, which is the next county over, we have not elected a \nDemocrat to Congress since Abraham Lincoln was President, but we like \nto breathe clean air. Our tourists do as well.\n  Tourist jobs are the second reason I am going to vote against the \nPaul amendment and why I support the Alexander-Pryor amendment.\n  Three, the American Lung Association tells us that dirty air blowing \ninto Tennessee makes us unhealthier. It causes some of us to die, \nespecially children and our older citizens. No. 4, this is no solution. \nIt has no chance of succeeding. It will not pass the Senate. The \nPresident will veto it if it does. And what will it do? It will throw \nit back to bureaucrats and lawyers and bureaucracy and uncertainty and \ndelay. That is not a solution. So the only reason for it is as a \npolitical message. What kind of message is it, that we favor dirty air \nblowing from Kentucky into Tennessee or Tennessee into North Carolina? \nThat we favor not doing our job, but turning it back to bureaucrats, \nlawyers, uncertainty and delay? That is not a solution.\n  If we want a message amendment, there are many better choices. The \nObama administration, particularly the EPA, is a happy hunting ground \nof unreasonable regulations. There is the boiler MACT rule, which must \nhave been created on another planet. There is the cement MACT rule, \nwhich would increase the amount of pollution in the air. There is the \nozone rule, which the President himself had to withdraw. There is the \npower plants coolant rule, which seems to have no benefits. There is \neven talk of a farm dust rule, which Senator Johanns is talking about. \nSo why aren't we talking about those rules instead of a proposal to \nmake it easier for dirty air to blow into our State, make us \nunhealthier, drive away tourists, and cost us auto jobs? The Senator \nfrom Kentucky says it will cost. His sources say 2 percent. The \nTennessee Valley Authority, the largest public utility in the country, \nsays it is $1 to $2 a month--$1 to $2 a month. That is a reasonable \ncost for what we are getting.\n  TVA has said they are closing 18 coal-fired units, but will continue \nto operate 38 coal-fired units. They are putting pollution control \nequipment on all of them. That means we are healthier, that means more \njobs, that means more tourists. The Senator from Kentucky says \nemissions are declining. That is true, except in Kentucky they are not \ndeclining. Soot went up by 20,000 tons in Kentucky, according to the \nEPA, between 2009 and 2010. Some of that might blow into Tennessee, \ndrive away jobs, drive away tourists, and make us unhealthy.\n\n  The Bush administration had a similar rule to this in 2005. That rule \nrequired nearly identical reductions in these two pollutants. Utilities \nhave known since that time--for 6 years--these reduction were coming. \nMost utilities, like TVA, have complied with it or are beginning to \ncomply with it. If we overturn the rule, it is no solution at all. I am \nready for Congress to step up and accept its responsibility and do its \njob.\n  Someone said to me: Is that part of your new independence? No. I have \nhad bipartisan clean air legislation in this Congress every year since \nI have been here, because I think it is our job, not the bureaucrats' \njob. I was elected to work on jobs and health, not pass the buck to the \nbureaucrats and lawyers. So I invite my colleagues to join Senator \nPryor and me. Let's put the rule into law. Let's give utilities enough \ntime to comply. They do not have to comply on January 1, 2012. They \nhave to comply 15 months after that in March 2013. We would extend it \nthat time another year giving them two years to comply.\n  We are going to have a President elected next year. Whoever it is, \nhis or her EPA will write new rules for communities across the country \nabout how clean their air needs to be. If we make it harder for them to \ndo their job, by allowing dirty air to blow into Nashville and \nChattanooga and Memphis and Knoxville from other States, then when \nVolkswagen suppliers come to the State office to get their clean air \npermit, they will not get it, and those jobs will go somewhere else.\n  There is a lot I admire about our neighbors in Kentucky, including \ntheir two distinguished Senators. But I do not want their dirty air \nblowing into Tennessee. And I know North Carolina does not want our \ndirty air blowing into North Carolina, because they have been suing us \nfor several years about it.\n  The American people are tired of messaging. I want to see the Great \nSmoky Mountains, not the Great Smoggy Mountains. I want tourists to \ncome to Tennessee, admire the mountains, and leave their money. I want \nthe Volkswagen suppliers to be able to locate their plants in \nTennessee. I want all Tennesseans to be able to grow up healthy and not \nhave to worry about\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\ndirty air blowing in from other parts of the country.\n  The Alexander-Pryor amendment would limit that dirty air. It would \nhelp our communities. It would make us healthier. It will create jobs. \nLet's do our job. I ask my colleagues to vote no on the Paul amendment \nand become a cosponsor of the Alexander-Pryor amendment to clean up the \nair and do it in a way that helps utilities provide electricity at the \nlowest possible cost to the ratepayer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMenendez go for 5 minutes and Senator Blunt for 10 minutes following \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to support the cross-State \nair pollution rule that protects downwind eastern States such as New \nJersey from upwind power pollution plants' dirty air, and I rise in \ndefense of the lives and the breathable air of the people of New \nJersey, all 9 million plus.\n  Last week I asked the Governor of my State to join this fight. After \nall, this rule is supported by the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and \nour largest utility, because it is good for business. They know it is \nonly fair to level the playing field for New Jersey businesses, since \nwe have already substantially cleaned up our electric generation \nfacilities. We are meeting our obligations.\n  The rule is supported by just about everyone in the public health \ncommunity because it will save an estimated 1,200 lives per year in New \nJersey beginning in 2014. Nationally, it will save up to 34,000 lives, \nprevent 400,000 asthma attacks, and avoid 1.8 million lost sick days \nper year starting in 2014.\n  The economic benefits of this rule are estimated to reach anywhere \nfrom $120 billion to $280 billion each year. We are all focused like a \nlaser beam on the economy, as we should be, on jobs and their creation, \nas we should be, on reducing deficits and looking at the bottom line. \nBut this rule does not create or force a choice between trying to grow \nthis economy, creating jobs, and reducing deficits. It is a good rule \nfor the economy. It is a good rule for the health and well-being of \nAmericans, particularly those downwind from the toxic emissions of \npowerplants.\n  Let's be clear. Corporate coal powerplants enjoy an enormous subsidy \nthat we are trying to repeal with this rule. Those polluters can \nprematurely end 34,000 lives per year and not have to pay anything for \nthat loss, not have to pay anything for the health care costs of all of \nthose who are afflicted at the end of the day by this dirty air. But \nyet that cost is borne by all of us at the end of the day. To put \n34,000 lives in perspective, that is almost as many American lives as \nare claimed by breast cancer every year. So I ask my colleagues to join \nwith me and others in voting against the Paul resolution. It is a vote \nfor saving 34,000 lives per year. There are few times in this Chamber \nwhere you can actually cast a vote that will save a life. This is one \nof those moments.\n  Vote for over $120 billion in economic benefits. Vote for cleaner \nair. Let us bequeath to future generations of Americans not air in our \nNation that is dirty but air that is cleaner. Vote for keeping our \nchildren healthy. You know, the number of asthma attacks growing in \nthis country is enormous. Certainly in my home State, respiratory \nailments are on the rise. The last thing we need to do is to nullify \nthe ability to create cleaner air at the end of the day. It is time for \nus to all see this as an opportunity to ultimately make a difference. \nIt is a time for us all to see this disapproval resolution for what it \nis, a path for polluting industries that make us sick without paying \nfor the cost it creates. To me, that is the ultimate corporate welfare. \nLet us join together in defeating this short-sighted resolution.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nCalifornia, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there was a time when strong bipartisan \nmajorities in Congress sided with the interests and views of the \nAmerican people about curbing pollution to safeguard the public's right \nto a clean and healthy environment. Citizens placed their trust in the \ngovernment to act on their behalf, to set science-based health \nstandards to protect the air we breathe. On both sides of the aisle, \nthere was an understanding that a healthy environment was critical to \nour families, our livelihoods, our economy, and our Nation. To improve \nthe Nation's air quality, Congress almost unanimously passed the Clean \nAir Act in 1970, under President Richard Nixon. Congress then passed \nthe 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, again with overwhelming majorities \nin both Chambers, under President George H.W. Bush.\n  As part of the 1990 Amendments, Congress specifically required the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, to address emissions that \ninterfere with another State's ability to protect public health through \nair quality requirements. Yet today we still lack the appropriate \npollution limits necessary to protect each and every American from \ndrifting smog and soot pollutants, and to protect States from bearing \nthe health and economic costs of distant polluters who are far beyond \ntheir purview. With the cross-State air pollution rule, the EPA is \ndoing exactly what we in Congress asked them to do. This is also \nexactly what the courts told them to do, and exactly what they should \ndo to protect the American public from the hundreds of thousands of \ntons of pollutants emitted each year from coal-fired powerplants.\n  These pollutants all too often reach unsafe levels, resulting in air \nquality alerts and dangerous health consequences--all the more so for \nyoung children, the elderly, and those who already have respiratory \nproblems. My own wife Marcelle is a nurse, and she knows from \nexperience how harmful air pollution can be in contributing to asthma, \nbronchitis, heart attacks, and even death.\n  This cross-State rule will protect the American people from dangerous \nair pollution pumped into our air by the largest polluters. These are \nsensible, workable limits that would tangibly improve Americans' lives. \nThese are improvements that would foster a better economy by annually \npreventing up to 34,000 premature deaths, 15,000 heart attacks, 19,000 \nemergency room visits, 400,000 aggravated asthma cases and 1.8 million \nsick days.\n  By 2014, in Vermont alone, the health benefits will add up to $360 \nmillion each year from these improvements. These changes are literally \na matter of life and death for many Americans. For example, studies \nshow that in our state, curbing smog and soot pollution will allow 44 \nVermonters to celebrate another birthday and live to see the next \ngeneration of children and grandchildren thrive. In States like \nKentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the cross-State \nrule will save as many as 1,400 to 3,200 lives each year. That is a lot \nof parents, children, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.\n  However, S.J. Res. 27 would void the life-saving, health-promoting \ncross-State air pollution rule and prohibit any future attempt by the \nEPA to limit unsafe levels of air pollutants that drift across state \nboundaries--making it one of the all-time most harmful and egregious \nattacks on the Clean Air Act and on the health of the people we \nrepresent. If passed, this resolution would force the EPA to ignore \ndangerous, drifting emissions forever, compelling Americans to accept \nshorter lives, to accept the risk of heart attacks and strokes, to \nsuffer with asthma and other serious illnesses, and to accept the \ndegraded quality of the Nation's parks, waterways, and forests. Those \nare not things that I am willing to accept and no Member of the Senate \nshould support.\n  Powerful special interests and their allies who want to overturn the \ncross-State rule are asking Americans to suffer to save the economy, \nbut their economic arguments fall flat in the face of the evidence. The \ntruth is, nothing will sink the economy more than degrading our \nenvironment and poisoning our workforce. Pollution regulations help to \nlower health care costs, maintain worker productivity, and support \nlocal economies through recreational industries. The cross-State rule \nwill have national benefits of up to $280 billion annually. This dwarfs \nthe annual compliance costs of about $800 million in 2014, which helps \nexplain why most Americans believe that health-based\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\npollution standards are essential in safeguarding our families and our \neconomy.\n  For decades, evidence has shown that pollution limits fuel spending \nand create jobs in producing, installing and monitoring control \ntechnology and emissions. In fact, utilities have already spent $1.6 \nbillion installing pollution controls to meet current air quality \nrequirements and anticipated requirements under the cross-State rule. \nFurthermore, powerplants have already achieved more than two-thirds of \nthe pollution reductions necessary to comply with the cross-State \nstandards that go into full effect in 2014. Studies already show that \nthe EPA's proposed air toxics rule and cross-State rule combined will \ncreate almost 1.5 million jobs over the next 5 years.\n  Undoing this rule now will nullify, or potentially even reverse, \nthese important pollution reductions. It will also harm the many \nbusinesses that have made investments in clean air technologies, while \nperversely rewarding those plants that refused to make the sensible, \nlong-term investments required by a rule that is nearly a decade in the \nmaking.\n  Vermont has no coal-fired powerplants, but we do have people \nsuffering with asthma and other respiratory illnesses, and we do have \nan economy that depends on the health of our environment. In Vermont, \nwe have made, and continue to make, decisions to invest in clean fuels \nand technologies. We do this because we value good health and family, \nfriends, and the outdoors. We do this to preserve the quality of life a \nhealthy environment provides us. We do this so that future generations \nhave access to clean air and all the benefits that come with healthy, \nvibrant communities. But without the cross-State rule, we are powerless \nto fully protect our Green Mountain State.\n  Reckless decisions regarding public health policy, especially in such \na broad manner as this resolution, should not be fast-tracked through \nthe Congressional Review Act process. This resolution goes much too \nfar, putting people permanently at risk by rolling back decades of \nprogress to make the air we breathe safer for each and every American, \nespecially for our children and seniors. The Clean Air Act has a proven \nrecord of improving public health, the environment, and our economy. \nThe cross-State air pollution rule is in keeping with that impressive \nrecord: These standards are conservatively estimated to produce net \nbenefits exceeding $100 billion a year. With today's spiraling health \ncare costs, this is a cost-effective way to help control harmful \npollution, save lives and foster a healthy environment and economy for \nfuture generations. I oppose S.J. Res. 27 and encourage my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose Senator Paul's resolution \nof disapproval of the Environmental Protection Agency's, EPA, cross-\nState air pollution rule because I believe that it is an extreme \nmeasure that is anti-clean air and water, anti-jobs and business, anti-\npublic health, and could potentially prevent EPA from protecting the \npublic from cross-state pollution indefinitely.\n  EPA finalized the cross-State air pollution rule on July 2011, \nestablishing a cost effective program to reduce sulfur dioxide and \nnitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fired powerplants that negatively \naffect citizens in downwind States. The rule updates a 1997 Clean Air \nAct standard and replaces a 2008 standard that was struck down by the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Because this rule replaces the vacated rule from the D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, if this resolution succeeds, by law EPA will not be \nable to issue a ``substantially similar'' rule, which means that \nsupporting this resolution could prohibit EPA indefinitely from \npromulgating any rule to control cross state air pollution. This would \nbe an enormous step backwards.\n  Contrary to what those who support this Resolution would like you to \nbelieve, the cross-State air pollution rule is a very reasonable \nregulation. By 2014, EPA estimates this Rule will yield up to $280 \nbillion in annual health and environmental benefits, far outweighing \nthe $800 million in annual projected costs. EPA worked closely with \nindustry and specifically designed this rule to give powerplants \nmaximum flexibility and keep compliance costs low. Not implementing \nthis rule would mean that local businesses in many Eastern States would \nhave to turn to more expensive, less cost efficient controls to meet \nair pollution standards.\n  Also contrary to what those who support this resolution are saying, \nthe cross-State rule would mean more certainty, not less, for business. \nPowerplants have known this rule was coming for years, and getting rid \nof it would create serious uncertainly by throwing the issue back to \nthe courts and reopening it to lawsuits. This could mean years of \ncontinued uncertainty for companies who won't know what standards they \nwill be held to. The cross-State rule gives power plants the certainty \nthey need.\n  The cross-State air pollution rule also creates jobs. The University \nof Massachusetts's Political Economy Research Institute estimates that \nthis rule and EPA's other recent clean air rule--the Air Toxics MACT--\ntogether will create nearly 300,000 jobs a year on average over the \nnext 5 years. In fact, thanks to environmental regulations under the \nClean Air Act, since 1970, we have created millions of jobs in \npollution control and environmental technologies industries, and the \nUnited States exports tens of billions of dollars of pollution control \ntechnologies annually. Using a term often thrown around these days, \nSenator Paul's resolution would be ``job killing.''\n  Most importantly, nullifying this rule will have significant and \nimmediate negative public health effects, especially for our children, \nseniors, and other vulnerable populations. In Massachusetts alone, the \ncross-State rule it is expected to avoid up to 390 deaths each year and \nresult in up to $3.2 billion of annual health and environmental \nbenefits. Nationally, by 2014, each year it will prevent up to 34,000 \npremature deaths, 15,000 nonfatal heart attacks, 19,000 hospital and \nemergency room visits, 1.8 million days of missed work or school, \n400,000 cases of aggravated asthma, and the list goes on.\n  These are not just statistics; these are real children who have to \nsit on the sidelines during a soccer game or are up wheezing late at \nnight and making emergency trips to the hospital; laborers who can't \nfinish a shift because of respiratory problems; senior citizens whose \nquality of life is dramatically diminished because they must be \nattached to a respirator 24 hours a day; and so many more. I recently \nheard the story of 6-year-old Mia Murphy in Massachusetts whose mother, \nRachael Murphy, lives in fear of her daughter's next asthma attack. \nOnly 6 years old, Mia can have coughing fits that last for hours. It is \nterrifying for both Mia and her mother when Mia can't breathe. Mia \nneeds to take daily medication to control her asthma, but when she has \na flare up, only a 5-day course of high dosage steroids can relieve her \nsymptoms. While these steroid courses help, they also cause Mia to have \nnightmares and emotional outbursts. For Mia, a normal cold can cause a \nflareup for weeks. As Mia's mother says, ``Children rely on us to keep \nthem safe.'' All children have a right to clean air. With other \ncitizens in Massachusetts, Rachael has bravely spoken out to support \nefforts like the cross-State rule to improve the air quality in \nMassachusetts to help keep her children healthy. Without this rule, \nMassachusetts and other Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States will not be \nable to control air pollution in the region at a level that protects \nthe public health of our citizens.\n  Forty years of the Clean Air Act have proven that environmental \nprotection and economic growth go hand in hand. The American people \nsupport the Clean Air Act because they know it has improved our \nNation's air quality and protected public health. S.J. Res. 27 would \nundermine this progress at the expense of America's most vulnerable \npopulations. We cannot in good conscious let it pass.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will oppose the motion to proceed to \nSenator Rand Paul's resolution that would disapprove of the cross-State \nair pollution rule promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  EPA's cross-State air pollution rule, also known as ``CSAPR,'' \nrequires reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that \ncontribute to smog and fine particle pollution in downwind areas. To \nminimize costs, EPA allows trading\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\nof air pollution permits and also provides flexibility to States for \nimplementing the rule.\n  The State of Michigan, in particular west Michigan, has air quality \nproblems due to pollution from areas such as Chicago, Milwaukee, and \nGary. Poor air quality not only causes a variety of health problems, \nsuch as asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory ailments, but also has \na detrimental impact on economic development and job creation. It \nsimply makes no sense for a region to be penalized with pollution and \nrequirements that could limit economic growth when the source of \npollution comes from outside of that region. For that reason, I support \nthe goal of the EPA rule.\n  I am pleased that EPA's cross-State air pollution rule is expected to \nhelp some Michigan counties meet the national air quality standards for \nsmog and fine particulate matter. However, I am concerned that the rule \ndoes not appear to adequately address a number of air pollution \nproblems in west Michigan caused by out of State sources. In 2014, \nAllegan County is projected to not be able to meet the national air \nquality standard for smog, even though Allegan County is not the source \nof the pollution. In fact, a 2009 EPA study concluded that smog levels \nin Allegan County and other areas in west Michigan are primarily due to \ntransport of smog and smog-forming emissions from other major urban \nareas outside of Michigan. It is unfair for Allegan County--or any \nother county--to be penalized due to pollution sources outside of their \ncontrol. This rule fails to remedy the kind of unfair situation Allegan \nCounty finds itself in.\n  The Rand Paul disapproval resolution would not only overturn the EPA \nregulation but any substantially similar rule. The rule can be \nimproved, e.g., establishing better linkages between the source of \npollution and downwind poor air quality, and adjusting the upwind \nemission requirements accordingly, but enactment of this resolution \nwould prevent that from occurring.\n  For these reasons, I will oppose the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I rise in support of this resolution, a resolution that \nwould allow the Congress to say this is a rule we should not go forward \nwith, the EPA cross-border air pollution resolution of disapproval or \nthe so-called transport rule, which places mandates on powerplants in \ncertain States in order to spare neighboring States from emissions.\n  The compliance date for this rule is around the corner. It is January \n1, 2012. It is an extraordinary time to comply with a rule that the EPA \njust issued in July. Six months to look at so much of the electric \ntransmission capacity of the country does not make sense to me, and I \nthink will not make sense to utility bill payers once they get their \nutility bills.\n  The Clean Air Act says that States are usually left to decide how \nbest to meet new EPA rules, including decisions about compliance time.\n  By mandating this arbitrary deadline, the EPA will only put more \npressure on job creators who are struggling to make ends meet as it is.\n  Another upcoming mandate from the EPA is the so-called utility MACT \nrule, a rule that deals with mercury. The combination of this transport \nrule and utility MACT rule will be devastating for our economy.\n  In fact, the combined effect of these two rules will cost Americans \n1.4 million jobs by 2020, according to a NERA Economic Consulting \nstudy--1.4 million jobs. Where will those jobs go? They will go to some \ncountry that cares a lot less about what comes out of the smokestack \nthan we do. The problem gets worse, not better.\n  These two rules will cause electricity rates to skyrocket over 20 \npercent in some regions of the country, according to the same study. We \nall remember the President's comments to the San Francisco Chronicle in \n2008, where he said that under his policies electricity rates would \nnecessarily skyrocket. The plan appears to be working. But is that the \nright plan for a country with 9 percent unemployment? Is that the right \nplan for a country where the No. 1 priority in the private sector is \njob creation? I don't think so.\n  Congress roundly and soundly rejected the House-passed--at least the \nSenate rejected it, and this Congress would reject the House-passed \ncap-and-trade idea that came from the administration. Now the EPA is \ntrying to circumvent the will of the legislature by imposing cap-and-\ntrade results with things such as the transport rule and the utility \nMACT rule. Unfortunately, these burdensome regulations will have the \nimpact the President predicted; they will raise utility bills.\n  Higher electricity rates mean a higher cost of doing business. There \nis no doubt the higher costs will be passed down to families across \nAmerica. There is no doubt the higher costs will cost jobs.\n  If we stand by and allow the EPA to impose these job-destroying \nregulations, job creators, families, seniors, and small business owners \nwill be hit by a costly tax hike that comes in the utility bill. We \nshould not allow this to happen.\n  I intend to vote for this proposal that would say this is not going \nto be a rule that becomes law, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n\n                        Remembering Mel Hancock\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about a champion for a better and \nsmaller government and an opponent of all job-killing regulations, and, \nin addition, a good friend and adviser of mine, someone whom many of us \nserved with in the House, Mel Hancock, who was my predecessor in the \nHouse, where he served four terms because that was his pledge--that was \nthe most he would serve.\n  He was much more than a politician. Mel Hancock was truly the \n``citizen legislator,'' the individual who got into government only to \nmake government better. Mel learned the ins and outs of the political \nsystem and developed a philosophy about taxes and government long \nbefore he came to Congress and, frankly, long before that philosophy \nbecame the philosophy that is so prevalent today.\n  Living in rural Stone County, MO, Mel Hancock had a profound \ninfluence from his father, John Hancock, and John Hancock spoke about \nhis concerns about a growing and intrusive Federal Government. ``The \npower to tax is the power to destroy,'' Mel remembered hearing his \nfather say.\n  Mel didn't hold public office until 1989. He sold farm equipment \nwhile in college and spent 10 years in the insurance business, where he \nbecame well known to many small business owners. In 1969, he started \nhis own business called Federal Protection, Inc.\n  In 1977, when proposition 13 passed in California, he became the \nperson who drove that issue in our State. One year later, in 1978, Mel \nand his wife Sug joined a small group around their kitchen table and \nformed a group that began to fight the idea of an overregulating, \novertaxing government.\n  In 1980, in our State, voters passed what was called the Hancock \namendment. That was one of the first State tax limitation amendments in \nthe United States. Mel Hancock developed this amendment using a formula \nthat limits total State revenue and expenses in Missouri to a \npercentage of personal income of residents in the State. It also \nrequired new local taxes, licenses or fees to be approved by voters in \npolitical subdivisions.\n  His public service didn't stop there. He ran for Congress when our \nlocal Congressman retired. He announced his candidacy and won in a \ncrowded primary. As part of that campaign, Mel declared his intention \nto serve only a brief amount of time. In fact, he went on to be an \nadvocate for term limits for the Missouri State legislature as well.\n  During his first three terms in the Congress, he served in the \nminority. But a sea change in 1994 took him to the majority, but it \ndidn't change his pledge to be there only four terms. He got exactly \nwhat he wanted in the new Congress--a seat on the Ways and Means \nCommittee. He walked away from that 2 years later, keeping his pledge \nto Missourians.\n  As a lifelong Republican, Mel built a reputation that reminded many \nof another Missourian, as his campaign theme became ``Give 'em Mel.''\n  Through his work in Washington and Missouri, he was decidedly ahead \nof his time. He rolled up his sleeves and went to work, taking the \ninitiative to protect citizens and taxpayers from unrestricted taxes \nand the power of government, and he always remembered where he came \nfrom.\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\n  Mel was, first and foremost, devoted to his family, his wife Sug, \nwhom he always called the boss, and his greatest pride was his \nchildren--Lee, Lu Ann, and Kim--and later grandchildren. He went right \nto work here. Mel became part of Washington. He often said that every \nday in America we decide between more government and less freedom or \nmore freedom and less government. Mel Hancock could be counted on to \nalways be on the side of more freedom.\n  I didn't go to his memorial service today because I decided the best \nway to recognize his legacy was to be here and vote against these two \nrules that he certainly would oppose if he was still in the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains on the Republican side and on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 50 seconds on the \nRepublican side, 28 minutes 15 seconds on the Democratic side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I will use some time on our side until we have \nanother speaker, which will probably about be 5 minutes. I know Senator \nReid will want to have the floor.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important vote that is coming up. I \nwish to put into perspective what we are talking about. In 1997--by my \ncalculation, that is 14 years ago--several States went to the EPA and \nsaid their people were suffering because certain States were producing \nhorrible pollution--toxic, dirty pollution--and it was floating right \nover to their States and then their States had to face the impact of \nthat pollution, which was causing asthma attacks, heart attacks, \ncardiovascular problems, all sorts of problems and that their State, \nthe recipient of the dirty air, was then expected to clean it up.\n  I liken that to this: If you had toxic garbage in your house and went \nand dumped it on your neighbor's front lawn and said now it is your \nproblem. That is not what we believe in America. We believe in \nresponsibility.\n  But the Paul amendment would say, no, we cannot ask those States that \nare producing pollution that is floating to other States and harming \ntheir people to do anything about it. That is what this rule is about. \nIt is the cross-State air pollution rule. The pollution goes across one \nState into another. I believe 38 States would be adversely impacted if \nthe Paul resolution were to pass.\n  Let's look at this. I am not just being rhetorical. The scientists \nhave looked at this. They said that if the Paul amendment were to pass \nand we repeal this cross-State air pollution rule and States could feel \nvery fine about dumping their pollution in another State, there would \nbe 34,000 cases of premature death, there would be 19,000 emergency \nroom and hospital visits, 400,000 cases of aggravated asthma attacks, \nand 1.8 million lost work and schooldays, and we would lose up to $280 \nbillion in annual benefits by 2014.\n  So anyone who stands in this Chamber and tells us that by voting for \nthe Paul resolution we are helping people, don't fall for it. It is \nwrong. If anyone comes to this floor and says: Oh, this is about jobs, \nit is wrong--because if we cannot breathe, we cannot work. Lost days at \nwork are an economic burden. If we turn the clock back, all this great \nclean-tech economy we have, which is exported to the rest of the \nworld--and it is huge; it employs more than 1 million people--we hurt \nthose jobs. So the Paul resolution, which would cancel out a very \nimportant protective air pollution rule that helps our people--that \nresolution is one of the worst things to come before this Senate.\n  Let me tell you who backs me on this: The American Association of \nCardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehab, the American Association of \nRespiratory Care, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the \nAmerican Lung Association, the American Nurses Association, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the American Thoracic Society, the \nAsthma and Allergy Foundation of America, the National Association of \nMedical Direction of Respiratory Care, the National Association of \nCounty and City Health Officials, the National Home Oxygen Patients \nAssociation--which sees people gasping for air.\n  Have you ever seen a child gasp for air? It is something you don't \nforget. I will show a photo of a beautiful child who is forced to wear \none of these inhalers too often because she cannot breathe. We hear \nlots of things: Oh, we need more time for this. How about the polluters \nknew about this since 1997? How about since 2005, when they learned the \nBush administration rule was too weak--how about that?\n  I see Senator Carper. Since we are going back and forth, this would \nbe a good time for Senator Lee to speak. How much time is Senator Lee \ngoing to need?\n  Mr. LEE. About 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes for \nSenator Lee, followed by 8 minutes for Senator Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The junior Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand in support of this resolution. I do \nso for the following reason. Article I, section 1 of the Constitution \nmakes abundantly clear that the legislative power of the United States \nshall be vested in Congress, which shall consist of a Senate and House \nof Representatives.\n  Legislative power is the power to make rules carrying the force of \ngenerally applicable law--in this instance, generally applicable \nFederal law. It was with wise reason that our Founding Fathers \nentrusted this power to those people entrusted by the citizens of the \nrespective States for a limited time to make law because they \nunderstood that those who have the power to make law have the power to \ninfringe on the individual liberties of the American people, such that \nwhenever they exceed those powers, they can be held accountable to \nthose they represent and on whose behalf they will be legislating.\n  Every single time we act, we have an effect on the American people. \nWe need to be held accountable at regular intervals for those \ndecisions--every 6 years in the case of Senators, every 2 years in the \ncase of Members of the House of Representatives.\n  Occasionally, Congress has chosen to delegate that power. For \ninstance, Congress might say we hereby enact the Clean Air Act and give \npower to the EPA to implement rules and enforce those rules, to make \nsure we have clean air. To the extent that we do that, particularly \nwhere the EPA or some other agency acts in a way that might have a very \nsignificant impact on our economy, I think we are selling the American \npeople short of their birthright, which is the guarantee that laws will \nnot be made on their behalf, particularly significant ones such as the \none we are addressing today, without those who voted for them being \nheld accountable.\n  There are great people at the EPA, as there are in every branch and \noffice of our Federal Government. But it is only those people in \nCongress who are constitutionally authorized to make generally \napplicable Federal law. It is only these people who stand at regular \nintervals for reelection, accountable to their people. This is what the \nCongressional Review Act does. This is why this approach, this \nresolution under the Congressional Review Act, is so important.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues suggest this somehow represents an \nattempt to circumvent the normal legislative process. What I am saying \nis, this is the normal legislative process. When we are looking at a \nrule that by the EPA's own estimates could cost as many 3,000 energy \nsector jobs and could cost the American people $2.4 billion in \ncompliance costs annually, we need to look seriously at the fact that \nwe need to hold ourselves accountable.\n  If this rule is a good idea, if in fact this is necessary to protect \nthe American people, if in fact the benefits of this outweigh the \ncosts, then we should be confident. We should be comfortable discussing \nit, debating it, and passing it into law. That is what we are doing.\n  I am supporting this resolution because I support the legislative \nprocess envisioned and mandated by the Constitution, and I urge each of \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am compelled to rise in opposition to \nthis resolution which would block the\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\nEPA's ``good neighbor'' clean air rule from being implemented.\n  Before I talk about the real-world impacts that would result if we \nblock this new clean air rule, I would like to go back in time 21 years \nago when this body debated the last major update to the Clean Air Act.\n  That day, we weren't debating how to weaken or delay our clean air \nlaws, we were considering bipartisan legislation that would improve our \nclean air laws and make them stronger. Eighty-nine Senators approved \nthe Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, a Republican President, George \nHerbert Walker Bush, signed them into law, and we are all the better \nfor it.\n  I believe we can protect our environment and grow our economy at the \nsame time. It doesn't have to be one or the other. The Clean Air Act \namendments of 1990 are great examples of just that. For every dollar we \nhave spent installing new pollution controls and cleaning up our air, \nwe have seen a $30 return in reduced health care costs, better \nworkplace productivity, and saved lives. In other words, for four \ndecades fewer people have gotten sick and missed work because of the \nClean Air Act.\n  Just last year, it is estimated that 160,000 lives were saved from \nthe Clean Air Act protections in place today. Here is some more good \nnews. Our economy didn't take a slide because of these protections \neither. Quite the opposite. Since former President Bush signed the \nbipartisan Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 into law, electricity rates \nhave stayed constant, and our economy has grown by 60 percent.\n  Despite the successes, more needs to be done. We know more today than \nwe did 20 or 30 years ago about how pollution impairs our health. We \nknow even more about how pollution travels from one State to another. \nWe know more about how to curb that pollution in ways that make sense \nand are cost effective.\n  My State of Delaware has made great strides in cleaning up its own \nair pollution--investing millions in clean air technology. \nUnfortunately, air pollution knows no State boundaries and easily \ndrifts from State to State. Delaware, like many east coast States, sits \nat the end of what I call America's tailpipe. That means most of the \npollution in Delaware isn't caused by sources in my State. It is caused \nmainly by sources in Ohio, Indiana, or other States in the Midwest. In \nfact, 90 percent of Delaware's air pollution comes from beyond our \nborders.\n  As Governor of Delaware, I could have shut down our entire State \neconomy, and we would still have been out of attainment of public \nhealth standards. This is pollution we need our neighbors to clean up. \nUnfortunately, that hasn't always happened.\n  Sadly, many of our upwind neighbors have not invested heavily enough \nin new clean air technologies. Some States have even built taller \nsmokestacks so the pollution would fall on neighboring States, keeping \ntheir air clean and making our air dirty. At the end of the day, \ndownwind States can spend millions of dollars to clean up their act, \nbut unless we require upwind States to make serious reductions, States \nlike mine would not get much healthier and people will continue to get \nsick and die.\n  For all Delawareans and all the others who are living at the end of \nthat tailpipe, I say enough is enough. The EPA and the courts agree. \nThis is why the EPA has implemented this cross-State air pollution \nrule. This rule follows the intent and the direction of the Clean Air \nAct amendments of 1990. It ensures that all of us do our fair share to \nreduce air pollution.\n  That is the way it ought to be. Like my colleagues, I try to live my \nlife by the Golden Rule, to treat other people the way I want to be \ntreated. That is why this rule is fair. My State and neighboring States \nshouldn't have to suffer because other States aren't required to clean \nup their act at our expense.\n  Furthermore, even if we ignore the fairness and equity arguments for \nthe cross-State air pollution rule, it is still a no-brainer because \nthe cost-to-benefit ratio of these new protections is overwhelming. \nThis rule will save up to 34,000 lives every year. That is roughly the \nnumber of people who fit into Fenway Park for a Red Sox game. All these \ngreat benefits will be negated if this resolution passes.\n  To my friends who are thinking about voting for this resolution, let \nme ask you this: What if the prevailing winds in this country blew \ninstead of west to east, from east to west? What if those of us who \nlive along the east coast, from Virginia to Maine, chose to operate \nolder, dirty coal-fired electric plants? What if we built tall \nsmokestacks that sent the harmful emissions coming from our plants \nupward into the air to be carried away by the winds from our regions \nonly to end up in the air and breathed by people living in areas to our \nwest? What if by operating these older, dirtier powerplants we lowered \nthe cost of electricity along the east coast while raising it for our \nneighbors in the Midwest? What if by operating these older, dirtier \npowerplants we decreased the health care costs associated with dirty \nair for Americans living along the east coast while increasing health \ncare costs for Americans living in the Midwest?\n  I will tell you what they would say. They would say it is unfair. \nThey would say we shouldn't be able to get away with polluting their \ncommunities year after year. They would say somebody should right this \nwrong. They would say: Haven't you heard about the Golden Rule; that we \nshould treat all others the way we want to be treated? They would say \nenough is enough.\n  Here are the facts. The technology exists to end this scourge of \npollution. Utilities all around the country have already installed it. \nIn doing so, they have put tens of thousands of people to work, \nincluding hundreds in my own State of Delaware. The utilities have the \nmoney. We have a trained workforce that wants to go to work. We just \nneed to act.\n  A clean environment and a strong economy can go hand in hand. We \ndon't have to choose between one or the other. Join me in defeating \nthis proposal. Give your neighbors who live in our part of the \ncountry--give their kids and their grandparents--air to breathe that \nwould not send them home from school or work or off to the emergency \nroom and into a hospital or worse yet, take their lives.\n  Please join me and vote no against this motion to proceed to this \nresolution.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Texas has some of the most highly \nindustrialized and populated areas in the Nation, and air quality in \nthese and other areas of the State is improving. We are actually taking \nvery positive steps toward reduction of pollutants. For example, ozone \nhas been reduced by 27 percent across our State since 2000, and \nnitrogen oxide, a precursor to ozone formation, has been reduced by 58 \npercent over roughly the same period of time.\n  But I rise in support of this resolution because it represents \nregulatory overreach and an abuse of power. This rule, when it takes \neffect January 1, will significantly harm grid reliability, destroy \njobs, and raise electricity prices for consumers living on a fixed \nincome and for businesses we are depending upon to create jobs in our \ncountry.\n  The reason this rule is an abuse of power as regards to the State of \nTexas is that we were not included in the rule when the Environmental \nProtection Agency first proposed it. Suddenly, miraculously, we were \nincluded in the final rule. Having less than a year ago concluded that \nTexas emissions have no significant downwind effects, the EPA has \nreversed course and included us in this rule without the opportunity to \nchallenge the claim.\n  Without fair notice, the EPA has mandated that Texas slash its \nSO2 emissions by half and greatly reduce NOX \nemissions in less than 5 months--an unprecedented and impossible \ntimetable with which to comply. The standard timeframe for permitting \nand constructing and installing new emissions controls is several \nyears. But as a result of this abuse of power by the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and without due process and fair notice and the \nopportunity to be heard, this rule is being imposed on my State.\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\n  Already, one power producer has announced that 500 jobs will be lost. \nThe integrity of our State grid is at risk. Our grid operator has said \nas a result of the unprecedented heat wave and the historic drought \nTexas has been experiencing, if we had had these rules in place last \nsummer we would have experienced rolling outages during August, when \npeople were relying on their air conditioners to deal with triple-digit \ntemperatures. This would have meant rolling blackouts, businesses \nforced to cut back, hardships--even to the threat of safety--for many \nof our senior citizens.\n  I visited some of those seniors in Houston, TX, recently, and, of \ncourse, many of them are on a fixed income. They can't afford to pay \nmore for their electricity bills. They are struggling to pay their \nbills right now, and they sure don't want to have to experience the \npotential hardship or public safety hazard of having a brownout or a \nblackout or outage should they need their heat during the winter or \ntheir air-conditioning during the summer.\n  The EPA has said: Well, we got it approximately right, but we are \ngoing to make some revisions. But revisions are not enough. The EPA \nrecently corrected errors from modeling assumptions and corresponding \nemissions budgets for several of the States under the rule, but other \nmistakes remain.\n  Haste makes waste, Mr. President. We know that is true. Why can't the \nEPA do it the right way? Give us some time, notice, and opportunity to \nbe heard so we can get this done right.\n  The EPA overestimates base generation capacity for our grid by 20,000 \nmegawatts. This includes 100 percent of the installed wind generation \nin Texas--as though wind power is always available. Our electric grid \nderates wind generation to 8.7 percent due to its unpredictability and \nreliability as a generation source. Put, simply, the wind does not blow \n24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This estimate also includes \npowerplants that are currently retired and mothballed.\n  So the EPA got it wrong. But when we say: Please, give us a chance to \nshow you the facts and to show you the science that would help make our \nair more clean but not kill jobs and create hardship for our senior \ncitizens and those on fixed incomes, their answer is, tough luck, tough \nluck.\n  Our only recourse, Mr. President, is to support a resolution such as \nthis one because we cannot get fundamental fairness from this agency of \nthe Federal Government when it comes to my State. So I support the \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 1\\1/2\\ minutes, and the \nDemocratic side has 16 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have heard the same theme over and over \nfrom our Republican friends: We need time, give us time. The EPA is \nrushing this.\n  Well, how much time do they need to fix a problem that is forcing \nchildren to put on these inhalers? How much time do they need to \nenforce a rule that is keeping people from dying prematurely; that is \nkeeping them from getting heart attacks?\n  Here is the deal. In 1997, several States went to the EPA and said: \nSomething is really wrong. We have kids like this gasping for air, and \nthe air pollution isn't coming from our State. It is coming from the \nStates to the west of us.\n  Now, I want to make it clear that my State of California doesn't have \na dog in this fight. We are not involved in this. We don't pollute. We \ndon't have a lot of coal-powered plants. And we are in the far west. \nFrankly, having that ocean along our State helps us. We have plenty of \nair pollution, but we are not getting it from another State to our \nwest. So I stand here speaking, frankly, as a Senator who cares about \nclean air, who cares about the public health, and who also sees this as \na moral issue.\n  I have said this every way I can say it. It is immoral to take poison \nand put it on someone else's front yard. It is immoral to walk away \nfrom your responsibility, particularly if you have a truck to put it in \nand take it away.\n  Well, we have the technology to make cleaner utilities, to make \ncleaner power. And as my friend Tom Carper so eloquently stated, clean \ntech creates jobs.\n  We have the technology. We have the ability to create jobs cleaning \nup the environment. We have an ability to make sure fewer children, \nsuch as this beautiful child, don't have to resort to inhalers if we \nclean up our powerplants, and we have the ability to do that. The other \nside is crying, We need time. That is all we need, we need time. Well, \nI think 14 years is enough time.\n  Then in 2005, the courts said again how important it was to do this. \nSo they knew about this in 1997, they knew about it in 2005, and now \nthey are crying bitter tears and they want to continue to dump poison \nin States next door. This is just the tip of the iceberg of the \nRepublican Party's desire to repeal important health and safety \nregulations. The American people do not agree with it.\n  Let me show you a poll that was taken last month in terms of where \npeople stand. This cross-State air pollution rule is very popular with \nthe people of this country because they see very clearly. I think when \nwe were kids our moms always said, clean up your room. You know, you \nowe it to the rest of the family, clean up your room. Polluters have to \nclean up their room. Polluters can't pollute at will and, as Senator \nCarper said, build these big smokestacks and blow that pollution over \nto, in this case, 38 other States and hurt the people in those States. \nThat is not the American way. What Senator Paul is doing is the height \nof irresponsibility.\n  I want to put back the picture of that child again.\n  How is it responsible to allow the pollution to go on and on and on \nwhen you have the technology developed to stop it, and when it is \nmoving out of your State and going to another State and harming \nchildren?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I wish to thank the Senator for her leadership on \nthis issue, and I wish to direct a question through the Chair.\n  I noticed earlier that Senator Paul, who is asking for us to \nbasically eliminate the standard of protection when it comes to air \npollution that crosses State boundaries, if I am not mistaken, his \nresolution would eliminate the standard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It would.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There would be none. And if I am not mistaken as well, he \nhas said on the floor this has no direct impact on asthma and pulmonary \ndisease, even producing a chart to that effect.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from California--because I visited an \nemergency room hospital, one of the children's hospitals in Chicago, \nand the emergency room physician said to me, Do you know what the No. 1 \nreason is that children show up in emergency rooms? And I said, Fall \noff their bicycles? Trauma? No. Asthma. Asthma.\n  She said, Senator, I will have young people come into this emergency \nroom who are fighting for breath, saying, I am asthmatic and I can't \nbreathe, and I watch as they die in front of me. That is the reality of \nasthma. This isn't just an inconvenience; it is life threatening.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from California on what basis could any \nSenator say there is no connection between air pollution, soot, and the \nparticles in the air, and pulmonary disease and asthma?\n  Mr. PAUL. Senator, I would be happy to answer that question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I directed the question to the Senator from California. I \ndon't know what the timeframe is, but I am happy to have her response.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will respond on my time; the Senator can respond on \nhis.\n  Let me tell you something. As far as I know, we do not have one \nperson in this Senate who is a physician with a degree in lung \nspecialty, thoracic specialty, cardiovascular specialty; therefore, we \nneed to look to those people.\n  You are right. When you go to the hospital and talk to physicians, \nthey will tell you about children dying in their arms. I have seen that \ntestimony, I have heard it in front of our committee. The fact is, this \nrule will prevent 400,000 cases of aggravated asthma\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\nattacks and 1.8 million lost work and school days. This is factual.\n  I want to say that hearing people come on this floor questioning \nwhether there is an association between soot in the air and asthma \nattacks, frankly, is to me unimaginable. And we have all of the health \norganizations that disagree with Senator Paul on that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask another question through the Chair of the \nSenator from California.\n  Two weeks ago, I went to the University of Illinois Children's \nHospital. A woman came there who had been suffering from asthma her \nentire life and talked to me about how there were days when the air was \nso bad, she couldn't go outside, children there with their parents and \ndoctors telling me exactly the same thing. Yet those who are trying to \nrepeal this air safety rule--Senator Paul and those who support him--\nare arguing these doctors and patients are wrong. So I wish to ask the \nSenator, because she was alluding to it here, what kind of medical \nsupport do you have for your position that Senator Paul's amendment, if \nit passes, will endanger the lives of those who are currently suffering \nfrom asthma, pulmonary disease, and maybe cardiovascular disease? And \ntell me what medical groups have come forward on one side or the other, \nplease.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I don't know of any medical groups that \nsupport the Paul resolution. But I do have in my hand a letter signed \nby many groups, which I wish to quote from.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this important \nletter Senator Durbin is speaking of.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 4, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: Our organizations write to express our strong \n     opposition to S.J. Res. 27, a resolution by Senator Rand Paul \n     that employs the Congressional Review Act to reverse the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) final Cross-State Air \n     Pollution Rule (CSAPR). If enacted, S.J. Res. 27 would vacate \n     CSAPR and the lifesaving protections it provides to the \n     public and bar EPA from reissuing any substantially similar \n     clean air protections without express Congressional \n     authorization.\n       CSAPR requires power plants to substantially reduce \n     emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that \n     contribute to life-threatening particulate matter and ozone \n     air pollution in downwind states. Ozone and particulate \n     matter are associated with numerous adverse health effects, \n     including lung disease, irreversible reductions in lung \n     function, asthma attacks, aggravation of other respiratory \n     and cardiovascular diseases, and premature death. EPA \n     estimates that CSAPR will prevent up to 34,000 premature \n     deaths, 400,000 asthma attacks, 15,000 heart attacks, and \n     19,000 hospital visits each year starting in 2014.\n       The rule covers emission sources in 28 states. It was \n     developed after an earlier rule, known as the Clean Air \n     Interstate Rule was deemed illegal and an insufficient \n     response to the health threats posed by cross-state \n     pollution. CSAPR provides much-needed public health benefits \n     by reducing upwind air pollution that significantly \n     contributes to ozone or particle pollution in downwind areas. \n     Blocking CSAPR, S.J. Res. 27 would force people living in \n     downwind states to continue to suffer from high levels of \n     unhealthy pollution from out-of-state power plants.\n       A vast majority of the public opposes Congressional \n     interference with EPA's implementation of the Clean Air Act. \n     According to a nationwide, bipartisan study conducted for the \n     American Lung Association, seventy-two percent of voters \n     oppose Congressional action blocking EPA from updating clean \n     air standards. Sixty-six percent of voters think the EPA \n     should set pollution standards, not Members of Congress.\n       We urge you to vote ``No'' on S.J. Res. 27 and similar \n     attacks on CSAPR. The public health benefits of CSAPR are \n     long overdue. We hope your constituents can count on you to \n     protect their health in the face of efforts to block, delay \n     and weaken these lifesaving protections.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary \n           Rehabilitation, American Association of Respiratory \n           Care, American College of Preventive Medicine, American \n           Lung Association, American Nurses Association, American \n           Public Health Association, American Thoracic Society, \n           Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, National \n           Association for Medical Direction of Respiratory Care, \n           National Association of County and City Health \n           Officials, National Home Oxygen Patients Association \n           Trust for America's Health.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Blocking the cross-air pollution rule, cross-State \npollution rule would force people living in downwind States to continue \nto suffer from high levels of unhealthy pollution from out-of-State \npowerplants. They say they express their strong opposition. They say \nozone and particulate matter are associated with numerous adverse \nhealth effects, including lung disease, irreversible reductions in lung \nfunction--irreversible.\n  So it is not as though you have a bad day and you are gasping for \nair, and suddenly the next day it comes back. Irreversible reduction in \nlung function. Asthma attacks. And, by the way, we are told there will \nbe 400,000 cases of aggravated asthma attacks if we go back on this \nrule. Aggravation of other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. \nAnd, I would say to the Senator, they add premature death. Here they \nare saying 34,000 cases of premature death. I will give you a few of \nthe names of the people who signed this.\n  I am so glad the Senator came down here. He has been such a great \nleader on these issues and, I want to say for the record, led me and so \nmany others, the majority of the House, in saying no more smoking on \nairplanes. And, boy, we remembered how it was in those days, and I know \nthe Senator's personal experience with lack of lung function and his \nown dad. So the Senator coming over here today is very appreciated. I \nwill give you the names of some of these organizations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am glad the Senator entered it in the Record. If the \nSenator will yield for one more question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It seems to me that the Republican argument from Senator \nPaul comes along two lines. First, air pollution doesn't hurt, so don't \nbe worried if there is more of it. And what we have is medical evidence \nand testimony from the experts he is wrong. I don't know if he \npresented any doctors--I would love to know--who support that position, \nthat air pollution doesn't cause problems. We know it does. It stands \nto reason it does. Medical and human experience tells us.\n  The second argument that he is making, if you can get past the first, \nis this is how we are going to create jobs in America. On 168 separate \noccasions, the Republican-led House of Representatives has sought to \nrepeal those environmental protections of our air and the safety of the \nwater we drink, and they have bragged about it, saying when we get rid \nof all of these standards on air and water pollution, more Americans \nwill go to work.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from California to respond, because the way \nI see it, if the Paul resolution passes, sadly, the people who will go \nto work are those who work in emergency rooms, those who work to make \nnebulizers for those suffering from asthma, and people who make oxygen \ntanks. I am sorry to say this but that is the reality. If you ignore \nthe health consequences, the jobs created will be to treat those who \nare going to be afflicted by pulmonary disease because of this \neradication of a standard.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from California, talk to me about job \ncreation and pollution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. Well, first of all, I want people to know \nthat since the Clean Air Act passed and there were all these \npredictions of a horrible recession, there has been a huge number of \njobs created and it is all documented on one of these charts here. I \ncan tell you, our GDP rose more than any other industrialized nation in \nthe world as we cleaned up the air.\n  The Senator and I were on a trip to China. We did not see the Sun for \ndays and days and days. I don't know if you missed this or caught this \nstory in the New York Times. The Chinese elites in the government--many \nof whom we met with there to try to push our agenda, which is trade \nwith China and all the other things we want and making sure their \ncurrency is floating--this is what we learned:\n\n       Chinese leaders are largely insulated from Beijing's \n     famously foul air.\n\n  In the Great Hall there they have all these fabulous clean air \ndevices. In their homes they are protected, in their cars they are \nprotected. But guess what. The people are suffering and struggling. \nThey don't even get to see the Sun shine there. If I could say, I don't \nwant to see elitism here. Every single person in our country deserves \nto have a chance to breathe clean air.\n  To get specifically to the point, to talk about the economy--because \nI think that is critical--Senator Paul's resolution is bad for this \neconomy. It is bad for jobs. It is bad for our families.\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\nThat is why it is opposed by every health professional.\n  Let me say this. We are talking about 400,000 cases of aggravated \nasthma attacks if this resolution passes. We are talking about 34,000 \ncases of premature death.\n  I want to make a point here. If you are the head of household and you \ndie prematurely because of filthy, polluted, poisonous air that is \nfloating in from another State, you can't work and your family is in \ndeep trouble. I will tell you this, the annual benefits by 2014--\nannual, of this rule--are estimated to be $280 billion a year. So if \nanyone stands up here and says we are fighting for jobs, we are \nfighting for the people, we are fighting for the economy by rolling \nback clean air rules, don't believe it for a minute. If you don't want \nto listen to me or Senator Durbin, listen to the people I know you \nrespect, from the American Association of Cardiovascular \nRehabilitation, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the \nAmerican Lung Association, the American Nurses Association. Those \nnurses have held those babies.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope we vote down this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The junior Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise in support of clean air, clean water, \nelectricity, and jobs.\n  Interestingly, the other side hasn't read the EPA v. North Carolina \nopinion that says the regulations were not overturned. We are arguing \nfor keeping in the current regulations. We are just arguing that we not \nbe overzealous and that we not add $2 billion in new regulations on top \nof the current regulations.\n  We have $2 trillion worth of regulations heaped on our economy, 14 \nmillion people out of work--2 million new people out of work since this \nPresident came into power. We cannot allow this administration to \ncontinue with its job-killing regulations.\n  We can have a clean environment and we can have jobs. We are arguing \nfor the existing regulations. We are arguing against placing additional \nburdens. We are arguing for the existing regulations. They don't seem \nto get it, so they make up all these numbers. All of their numbers are \ncompletely fictitious because they don't account for the current \nregulations that would still be in place if we don't increase these \nregulations.\n  This is about whether we can have a balanced approach in our society, \nwhether we can have a clean environment and have jobs. What I am \narguing for here is some reasonableness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7324-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7324-S7326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DISAPPROVING THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS \n   COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO REGULATING THE INTERNET AND BROADBAND \n                 INDUSTRY PRACTICES--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Last December, the Federal Communications \nCommission took action to promulgate ``network neutrality'' rules, \nwhich are set to go into effect later this month. These are rules that \nwill create transparency and foster competition. I oppose the \nresolution being considered by the Senate today that disapproves of the \nCommission's actions in this area.\n  Many Americans have either no choice or a limited choice of broadband \nservice providers. This is particularly true in rural areas like \nVermont. This lack of competition in the market raises the threat of \nproviders discriminating against certain lawful Web sites and Internet \ncontent. Net neutrality rules are crucial in ensuring that the Internet \nremains the ultimate free marketplace of ideas, where better products \nor services succeed on their own merits and not based on special \nfinancial relationships with providers.\n  Congress and the executive branch must take steps to ensure that \ncompetition on the Internet is vibrant. This has taken on new \nimportance as the Internet has become increasingly central to our \nlives. The online marketplace is going to be a key driver of the 21st \ncentury economy, and implementing net neutrality rules now, while it is \nstill growing, will ensure that the online marketplace will continue to \nbe dynamic well into the future.\n  The Judiciary Committee held hearings on this issue several years \nago, and it is an issue in which I have been interested. I was an \noriginal cosponsor of the Internet Freedom Preservation Act in both the \n109th and 110th Congresses. That bill would have gone even further to \npreserve an open Internet than the actions taken by the FCC last year. \nI will remain a strong supporter of strong and responsible net \nneutrality regulations in the Senate, and I oppose the resolution being \nconsidered today.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 6, \nthe FCC Internet and broadband resolution of disapproval. There are so \nmany reasons to support this resolution and oppose the FCC's rulemaking \non net neutrality.\n  I could focus on regulatory overreach, the lack of cost-benefit \nanalysis to justify this rulemaking, consistent court rulings showing \nthe lack of FCC legal authority to implement net neutrality or even the \naggressive nature of this administration to regulate at all costs.\n  However, today I would like to talk about the most important reason \nto support this Resolution in opposition of net neutrality--jobs.\n  Last year, the telecommunications industry invested over $65 billion \nin our domestic economy. These billions of dollars go toward \ninfrastructure, network expansion, and continual upgrades, all of which \nwill drive job creation in a growth sector. For every billion dollars \ninvested, there is a direct correlation to 3,400 created jobs.\n  What is at stake in this debate is nothing more than the government \ntrying to take over the Internet in a misguided attempt to regulate a \ndynamic industry into a static platform. This approach will stifle \ninnovation.\n  If companies are devoting $65 billion a year to building out their \nnetworks, but do not have the ability to control and manage their \ninvestments, then they are going to stop investing tens of billions of \ndollars into their product. It really is that simple. No company is \ngoing to continue to invest at such a fast rate if they will be forced \nto cede partial control over to government regulators.\n  In a down-economy, telecommunications has been one of the few bright \nspots. Why? Because of a light-touch, hands-off regulatory approach. \nNow the FCC is pursuing a political agenda by attempting to undermine \nthe industry. The FCC has not won in the courts or through the \nlegislative process in Congress, so it has resorted to expanding the \nregulatory process.\n  According to a 2010 study entitled ``The Economic Impact of Broadband \nInvestment,'' 434,000 jobs have been created in the broadband industry \nin the past decade, and in the next 5 years, we can expect over 500,000 \nadditional jobs to be created.\n  To help protect these jobs, we must stop this government over-reach. \nIT investment accounts for 47 percent of all U.S. nonstructural \ninvestment and as I mentioned, the job creation from this is a bright \nspot in our economy. We must continue the hands-off approach\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nthat results in job creation and allows our companies--big, small and \neverything in between--to do what they do best: innovate, invest in the \nfuture, and create jobs.\n  We need to support policies that encourage investment in tomorrow's \ntechnologies, not hamper innovation. According to the FCC's own \nNational Broadband Plan, in 2003 only 15 percent of Americans had \naccess to broadband. Today that number is 96 percent, and we cannot \nstop until we have 100 percent market-saturation. Parts of northern New \nHampshire are included in this remaining 4 percent, so to get the rest \nof my state, and our great country, access to broadband, we must have \npolicies that encourage private-sector investment and growth.\n  We have heard it said many times, but it is worth repeating: net \nneutrality is a solution in search of a problem that does not exist. \nThere is no market failure and no justifiable reason to impose such \nonerous regulations. Quite the contrary--competition is at an all-time \nhigh in the telecommunications and broadband industry. Since the \nInternet was privatized in 1994, there has been a steady movement away \nfrom government control and roadblocks.\n  As FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell pointed out in his December 2010 \ndissent to the FCC's rulemaking on net neutrality, there are fewer than \na handful of cases of alleged misconduct by an Internet service \nprovider, and each of those cases was resolved by the courts in favor \nof the consumer. So as you can see, the consumer is well-protected by \nthe existing system and does not need the heavy-hand of the government \ninserting itself with more regulations.\n  The White House this week issued a veto threat for this resolution. \nHowever, in doing so it made our point for us. The White House says it \nwould be ``ill-advised to threaten the very foundation of innovation in \nthe Internet economy'' but then says we need to keep the Internet \n``free and open.'' Well I have news for the White House--the Internet \nis free and open. I sent a letter, along with 10 of my Senate Commerce \nCommittee Republicans to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowki a couple of \nmonths ago asking him to provide a market justification and cost/\nbenefit analysis for imposing net neutrality regulations. In his \nresponse, he could not cite any examples of market failure to justify \nsuch a rash rulemaking. Why? Because no rationale exists. There is no \nmarket failure.\n  I fear that if net neutrality were to become law, we would be taking \nan irreversible step backwards at a time when our economy needs it \nleast.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and say no to \ngovernment attempting to take over the Internet.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will oppose the motion to proceed to \nS.J. Res. 6 a joint resolution of disapproval of the FCC rule regarding \nnet neutrality.\n  This resolution of disapproval would overturn the FCC's rule that \nwould codify and supplement existing Internet openness principles while \nmaintaining the ability of Internet service providers to engage in \nreasonable network management. The rules would prohibit Internet access \nproviders from preventing its users from sending or receiving lawful \ncontent over the Internet; prohibit Internet access providers from \npreventing users from connecting lawful devices to the network; and \nwould require Internet access providers to treat lawful content, \napplications, and services in a nondiscriminatory manner. It also \nincluded additional provisions that will create an Open Internet \nAdvisory Committee to assess and report to the FCC on developments in \nmobile broadband.\n  The Internet has become an indispensable tool that has spurred \ninnovation, provided virtually unlimited access to information and \ncommerce, and increased communication through Web sites, e-mail, and \nblogs. It has become difficult to imagine life without the Internet, a \nsystem both open and unrestricted.\n  The Internet plays a critical role in our society because it provides \nan equal platform for all users, allowing for the free exchange of \nideas and information. It is important that the Internet remain free \nand open and not risk becoming a system with limited access for some of \nthe smaller Web sites and their users.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, over the past 20 years, the Internet \nhas grown and flourished without burdensome regulations from \nWashington. With the strength of free market forces behind it, the \nInternet has been an open platform for innovation. It has spurred \nbusiness development, much needed job creation, millions of jobs in \nfact. If we are going to keep an open and free Internet and keep the \njobs it spawns, we should reject the FCC regulation on net neutrality.\n  The FCC reversed its successful hands-off approach last December by \npassing net neutrality rules where the FCC has essentially granted \nitself power over all forms of communication, including the Internet. \nCongress did not explicitly delegate this authority to the FCC, and it \nis our responsibility to hold on to the power that only we authorize \nregulations where they are needed. Unelected agencies do not get to \ndecide on their own that something needs to be done that Congress has \nnot, in its congressional and constitutional responsibility, decided is \nnecessary.\n  These regulations on broadband providers establish the FCC as the \nInternet's gatekeeper--a role for which government is not really suited \nwhen innovation could be stifled. Instead of spending their resources \non new job-creating investments, on new products, on new services, \nInternet providers are going to have to spend money on lawyers and \nlobbyists to comply with and go through the processes the FCC will \nrequire. Congress has never given the FCC this authority.\n  Regulators and bureaucrats all across the government are overstepping \ntheir bounds in many areas--the NMB, the NLRB, the EPA--and it is time \nfor Congress to push back, and we can do it today. Regulators should \nnot regulate without the explicit authority of Congress. The court said \nso in the Comcast case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Madam President, I want to speak for a few minutes about \nthe proposed veterans tax credit. I know what I am about to discuss \nwill not make me very popular. I will probably be accused of not \nsupporting veterans by the politicians pandering for their votes, but I \nam not going to be intimidated into voting for something that may make \nsense politically but is inherently unfair, and it is not going to \nwork. The measure the Senate is now considering at President Obama's \nurging is to offer tax credits to employers who hire unemployed \nveterans. It might sound like good politics, but it is not good policy.\n  We have learned over the past few years since President Obama took \noffice that employers hire based on their long-term plans, not short-\nterm stimulus. It costs an employer about $63,000 a year to create an \naverage private sector job. A new tax credit for a couple thousand \ndollars is simply not enough to increase employment. We have to \nrecognize the fact that businesses are not going to hire until the \ngovernment gets out of their way and creates a stable environment where \nbusinesses can thrive.\n  Let's be clear: I want veterans to have work opportunities. Once a \nman or woman has completed his or her service to our country, I hope \nthey are welcomed into the job market. But veterans are not hired \nsimply because they are veterans. By and large, they demonstrate \nadmirable qualities that are invaluable in the workforce, such as \nselflessness, hard work, and dedication to improving oneself. Many \nother Americans who are suffering in this same bad economy--such as \nsingle moms, young graduates, and minorities--also demonstrate these \nsame commendable character traits. The best way to get our veterans \nback to work is by doing what will help the economy and get all \nAmericans back to work. Sadly, this tax credit does not do that.\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\n  The government has tried offering credits to hire particular \ncategories of people many times before. A Government Accountability \nOffice report studied the targeted jobs tax credit that was passed back \nin 1978. The credit was intended to encourage companies to favor the \ndisadvantaged in hiring, but a followup study found that it was not \n``effective or economical'' in helping the targeted group. The program \nwas eventually allowed to expire.\n  Unfortunately, that tax credit was quickly replaced with the welfare-\nto-work and work opportunity tax credits in 1996. The Urban Institute-\nBrookings Tax Policy Center studied these credits, which were intended \nto help the needy, low-income veterans, inner-city youth, and ex-\nfelons. But it found that the credits had ``not had a meaningful effect \non employment rates among the disadvantaged.''\n  President Obama signed another law, the Hiring Incentives to Restore \nEmployment Act, in March of 2010 to give companies a tax credit to hire \nunemployed workers. There is no evidence this encouraged employers to \nhire, as unemployment has remained stubbornly high since President \nObama came into office, especially over the last year while this credit \nwas available.\n  Despite the overwhelming evidence that these tax credits do not \nstimulate hiring for targeted groups, the Obama administration \ncontinues to push Congress to pass another tax credit, this time \nexclusively for veterans. By using a politically sensitive group the \nday before Veterans Day, the Democrats are hoping they can trick \nRepublicans into further complicating the Tax Code, when we should be \ndoing everything possible to simplify it.\n  If we want to help veterans and all Americans, we need to get serious \nabout fixing our economy. There are almost 14 million unemployed \nAmericans and another 10 million underemployed and discouraged workers \nwho need work. We need a simpler tax code that businesses can navigate, \nnot a more complicated one, riddled with incentives for employers to \nhire one particular group over another. The endless morass of tax \ncredits and loopholes is exactly what is wrong with our Tax Code. We \nshould also repeal ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank, which are proven job \nkillers. We will have a chance to vote on that later today. We need to \nopen more domestic energy resources.\n  The answers are right in front of our faces. But, instead, we are \npandering to different political groups with programs that have proven \nto be ineffective. We are giving more false promises to Americans in \norder to benefit political ends.\n  All Americans deserve the same opportunity to get hired. I cannot \nsupport this tax credit because I do not believe the government should \nprivilege one American over another when it comes to work. I am deeply \nthankful for the courageous and selfless service of our veterans. They \nhave performed for our country a service, and we will always be \nindebted to them. Above all, I am thankful for their sacrifices to \nprotect freedom and equal opportunity in America. But we do not pay \nthem back for their service and sacrifice with false promises of \ngovernment programs that have been proven not to work.\n  Let's be honest with our veterans and with all Americans and do what \nwe need to do to fix this economy.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield back and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today, on the eve of Veterans Day, \nto speak on behalf of those who have fought for our country only to \nreturn home to find that their fight must continue, this time their \nfight for a job, for employment. I rise today to offer my support on \nthe floor for the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which I believe is now before \nthis body.\n  I am a cosponsor of this bill, because as a nation we must do more to \nappreciate, to support the service of our returning heroes, and to help \nthem to fully recover from their service abroad by returning to \nmeaningful employment in the civilian sector.\n  We have not had as many servicemembers coming home from military \nservice abroad in a long time. Unfortunately, so many of them come home \nto a bitterly slow recovery from the great recession. The employment \nrate among all veterans from service in Iraq or Afghanistan is now 30 \npercent higher than the national unemployment rate. It is at roughly \n12.1 percent. That means nearly a quarter million veterans who are \nunemployed.\n  This bill is about equipping them, equipping them effectively to \nreturn home to full employment. We have a tremendous asset in the \nhighly trained, highly skilled, highly motivated veterans we have \ndeployed overseas in the service of freedom and who are now returning \nhome seeking service in employment with America's businesses.\n  We are talking about men and women who are real leaders, tested \nleaders who have learned something useful about managing people through \nsome of the most difficult situations imaginable, folks in whom we \ninvest hundreds of millions of dollars every year, year in and year \nout, in training them and equipping them--billions of dollars in \nequipping them to the highest service levels when we send them \noverseas. We should invest comparably in making sure that that \ntraining, that equipment, is relevant as they return home.\n  This summer I hosted a roundtable in Delaware on veterans jobs. \nNineteen participants came from a wide range of sectors: from the \nmilitary, from labor, from businesses, from all sorts of different \ncivilian support organizations that work with our returning veterans. \nAs we had a long and productive conversation, the message was loud and \nclear: We can and should incentivize private businesses to hire \nveterans. We can help connect the private sector--these businesses \nacross America--with veterans whom they want to hire. And we can and \nshould do a better job of helping returning veterans transition to \ncivilian service.\n  In Delaware and across the country, we have had some great programs \nin the past: Helmets to Hard Hats, for example, one with which I became \nfamiliar in my previous service in county government, that connected \nfolks in the building trades who wanted to welcome into their ranks \nveterans returning from recent service, with those who have served our \ncountry honorably overseas and are now home fighting for jobs.\n  There is also the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, or ESGR, \nwith which I regularly communicated as county executive and continue to \noffer my support as Senator, that helps make sure those who serve \noverseas in the Guard and Reserve know that their employers understand \nand respect their legal obligations and their moral obligations to \nprovide employment opportunities comparable to those they had before \nthey deployed.\n  We also had participating in this important conversation this summer \nDelaware companies that have made a public pledge to hiring veterans, \nSummit Aviation in Middletown, JPMorgan Chase, with a very large \npresence in Delaware, which has made a very real and sustained \ncommitment to hiring returning veterans.\n  We have a jobs crisis in America. Today, Delaware's veterans \nunemployment rate is 8 percent. While that is good compared to the \nnational average, 8 percent should not be a good number. In my view, \nthis Congress could have no higher priority than helping Americans get \nback to work and in that priority helping America's veterans get back \nto work.\n  The bill we are on today is the fourth major jobs bill full of ideas, \nmany of which originally came from the other side of the aisle for job \ncreation that we have introduced and considered--the American Jobs Act, \na bill that would put public safety workers and teachers back to work \nand sustain their public service role; a bill that would invest in the \ninfrastructure bank and public dollars for infrastructure all over this \ncountry--and all of these bills have been blocked--not defeated but \nblocked, prevented through filibuster from even coming to the floor. If \never there were a jobs bill that has earned bipartisan support, it is \nthe one this body will vote on later today. Today, we have an \nopportunity to make it easier for our veterans to find jobs, and\n\n[[Page S7328]]\n\nI am encouraged by very real signs that this bill may pass, so that all \nof us can go home tomorrow to our States, participate in Veterans Day \nceremonies, having voted for a bill designed to help so many of \nAmerica's service men and women ease their path back to full employment \nin the civilian economy. I believe we owe them nothing less.\n  This bill offers tax credits to businesses in the private sector that \nwould hire veterans. It guarantees servicemembers access to training \ndesigned to facilitate their transition to civilian life, and allows \nthem full use of the skills they have gained in service to our Nation, \nand it cuts through some of the bureaucratic redtape that has made it \ndifficult for veterans to get access to Federal resources.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, just as I was proud to \ncosponsor with Senator Murray of Washington the hiring heroes act this \nspring. We owe it to America to work more aggressively together, across \nthe aisle, in confronting this ongoing jobs crisis. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the VOW to Hire Heroes Act today.\n\n\n                     Obtaining Permanent Residency\n\n  Madam President, I also wish to take another few minutes to discuss a \nbill that I hope will pass the Senate later today on a similar topic. \nIt is a small bill addressing a complicated issue, but it will make a \nbig difference in the lives of many of our servicemembers.\n  When an American marries a foreign national, an immigrant, and that \nimmigrant decides he or she wants to become an American citizen, they \nbegin a process of obtaining permanent residency, of applying for and \nseeking a green card. Before the 2-year mark in that process, the \ncouple must fill out a form together and appear for an in-person \ninterview. You have a 90-day window to file that paperwork and another \n90 days to appear for this in-person interview together. Here is the \nproblem. What if you are in the military and deployed abroad. What if \nthe American in this couple is in a war zone and cannot make it back to \nthe United States in that limited, tightly defined 90-day window for an \nin-person interview. You might miss your opportunity for you and your \nspouse to have the interview and secure his or her green card in this \nUnited States.\n  Our soldiers, in my view, have enough to worry about without adding \nthis to the list. The bill we will offer later today is a simple fix. \nMy colleague, Senator Graham of South Carolina, and I have introduced a \nbill that Congresswoman Zoey Lofgren introduced in the House earlier \nthis year. It would give our servicemembers the flexibility to wait \nuntil after their deployments have concluded in order to conduct these \nin-person interviews. That measure passed the House of Representatives \n426 to 0. It is my hope it will also pass this Senate unanimously \ntonight.\n  We are blessed in this Nation to be served by volunteers, by men and \nwomen who go to the other side of the world to serve us in the interest \nof freedom. The two bills I have spoken of here on the floor today are \nthings that we can and should do together across the aisle to advance \ntheir interests in having the enjoyment of liberty for which they \nsacrificed so much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nremarks from the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin, and the \nSenator from Indiana, Mr. Coats, that I be recognized as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7328-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7328-S7336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EPA DEADLINE EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very real \nproblem, making sure that we do everything we can to protect jobs, \nsafeguard our environment, and make sure utility companies can provide \nreliable and affordable electricity from our domestic resources. There \nare two EPA rules that are at the heart of this issue. One is the \nutility MACT rule, which would require a decrease in mercury emissions \nat powerplants, and the cross-State air pollution rule, which would \nrequire powerplants to lower emissions of pollutants that may reduce \nair quality in neighboring States.\n  Some utilities have already complied with these rules. Many have not. \nYou can put the blame for the past sins on anybody and everybody, and \nwe seem to do it well here from time to time. This is not what we are \nhere for today.\n  My good colleague and my friend from Indiana will be speaking after \nme. This is truly a bipartisan effort trying to bring reasonability and \ncommon sense to this subject. But we have proven here in this body time \nand again that you truly cannot fix it if you blame people for it. What \nwe intend to do with our legislation is truly fix the problem.\n  Let me be clear. I believe both of these rules aim to accomplish \nimportant objectives. But as they are written, they are nearly \nimpossible to realize. If we do not extend the deadline for utilities \nto responsibly comply, we are going to lose the jobs and the \nreliability of the electricity we depend upon, and that hike of rates \nto consumers will be unimaginable. So we need to find a balance with \nour economy and the environment. That is why I am proud to stand today \nwith my friend Senator Coats, a Republican from Indiana, to offer a \ncommonsense solution to this problem, and to move forward with \nresponsible, reasonable legislation that would get plants in \ncompliance.\n  We are offering a bill today which is called the Fair Compliance Act \nof 2011, which has broad support from labor and industry and across the \naisle. It is rare for so many groups with different points of view to \ncome together behind a bill, but let me give you a list of some of our \nsupporters: the Building and Construction Trades, the International \nBrotherhood of Boilermakers, International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers, United Mine Workers of America, AES, American Electric Power, \nEnerfab, the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, to name a few.\n  I believe this bill provides a reasonable, responsible extension of \nthe deadlines, while also protecting our most important priority, our \nenvironment and our responsibility to the environment, the reliability \nof our electric grid, the consumers who have to buy energy and can only \nafford to pay a reasonable price, using our own domestic resources so \nthat we depend less on foreign energy and, most importantly, the \nthousands of jobs that are on the line.\n  I yield the floor for my friend from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Manchin, for joining with me to produce a bipartisan, \ncommonsense solution that is supported by both industry and labor, a \npiece of legislation that will ensure that the provision established \nthrough the Clean Air Act relative to the emissions of sulfur dioxide, \nnitrous oxide, mercury, and other emissions will not be reduced and \neliminated.\n  We do nothing to stop the progress that has been made over many years \nin regard to cleaning up our air. We should be proud as Americans that \nwe have taken the steps necessary to produce a cleaner environment, to \neliminate toxic pollutants in the air. Over $100 billion has been spent \nby industry to retrofit their energy-producing plants with equipment \nthat reduces and eliminates these pollutants. So we are not here today \nto advocate in favor of pumping more toxins into the air. We are here \ntoday to say we need a reasonable provision in place that would allow \nthese industries to continue to spend the billions of dollars they are \nspending and do it in a timely manner so that we can reach the goal \nestablished through the Clean Air Act and other regulations.\n  But I think this current regulation we had a vote on--the Paul \nresolution--less than an hour ago, which came close to passing, now \nsets the stage for this particular provision, which the Senator from \nWest Virginia, Joe Manchin, and I have cosponsored.\n  The Fair Compliance Act simply says that we want to continue to meet \nthose standards, but we need to do it in a time-sensitive way so that \nindustry can comply with the necessary procedures to arrange the plans, \nhire the contractors, and install the equipment. The timeline proposed \nby the EPA is\n\n[[Page S7329]]\n\nsimply unattainable, unreasonable, and punitive. It costs jobs and \nmoney. Furthermore, it negatively impacts these necessary energy-\nproducing facilities in the United States that are critical to our \neconomy and employment. What we need now is an extension of 2 years on \none of the provisions and 3 years on the other so that companies can \naddress these rules together.\n  For those who have indicated on the floor in previous debate that we \nare undermining and undercutting regulations from going forward to \nreduce contaminants in the air, that is absolutely incorrect. We are \nensuring that these will take place in a reasonable way that won't cost \nus jobs and further harm our economy.\n  Just to repeat something and to ask my colleague from West Virginia, \nmy understanding is that this has significant labor and industry \nsupport. My colleague has outlined a number of industries and a number \nof labor unions that have supported this.\n  I know there is some concern that the utilities have avoided these \nrules in the past--that has been alleged--although they have spent over \n$100 billion in compliance. And some say this is just another delaying \ntactic. I ask my colleague, what would he say to people who object to \nthis legislation on those grounds?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator that that \nquestion has been out there, and the naysayers are saying we should not \ndelay it longer or extend it any more. This has gone through a real \nstoried past, if you will. It had been repealed by previous \nadministrations, it had gone through a court system and was overturned, \nand we are back where we are.\n  They are going to say: Well, some of them have complied and some \nhaven't. There is ample time.\n  We can sit here--and we have talked and we have watched, in the last \nyear, the blame game. That doesn't work. We haven't fixed a thing in \nthis body this year by blaming the other side or blaming a previous \nadministration or some other partisan group. We have a chance, with \nwhat the Senator and I have teamed up on, to fix this.\n  The only thing I would say, which the Senator eloquently laid out, is \nthat a 2-year extension on one to comply, not just to extend and \nforgive--we are not asking to reduce in any way possible or to amend \nthe Clean Air Act. We want it in force, and we want to do it with the \nenergy we have used for the last century--it is domestic, and it is a \nfossil fuel. We have cleaned up the air in West Virginia by putting \nscrubbers and SCRs on boilers to the tune of 89 percent within the last \ntwo decades. We can do a lot more.\n  What we are allowing now is to bring plants into compliance without \nshocking the system. The shock is this: The cost, if I may quote this--\neven by EPA's own estimate, they peg the cost--if this rule is not \nextended so that we can comply, it will cost $2.4 billion. Who do you \nthink will pay that? It will be your consumers, your constituents, and, \nmost importantly, people who cannot afford it. It is putting a burden \non, it is challenging jobs that rely on reliable, dependable, and \naffordable energy so that they can compete globally. It is knocking us \nout of the market to compete. Why would we shoot ourselves in the foot \neconomically?\n  We can work within the Clean Air Act and comply with it, and it \ndoesn't make any of these rules less stringent. We are not saying relax \nit. We are just saying: Let us comply. Don't blame what happened in the \npast. Let's fix what is before us right now.\n  That is what I would say to my good friend.\n  If I may, I will ask my good friend a question. What has he heard \nfrom the utilities in Indiana about the EPA's current timeline? What \nhave they told the Senator?\n  Mr. COATS. I thank my friend for asking me that question, and I thank \nhim so much for his answer to the previous question. I have visited \nthose utilities. Let me mention one.\n  Tanners Creek is down along the Ohio River. It is a facility that \nwill have to retire many units under this proposal, at the cost of more \nthan 60 jobs. These types of closures may result in increased energy \ncosts for consumers and the loss of electricity that will flow into the \ngrid, potentially causing blackouts or interruptions in electric \nsupply.\n  They are good citizens. They have plans to deal with their plants, to \ncomply with these regulations. But they need more time to do it. They \nhave also said: If we have to do this immediately, with all the plants \nall across the country, there is a shortage of equipment and \ncontractors that are able to manufacture this type of equipment \nnecessary and install it. That will drive up costs.\n\n  As the Senator from West Virginia has said, all of this is borne on \nthe backs of the taxpayers, those who receive utility bills, whether \nfor residences or companies that receive bills that are producing in \nthe Midwest. The Senator's State and my State--we make big stuff, such \nas cars, locomotives, airplanes, major airplane parts, and big \nmachines--things at the industrial heart of America. So it takes a lot \nof energy to produce the kinds of products that are made in our States.\n  To have a sudden spike in utility costs at a time when our economy is \nstruggling is the worst thing we could do in this economy. While this \namendment is not designed to specifically address that issue, it \ncertainly helps us as we work our way through the downturn in the \neconomy that has kept people out of work and kept our economy from \ngrowing as it should.\n  This is just another blow to the manufacturing industry in the \nMidwest, particularly in terms of hiring and in terms of being \ncompetitive and making a product. So the industries have come forward \nand said: We will comply, and we have complied--$100 billion-plus in \ncompliance, which is a record to date. It will be continued as we go \nforward. We are simply asking for a sensible timeframe in which to do \nthis.\n  In conclusion--and then I will turn it back to my friend--to my \ncolleagues, I simply say that the allegation that this undermines what \nwe are trying to do relative to providing clean air for American \ncitizens to breathe is exaggerated and not true. Our bill requires \ncompliance with the Clean Air Act, and it does not take away any \nregulation relative to these emissions that are poured into the air out \nof our utilities.\n  It is a bipartisan bill. This is not something that divides us on a \npartisan basis. It has industry support and labor support. It ensures \nfull compliance with the Clean Air Act and reduction levels through \nregulations. It ensures that we won't have energy disruptions and \nblackouts and grid problems. It keeps jobs, and it spreads out the \ncosts so that utility payers aren't hit with the shock of an increase \nin their bills. And the time to do it is set in a way that it will be \naccomplished within a more reasonable period of time. It synchronizes \nthe two rules on reductions of emissions, the sulfur and nitrous oxide, \nas well as mercury and other toxins, so utilities can make the \nnecessary changes at the same time.\n  We urge our colleagues to look at the details of the bill and study \nthis. I see no reason why those who are concerned just about the \nenvironment and those who might be concerned just about the production \ncapacity can't come together in a compromise and achieve the ends they \nboth want to meet.\n  With that, I yield the floor and turn it back to my colleague. I \nthank him for his work in this process. We have been working together \nto do this in a way that both sides can support.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank my good friend, the Senator from Indiana, Mr. \nCoats, for his diligence in working on this issue. In the greatest \nNation on Earth, not to have an energy policy is wrong. It is also \nwrong to be so insecure--or less secure, if you will--by depending on \nforeign oil as we have. We know the results we are faced with now.\n  We are saying: Let us comply and make sure we are working in harmony \nwith the environment and the economy. We can make that happen within a \nreasonable amount of time. That is all we have asked for. We are not \nasking to make the rules less stringent or to forget about them and \nthrow caution to the wind. We know jobs and the economy are at stake. \nWe know that, basically, the security of the Nation is at stake. But \nuntil we find a fuel of the future, we need to use what we have right \nhere in America. Coal has supplied energy for a hundred years and will \ndo so until we find a fuel that will replace it that is dependable, \nreliable,\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\nand affordable. So what we are asking for is something that is \nreasonable, and we are not blaming anything.\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 927, AS MODIFIED\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Reid for \nTester amendment No. 927 be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 927), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike title II and insert the following:\n\n                      TITLE II--VOW TO HIRE HEROES\n\n     SEC. 201.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding that I have as much as 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate very much what has been described. \nPerhaps people can look at this in terms of the overregulation we are \ndoing in this country, the fact that there is a direct relationship \nbetween the amount of revenue that comes into the government and the \namount of regulations.\n  I have always used this--in fact, it is still permissible to use it. \nAccording to OMB, for each 1 percent addition to the GDP, it creates an \nadditional $50 billion of revenue. There are other ways of doing it \nother than tax increases.\n  To turn it around, look at what this administration has done. They \nhave regulations such as the greenhouse gas regulation, which would be \nbetween a $300 billion and $400 bill loss each year. The ozone--which \nthey postponed, but nevertheless they proposed it--would be $676 \nbillion in lost GDP. You can do your math on that. For each 1 percent--\nand 1 percent is $140 billion--for each 1 percent, it would be about a \n$50 billion loss in revenue. Boiler MACT is a $1 billion loss in GDP. \nUtility MACT, which is what they have been talking about, across State \nlines, is $140 billion in compliance costs. Cement MACT--all of these \nare huge losers in terms of revenue that can be generated.\n  So I would only like to say--and I wish I had time to get into more \ndetail on this--that shortly we will be voting on McCain amendment No. \n928. It has a lot of great features in it, but one that has been almost \noverlooked is the feature that would take away the jurisdiction of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases. This was \nthe Upton-Inhofe bill. My bill, actually, was tested here, and we had a \nmajority of people who were in support of it. It passed overwhelmingly \nin the House of Representatives.\n  So part of this amendment addresses what would have been done by the \nWaxman-Markey bill, which would cost us, not just once but every year, \nbetween $300 billion and $400 billion. The big question was, since the \nPresident could not get this body to pass a bill on cap and trade, he \ndecided he would do it through regulation. But doing it through \nregulation would still cost between $300 billion and $400 billion a \nyear. So what they had to do was to come up with an endangerment \nfinding.\n  That endangerment finding was based on flawed science. In fact, we \nhave a recent response to a request by the IG of the EPA who said, in \nfact, that was true--that the science on which this was based was \nfaulty science. So after we realized that--and everyone else realized \nit--we went back to these people who were on record opposing the \nlegislation regulating greenhouse gases and tried to get a bill passed \nthat would take away the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection \nAgency to regulate greenhouse gases. So that is what this was all \nabout.\n  We were not able to get that, but that provision is in amendment No. \n928 by Senator McCain and others. I hope people will realize, in \naddition to those things being talked about, and the new jobs that \nwould come with the passage of that amendment, there is also this \nprovision which would be a huge boost to our economy and would \neliminate an unnecessary tax increase of between $300 billion and $400 \nbillion a year.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7336-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7336-S7346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               3% WITHHOLDING REPEAL AND JOB CREATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 15 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 927\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, the economy has hit us all hard. Montanans \nwho have done everything right are losing their jobs, and some are even \nlosing their homes. To get the economy back on track we need to employ \nsome common sense. We need to put politics aside, and we need to work \ntogether on behalf of the struggling families across this country.\n  In particular, we need to do the right thing on behalf of our men and \nwomen who have served our Nation in uniform. The unemployment rate for \nyounger veterans who have served since September 11, 2001, continues to \nremain well above average. It is unacceptably high and is getting \nworse. It is a national disgrace. Our service men and women deserve \nbetter.\n  These men and women left the comforts of home and put their lives on \nhold to fight for us in some of the harshest conditions imaginable. Far \ntoo many have paid the ultimate sacrifice, while thousands continue to \nstruggle with the wounds of war--those seen and those unseen. They face \ndaily challenges many of us can never fully comprehend, and they have \nendured sacrifices we can never fully repay. Many of them served \nmultiple tours. Even the Montana National Guard's largest unit was sent \nto Iraq twice in the last 8 years. That is a long time--especially for \na Reserve component--to be away from home. But they carried out their \nassignments as the best-trained, most professional military in the \nworld. And for that we are proud and we are grateful.\n  When I visited Iraq and Afghanistan earlier this year, I was \nprotected by some of the most well-trained, professional, and downright \ninspirational men and women our country has ever produced. I recall in \none instance standing at a command operating base looking out over a \nvalley in Afghanistan where, months earlier, the Taliban had run \nroughshod. I thought about how difficult the conditions were for the \nyoung men and women who were there wearing the uniform of our country, \nstanding shoulder to shoulder with members of the Afghan Army.\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\n  In the hours we were there, I did not hear one complaint, only \ncommitment and pride in their work from our troops. I will never forget \nthat. If we fail to do right by them, what does that say about us?\n  Simply put, we have a responsibility to provide for all veterans and \ntheir families. It is something I have never taken lightly, and it is \nsomething that continues to motivate me every single day. It means \nproviding them with the best services and care, and it means giving \nthem every opportunity to succeed and empowering them with the tools \nthey need to find good-paying jobs.\n  The legislation before us today does exactly that. It would provide \nimportant tax credits to encourage more employers to hire veterans who \nare out of work. It would provide additional education and job training \nfor veterans to gain additional skills to be more successful in an \nincreasingly competitive job market. It would take important steps to \nhelp ease the transition between military service and the civilian \nworkforce.\n  Let me give an example of how this bill would directly affect one of \nmy constituents. A chap by the name of Nathan Wiens grew up in Glasgow, \nMT, a small town in the northeastern corner of the State. He attended \nMontana State University on an ROTC scholarship, earned a degree in \ncivil engineering, and was deployed to Iraq as a captain in the Army. \nDuring his years in the Army, Nathan used his engineering degree. But \nwhen he came home, his military experience did not count toward his \nprofessional engineering certification. Now Nathan has to spend a \ncouple of years building up the civilian equivalent of the military \nexperience he already has just to be able to qualify to become a \ncertified professional engineer. This bill will help fix it so that \nmilitary experience counts.\n  This bill says if someone spends 6 years in the Army driving a truck, \nthey ought to be able to get their commercial driver's license a whole \nlot faster than someone who does not have that experience.\n  It would require the Department of Labor, in conjunction with the VA \nand the Department of Defense, to take a hard look at what military \nskills and training should be translatable to the civilian sector. It \nwould make it easier to get these licenses and certifications that our \nveterans need.\n  This bill will give employers valuable information about the skill \nsets our veterans have gained while they have served in the military. \nThese are the kinds of commonsense ideas we should be taking a look at. \nIt is the responsible thing to do for America's veterans.\n  It would not surprise anyone this proposal has ideas from both \nDemocrats and Republicans because this is an issue that shouldn't be \npartisan. Every Member of the Senate should be committed to helping \nveterans find jobs.\n  Montana has more veterans per capita than any other State in the \nUnion, except Alaska. We have 103,000 veterans in Montana. As I travel \nacross the State and visit with them and their families, the topic of \nveterans employment remains at the forefront of their minds. It is \nimportant to them. It is important to their friends and loved ones. It \nis important to our communities. It should be important to each and \nevery one of us.\n  We deal with a lot of contentious issues here, but this should not be \none of them. Let's work together to do the right thing and get this \nbill passed because it is the least we can do for those to whom we owe \nso much.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may ask for the \nyeas and nays on his amendment.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I first want to thank \nSenator Tester for his comments.\n  Mr. President, if we pass these two measures today, if we repeal the \n3-percent withholding and take steps to help our veterans find work, \nthe American people will win, and for 1 day at least partisanship will \nlose.\n  Veterans Day is tomorrow. So let's renew our commitment to the men \nand women who have answered the call of duty and who have fought for us \nand for our freedom and continue to do so.\n  Our returning heroes face a jobs crisis. We all know it. We hear \nabout it. It is as relevant in Massachusetts as it is in Montana and \nevery other State in this great country. We are here to make a \ndifference today, and that is what this bill will do. This bill will \ngive a much needed boost to the employment of veterans.\n  I earlier filed a hire a hero act, and I am glad it has been \nincorporated with the President's proposals and is moving forward \ntoday. The 3-percent withholding provision is also something I have \nbeen working on for many months as well. So I am glad these two bills \nare coming to fruition. It will give, as I said, a much needed boost to \nour unemployed heroes, and it will improve our veterans transitioning \nfrom military to civilian life.\n  I hope Congress will seize on this momentum and work in a bipartisan \nmanner to pass more jobs legislation. Contrary to what we read and hear \nfrom the media, there are things we can all agree on, and these are two \ngood examples.\n  So I say again, if we can do these two things--repeal the 3-percent \nwithholding and help our veterans--maybe it will usher in an era of \ngood will, with one good deed leading to another good deed, and so on, \nand so on. So let's end this stealth tax and do something meaningful \nfor our veterans. Let's start working together. Above all, let's put \nAmericans first because we are all Americans first.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Republican jobs \nplan. I think it is very important that the American people know there \nare different visions about how we would create jobs in this country, \nwhether the jobs should be created by the private sector or the jobs \nshould be created by borrowing money from China, taxing us more, and \nthen redistributing that money into government-created jobs.\n  There are different visions in this country about how we create jobs. \nThe one thing we know is, we need millions of jobs--not tens of \nthousands of jobs but millions of jobs.\n  What I ask the President to do is to come in from the campaign trail \nand talk to us. I think he needs to be here, not raising money, not out \nfundraising for his campaign, not bashing Republicans on the campaign \ntrail. He needs to be in Washington. He needs to be engaged with the \ncommittee, the supercommittee. He needs to be engaged with Republican \ncounterparts.\n  I have told the President, personally, I will work with him. I will \ncome from the Republican side of the aisle, and we can figure out areas \nin which we agree. There are many aspects of the Republican jobs plan \nthat some Democrats have said they might support: Reducing the \ncorporate income tax, lowering the rates, and eliminating loopholes.\n  The thing is, on the campaign trail, we are told Republicans are \nunwilling to eliminate loopholes for millionaires who don't pay taxes. \nThe truth is, we are very willing. This has been offered in the \nsupercommittee. It has been offered by our side. It is offered in the \nRepublican jobs plan. We are willing to eliminate loopholes that make \nthe Tax Code unfair, that allow either millionaires or corporations to \npay no taxes. But we want to do it in the context of tax reform.\n  There are a couple things historically that government has done that \nhas created jobs. In the 1960s, President Kennedy reduced the top rate \nfrom 90 to 70.\n\n[[Page S7338]]\n\nUnemployment was cut in half. In the 1980s, Reagan lowered the top rate \nfrom 70 to 50. Unemployment was cut in half. Reagan again lowered the \ntop rate from 50 to 28, and unemployment was cut in half.\n  Interestingly, through all these rate cuts of the top taxpayers, as \nwe cut the rates, tax revenue didn't go down. Tax revenue has stayed \nabout 18 percent of GDP no matter what the rates are. But what lowering \nthe top rates does is it spawns economic activity.\n  So I ask the President to come in from the campaign trail, to come in \nfrom his Canadian bus tour, and talk to us on the Hill--talk to us \nabout ways we could create jobs again. We need millions of jobs. \nFourteen million Americans are out of work. Two million Americans have \nlost their jobs since this President came into the White House.\n  They say the definition of ``insanity'' is doing the same thing over \nand over and expecting a different result. We need conversation on \nCapitol Hill between Republicans and Democrats, but we also need \nleadership from the White House. Continuing to bash us on the campaign \ntrail is getting us nowhere as a country.\n  A couple things I have heard from the President as he has campaigned \naround the country: One, he said Republicans are too stupid to \nunderstand his plan, so he is going to break up his jobs plan and give \nit to us in pieces because we can't understand the whole thing.\n  In diplomacy, they sometimes talk about the stick and the carrot. I \nam sure feeling the stick from the President, but I am not seeing a \ncarrot. What we need to have is conversation where we can bridge these \ndifferences and find some common ground.\n  We have a corporate income tax higher than anybody in the world. We \nkeep heaping new regulations onto our businesses. We need to lower our \ncorporate income tax. How can they compete? We worry about jobs going \noverseas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PAUL. I urge support of the Republican jobs plan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the legislation before the Senate is the \nlatest effort by Senate Democrats to pass portions of the President's \nAmerican Jobs Act that will boost the economy and put Americans back to \nwork. The underlying legislation will repeal a 3 percent withholding on \ncontractors that was designed to encourage contractors to pay their \ntaxes; and the amendment offered by my colleague from Montana, Senator \nTester, will help veterans by providing hiring incentives to employers \nwho hire our heroes and expanding education and training opportunities \nfor older veterans.\n  The 3 percent withholding on contractors was enacted in 2005 and, \nbecause of implementation problems, has never been put into effect. I \nhave heard from businesses in Michigan, universities in Michigan, \nmayors and countless others that this withholding provision is \nunworkable. Because Congress and the President recognize this problem, \nCongress has continued to delay its effective date.\n  The repeal of the 3 percent withholding requirement should be paid \nfor by finding other ways to promote tax fairness and improving tax \ncompliance. I have offered several of these proposals before. \nUnfortunately, rather than paying for this bill with measures to \npromote tax compliance and fairness, it is paid for by revising the way \nthe modified adjusted gross income is calculated in determining \neligibility for health care programs. According to the Joint Tax \nCommittee and the Congressional Budget Office, this means that \nsomewhere between 500,000 and a million people receiving early retiree, \ndisability, and other social security benefits will no longer be \neligible for Medicaid. If changes in income eligibility for Medicaid \nneed to be considered, then any savings from those changes should be \nreinvested back into Medicaid to strengthen our health care system. I \nbelieve it is unwise to take savings from health care programs to pay \nfor the repeal of the 3 percent withholding requirement. This \nlegislation does do some important things to help America's veterans \nwho continue to face big challenges even after leaving the battlefield. \nVeterans comprise almost 10 percent of the U.S. population. While \noverall employment of veterans has been at or below the national \naverage, those veterans who have served in the past decade have seen \ntheir unemployment rate rise to above the national average. Male \nveterans aged 18-24 had an unemployment rate of almost 22 percent in \n2010. Almost 12 percent of all homeless adults are veterans. It is a \nnational embarrassment that we are failing to serve those who have \nserved us.\n  This bill will provide business tax credits for the hiring of \nveterans, including those with disabilities. The tax credit is scaled \nto increase depending on how long that veteran has been unemployed. The \nbill also helps unemployed veterans pay for school and provides \nVocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits for disabled \nveterans. And finally, the bill allows active servicemembers to begin \npursuing federal employment opportunities prior to separation from the \nmilitary, easing their transition from the military to jobs at the VA, \nHomeland Security or other federal agencies that would benefit from the \nexperience a veteran offers.\n  Because it will help to hire veterans, who have sacrificed so much to \nhelp our country, and repeals the 3 percent withholding requirement, I \nwill vote for the bill although the health care eligibility changes are \nthe wrong way to pay for.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 928\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \nprovisions contained within the amendment offered by Senator Tester, as \nthey will make critical strides in addressing the reality that far too \nmany of our Nation's veterans are finding it difficult--if not \nimpossible--to find work in the civilian job market after they leave \nmilitary service. Senator Tester's amendment is illustrative of how our \nNation's government should work, as it contains ideas from both bodies \nof Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, and the executive branch.\n  Over the past year, I have been particularly pleased to support many \nof the concepts contained within this amendment in other forms. I \njoined Senator Patty Murray, chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nin June by cosponsoring the Hiring Heroes Act, which is the source of a \ngreat number of the sections of this amendment. I am also gratified to \nsee that this amendment contains the President's September proposal to \noffer tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed and disabled \nveterans. As I said then, providing tax incentives for these hires is \nan excellent means of fostering job creation--in this case, it has the \nadded benefit of helping to address veteran unemployment rates.\n  Earlier this week, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta held a \nroundtable on veteran unemployment in which he noted that today's \nnewest veterans--the men and women who have risked their health and \ntheir very lives by serving in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, and other \nparts of the world--are ``the next greatest generation''' which have \n``dedicated themselves to serving this country.''\n  On this point, Secretary Panetta could not be more correct. As a \nsenior member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have \nhad no higher privilege than witnessing firsthand our exceptional \nservicemen and women on the frontlines in Afghanistan and Iraq. Their \nsteadfast courage, leadership, and dedication ensures that our armed \nforces are second to none and the finest on the planet.\n  Yet despite their extraordinary commitment to this Nation, \nunparalleled technical and practical skills, and remarkable \ncapabilities demonstrated under the most difficult conditions possible, \ntoo many of our Nation's veterans remain unemployed today.\n  Indeed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' October 2011 \nreport, post-9/11 veterans have had a particularly challenging time \nfinding employment, with more than 12 percent of them currently \nunemployed. Not only is this number far too high, but it greatly \nexceeds the nation's unemployment level for nonveterans. Our youngest \nveterans--those between ages 18 and 24--are experiencing even greater \ndifficulty finding jobs, with unemployment rates exceeding 20 percent.\n  For our veterans--and our Nation--such statistics are nothing less \nthan a travesty. And that is why I so strongly support the efforts of \nthis Chamber to lend a well-deserved helping hand to our veterans in \ntheir efforts to find employment. Indeed, when it comes to securing a \njob, is there any question that we all should be fighting for those who \nhave so nobly fought for America?\n  The amendment before the Senate today is a crucial effort to do so. \nSome of its provisions will ensure that our servicemembers receive \nassistance in preparing for their transition to life as a civilian, \nlooking for a job, and identifying good career options. Other \nprovisions will establish a pioneering effort to identify equivalencies \nbetween the skills our servicemen and women develop in the military and \nthe qualifications required for civilian employment. Still other \nsections will extend the opportunity for servicemembers and veterans to \nreceive supplemental rehabilitation and vocational benefits, providing \nthem additional time to prepare for the job market.\n  Efforts such as these are imperative in order to allow our veterans \nto prepare to be competitive in today's job market. Other items in this \namendment, such as tax credits of up to $9,600 for each unemployed or \ndisabled veteran hired by a business, offer further help by encouraging \ncompanies to give our veterans the chance they deserve to work.\n  As Secretary Panetta said at the recent roundtable, ``the best thing \nwe could do to honor those that have served is to make sure that when \nthey come back, they have some opportunity to be able to become a part \nof our society and not just wind up on the unemployment rolls.'' \nStriving to increase those opportunities is the absolute least we \nshould do.\n  In that light, I strongly believe we should take all reasonable steps \npossible to provide our servicemembers and veterans with the training \nthey need to make the transition into the civilian workforce. We should \nalso do all we can to encourage companies to hire veterans returning \nfrom Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world.\n  For these reasons, I am very pleased to see the Senate considering \nthe Tester amendment today. At the same time, it is my practice to vote \n``present'' on legislation which contains the potential or appearance \nof association with the private business activity of my spouse. As \nsuch, and in consultation with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, I \nvoted ``present'' in this particular instance, despite my overwhelming \nsupport for the vast majority of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, over the past year, I have been pleased to support \nmany of the concepts contained in H.R. 674, as amended and passed by \nthe Senate today. This June, I joined Senator Patty Murray, chair of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, by cosponsoring the Hiring Heroes Act, \nwhich is the source of a great number of provisions in this bill \nintended to address the high unemployment rate of our Nation's \nveterans. This bill also now contains the President's proposal to offer \ntax credits to businesses that hire unemployed and disabled veterans--I \nhave supported this proposal since the President announced it in \nSeptember, and I continue to believe that providing tax incentives to \nbusinesses for hiring veterans is an excellent means of fostering job \ncreation while helping to address veteran unemployment rates.\n  And of course, I could not be more pleased to have helped to author \nthe repeal of the 3 percent withholding provision that is at the heart \nof H.R. 674. This provision will greatly aid small businesses that are \nhard-hit by current law requirements that withhold a portion of \npayments to contractors until they pay taxes on the earnings. By \nrepealing this mandate, which threatens to overburden business owners \nand taxpayers alike, and stifle the economy at a time when we cannot \nafford any unnecessary obstacles in the road to recovery, H.R. 674 will \nhelp businesses, their owners, and their employees all over our Nation.\n  For these reasons, I was gratified to see the Senate pass H.R. 674 \ntoday. However, it is my practice to vote ``present'' on legislation \nwhich contains the potential or appearance of association with the \nprivate business activity of my spouse. As such, and in consultation \nwith the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, I voted ``present'' in this \nparticular instance, despite my overwhelming support for the vast \nmajority of this bill.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I was unavoidably detained for \nrollcall vote No. 204, passage of H.R. 674 as amended. This legislation \nrepeals the imposition of 3 percent withholding on certain payments \nmade to vendors by government agencies. It also includes an amendment I \nsupported to provide our veterans with greater job opportunities in \ntoday's difficult economy.\n  Had I been present for rollcall vote No. 204, I would have voted yea \non final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nafter my remarks of no more than 12 minutes, that Senator Coburn be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes, and then Senator Harkin be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Ohio's Election Results\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, on Tuesday, Ohio, my State, made \nhistory. Overwhelmingly, Ohio voters made a simple choice between what \nis right and what is wrong. They answered the question at the heart of \nany election: Whose side are you on?\n  Tuesday, Ohioans showed they stood with teachers and firefighters, \nwith police officers and nurses and librarians, and other public \nworkers and the middle class. They showed they want leaders focused on \ncreating jobs rather than taking potshots at people who teach, who plow \nour roads, who guard our prisons, who teach our children, and who \nsafeguard our public health. They showed they are ready to rebuild what \nwas once a national consensus: that our Nation's strength is rooted in \nthe strength of our middle class.\n  There used to be a consensus among educators and elected officials, \ncommunity leaders, and business leaders that our economy is designed to \nbuild a strong middle class, to help people become part of that middle \nclass. We used to see that consensus on Medicare and Pell grants, on \ncivil rights and women's rights, on tax and economic policy, and we \nused to have that consensus on collective bargaining rights.\n  Rights earned at the bargaining table provide a path to the middle \nclass for millions of workers who belong to unions and millions of \nworkers who do not belong to unions. Collective bargaining is the tool \nwe have had in this country for three-quarters of a century for labor \nand management relations in a democracy. Collective bargaining has \nhelped minimize strikes and work stoppages because it allows a process \nwhere people sit down at a table, talk to one another, disagree, come \nto agreement, come to a consensus, a process to resolve disputes.\n  In Ohio, balanced budgets and collective bargaining have coexisted \nfor nearly three decades. Collective bargaining not only strengthens \nmiddle-class jobs, it protects public health, and it protects community \nsafety. During the passage of the legislation called S. 5 earlier this \nyear, which was rammed through the legislature by the Republican \nGovernor and the Republican majority in the House and Senate, even \nthough a number of Republicans dissented on it, I had a roundtable in a \nchurch right on Capitol Square in Columbus.\n  A young teacher said to me from the Columbus suburbs: You know, when \nI sit at the bargaining table and bargain on behalf of my teachers, I \ndo not just bargain for better wages and higher and better pensions and \nhealth care. She said: I also bargain for class size because I know my \ncolleagues can teach better and students can learn better if class \nsizes are smaller.\n  Then a police officer said: When I bargain, I not only bargain for \nbetter wages, of course, and better benefits for my members, the \nFraternal Order of Police, I also bargain for safety vests because it \nmatters to me that the men and women who wear the badge work in the \nsafest possible conditions.\n  But somewhere along the way we lost this consensus that we once had \nin this country. From what we have seen at statehouses across the \ncountry, you would think teachers and nurses, you would think \nsanitation workers and firefighters, you would think police officers \nand librarians caused the fiscal crisis and the budget deficit.\n  We hear Governors around the country, we hear Washington pundits talk \nabout the privileged class of public sector workers. Now who is playing \nclass warfare, when, in fact, they go after public workers to the point \nthat I have heard young teachers tell me--and I have heard parents who \nhave kids in college at Bowling Green or Akron U or University of \nToledo or Xavier say: You know, my daughter or my son were going to be \nteachers. But I am not sure they want to be with the attacks that the \nGovernor and conservative politicians have made against teachers.\n  So who are these privileged elite who have been attacked by \nconservative politicians? They are the people who clear snow off our \nstreets. They are the people who run into burning buildings to save \npeople and property. They are the people who teach our children. So \nlet's be clear. It was recklessness on Wall Street that caused the \nfinancial crisis, not teachers, not librarians, not mental health \ncounselors, not sanitation workers, not cafeteria workers at Mansfield \nSenior High. It is a crisis made worse by our Nation's economic tilt \naway from manufacturing.\n  Thirty years ago, more than 25 percent of the GDP in our country was \nin manufacturing. Only about 10 percent was financial services. That \nhas almost flipped now. Financial services is about one-quarter of our \nGDP, and manufacturing is only 10 or 11 percent. You know what it has \ndone in your home State of Missouri, Madam President, what this means \nfor middle-class workers. We have moved far too much into\n\n[[Page S7348]]\n\nfinancial services because of government policy and far too much away \nfrom manufacturing.\n  States face budget crises because people do not have jobs--do not \nhave these good-paying jobs and cannot pay taxes, so the revenue does \nnot come. Yet instead of a balanced approach to State fiscal problems, \nwe have had an ideologically motivated approach to destroy collective \nbargaining.\n  In the elections last year in my State, 1 year ago this week, there \nwas a sweep, as there was in some other States, of Republicans all \nsaying: Put us in office and we will fix this problem with all of the \nlost jobs. They won, in large part, because of lost jobs. That is what \nelections are about. Yet almost from the beginning, the Governor and \nthe radicals in the legislature in my State did not do a lot about \njobs. What they did a lot of was attacking collective bargaining \nrights. They attacked women's rights. They attacked voting rights.\n  That is not what we should be doing. We should be working together in \njob creation. They seem, in many ways, more interested in payback than \nin progress. That is not shared sacrifice. As the middle class didn't \nhappen on its own, it will not unravel on its own either.\n  Tuesday, Ohioans took an important step in protecting the very rights \nof collective bargaining that people of all stripes in our country have \nenjoyed for 75, 80, 85 years. It is an important step in protecting the \nvery collective bargaining right that created our middle class.\n  Our mission is to continue to build a strong middle class and help \npeople become part of the middle class. It is about creating jobs and \nfairness. For too long there has been class warfare in this country, \nwaged from the top, aimed at the middle class. When the wealthiest \npeople in this country continue to do better and better, and the wide \nswath of people in the middle--70 to 90 percent--have barely had a pay \nincrease in 10 years, you know that is what happened. They love to say \nthat our side commits class warfare. What has happened is they have \ncommitted the class warfare, we are just pointing it out. The class \nwarfare they have committed has been class warfare waged from the top \nand aimed at the middle class.\n  That is a big reason we have seen this decline in the middle class. \nTuesday, this week, Ohio pushed back, and we will continue to do so \nbecause this Nation is exceptional, because of our continued struggle \nto form a more perfect union, where opportunity grows and expands for \nall. It is not restricted to a privileged few. We do so because we are \na nation and my State is a State that speaks more loudly and fights \nharder and stands up for the dignity and the honor of fair play.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Harkin, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Medicare and You\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, myself and Senator Barrasso are two of the \nthree doctors in the Senate. Both of us have practiced for over 25 \nyears. We have put out several reports. Every year, Medicare recipients \nreceive a message from Medicare, called ``Medicare and You.'' What we \nthought we would do is come to the floor and tell our colleagues, as \nwell as the American people, that we also put out a ``Medicare and \nYou'' report. There is a lot that wasn't in the ``Medicare and You'' \nreport this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a colloquy between myself and the \nSenator from Wyoming, Dr. Barrasso, as to what we are reporting in our \nMedicare and You statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. This booklet, which will be available on \ncoburn.senate.gov and barrasso.senate.gov to every Medicare patient out \nthere, explains what has actually happened to Medicare in the last year \nand a half. It explains that $530 billion has been cut out of Medicare. \nIt explains the physician reimbursement cuts were not addressed when we \naddressed health care and, consequently, a 27-percent cut is coming if \nCongress doesn't change that.\n  It explains that Medicare Advantage--both the options and the number \nof people eligible for that--has been taken away by the Affordable Care \nAct. It explains that the CLASS Act was put in to save money, but it \nwon't, and it has now been abandoned by the administration. The fact is \nthere is an independent payment advisory board, whose sole purpose is \nto cut payments for Medicare procedures and supplies and drugs to save \nmoney--even when that will instigate the loss of available drugs.\n  Finally, it creates a $10 billion trust fund for an innovation center \nthat is a smokescreen for a rationing board very similar to the IPAB.\n  I want Dr. Barrasso to go over the Medicare cuts now, if he will.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank Dr. Coburn for \nhis significant leadership in this area. Medicare patients all across \nthe country are getting a thick book--150 pages or so. In Wyoming, it \nis about 150 pages, and it is called ``Medicare and You, 2012.''\n  Under Dr. Coburn's leadership, we have prepared a report, also called \n``Medicare and You, 2012,'' but it is, as I do week after week, a \nsecond opinion about the big book people are getting at home. The cover \nis quite distinct from the book that goes to other Medicare patients \naround the country, because this starts by saying ``Your Medicare \nProgram was cut $530 billion by President Obama's controversial health \ncare law and used for a brand new program for someone else.''\n  That is the fundamental problem here. When we talk about Medicare, we \nthink of our parents and others, and I think of so many of my patients \non Medicare. We need to strengthen Medicare. What this administration \ndid by taking $530 billion from the health care law has not \nstrengthened Medicare; it devastated Medicare and our seniors on \nMedicare to the point where the Medicare Actuary said the funding will \nbe exhausted by 2016--5 years from now. We go through that in this \nreport.\n  My concern is that my patients and Dr. Coburn's patients will see \ntheir health care impacted by a denial of care, by care being refused \nbecause of the limitations within the law and the significant impact on \nphysicians, hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, and home health \nagencies, which are a lifeblood for seniors, all as a result of what we \nhave seen passed and signed into law by this President.\n  It is interesting, because we recently heard from the Senator from \nOhio, who talked about the vote in Ohio on Tuesday. What was not \nbrought up is that there was another ballot initiative specifically \nrelated to the Obama health care law. Those same people he was praising \nso much also voted by 2 to 1--a margin of over a million voters--that \nthey did not want the Obama health care mandate to apply to them. This \nis no surprise, and the popularity of this health care plan has \ncontinued to fall ever since it was signed into law.\n  I ask my colleague, Dr. Coburn, about some of the issues that will \nimpact not just the patients through the payment mechanism but their \nability to see a doctor under this Medicare change.\n  Mr. COBURN. The other thing Medicare recipients should recognize is \nthat under the laws as previously set, the reimbursement for your \nphysician in January is scheduled to decline 27 percent. When I talk to \nseniors in the State of Oklahoma, one of the No. 1 problems that \nsomebody turning 65 has is now finding that physician who will care for \nthem under the Medicare payment guidelines. What was never spoken of \nwas the fact that there was no fix in the health care bill for the very \nreal need to attract more physicians into caring for seniors.\n  As we have seen, Congress may or may not fix that--it is $300 billion \nto fix that. That is the cost of it. Whether we fix it or not, the fact \nis we are playing with the access of Medicare patients to care. Denied \naccess is denied care.\n  If you live in a community much like mine where no new doctors have \nbeen coming in because there is a shortage of primary care doctors, and \nthose who do come in will not take the lower reimbursement for Medicare \nbecause they cannot afford to, it may mean that you have to drive 70 \nmiles to get that care. That is not access, and it is\n\n[[Page S7349]]\n\nnot health care. It means you don't have available health care because \nthe government runs the program so poorly.\n  Let me finish up, since we don't want to go over our time. The other \nthing I want to talk about for a minute is this innovation center. In \nthe health care law, we set aside a $10 billion slush fund for \ninnovation in payment and procedures for Medicare patients. We are \ngoing to be spending $10 billion to figure out how to pay for it more \ncheaply and limit the combinations, or increase the combinations of \ncombining these things so that the reimbursements are less.\n  First of all, I don't understand why it is going to take $10 billion, \nbut it is a slush fund. No. 2 is that if you don't like the results of \nthat, there is nothing we can do about it except reverse the Affordable \nCare Act, Obamacare. No. 2, you can't sue. You have no injunctive \nrelief. You have no opportunity to express your desire in a court \nof law or through an administrative procedure to challenge their \nelimination of paying for certain procedures that may in fact save the \ncountry money but may in fact also hurt the very patients who are on \nMedicare.\n\n  We have this fund that we cannot find out anything about; no rules \nhave been put out on it, and we cannot find the details of it. Yet, we \nknow what the purpose of the fund is. It is like the IPAB fund. It is \ndesigned to ration the care that seniors need to control the cost of \nMedicare.\n  What do we know about Medicare? One dollar of every three dollars \nspent on Medicare doesn't help anybody get well and doesn't keep \nanybody from getting sick. The reason it doesn't work is because of the \ngovernment's mandate--we have all these stories about shortages of \ndrugs. The reason there are shortages of drugs in our country is \nbecause Medicare has mandated prices 90 percent of the time so low that \nwe only have one supplier. Some of them either have a technical problem \nor have decided to stop making a drug that is critical to our seniors \nbecause we have a price control bureaucracy.\n  There are large problems with the Medicare law. They need to be \nrecognized and addressed. They need to be fixed, and the last thing we \nought to do is spend $10 billion figuring out how not to get somebody \ntreatment, or lessen the availability of treatment through the \ninnovation council.\n  I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. We have talked about this. There is a program that his \npatients and mine have enjoyed, called Medicare Advantage, and there is \nan advantage for patients signing up for that program. About one in \nfour Americans on Medicare signs up for Medicare Advantage. The \nadvantages of this program are that it coordinates care, works with \npreventive care. Yet, the President has targeted that for elimination. \nBy 2017, half of the people on this program, who say they like and have \nit, will no longer be eligible to participate in it because of this \nhealth care law. We explain that to the American people in our second \nopinion on ``Medicare and You.''\n  Finally, Dr. Coburn talked about the IPAB, the Independent Payment \nBoard. It is a rationing board to me, a board designed to deny and \nrefuse care. These are unelected bureaucrats. They don't need to have a \nmedical background or don't necessarily need to see patients. It is \nspecifically related to cutting the amount of money that is paid for \npatients to have procedures, to see physicians, and to get the care \nthey need, which is why there is great concern throughout this country \nand why the President's health care law becomes more unpopular every \nday.\n  Mr. COBURN. If the Senator will yield for a moment, one of the \nreasons our cancer cure rates are a third better than England is \nbecause we don't have an IPAB and they do. The No. 1 reason survival \nrates from cancer in England are lower is because treatments are denied \nby their IPAB for the best treatments, which will save more people's \nlives at the best price. That is something that should not be \ndiscounted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. This health care law continues to be bad for patients, \nfor providers, for the doctors who take care of them, and it is bad for \nthe taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ntalk about a bipartisan bill that was recently passed out of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, the HELP Committee, \nwhich I chair and of which Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming is the ranking \nmember. This bipartisan bill reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 and would replace its current iteration, which \neveryone knows by the title of ``No Child Left Behind.'' I want to \nstart with a few words about the Federal role in education in this \ncountry since ESEA is a key part of that role.\n  While it is certainly true education is primarily a State and local \nfunction, the Federal Government does play an important role, and a \nwell-educated citizenry is clearly in the national interest. A central \nFederal role is to ensure all Americans, regardless of race, gender, \nnational origin, religion, or disability, have the same equal \nopportunity to a good education as any other American citizen.\n  Likewise, the Constitution expressly states that our National \nGovernment was formed specifically to ``promote the general welfare, \nand secure the blessings of liberty.'' The general welfare, I submit, \nis greatly in danger when the populace is not adequately educated, and \neducation is critical to liberty. As Frederick Douglass so eloquently \nnoted, education ``means emancipation. It means light and liberty.''\n  It is no surprise that the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 expressly \nstated that ``schools and the means of education shall be forever \nencouraged.'' That law encouraged new territories to establish schools.\n  The Federal Government also encouraged States to establish public \ncolleges and universities through the Morrill Act of 1862, which \nstarted the whole land grant college movement.\n  Moving into the 20th century, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, \nknown as the GI bill, provided grants to World War II veterans to \npursue a college education.\n  In 1954, the Supreme Court struck down laws endorsing racial \nsegregation in public schools.\n  In 1958, Congress authorized the National Defense Education Act, the \nfirst Federal loan program to students for higher education. That was \none I borrowed money from when I went to Iowa State University.\n  That was followed by the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Federal \nPell grants enacted in 1972.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in 1965 and \nprovided aid to States and school districts to improve education for \nchildren from low-income families.\n  In 1975, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children \nAct, which later became the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, which was to assist States and districts in educating children \nwith disabilities.\n  In 1994, Congress passed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and the \nImproving America's Schools Act.\n  In 2001, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, which went \neven further in terms of what was required of schools to receive \nFederal funds.\n  I go through all this so you can see that the Federal role in \neducation spans over 200 years, and its primary objective has always \nbeen to increase educational opportunity and to enhance educational \nattainment. This context is important to any discussion about the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  The original goal of ESEA was to provide resources to the schools \nwith the most disadvantaged students. This funding was needed because \nmany States and districts use education funding formulas that provide \nfewer resources to high-poverty schools. Again, when anyone wants to \ntalk about this, I say go back and read Jonathan Kozol's book entitled \n``Savage Inequalities,'' written in the mid-1980s, in which he pointed \nout the gross inequality in our schools in America depending upon your \nZIP Code--depending upon where you lived. We knew from that time that \neducating poor students actually requires more resources, not fewer, \nand title I was our attempt to\n\n[[Page S7350]]\n\ncreate a better, more equitable education system. Title I of ESEA has \nnever fully realized that goal, but it has served as a significant \nsource of funding to our most impoverished schools, leading to more \neducational opportunity for low-income students over the last 40 years.\n  In the early 1990s, a national consensus emerged around the idea that \nfor the United States to remain competitive in the world economy, our \neducation system needed significant improvements. Foremost among these \nwas the movement for a ``standards-based reform.'' That was the idea \nthat statewide academic standards and assessments aligned with those \nstandards were a key lever for ensuring that all students received a \ngood education. To that end, the 1994 reauthorization of ESEA required \nthat States have one educational accountability system for all \nstudents, including racial and ethnic minorities, students with \ndisabilities, and English-language learners. Along with Goals 2000, it \nrequired that States put in place standards and assessments so that we \nwould actually know how students were doing.\n  During the next reauthorization--that was the No Child Left Behind \nAct in 2001--lawmakers felt compelled to be more prescriptive with \nStates to ensure they improved their low-performing schools and focused \non closing pernicious student achievement gaps. Therefore, NCLB, as it \nis known, defined ``adequate yearly progress'' for schools and \ndistricts. It required districts to implement public school choice, \nsupplemental educational services in schools, and it set aside 20 \npercent of their title I funds for these activities. It also included a \nlist of rigorous interventions for schools in corrective action and an \nadditional category of ``restructuring'' for the most chronically low-\nperforming schools with even more severe consequences attached.\n  What was the result of this more heavyhanded and prescriptive version \nof ESEA? Well, ``The Proficiency Illusion,'' a 2007 report by the \nFordham Institute, found that State definitions of student proficiency \nvaried erratically, and comparisons across the States were not valid.\n  A new term was coined in education. It was called the hockey stick. \nIn reaction to the 2014 proficiency deadline that schools were to meet, \nwhat happened is that States backloaded the student gains needed to \nreach this goal. So it kind of came in the shape of a hockey stick \nlying on its side. So it was at a low level, and then all of a sudden, \nin the last 2 or 3 years, all of these proficiency standards would have \nto be met. That is why so many more schools are now failing to make \nadequate yearly progress across the country as we approach 2014. The \nslope gets steeper, and it gets tougher for them to make that yearly \nprogress.\n\n  Another thing happened. Districts responded to the new restructuring \ncategory by choosing the least prescriptive--and some would say the \nweakest--option. In effect, districts could do as much or as little as \nthey wanted in these severely underperforming schools.\n  Lastly, the No Child Left Behind law drove a critical transparency \nand focus on the performance of student subgroups--which was good, but \nits prescriptiveness also led to a culture of compliance and not \ninnovation. So they would comply, but nothing would be done to change \nthe system.\n  Given this history, we must now ask what the next reauthorization of \nESEA should look like. Should the Federal Government come down harder \non States and districts, be more prescriptive, more punitive?\n  I strongly believe that we must maintain a robust Federal role. In \nlooking at the most recent national assessment of educational \nprogress--also called NAEP--scores, we see that more than 50 percent of \nthe students who are eligible for free or reduced lunch--read that as \n``poor kids,'' OK?--scored ``below basic'' on the fourth grade reading \nassessment, as compared to only 17 percent of students who were not \neligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Fifty percent of the poor \nkids read ``below basic,'' compared to only 17 percent of kids who were \nnot poor. On the eighth grade mathematics assessment, almost half--49 \npercent--of African-American students scored ``below basic.'' Got that? \nOn eighth grade math, 49 percent of African-American students scored \n``below basic,'' as compared to only 16 percent of White students.\n  Madam President, we believe in equal opportunity in this country, but \nyou cannot have equality of opportunity when you have inequality of \neducation. Our economy, our ethics, and our commitment to equal \nopportunity all demand that the Federal Government continue to have a \nstrong role in ensuring an educated citizenry. But just as the Federal \nrole has evolved from Federal land grants to student Pell grants, we \nmust be willing to shift to new approaches when the old ones aren't \nworking.\n  I do not believe No Child Left Behind is the pinnacle of Federal \neducation laws. I believe we can and must do better. Our bipartisan \nbill follows a different course, one of a more strategic partnership--\npartnership--with States and districts within Federal guidelines or \nFederal parameters.\n  In making this move, it is important to note that States have stepped \nup to the standards and accountability plate in recent years.\n  In 2009, the Common Core State Standards Initiative was launched, a \nState-led effort to develop high-quality standards that are common \nacross State lines. Thus far, 46 States and the District of Columbia \nhave adopted the English language arts standards, and 45 States have \nadopted the math standards.\n  In 2011, the Council of Chief State School Officers released its \naccountability principles for next-generation accountability systems, \nnow endorsed by 45 States. These principles include setting performance \ngoals for all schools and districts aligned to college- and career-\nready standards; measuring student outcomes based on status and growth; \ndifferentiating between schools and districts and providing supports \nand interventions; and targeting the lowest performing schools for \nsignificant interventions. States committed through these principles to \ndoing deeper diagnostic reviews as appropriate--looking at more than \njust student test scores and high school graduation rates--to better \nlink accountability determinations to meaningful supports and \ninterventions.\n  This is all being done by the States. So these commitments by the \nStates have led me to believe we may be entering an era in which the \nFederal Government can work in partnership with States to improve our \nNation's schools, while continuing to provide a backstop to avoid \nreturning to old ways of discrimination and exclusions. I think that is \nwhat the bipartisan bill passed by the HELP Committee last month does.\n  This bill, in many ways, resembles the ESEA blueprint released by \nSecretary Duncan almost 2 years ago. Our bill gets rid of AYP--the \nannual yearly progress--but it sets Federal parameters for State-\ndesigned accountability systems, which they are already doing. They are \ndoing that on their own. These systems must cover all students, \nincluding students with disabilities and English-language learners; \nthey must continue to measure and report on the performance of all \nschools; they must expect continuous improvement for all schools and \nsubgroups of students; and they must provide for interventions in low-\nperforming schools or schools with low-achieving student subgroups.\n  State accountability plans are also subject to peer review and \napproval by the Secretary of Education--an important safeguard on the \nquality and integrity of these systems. In short, we do not want to \nhave a race-to-the-bottom type of system where States race to the \nbottom to see who has to do the least to meet these quality \nimprovements.\n  The HELP Committee's bill also sets the high bar of having students \ngraduate from high school college- and career-ready. It also tightens \nthe Federal focus on turning around persistently low-achieving \nschools--the bottom 5 percent--and our Nation's dropout factories--\nthose high schools that graduate less than 60 percent of their \nstudents--less than 60 percent of their students.\n  We focus on those schools with significant student achievement gaps. \nWhat I mean by that is sometimes you might have very good schools by \nall appearances--all the test scores are great, they graduate a lot of \nstudents--\n\n[[Page S7351]]\n\nbut there are subgroups there--usually students of color, English-\nlanguage learners, students with disabilities--who aren't receiving the \nproper type of education. But because the rest of the school looks so \ngood, they are sort of not seen. They are sort of invisible. These are \nthe achievement-gap schools which we have focused on and which, I might \nadd, States have already said they are going to focus on too.\n  Our bill takes the significant step of closing the comparability \nloophole so that funds provided through title I ESEA will finally serve \nas additional dollars--not replacement but additional dollars--for our \nneediest students. And title I schools will get their fair share of \nFederal resources.\n  It also provides districts with more flexibility in how States and \ndistricts spend their Federal funds while ensuring that the resources \ndesignated to serve our most disadvantaged students get to those \nstudents. The bill incentivizes the development of rigorous and fair \nteacher and principal evaluation systems. We don't mandate it, but we \ndo incentivize teacher and principal evaluation systems, and it \nprovides these critical school staff with the support they need to \ncontinually improve teaching and learning.\n  The bill also leverages opportunities for more children to access \nhigh-quality early learning programs and adds new protections for some \nof our most vulnerable children--homeless kids and students in foster \ncare--so they can be better served by schools.\n  Our bill strategically consolidates programs and focuses grant funds \non a smaller number of programs to allow for greater flexibility. It \ninvests in effective programs to train and support principals and \nteachers for high-need schools. It fosters innovation through new \nprograms such as Race to the Top, Investing in Innovation, and Promise \nNeighborhoods.\n  So as I have said many times over the past few years, I believe this \nis a good bill. I am proud of our efforts. The bill is the result of \nmany months of bipartisan negotiation and, as such it is a carefully \ncrafted compromise. It does not contain everything I want, nor does it \ncontain everything Senator Enzi wanted. I said the other day: This is \nnot my bill and this is not Senator Enzi's bill, but it is our bill--\nand I don't mean just the two of us, but I mean our committee bill. It \nis, as currently written, a bill that moves us forward beyond the \npunitive nature of No Child Left Behind.\n  Last, I want to make clear that as this process moves forward, I \nbelieve it is crucial that we maintain the integrity and balance of \nthis bipartisan compromise. We owe it to our kids and our Nation to \nproduce a strong bill that will actually move the needle in improving \nour educational system. That will be the barometer that will guide me \nas this process moves forward.\n  To that end, I would note that, historically, education policy has \nbeen done in a bipartisan fashion, and I believe the House must also \nmaintain that approach. Without a bipartisan bill coming out of the \nHouse, I believe it would be difficult to find a path forward that will \ndraw the support we need from both sides of the aisle to be able to \nsend a final bill to the President that he can sign. Here in the Senate \nwe have demonstrated it is possible to reach bipartisan consensus on \nESEA. We all need to work together in a bipartisan way to replace No \nChild Left Behind with this new and better law.\n  With the reauthorization of ESEA, we are on the brink of change, and \nchange many times is difficult. But we must work together to move from \na culture of minimal compliance with Federal requirements to one of \nshared innovation, shared responsibility, and success for students. I \nlook forward to working toward this new partnership and to the next \nchapter of an effective Federal role in promoting educational \nexcellence and equity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                              Veterans Day\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, tomorrow I will join with what I hope \nwill be every American in paying tribute to our veterans who have \nserved us over 200 years to protect the liberty, the freedom, and the \npeace that all of us enjoy--our veterans from the Revolutionary War, \nveterans who created this great Republic, to our veterans who serve \ntoday in Afghanistan and the war on terror.\n  In the history of our country, every generation has been called at a \ntime of trouble, and in America's good fortune every generation has \nresponded. There are significant dates in the history of our country \nthat remind us of the great military victories that we have had and the \ngreat sacrifices our soldiers have made: December 7, 1941, the terrible \nattack on Pearl Harbor; June 6, 1944, when Americans bravely stormed \nOmaha Beach and began the invasion of Europe which ran out Nazi \nGermany. We all remember, with horror and with terror, 9/11/2001 when \nNew York, Washington, and all of America and all peace-loving people \nwere attacked by al-Qaida, and just a few days later, September 20, \nwhen we began and initiated our effort to go after al-Qaida wherever it \nwas, and now recognizing, a little over 10 years later, terrorists have \nbeen disrupted, bin Laden has been killed, and America and the world \nare a safer place.\n  In the financial and economic history of our country, there have also \nbeen significant dates which we should remember and significant \nresponses which we also should recognize: the tragedy of October 1929 \nwhen the market crashed and the Great Depression began, the difficulty \nof Black Friday in 1987 when the markets had a terrible crash. Those \nwere all memorable times, and we hated to see our financial and \neconomic stability upset.\n  Well, there is another critical day coming in America's history, and \nit is coming 13 days from today on November 23, 2011, when the select \ncommittee we in this Senate and the Members of the House created to \naddress our troubles economically in this country, which are rooted in \nour spending, rooted in our tax system, and rooted in our entitlement \nsystem--the select committee is to come back with at least $1.2 \ntrillion in cuts, revenue increases, or reform of entitlements over a \n10-year period of time, to be matched with the $900 billion that we cut \nin August to, hopefully, get us on some type of a track that will be a \nsustainable recovery in getting our balance back in line. But there is \nfear that a deal will not be reached, and that is a failure that is not \nan option, in my judgment.\n  Yesterday, there was an offer put on the table that involved \nrevenues, involved the reform of entitlements, and involved spending \ncuts put on the table to begin the discussion to find common ground to \nhave $1.2 trillion or more in cuts. Unfortunately, as I understand it, \nthe conversation ended, and they are not back at the table yet, and \nthere are 13 days left to go.\n  As just one Member of the Senate, but as the father of three and \ngrandfather to nine, someone who has lived in this country almost 67 \nyears, I implore my colleagues on the select committee, and all of us \nin the Senate, to be supportive of their effort to get back to the \ntable, to put all issues back on the table, and understand that failure \nis not an option.\n  Today in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, and in the European Union there \nis great fear. There is a search for leadership in those that can \ncontrol their debt, control their entitlements, and control their \nspending.\n  America, as it led on D-day on June 6, 1944, as it led in the battle \nagainst al-Qaida and terrorists, must lead economically at this time \nmore than ever. It is time for us to put forward a plan that gives us a \nchance to recover our economy over time, lower our debt and our deficit \nover time, and reduce our spending over time. It is not an instant, 1-\nday cure that we seek, but it is an amortization of our liabilities to \nget our leverage down and our hopes and our prosperity up.\n  So as one Member of the Senate, I implore our members of the select \ncommittee to come back to the table, to put every issue on the table, \nto forthrightly discuss them, and understand that November 23, 2011, is \ngoing to be a historic day in this country--historic because we found a \nsolution and began a process or historic because we as Americans for \nthe first time looked the other way.\n  As one Member of the Senate, I don't want to look the other way. I \nwant to look my constituents square in the eye and say that I was \nwilling to look at spending; I was willing to look at entitlement \nreform; I was willing to look at revenues.\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\n  I am willing to find a path forward so America can remain in the \nfuture what it always has been; that is, a beacon of economic security \nin a troubled world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Veterans Day\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, tomorrow, Veterans Day, our Nation will \npay our respect and honor to the men and women who have served in our \nmilitary.\n  I know we say this frequently, but every day we should honor the men \nand women who have served our Nation in uniform. Every day we should \nhave in our thoughts and prayers those who are currently in harm's way \ndefending America's freedom. We want to make sure we do everything we \ncan to make sure they have the support of this Nation to complete their \nmission safely and return to their families safely.\n  So I take this time to express the appreciation of this Senator, on \nbehalf of the people of Maryland, to the men and women who have served \nour Nation, who are our veterans, their families, and those who are \ncurrently serving our Nation in the military service. They have \ndefended this Nation and the freedoms we enjoy today from our \ntraditional threats from hostile countries to our current threats that \ncome from extremists and terrorists. Our men and women in our Armed \nForces have served our Nation very proudly.\n  We need to show our appreciation by words and deeds, and I know I \nspeak for the Members of this body that we need to make sure we provide \nthe very best in health care to those who are returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan and to those who have served our Nation. I have visited and \nseen firsthand our soldiers who have returned and how they are being \ntreated, and I tell you we need to keep up this commitment.\n  I compliment my friend, Congressman Ruppersberger, my colleague from \nMaryland, who started a program known as Miles for Heroes, where \nsoldiers who were returning home would come into BWI Airport and \nBaltimore, but for them to get to their homes they had to purchase \ntheir own tickets in order to see their families. In many cases, our \nsoldiers who returned home for treatment, their families could not \nafford to travel to visit them in the medical facility.\n  Congressman Ruppersberger introduced a proposal where they could use \nfrequent flier miles and donate that so our soldiers and their families \ncould get airline tickets to see each other. It has been extremely \nsuccessful. We celebrated an anniversary of that not too long ago at \nthe BWI Airport.\n\n  I mention that because I have filed S. 1776 to extend this program to \nhotel miles so families can not only have the transportation costs to \nvisit their wounded warriors but also have a place to stay. I think \nthat makes abundant sense, and I hope we will be able to act on that. \nTo me, this is what we should be doing on Veterans Day, not only again \nshowing our words but also showing our deeds.\n  When I was at Baltimore Washington International Airport, I had a \nchance to visit the returning soldiers, literally just coming home from \nAfghanistan and Iraq. It was an incredible experience to see their \nfaces as they reunited with their families, having served this Nation \nin combat. But there was also concern on some of their faces because \nthey do not know whether they are going to have a job to return to once \nthey return to the work place. We took some steps to help them today in \nthat regard by the passage of a bill that will provide incentives for \nemployers to provide employment for our veterans returning home from \nAfghanistan and Iraq. That is exactly what we should be doing, showing \nour support for our veterans.\n  I wished to take this time to pay respect and to honor those who \nserve in our military. Tomorrow, on November 11, at 11 o'clock in the \nmorning, I will be at Cheltenham at the veterans cemetery for a \ncommemoration where we will pay honor to all the men and women who have \nserved our Nation, and I will then express, on behalf of the people of \nMaryland and the people of this Nation, our gratitude for preserving \nour way of life and being a beacon of hope for freedom-loving people \naround the world.\n\n\n                       Cross-Border Air Pollution\n\n  Madam President, earlier today we rejected the resolution by Senator \nPaul that would have undone the cross-state air pollution standards. I \nvoted against that resolution. I wish to compliment my colleagues for \nthe strong bipartisan vote that rejected the resolution that would have \nprevented this regulation from going into effect. I wish to share with \nmy colleagues some of my reasons.\n  This is a matter of a sense of fairness. Let me talk for a moment \nabout Maryland. Maryland has done all it can to protect the health of \nits citizens with some of the most stringent clean air standards in the \nNation. We have done that. We have enacted those standards. We have \nimplemented those standards. But here is the problem: 50 percent of the \nsmog that comes into Maryland that affects the health of Marylanders \ncomes in from other States. Maryland can do everything it can to \nprevent the air pollution in our State, but it is coming in from other \nStates, affecting the health of our citizens.\n  We have 140,000 Maryland children who suffer from asthma. Dirty air \nmakes it difficult for these children to have a productive day in \nschool. We have workers who cannot work on bad air days. It is \ncritically important that we move forward with sensible cross-State air \npollution standards. That is exactly what the Obama administration \nbrought forward. Thanks to the vote in the Senate, those regulations \nwill be able to go forward.\n  I wish to dispel another myth. Some say we cannot have clean air and \njob growth. We cannot have a clean environment. We have to choose \nbetween jobs and the environment. I tell you, we need to have a clean \nenvironment in order to get the type of job growth we want. I can give \nthe number of people who lose days from work as a result of poor air \nquality and the effect it has on their health. I can talk about the \nproductivity in the workplace as a result of illness that is generated \nbecause of dirty air. All that has absolutely been documented by our \nscientists. They can demonstrate that. But let me talk a little bit \nabout concrete jobs in the Maryland example.\n  In 2007, the Maryland legislature implemented the toughest powerplant \nemission laws on the east coast of the United States. They used 2002 as \na baseline and they reduced SOX emissions by 80 percent by \nthis year. They reduce NOX emissions by 75 percent by next \nyear. It will reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent by 2013. These are \nthe major air pollutants we are aimed at reducing. Maryland has done \nthat.\n  What impact has that had on our economy? Two thousand skilled \nconstruction worker jobs were created as a result of the investment \nthat was made in clean air. We now have Brandon Shores, one of the \ncleanest coal-burning powerplants in the country. That is the legacy \nMaryland has given us. We have created jobs and have done what we can \nfor clean air to help our children and help our community.\n  As I said earlier, there is very little more that Maryland can do. We \nhave to rely now on the help of other States. It is for that reason \nthat we have seen utilities that are supporting us. Constellation \nEnergy, Excelon, PG have supported reasonable standards for air \nquality, and they recognize it is the right thing to do to have these \nstandards apply to all States because pollution knows no State border.\n  I was encouraged by the vote we had on this issue. It was a vote for \nhealthy air for our children, for jobs for our construction industry, \nand a stronger economy for America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I wish to follow the remarks of my \ncolleague in a colloquy, briefly, saying I agree with him which is why \nI voted to support restrictions on cross-State air pollution. Certainly \ncoming from Maryland, I understand that one State can\n\n[[Page S7353]]\n\npollute another, especially given the prevailing westerly winds. But \neven in the State of Illinois we estimate that the rule will reduce \npollution in Chicagoland by 7 to 13 percent and in high-ozone time, the \nhighest pollution, 24 percent.\n  We have also seen quite a number of our powerplants already \nreengineer their plants to control pollution, expecting this regulation \nwhich, by the way, comes from the Bush administration, the initial \nlegislation, and pursuant to a Federal court order.\n  I commend my colleague and say there is bipartisan agreement that we \ncontrol cross-State pollution. This rule, by the data that was provided \nby the Congressional Research Service, has a significant amount of \nbenefit in reducing particulate matter that would be in the State of \nIllinois and especially Eastern States.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If my colleague will yield, we had a strong bipartisan \nvote on the floor on this issue. He is exactly right. All States in \nthis country will benefit from it. Illinois is a State that also \nreceives pollution from other States. Pollution does not know a State \nline. We cannot stop the air from traveling. I think my colleague is \nexactly right. This was not just the east coast. It happens to be at \nthe tailpipe, as we say it, of the pollution in America, but the \nMidwest is very much impacted and this regulation will help the health \nof the people of the Midwest and throughout the country.\n  I thank my colleague for his comments.\n\n\n                         Honoring Our Veterans\n\n  Mr. KIRK. I actually rose to speak on several other topics which I \nwill do in turn. First, I wish to say tomorrow we are going to honor \ngenerations of veterans who wore the uniform of the United States. As a \nMember of the House, I worked to help save my congressional district's \nveterans hospital in north Chicago, IL, after Washington bureaucrats \nrecommended its closure by the Department of Defense, by the Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  We actually arranged to bring the Department of Defense and the VA \ntogether in a naval hospital and a VA hospital, to combine them in what \nbecame the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center, building \non synergy and seamless care for Active Duty and veterans alike. It \nbecame the first combined VA-Navy hospital in the Nation. It is a \nworld-class facility that delivers medical care to about 4,000 Active \nDuty at Great Lakes and about 42,000 recruits and a equivalent number \nof veterans in the region.\n  I like to think about the waiting room of this hospital in which \ngrizzled veterans from--one I remember meeting from the battle of Savo \nIsland, 1942, World War II right next to the rawest new recruits to the \nNavy, in the same waiting room about to receive care from the same \nnurses and doctors at this now combined Navy-VA hospital.\n  In the Senate, I became the new ranking member of the Military \nConstruction and VA Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee. Now we are \ngoing to see if we can expand this model of care, not just to one part \nof northern Illinois but to the country. We should go to the next \nlevel, not just integrating one set of hospitals but for the whole \ncountry.\n  Here, the greatest potential is in medical records. It should be the \npolicy of this Congress, the Appropriations Committee and our \nsubcommittee, that we create in the end one military VA health record \nso there is a seamless continuum of care for the men and women who have \njoined to protect our country from the first day they sign up as a \nrecruit until their sunset years as a veteran.\n  I shared a draft of this speech with the chairman of our \nsubcommittee, Chairman Johnson, and also Chairman Culberson of the \nHouse subcommittee, and the administration, to hopefully drive \nconsensus in the House and Senate forward on this issue. I think we all \nnow agree there should be more Defense Department and VA collaboration \non health care but especially focused on health records.\n  With Chairman Johnson, we held a March hearing on the progress of \nmoving forward to a military veteran--what is called--fully integrated \nelectronic health record or IEHR. The system will provide \nservicemembers with a single medical record from their enlistment \nthrough their final days as a veteran. I wish to applaud Secretary \nShinseki, Secretary Gates, and Secretary Panetta, his successor, for \npushing the very separate Department of Defense and VA bureaucracies \ninto a single common record system. The integrated health record \ndeveloped jointly by VA and DOD is a very large and necessary IT \nproject. It will encompass quite a lot of effort to be caring for \naround 15 million servicemembers, veterans, and eligible families each \nyear.\n  For more than 20 years, these two executive departments built \nentirely separate health care systems, but the taxpayer did pay for \nboth. A 20-year marine leaving Active-Duty health care would then, \npotentially, today, have three separate health care records--a military \none, a veterans record, and a civilian care record through TRICARE. \nThis meant that information on medical treatment or service-connected \ndisabilities could easily be split between these records. VA doctors or \nVA benefits personnel would not have the complete information in \nassessing care for this American in uniform or just out of uniform.\n  The new system will hopefully eliminate paper records, missing files, \nand replace them all with a common record, complete with Active-Duty \nmedical history that the VA medical care providers can access in all \nhospitals and clinics throughout the country.\n  A project of this magnitude, 6 years of work, several hundred million \ndollars in expense, is not without risk. It is our responsibility to \nmake sure both departments, DOD and VA, make the right cost-effective \ndecisions to defend the hard-working taxpayer. In past years, normal \npractice inside Washington would be to give a project such as this to a \nmassive government contractor that would hijack it into an unwieldy and \nproprietary system which rapidly became outdated, with technology that \nwas only licensed to that contractor. In the Congress we cannot let \nthat happen with this project. In times of physical austerity it is \ncritical that the government work carefully with Chairman Johnson in \nthe Senate and Chairman Culberson in the House to look beyond their own \nwalls to cooperate and innovate and deliver more efficient and \neffective services.\n\n  It is imperative that VA and DOD ensure that it gets this right and \nnot replicate problems associated with past developments of so many \nlarge IT systems. One of the most positive developments is the joint \nVA-DOD approach that will embrace best commercial practices by \nleveraging technology already used in the private sector through \ncommercial off-the-shelf systems, and especially open-source coding so \nthat the electronic health record can be billed at the lowest cost. \nThis will ensure that the new system will benefit from innovative and \nnew solutions being used by major medical systems and health care \nproviders across the country.\n  An open source--that is an open computer-code approach--will, most \nimportantly, prevent us, the government, from being locked into one \nsingle vendor. Instead the approach will allow not only innovation but \nwill require a private firm to integrate their technology into the \njoint VA-DOD system. It will also encourage real competition as every \nvendor bidding on a new contract will have full, public access to the \nproduct completed by the previous vendor. This approach should ensure \nthat the taxpayer is defended, that their dollars are well spent, and \nthat servicemembers and veterans are well served by the system that we \nthen develop.\n  I commend the VA and DOD on their willingness to break down the walls \nbetween their respective departments and work together on this project, \nespecially on the eve of Veterans Day. If successful, this approach \ncould serve as a model for cooperation between other government \nagencies serving similar communities, making the government smarter and \nleveraging private sector innovation and developing cost-saving \ntechnologies--like open source coding, like commercial off-the-shelf \nrequirements--which is exactly the mindset we need to embrace in the \ncost-conscious environment we are in today.\n  In closing, I want to, once again, thank Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs Shinseki, our previous Secretary of Defense Gates, and our \ncurrent Secretary of Defense Panetta for their vision in bringing this \ntough problem together. I\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\nwill tell each one of these Cabinet Departments that Chairman Culberson \nand I are looking forward, in about 2\\1/2\\ months' time, to meeting \nwith their teams to assess the project and progress on developing a \nfully integrated, complete joint DOD and then VA health record to care \nfor that American from the time they enlist until their final days as a \nveteran.\n\n\n                            Hiring Veterans\n\n  On November 11, 1919, exactly 1 year after the end of World War I, \nPresident Wilson designated Armistice Day to honor those who served \nduring the great war. In 1954, Congress changed the name of the holiday \nto honor the service of all men and women in uniform that we now know \nas Veterans Day. For the last 22 years, it has been the honor of my \nlife to serve in the U.S. Navy Reserve. I have seen firsthand the \nsacrifice of men and women who wore the uniform and, quite frankly, \nprovided the freedoms that we enjoy as Americans.\n  This week we remember those who sacrificed everything in the defense \nof our Nation, and I am proud to support legislation that provides a \nnew employment opportunity for those veterans. The VOW to Hire Heroes \nAct of 2011 is bipartisan legislation that the Senate has just passed \nto give our veterans the opportunity to learn new skills and reenter \nthe workforce. Too often employers overlook the experience of our \nprofessional veterans. These men and women are typically highly \neffective, organized leaders who have been part of a team in a \ndifficult environment. They have undertaken responsibilities few could \nimagine under extreme conditions--especially at young ages.\n  Across Afghanistan and Iraq, veterans are saving lives and using \nstate-of-the-art medical equipment in austere conditions. When they \nreturn, these skills they have obtained do not necessarily quickly \ntranslate into civilian certifications that first responders need to \nqualify for a job. As a result, governments subsidize expensive \ntraining for veterans who are already, in many cases, substantially \noverqualified. The bill just passed in the Senate requires the \nDepartment of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor to identify \nequivalencies between military service and private sector competencies. \nThis change will translate military experience and certifications into \ncivilian qualifications opening new career opportunities for veterans.\n  The legislation also reforms and improves the Department of Defense \nTransition Assistance Program to assist retiring servicemembers with \nresume development, educational options, and tools for separating from \nthe military. The legislation will identify potential positions and \nindustries in the private sector for our new veterans.\n  For unemployed veterans the legislation establishes a retraining \neducational benefit allowing veterans to go back to school for high-\ndemand skill development and to obtain a technical certificate or \ndegree that prepares them to reenter the workforce. This bill also \nengages the private sector and expands the tax credit for hiring our \nreturning heroes.\n  The legislation is particularly important to my home State where we \nhave over 700,000 veterans. Across Illinois they enthusiastically take \non new challenges and become teachers and corporate executives or \npublic servants.\n  In 1901, a Knox County native and Illinois veteran, Charles Walgreen, \nbuilt the foundation of one of our Nation's largest pharmacy chains. \nChicago native George Halas served twice in the Navy and then spent 63 \nyears at the helm of the Chicago Bears and helped found the NFL. \nCountless other citizens of our State served in the military but then \nmade invaluable contributions to our Nation and its economy.\n  Despite what most Americans see on TV, Chairman Murray in the Senate \nand Chairman Miller in the House demonstrated that Republicans and \nDemocrats across the Senate and House can work together, and this \nlegislation just passed as a result of that bipartisan cooperation.\n  Today our Nation's veterans are facing different adversities and are \novercoming new challenges both in the field and when they come home. We \nowe these men and women everything, and this measure--a bipartisan \nmeasure--is one of the ways we can say thank you.\n\n\n                          Europe's Debt Crisis\n\n  I also want to take a moment to speak briefly on the subject of the \nEuropean debt situation. I am concerned that we are now eyewitnesses to \nhistory, but few in the Senate are even watching major events that \ncould hurt the incomes of Americans at home.\n  Margaret Thatcher once said: Socialists eventually run out of other \npeople's money. We witnessed the end of communism in 1991 when Russia \nran out of money. In 2011 we may be witnessing the end of European \nsocialism as many of their economies go bankrupt. Events in Europe \noffer an immediate warning to our own banking system and is a long-term \nlesson to our society.\n  I thank my friend David Malpass for his work in helping to develop my \nview on these issues. In our view, Europe's approach to the run on \nGreek debt and then Italian debt and possibly this afternoon French \ndebt shows that Europe's leaders are not addressing the problems \nsquarely that they face. The current approach they have is \nunsustainable.\n  Yesterday we witnessed the interest rate Italy must pay to borrow \nfunds rising to over 7 percent from the 6.4 percent on Tuesday and the \n5 percent they had to pay at the beginning of the month.\n  Germany's Finance Minister suggested that Italy consider drawing on \nEFSF funds, implying that Germany doesn't recognize the true magnitude \nof the systemic problem they face, still focused on Plan A when Plan A \nno longer is viable. As Malpass commented, this compares a popgun \nversus the charging financial rhinoceros that is needed.\n  German Chancellor Angela Merkel talked about a new European Union and \nnew EU treaty structures. The United States should support increased \nfinancial restraints--tougher ones than the Maastricht Treaty provided. \nIt is hard to see how Europe could undertake an entirely new treaty and \nthen ratify it in the middle of this crisis. After all, the EFSF was \nhard enough.\n  Merkel's party also discussed ways to allow countries to exit the \neuro. This would be an immediate and severe threat to the current \noutlook, but her party is now no longer in the ascendency. It is losing \nstrength to coalition parties that are more committed to the euro.\n  On Tuesday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy raised the possibility \nof what he called a two-speed Europe in a speech in Strasbourg, meaning \nthat the eurozone countries would have different rules than non-euro EU \nmembers. These issues would all be fine to discuss if we were not \nimmediately in a current financial crisis. There are many steps the \nUnited States should encourage to prevent this situation from jumping \nacross the Atlantic. Unfortunately, none of them appear to be underway.\n  First, Italy should undertake major growth-oriented structural \nreforms in their labor market, but there appears to be little chance of \nthat.\n  Next, Europe could temporarily back away from the Basel III mark-to-\nmarket and the bank capitalization levels they require, removing for \nnow the threat their banks face: that they will be taken over or forced \nto excessively dilute their equity at the market bottom. Recall that \nthe United States provided critical relief in this regard by \nreinstructing the FASB in March of 2009 to do this launching the equity \nmarket surge.\n  European Nations could also begin guaranteeing new liabilities at \ntheir banks. Remember, also, the United States took this step in \nOctober of 2008 through a fee-based FDIC guarantee of new bank \nissuance. The ECB could also purchase Italian bonds in the size needed \nin the secondary market with the goal of lowering the current yield. \nRemember, the Fed bought American mortgage-backed securities in \nDecember of 2008 instantly helping recover and resuscitate that market.\n  Unfortunately, right now none of these positive developments seem \nlikely. The news tonight from Europe is fairly dismal, and I recall the \ncollapse of German credit in July of 1931. It was that collapse that \nturned the recession of 1929 into the Great Depression.\n  Our Congress right now is rightly focused on the need to cut our own \nspending, but, unfortunately, the news that I have seen is the crisis \nabroad\n\n[[Page S7355]]\n\ncould become the No. 1 economic story in the United States as early as \nnext month.\n  Americans should watch this situation very closely. We should \nencourage Europe to take the actions I outlined above, and most \nimportantly, we should make sure the supercommittee does its job and \nthat we kick our own spending habit before we face the same future.\n\n\n                         Iran's Nuclear Program\n\n  Lastly, I want to touch on a subject that I think most concerns me \nfor the future of the country, especially next year.\n  When the history of the Iranian nuclear program is written, November \n2011 is likely to be marked as the turning point toward conflict \nregarding Iran's nuclear weapons program. Recall that Iran has signed \nthe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and her government claims they are \ntaking no action in violation of that treaty. Recall also in 1979 Iran \nembraced supporting terror as government policy. Iran was then \ncertified as a state sponsor of terror by Presidents Carter, Reagan, \nBush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama. Recall also that Iran now has become \nthe top financier for two major terror groups in the Middle East, Hamas \nand Hezbollah.\n  Iran has transferred nearly every type of weapon in its inventory--\nincluding cruise missiles--to Hezbollah. Recall also that Iran has \nstarted the massive refining of uranium, far above the 3 percent \nnecessary to fuel a reactor--upwards of 20 percent--moving to the 98 \npercent needed to run an atomic weapon.\n  This week, the IAEA released a landmark report. It said the Iranians \nwere accelerating their uranium enrichment. It said they had received \ndesign information through military personnel on nuclear weapons. But, \nmost importantly, it showed how step by step the Iranians were working \non a nuclear warhead for their long-range SHAHAB-3 missile to include \nthe density and weight of a nuclear weapon as well as the inclusion of \nan electric generator inside that weapon--unnecessary for a \nconventional munition but absolutely required for a nuclear munition--\nthat there were no submunitions, that the entire package was to go off \nat once, and that the critical design information behind that all \npointed to a nuclear warhead. Our response should be, in my view, \nnonmilitary but the strongest nonmilitary means necessary.\n  For many years as a House Member I worked on what I thought was the \ncritical sanction, which was to take advantage of the key vulnerability \nof Iran; that the mullahs had so mishandled their economy since 1979 \nthat this oil-producing nation totally depended on foreign gasoline for \ntheir energy supplies. Our idea was to cut off Iran's supply of foreign \ngasoline and then to ensure that their signature under the nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty was genuine, real, and verifiable. After \nworking many years on this legislation, eventually the House of \nRepresentatives voted, with over 400 positive votes, for this \nlegislation to help cut off Iran's gasoline supply. In fact, the bill \nwas unanimous in the Senate, and last year President Obama signed this \nbill into law.\n  But the record now shows, according to Reuters this morning, that \ngasoline deliveries, despite the Obama sanctions, now have gone up 21 \npercent to Iran. Despite the comprehensive sanctions the United States \nhas leveled against Iran, the International Monetary Fund reports that \nthe Iranian economy grew faster than the U.S. economy last year. So, \nmany of us, looking at the sorry record of sanctions enforcement, have \ngathered together on the idea of one last sanction that we think could \navoid a conflict, that we think would deliver the decisive diplomatic \nweight to solve this problem, and that is to sanction the Central Bank \nof Iran itself. We would say any entity which does business with the \nCentral Bank of Iran cannot do business with the United States, and we \nwould force every financial and business interest in the world to \nchoose between the $300 billion Iranian economy and the $14 trillion \nAmerican economy.\n  We know the Central Bank of Iran is the central paymaster of \nHezbollah and Hamas, two organizations Secretary of State Clinton has \nhighlighted as sponsors of terror. We know the Central Bank of Iran is \nthe central paymaster for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and \nespecially their subunit, the Quds force, which Attorney General Holder \nhighlighted, which tried to launch a plot through a Mexican drug cartel \nto blow up a Washington, DC restaurant. They talked about killing \ndozens of Americans--they even talked about killing Senators--in an \neffort to kill the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States. We \nknow the Central Bank of Iran also is the likely paymaster of the \nnuclear program of Iran itself.\n  This summer, something unique happened in the life of the Senate. In \nthese partisan times, with so many differences expressed between \nRepublicans and Democrats, 92 Senators joined in the Kirk-Schumer \nletter saying that we should sanction the Central Bank of Iran, that we \nshould cripple the Iranian currency. For God's sake, at least we can \nhave Iranian economic growth as slower than U.S. economic growth for \n2012. It was a unique moment of bipartisan consensus, and the Obama \nadministration even leaked to the New York Times that this action was \nunder consideration. All indications are now that the Obama \nadministration will take no major action against Iran, despite a United \nNations report and despite a plot revealed by the Attorney General \nhimself.\n  Recall that the IAEA was the organization that downplayed Bush \nadministration accusations against Iraq and its weapons of mass \ndestruction program, and that following the fall of Saddam Hussein we \nconsistently found that what the IAEA said about Iraq was exactly \ncorrect. So when the IAEA reports that the Iranians are working toward \na nuclear weapon and a warhead aboard their SHAHAB-3 missile; when we \nlearn that the Iranians are supporting terror through Hezbollah and \nHamas with a plot to kill Americans at a Washington, DC restaurant; \nwhen we learn that Iranians have registered the names of every Baha'i \nfamily, all 330,000 in their country, that they have removed all \nBaha'is from universities, that they have kicked all Baha'i children \nand prohibited all Baha'i businesses from doing business with their \ngovernment, we are worried that this is a government--probably the only \nmember of the United Nations--where the head of state regularly talks \nabout wiping another member of the United Nations off the planet, it \nseems as though we should take action.\n  I recall a famous quote from President Kennedy long before he was \nelected President when he wrote an essay called ``Why America Slept'' \nin which he talked about all the signs of a coming catastrophe in \nEurope and no action by the U.S. Government.\n  This week is the turning point for Iran. If the United States takes \nno action, then we set the Middle East on a course for conflict likely \ninvolving our allies in Israel, potentially also Saudi Arabia. The \nsimple course of history right now I think would be improved if we \nleveled this sanction in a bipartisan fashion, giving our diplomats \ndecisive weight to stop this program and, therefore, avoiding conflict. \nBy taking the easy way out--by leveling no action against Iran--we \nactually are empowering those who would go to conflict more quickly.\n  I am dumfounded as to the reason we are doing this. Senators on this \nfloor told me they suspected there was so much insecurity about the \ncurrent price of oil that the administration will do everything \npossible not to have conflict or stress in the Middle East in order to \nensure its reelection and keep prices low. But I would argue that \nnuclear weapons in the hands of the Iranians will automatically raise \nenergy prices in the United States. I would argue that with the record \nof the Iranians transferring cruise missiles to Hezbollah, there is no \ndoubt in my mind that the Iranians, once they build a sufficient \nstockpile of nuclear weapons, will transfer some of those to Hezbollah.\n  We also see hostile intent by the Iranians not just at the Israelis \nbut at the Saudi Arabians, and that the path to further instability and \ndanger is in not taking action rather than taking action.\n  This, on a Friday night in November, is the turning point on the Iran \ncrisis. Many bureaucrats inside the administration would prefer we not \nknow this\n\n[[Page S7356]]\n\nis the turning point. They would prefer we not realize the Iranian \nprogram is receiving decisive weight, and that according to experts the \nIranians will have nuclear weapons either next year or, by their latest \nestimate, the year after. They would prefer we not realize that \naccording to my scenario, they would build a sufficient stockpile so \nthat we envision a possible future where by 2014 or 2015 the Iranians \nwill have a sufficient number to begin transferring weapons to \nHezbollah. And we certainly know that the moment the Iranians detonate \na weapon, we will witness the launch of nuclear programs in Saudi \nArabia and likely in Egypt.\n  The bottom line is this: Without decisive action on economic \nsanctions, we condemn the Middle East to a conflict that eventually may \ninvolve weapons of mass destruction. With action similar to action \ncalled for by those who saw history correctly in the 1930s, we could \nhelp protect the coming generation from such a conflict. A world in \nwhich the Iranians have nuclear weapons is one that we grant to our \nkids in a far more dangerous environment than the 21st century, rather \nthan the one we should grant to them.\n  The Senate, hopefully, will vote on an amendment next week that I \nhope to offer to level this sanction on Iran. If opposed by the Obama \nadministration, then I think we are condemning this region to an awful \nconflict, and I think we should protect the next generation from such a \nfuture by taking good, solid, decisive, nonmilitary sanctions action \nnow.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today to address one of the \nmost important issues facing the supercommittee; that is, where does \nSocial Security fit into their plans?\n  I know the supercommittee is doing a great job. They are working in a \nsteady way to see how we can be a more frugal government, but while we \nare trying to be frugal, how we also meet our responsibilities for the \nnational defense and also how we maintain our social contract.\n  To me, one of the most essential programs in the social contract; \nthat is, the contract between the U.S. Government and its people, is \nSocial Security. For more than 75 years, under every President, we have \nworked in a bipartisan way to ensure the security and the solvency and \nthe safety of Social Security. Every President has agreed that Social \nSecurity should be undeniable, available to everybody, reliable, that \nit is there when you need it, and inflation proof--inflation proof.\n  I was in the House when we were teetering on a collapse of Social \nSecurity. Ronald Reagan was in the White House. Tip O'Neill was the \nSpeaker of the House. Bob Dole and Bob Byrd were in the Senate. We went \nto work and made sure Social Security was solvent for all of 30 or 40 \nyears.\n  Under Bill Clinton, we also took positive forward steps. Under \nPresident Bush he wanted to privatize it. That is the way he saw \nentailing its future solvency. We fought that. But we still had money \nin the trust fund.\n  Now where are we? Well, there are those who say we have got to reduce \nthe debt. Hey, I know we have to reduce the debt. I say to the \nPresiding Officer, we have had extensive conversations. The Presiding \nOfficer has some very meaty ideas worthy of consideration. But let's \nmake it clear, Social Security should not be on the table. When they \nsay all options are on the table, let's put all options on the table \nfor those programs that created the debt, that created the deficit. \nSocial Security did not create our debt. Why it is part of the \nsupercommittee conversation, debate, and even hit list, I do not know.\n  That casts no aspersions against any member of the committee. I am \ntalking about somehow or other editorial boards that know everything \nabout everything all the time have said you have to do something about \nSocial Security. We know we have to reform Social Security to modernize \nit for a 21st century economy and a 21st century demography. We get \nthat. But it does not belong in the supercommittee up against the wall \nwith impossible deadlines, up against the wall with impossible \nmandates.\n  So while they are looking at revenue, discretionary spending, \nmilitary spending, Social Security does not belong there. The reform of \nSocial Security belongs in another environment. So that is position No. \n1.\n  Position No. 2 is, what are we doing on Social Security? Well, I am \nconcerned we are about to shred this social contract, and we are going \nto do it by doing something called the ``chained CPI.'' Isn't that a \nterrible word: ``chained CPI''? Wow. I am afraid we are going to chain \nseniors to poverty.\n  Let me tell you what a chained CPI is. When you read all of the books \nwe get, policy books, chained CPI would cut Social Security by $112 \nbillion over 10 years. They do it by changing the way the cost of \nliving is calculated. It is based on kind of this ``theory.'' It is \nbased on a ``theory of human behavior,'' one of those ``social \nengineering schemes.'' What it says is this: It assumes that a consumer \nwill substitute lower cost items when the cost of what they normally \npurchase goes up.\n  Well, that means, again, ``in theory,'' if the price of apples goes \nup, you are going to buy an orange. It sounds good. But for the debate \non Social Security, it is inappropriate because the market basket \napproaches by senior citizens, validated by every economic and \nmarketing group, say their largest expenditure is health care, and the \nreason they do it on health care is because they need it to keep alive. \nThis is not trading a latte for Dunkin' Donuts. This is not going from \narugula to big lettuce. This is life. This is life on the line when we \nare about to cut the seniors' bottom line. We have to get real and talk \nabout what is the way seniors live, what is it they need to do to stay \nalive, and what is their purchasing power.\n  So this is not Barb Mikulski. The Social Security people themselves \nsay there is something called the market basket for elderly, CPI-E. It \nmeans they spend their money on health care, on food, and on energy, \nand in many cases housing. They cannot reduce those costs. Those are \nfixed costs for which they have no choice and no negotiating power. Our \ncitizens, our senior citizens, cannot negotiate on their heat, they \ncannot negotiate much on their prescription drugs. Oh, they might go \nfrom a brandname to a generic. But if their cost of living is being \nsqueezed down, they will not be able to do it. You cannot substitute \nyour medication, your insulin, and substitute it for apricot juice.\n  If the cost of prescription drugs goes up, so does medication. I am \nconcerned that this chained CPI--human behavior, untested, untried \nsocial engineering scheme--is going to become the basis by which we \ncalculate the cost of living.\n  Let me go to some facts. By the way, this is not Senator Barb \nMikulski talking, this is the Social Security Actuary, the Actuary \nactually giving accurate facts. Let's go to the A word. The Actuary \nactually giving accurate facts. First of all, they say this is a \ntechnical fix and does not mean a whole lot to seniors. Actually, the \nchained CPI will fundamentally restructure Social Security. If we do \nit, we will be complicit and complacent in creating a structurally \ninduced poverty for old people.\n  What do we mean? Well, if you look at this chart--and this comes from \nthe Actuary--if you go to the chained CPI and the purchasing power they \ntalk of, first of all, it will go into immediate effect. Then it \nactually cuts--it is not like--you know how the seniors were upset they \ndid not get a cost of living 2 years in a row? They will actually get a \nreduced benefit. And under the way this will be calculated, \nhypothetically if you are now getting $15,132 in Social Security, if \nyou are getting it when you are 65 now, 10 years from now your benefit \nwill be reduced. Not only will you not get your cost of living, but \nyour benefit will be reduced to $14,572.\n  If you continue to live, and you are 85, it will be reduced to \n$14,148. It compounds itself. So God forbid you even make it another 30 \nyears. Because under what the chained CPI would do is you would \nessentially lose over close to\n\n[[Page S7357]]\n\n$1,600 in benefits. I cannot believe this. I cannot believe we are even \ntalking about it. Because if we are talking about going with the true \nmarket basket, what you should do is actually have this increase. I \nwill not go through all of the numbers, but they are significant and \nthey are severe.\n  There is another thing going around here on the floor: Oh, Senator \nMikulski, why are you so upset? It will hurt future beneficiaries. \nWell, I am upset because no matter what time it affects a beneficiary, \nit affects a beneficiary. But what everyone fails to grasp is this will \nbe an immediate--underline the word immediate--cut, according to the \nSocial Security's Chief Actuary. If we pass this this year, this \nchained CPI begins December of 2012. So 1 year from this December, it \nwould go into effect. That means if you are 65 years old, your benefit \nwill be reduced that year. By the time 10 years later, your benefit \nwill have been reduced five times as much. And if you make it to 85, \nyour benefit will actually be reduced by 10 times as much.\n  This is, to me, a horrific idea. The current CPI-W, which is what we \ncall the cost of living, was used in 1972. It was the only measure we \nhad at the time. It was viewed as an advanced thing for an inflation-\nproof benefit. Now when we look at it, what we know is that we know the \npurchasing power--not the purchasing power, what is the market basket \nthat seniors use. Chained CPI might be fine in other areas or other \ncategories. I am not going to debate this here today.\n  But what I do want to do this time, this place, I want to sound the \nalert. I am going to ring the bell. I am going to be at my battle \nstation saying to every member of our caucus, and every member of the \npeople on the other side of the aisle, please, read up on this. Know \nwhat we are doing. If you are going to vote, I do not want to hear \nbuyer's remorse a year from now. I do not want to hear buyer's remorse \n2 years from now. I do not want to hear from the seniors in my home \nState of Maryland say: Where were you, Barbara? Did you say anything? \nDid you do anything? So I am saying here today, get out our policy \nbooks and for God's sake read them. Read them. And do not read what \nthis think tank or that editorial board says, read the Social Security \nActuary. Because I am telling you, we are about to do something that is \nirrevocable.\n  I believe in old-fashioned values, and one of the great ones is honor \nthy father and thy mother. It is not just a great commandment to live \nby, it is sure a great public policy to govern by. The American people \nevery day particularly who work hard now and live by the rules, go by \nthe rules, pay into Social Security over a lifetime, we said to them: \nIf you do that, your Social Security will be a guaranteed benefit. It \nwill be a lifetime benefit. It will be reliable and undeniable. And it \nwill be inflation proof.\n  FDR signed the bill that created that contract. Every President \nregardless of the party has kept that promise. And it is up to this \nCongress not to shred the social contract with the seniors of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I want to yield the floor to someone from the Finance Committee who \nhas done so much work on this, such great work, such due diligence, and \nhas a grasp of both the policy and the impact that it has on people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Maryland, for her leadership on this issue for protecting seniors \nand protecting women. It seems to me every time we have a battle that \nis about undercutting the benefits to women in America, Barbara \nMikulski is on the Senate floor or in the halls and in various meeting \nrooms making sure that America knows what these proposals are.\n  I could not have been more proud of her when she led all the women \nSenators on the Democratic side of the aisle to push back on the Bush \nAdministration's proposal to privatize Social Security. At that point \nin time, she most succinctly told Americans that women, more than any \nother in that age group, would suffer because they live longer, they \ndepend on Social Security, and if Social Security was privatized, women \nwould feel the brunt of it.\n  So I am proud to be out here this afternoon with her to talk about \nthis proposal that has been--we cannot tell, because we do not know. We \nare not on the supercommittee. But it seems to be floating around in \nvarious forms, various organizations may be talking about it, the \nnotion that we would change Social Security.\n  I know at home in my State of Washington, people seem to be confused \nwhen we are talking about our budgets. And we are obviously having to \nmake tough budget decisions, as are people around dining room tables, \naround city halls, around our State capitols and here in Congress are \nhaving discussions about how to have a budget to live within our means.\n  But when you talk to them about the primary way--and one proposal \nthat surfaced in the last budget negotiations in July was to \nautomatically take $300 billion of cuts right off the top as the major \nproposal out of a concept called chained CPI. When you think about \nthat, the first shot of budget cuts would be on the backs of seniors, \nit is almost as if someone thought seniors cooked up exotic financial \ninstruments and foisted them on the U.S. economy and somehow they \nshould pay the price. We know that is not the case.\n  So why are people targeting these seniors now? And we are not sure if \nthey are. We have just heard various rumors that perhaps this notion of \nchained CPI, a change in Social Security benefits as my colleague just \noutlined, would be a proposal.\n  I am here to say, I am not for having the seniors in America share \nthe brunt of sacrifice with a proposal such as this that would clearly \nbe on the backs of seniors. It is not something they can afford. I know \nsome of my colleagues may have endorsed a chained CPI, a change in the \nconsumer price index to calculate inflation. But that is a cut that \nwould increase over time. And literally, the longer you live, the more \nyou are penalized. It is such a disproportionate impact to women who do \nlive longer than men and count on those benefits for their living.\n  In my State, changes to the cost-of-living adjustment would hurt more \nthan 1 million Washingtonians. Social Security has kept about 30 \npercent of Washington residents who are 65 and older out of poverty. \nThat is what it has done for them. And what is more, 25 percent of \nseniors in my State live on Social Security alone. So there is a \npopulation that is depending on Social Security, and they are living on \nit alone, or it is making up--another 21 percent of them--it makes up \n90 percent of their income.\n  I think this demonstrates that we cannot support these kinds of cuts, \nespecially at the magnitude this proposal is talking about. The Social \nSecurity Office of the Actuary has reported that chained CPI would \nreduce the COLA by about .3 percent a year. So let's look at that \nexample. A single woman, 65 years old in Washington State, would get a \nmonthly benefit of about $1,100 a month or $13,300 annually.\n  By age 80, if chained CPI would pass, that would result in a $56 per \nmonth or $672 annual cut in that benefit. So that is less food, that is \nless medicine, that is less vital care for these seniors. If that \nindividual actually lived to 90 years old, it would be an $87 a month \ncut and a $1,044 cut annually. If you think about the costs these \nseniors endure--and I for one have proposed changing the market basket \nof goods that the CPI is based on, because if you think about it, we \nhave a market basket of goods for their CPI that are what the overall \neconomy looks at.\n  But seniors have a much more expensive market basket of goods. They \nhave to buy more medicine. They have other additional out-of-pocket \nhealth care expenses. And so their costs are going up at a higher rate. \nBut this proposal, if you think about it, the average monthly cost of \nfood for a single elderly individual is about $231 per month. That is \nwhat the average is, about $53 a week. That is based on data from the \nElder Economic Security Standard Index. So an individual at 80 \nbasically means they would have 1 week less groceries under chained \nCPI.\n  That is what it means. They would have 1 week left of groceries every \nmonth.\n  In my State, when you think about the average out-of-pocket health \ncare\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\nexpenses seniors have for care, that average out-of-pocket expense \nrises by $1,400 for an individual. If you think about it alone, the \nincrease in health care out-of-pocket expenses basically wipes out \nwhere many seniors are for any kinds of remaining income. Certainly, if \nwe put this kind of cut on top of that, it would make it clear that \nseniors would be getting less from Social Security. We recently, for \nthe first time since 2009, gave seniors an increase to their cost-of-\nliving adjustment. Now what are we going to do--go backward and take it \naway? For 75 years, Americans have been paying into Social Security \nwith the promise that they would receive these benefits in their \nretirement years. Now is not a time to break that promise.\n  I think my colleague has clearly come to the floor with a message to \nour other colleagues who aren't here this afternoon, to say take a look \nat the details of this proposal. This is not a simple proposal about in \nthe future someone is going to get less than they might under some \nother plan; this is about a cut in the benefit formula today that would \nimpact seniors if implemented.\n  So I am here with my colleague to say our economic situation has not \nbeen caused by seniors coming to Capitol Hill and proposing that we \nhave opaque derivative markets. It wasn't caused by seniors coming and \nsaying: Let's go ahead and have the banks get rid of Glass-Steagall so \nthe banks can do whatever they want. Seniors didn't come here and foist \nthis economic situation on us. Yet, where are the other proposals to \nhelp fix that? Yet, the No. 1 proposal we saw circulating in July was, \nright off the bat, $300 billion coming off the backs of seniors. That \nsame proposal is still circulating in the Halls of Congress. My \ncolleague and I are here this afternoon to say that it is not the \nproposal we should be considering.\n  So I hope our other colleagues will stand up to protect seniors, \nparticularly women, who are living longer, and make sure they have \nthese important Social Security benefits.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First of all, I compliment the Senator for the really \nwonderful teaching she just did on this issue. She is a member of the \nFinance Committee, and with all they are doing in Social Security, \nhasn't there been a hearing in the Finance Committee on the chained \nCPI, and have experts and senior advocacy groups shared their views \nwith the Congress?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I can say to the Senator from Maryland \nthat in my time period there, I don't remember any hearing or briefing \non chained CPI that was the focus of the hearing. I don't know if in \nthe last 15 or 20 years somebody hasn't suggested or had a hearing on \nit.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How many years has the Senator been on the committee?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Two years.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. In those 2 years, this has not come up.\n  I have another question about the Finance Committee, which also has \njurisdiction over health care. Is it the Senator's understanding that \nboth in the supercommittee and other reforms, Congress's intent is to \nraise premiums and copayments and a variety of other things on seniors? \nIs that one of those things out there in the ether?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I can tell the Senator from Maryland that there are \nlots of ideas that people are suggesting. I don't know the details of \nthe supercommittee or to say the Finance Committee is backing up the \nsupercommittee on those ideas. I know we have to live within our \nbudget, and we have to make some tough decisions.\n  There are many positives in the health care law that are about \nallowing seniors to stay in their homes and receive care as opposed to \ngoing into nursing homes, which is very positive and helps reduce \nsignificantly the cost of health care. There are things in there that \nwill help us get more transparency on drug prices. Many of us would \nlike to have direct negotiations on drug prices and drive the costs \ndown even further for seniors. And obviously there are reforms that \nwill help us get more efficient in the delivery system. Those are \nthings you can accentuate by moving more quickly.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, coming from Minnesota, with the Mayo \nClinic, certainly understands about outcome-based health care, \npreventive medicine, and those things seniors would like to see in \nreform that actually deliver better care and drive down costs. Those \nare the proposals that I think we should be discussing, that are \npositive for seniors, will help seniors, and will deliver the kind of \ncare that is more efficient and cost-effective. But asking them to take \nit right on the chin with something like this proposal, as my colleague \noutlined as well, is something we are not willing to do.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senator from Maryland for her tireless \nleadership on behalf of women in America and making sure they can make \ndo in this tough economy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7358-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., called \nthe organized labor movement, ``the principal force that transformed \nmisery and despair into hope and progress.''\n  And for three decades, Jerry McEntee has been a leader in the quest \nfor that progress.\n  As president of the American Federation of State, County and \nMunicipal Employees since 1981, Jerry McEntee has been a driving force \nin the fight for a better life for American workers.\n  He has dedicated his union's resources to the struggle for greater \neconomic and social justice for every man and woman in this Nation--\nregardless of age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or \ndisability.\n  And he has literally given American workers a voice.\n  AFSCME has played a role in every struggle to protect collective \nbargaining rights, equal pay, good benefits, secure retirement, public \nservices and worker opportunity for the last 75 years. And for more \nthan 50 of those years, Jerry has been part of the fight.\n  At the helm of AFSCME, Jerry advocated for every piece of progressive \nlegislation passed in the last three decades. The organization and \ndedication of Jerry and his 1.6 million brothers and sisters has been \ninvaluable, whether we were raising the minimum wage or passing the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  And Democrats and our progressive allies are grateful for his \nleadership and support over the years.\n  As Jerry McEntee announces that he will retire next year from \nAFSCME's presidency, I am reminded that our work isn't over. Assaults \non collective bargaining rights in Wisconsin and Ohio proved that.\n  The journey from misery and despair to hope and progress that Dr. \nKing spoke of--a journey that Jerry McEntee has led for more than 30 \nyears--is never truly over.\n  I look forward to working side by side with AFSCME, our friends in \nlabor and all our progressive allies as we continue the work of my \nfriend, Jerry McEntee.\n  The labor movement is better because of Jerry. America is a better \nplace because of Jerry.\n  I congratulate Jerry on a career well spent in the pursuit of \nprogress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7358-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7358-S7359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      KENTUCKY ARMY NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a couple \nwho truly exemplify the spirit of Kentucky. Mackie and Doris Reams have \nbeen happily married for 57 years and have lived an exciting and \nromantic life together in London, KY.\n  When Mackie, now 80, first saw Doris, he was about 20 and was working \nas a tobacco cutter in a field near her house; she was only 16 at the \ntime. ``I saw her a few times and I just got brave enough to ask her to \ngo out,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't resist those pretty blond curls . . \n. .That's how it started. We went together for about three years before \nwe got married.'' Mackie and Doris were married on October 3, 1953, by \npreacher Layton Vandaventer and have been inseparable ever since.\n  The couple lived in Mackie's parents' house on Old Salem Road for \nseveral years after they wed and worked on the family farm. Each day \nthey milked 8 cows by hand and tended to 6,000 broiler chickens. ``We \nfed and took care of them for nine weeks,'' recalls Doris, now 76. \n``Then Purina Company came and we loaded them on a truck that took them \nto a processing plant in Mt. Sterling.''\n  In 1955, Mackie began a brief stint of service in the U.S. Army--his \nservice ended in 1957. Afterwards, he began a career at Caron Spinning \nwhere he worked for 27 years. Doris was also employed at the Caron \nSpinning factory for almost 13 years until it finally closed down. \nMackie's final job before he retired was as a door greeter at Walmart. \n``My legs and knees got to bothering me, standing there all the time,'' \nMackie said. ``So, I just quit. We just go and do whatever we want to \ndo,'' he says in reference to their daily routine.\n  Each day the couple walks at Kmart every morning and visits the \nLaurel County Older Person Activity Center. ``We play cards and play \ncornhole in the exercise room,'' Doris said. ``We have lunch. OPAC has \na lot of things to do. They took us to the state fair this year,'' she \nexplained. In what spare time they do have, Doris and Mackie also \nattend Calvary Baptist Church on Sunday mornings and Wednesday \nevenings.\n  ``We have been very healthy and happy all our life together,'' Mackie \nand Doris are lucky enough to say. ``We thank God for that.''\n  Doris and Mackie Reams are an outstanding pair of Kentuckians who are \ntruly blessed for the wonderful lifetime they have shared together. \nThey are hard-working, caring citizens whose lifetime of success and \nhappiness serves as an inspiration to the people of our great \nCommonwealth.\n  The Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo recently \npublished an article highlighting this couple's achievements over the \nyears. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel Echo, Winter 2011]\n\n                        Together, Wherever We Go\n\n                            (By Carol Mills)\n\n       Former Walmart greeter Mackie Reams met his wife Doris 60 \n     years ago, and they have been happily married for 57 years. \n     He is 80 and she is 76.\n       Their secret to staying in love for so long is they do \n     everything together.\n       ``We just went together wherever we were going, and we \n     still do,'' Doris said.\n       Mackie said he lets her do all the shopping, but he goes \n     with her. Sometimes he sits and waits on her to finish \n     shopping, but he is always near.\n       ``If we went somewhere, we took our kids with us and \n     everybody went. That's just the way we lived.''\n       Doris moved to Bill George Road from Knox County with her \n     parents at a young age.\n       ``I've lived around this territory ever since I was 10 \n     years old,'' she said. ``My dad owned all this country back \n     in here where all the houses are. We just farmed. We raised \n     tobacco and corn. After we got married, I worked for Caron \n     Spinning. I worked there for 13 years until they closed \n     out.''\n       Mackie farmed at his parents' place on Old Salem Road. \n     After he married Doris, the couple stayed with his parents \n     for a couple of years. On his farm, they milked eight cows by \n     hand twice a day for two years and sold the milk to Southern \n     Belle Dairy Company.\n       The Reams also raised broiler chickens.\n       ``The broiler house held 6,000 chickens,'' Doris recalled. \n     ``We fed and took care of them for nine weeks. Then Purina \n     Company came, and we loaded them on a truck that took them to \n     a processing plant in Mt. Sterling. Then we would have to \n     clean the house and get ready for another bunch of baby \n     chickens and start all over again.''\n       Mackie spent two years in the U.S. Army--1955 to 1957. He \n     then worked at Caron Spinning for 27 years and for 13 years \n     as a door greeter at Walmart.\n       ``I quit about three years ago,'' Mackie said. ``My legs \n     and knees got to bothering me, standing there all the time. \n     So, I just quit. We just go and do whatever we want to do.''\n       The couple walks at Kmart every morning and attend Calvary \n     Baptist Church every Sunday morning and evening and on \n     Wednesday.\n       The couple also visits Laurel County Older Person Activity \n     Center almost every day.\n       ``We play cards and play cornhole in the exercise room,'' \n     Doris said. ``We have lunch. OPAC has a lot of things to \n     do.''\n       Mackie said OPAC took them to Frankfort to see the Capitol.\n       ``They took us to the state fair this year,'' Doris said.\n       They used to travel a lot.\n       ``We've been to a lot of the states,'' Doris said. ``We \n     usually went with friends. We went all the way to California, \n     driving around on two weeks of vacation. We just drove and \n     stopped whenever we got ready.''\n       ``Niagara Falls, all up in New York and all up in that \n     territory,'' Mackie added. ``All over Kentucky and the United \n     States just about.''\n       In the '70s and '80s, Mackie and Doris were active in \n     sports. He played baseball while Doris watched and rooted for \n     him. They also went bowling three or four nights a week at \n     Levi Lanes.\n       ``We won lots of trophies,'' Doris said. ``I also used to \n     quilt a lot during the winter months and made crocheted \n     afghans, but I can't anymore because of my arthritis in my \n     hands.''\n       Mackie first noticed Doris at her home near where he was \n     cutting tobacco in a field. Her home was just a couple of \n     houses down from where she now lives on Bill George Road. He \n     was 20 years old, and she was 16.\n       ``I saw her a few times and I just got brave enough to ask \n     her to go out,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't resist those \n     pretty blond curls. That's how it started. We got to going to \n     church together. We went together for about three years \n     before we got married.''\n       Mackie said he drove his father's pickup to do his \n     courting.\n       ``I got to drive it,'' he said. ``I'd go get her and we'd \n     go to church. We'd ride around and maybe go up to town on \n     Saturday and walk up and down the streets. I never did go to \n     the Reda (theater) with her because her family was kind of \n     strict. They didn't want her going places like that at that \n     time.''\n       ``My parents were old fashioned,'' Doris laughed. ``I guess \n     they finally decided we were going to get married anyway and \n     agreed. They didn't like it too well, but they went ahead \n     with it. My dad went with us to the wedding, but my mom \n     didn't because she thought she would cry or something. We got \n     married in the preacher's house on Oct. 3, 1953. His name was \n     Layton Vandaventer. He's deceased now.''\n       Doris and Mackie have been in good health for most of their \n     lives.\n       ``We have been very healthy and happy all our life \n     together,'' they said. ``We thank God for that.''\n       The couple has two children, Eddie Reams and Phyllis \n     Purvis, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7359-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7359-S7360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from Attorney General Holder.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2011.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: This responds to your letters to Attorney \n     General Holder dated June 6, 2011, and November 2, 2011, \n     regarding the Department of Justice's implementation and \n     enforcement of the Crime Victims'\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\n     Rights Act (CVRA), enacted as section 102 of the Justice for \n     All Act of 2004. Pub. L. No. 108-405, 118 Stat. 2260, 2261-64 \n     (codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771 (2006 & Supp. III 2009)). We \n     apologize for our delay in responding to your June 6 letter. \n     Your November 2 letter raises additional questions, to which \n     we will reply as soon as possible.\n       The Department appreciates your leadership in the area of \n     protecting crime victims' rights, and we share your \n     commitment to ensuring that crime victims receive the rights \n     and services to which they are entitled under federal law. In \n     the six years since passage of the CVRA, Department personnel \n     have made their best efforts in thousands of federal and \n     District of Columbia cases to assert, support, and defend \n     crime victims' rights, often over the objections of \n     defendants, and occasionally in the face of a skeptical \n     judiciary.\n       Every day, federal prosecutors and victim-witness \n     professionals consult with victims, inform them of their \n     rights, including the right to be represented by an attorney, \n     accompany them to court, and assist them with preparing \n     victim impact statements and seeking and recovering \n     restitution. The number of identified victims registered in \n     our automated system in order to receive notices and other \n     services has grown significantly, totaling 2.2 million in \n     Fiscal Year 2010. In that year, the Department sent out 8 \n     million notifications of public court proceedings to victims \n     to ensure that persons harmed by the charged conduct were \n     informed about those proceedings. In contrast, the year \n     before the CVRA passed, 2.7 million such notices were sent.\n       In addition, U.S. Attorneys' Offices are increasingly using \n     asset forfeiture laws to help victims by applying forfeited \n     assets to satisfy restitution orders. These efforts have \n     resulted in measurable improvements for victims; the amount \n     of forfeited proceeds returned to victims has jumped from \n     $13.7 million in FY 2004 to $250 million in the first 8 \n     months of FY 2011.\n       In 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     conducted an extensive evaluation of the Department's CVRA \n     implementation efforts. GAO considered the views of victims, \n     victim-witness professionals, federal investigators, \n     prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges during the audit. \n     The GAO concluded that the Department and the federal \n     judiciary ``have made various efforts to implement the \n     CVRA,'' and ``have taken actions to address four factors that \n     have affected CVRA implementation, including the \n     characteristics of certain cases, the increased workload of \n     some USAO staff, the scheduling of court proceedings, and \n     diverging interests between the prosecution and victims.'' \n     See Crime Victims' Rights Act: Increasing Victim Awareness \n     and Clarifying Applicability to the District of Columbia Will \n     Improve Implementation of the Act: Hearing Before the H. \n     Comm. on the Judiciary, 110th Cong. at 8 (2009) (statement of \n     Eileen R. Larence, Director, Homeland Security and Justice, \n     Government Accountability Office). The GAO ultimately offered \n     only minor recommendations for improvements, all of which \n     have been significantly addressed.\n       Your June 6 letter posed three questions regarding victims' \n     rights. First, you asked about the fair treatment of crime \n     victims prior to charging, specifically during pre-charge \n     plea and non-prosecution negotiations. In 2010, the Attorney \n     General directed the Deputy Attorney General to convene a \n     working group to help evaluate, coordinate, and improve the \n     services the Department provides to crime victims and \n     witnesses. The working group undertook a revision of the \n     Department's basic operational policy manual, the Attorney \n     General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance (AG \n     Guidelines). As you noted in your November 2 letter, the \n     revised 2011 AG Guidelines (available at www.justice.gov/olp/\npdf/ag_guidelines2011\n.pdf) took effect on October 1, 2011. As part of the revision \n     process, the working group sought input from all Departmental \n     components that interact with victims of crime and, with \n     respect to certain difficult legal issues, sought guidance \n     from the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). Regarding when the \n     rights accorded by the CVRA apply, OLC determined the statute \n     is best read as providing that rights apply beginning when \n     criminal proceedings are initiated. Even so, the new AG \n     Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors \n     should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims \n     of, and consider victims' views about, prospective plea \n     negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging \n     instrument with the court. Art. V.0.2, AG Guidelines (2011 \n     ed.).\n       Additionally, the revised AG Guidelines strengthen and \n     clarify the Department's policies by encouraging Department \n     personnel to go beyond minimum statutory requirements to \n     assist crime victims at all points in the criminal justice \n     process. Even for those who do not qualify under statutory \n     victim definitions, the revised AG Guidelines authorize the \n     provision of services and information, and support \n     participation by victims in court proceedings. See Art. 11.A \n     and Art. III.E, AG Guidelines (2011 ed.).\n       Moreover, in addition to carrying out our responsibilities \n     under the CVRA, the Department is taking other steps to \n     fulfill its mandate to provide services to crime victims from \n     the opening of a criminal investigation. Pursuant to the \n     Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the \n     Department identifies victims and provides to them service \n     referrals, reasonable protection, notice concerning the \n     status of the investigation, and information about the \n     criminal justice process prior to the filing of any charges. \n     The Department's investigative agencies provide such services \n     to thousands of victims every year, whether or not \n     the investigation results in a federal prosecution. The \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alone reports it \n     provided more than 190,000 services to victims during the \n     past fiscal year, including case status updates, \n     assistance with compensation applications and referrals, \n     and counseling referrals. From sexual assaults in Indian \n     Country to child pornography and human trafficking to mass \n     violence and overseas terrorism, FBI victim specialists \n     provide much-needed immediate and ongoing support and \n     information to victims. The FBI addresses victim safety \n     issues when needed, providing on-scene response and crisis \n     intervention services in thousands of investigations. With \n     regard to sexual assault victims, FBI personnel arrange \n     for and often accompany victims to forensic sexual assault \n     medical examinations and provide assistance with HIV/STD \n     testing. In sum, the Department's assistance to victims \n     during the investigatory stage exemplifies a commitment to \n     crime victims above and beyond the statutory mandates.\n       Second, you asked about the Department's litigation \n     position regarding the standard of review for mandamus cases \n     filed pursuant to the CVRA. The CVRA constitutes a \n     significant, large-scale change in the operation of the \n     federal criminal justice system. For that reason, and because \n     the rights of crime victims must be balanced against \n     recognized rights of criminal defendants, it was inevitable \n     that CVRA implementation would be accompanied by litigation \n     concerning its provisions. The Department has been actively \n     engaged in that litigation, frequently on the side of the \n     victims, seeking to enforce their rights in court. The \n     litigating decisions we make in those cases are reached only \n     after careful consideration of both the language and the \n     purpose of the CVRA, and of our responsibility to foster a \n     fair criminal justice system that respects the rights of all \n     involved, including victims and defendants. Even when we \n     conclude that victim status is inappropriate, or that a \n     certain claimed right should not be accorded to the person \n     seeking it, we often try to find other ways to accommodate \n     that person's legitimate interests in the outcome of the \n     criminal case at hand.\n       Concerning the mandamus standard of review, the \n     Department's legal analysis is set forth in the brief that \n     you cite in your letter, In re Antrobus, No. 08-4002 (10th \n     Cir. Feb. 12, 2008). As you note, the CVRA requires that the \n     Department use its ``best efforts'' to afford crime victims \n     their CVRA rights. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771(c)(1) (``Officers and \n     employees of the Department of Justice and other departments \n     and agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, \n     investigation, or prosecution of crime shall make their best \n     efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and \n     accorded, the rights described in [18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3771(a)].''). The Department makes its best efforts on a \n     daily basis to ensure victims are notified of and accorded \n     such rights. Indeed, the new AG Guidelines specifically \n     instruct Department personnel to consider a victim's right to \n     fairness when developing and presenting the government's \n     arguments. Art. V.J.3, AG Guidelines (2011 ed.).\n       Finally, you asked whether the Department has asserted \n     victims' rights on an appeal, even when the appeal is taken \n     by the defendant appealing his or her conviction. See 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3771(d)(4) (``In any appeal in a criminal case, \n     the Government may assert as error the district court's \n     denial of any crime victim's right in the proceeding to which \n     the appeal relates.'') We do not maintain statistics on the \n     use of this provision and, therefore, cannot answer this \n     question definitively. We note, however, that the potential \n     utility of this provision is limited, with the exception of a \n     narrow category of cases; an appellate court typically would \n     not be able to grant any relief to correct a CVRA error \n     asserted in response to a defendant's appeal, other than \n     issuing an advisory opinion. We will continue to keep this \n     provision in mind as we evaluate cases in the future and, as \n     we have done in the past, we will continue to defend \n     convictions on appeal in the face of defense challenges to \n     victims' assertions of rights.\n       Thank you for your interest in the Department's efforts to \n     accord the victims of federal crimes their rights under \n     federal law. We welcome the opportunity to work with you and \n     your staff to ensure that crime victims receive the rights \n     and services they deserve. We hope this information is \n     helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact this office if we \n     may provide additional assistance regarding this, or any \n     other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ronald Weich,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7359-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7359-S7360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from Attorney General Holder.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2011.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: This responds to your letters to Attorney \n     General Holder dated June 6, 2011, and November 2, 2011, \n     regarding the Department of Justice's implementation and \n     enforcement of the Crime Victims'\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\n     Rights Act (CVRA), enacted as section 102 of the Justice for \n     All Act of 2004. Pub. L. No. 108-405, 118 Stat. 2260, 2261-64 \n     (codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771 (2006 & Supp. III 2009)). We \n     apologize for our delay in responding to your June 6 letter. \n     Your November 2 letter raises additional questions, to which \n     we will reply as soon as possible.\n       The Department appreciates your leadership in the area of \n     protecting crime victims' rights, and we share your \n     commitment to ensuring that crime victims receive the rights \n     and services to which they are entitled under federal law. In \n     the six years since passage of the CVRA, Department personnel \n     have made their best efforts in thousands of federal and \n     District of Columbia cases to assert, support, and defend \n     crime victims' rights, often over the objections of \n     defendants, and occasionally in the face of a skeptical \n     judiciary.\n       Every day, federal prosecutors and victim-witness \n     professionals consult with victims, inform them of their \n     rights, including the right to be represented by an attorney, \n     accompany them to court, and assist them with preparing \n     victim impact statements and seeking and recovering \n     restitution. The number of identified victims registered in \n     our automated system in order to receive notices and other \n     services has grown significantly, totaling 2.2 million in \n     Fiscal Year 2010. In that year, the Department sent out 8 \n     million notifications of public court proceedings to victims \n     to ensure that persons harmed by the charged conduct were \n     informed about those proceedings. In contrast, the year \n     before the CVRA passed, 2.7 million such notices were sent.\n       In addition, U.S. Attorneys' Offices are increasingly using \n     asset forfeiture laws to help victims by applying forfeited \n     assets to satisfy restitution orders. These efforts have \n     resulted in measurable improvements for victims; the amount \n     of forfeited proceeds returned to victims has jumped from \n     $13.7 million in FY 2004 to $250 million in the first 8 \n     months of FY 2011.\n       In 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     conducted an extensive evaluation of the Department's CVRA \n     implementation efforts. GAO considered the views of victims, \n     victim-witness professionals, federal investigators, \n     prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges during the audit. \n     The GAO concluded that the Department and the federal \n     judiciary ``have made various efforts to implement the \n     CVRA,'' and ``have taken actions to address four factors that \n     have affected CVRA implementation, including the \n     characteristics of certain cases, the increased workload of \n     some USAO staff, the scheduling of court proceedings, and \n     diverging interests between the prosecution and victims.'' \n     See Crime Victims' Rights Act: Increasing Victim Awareness \n     and Clarifying Applicability to the District of Columbia Will \n     Improve Implementation of the Act: Hearing Before the H. \n     Comm. on the Judiciary, 110th Cong. at 8 (2009) (statement of \n     Eileen R. Larence, Director, Homeland Security and Justice, \n     Government Accountability Office). The GAO ultimately offered \n     only minor recommendations for improvements, all of which \n     have been significantly addressed.\n       Your June 6 letter posed three questions regarding victims' \n     rights. First, you asked about the fair treatment of crime \n     victims prior to charging, specifically during pre-charge \n     plea and non-prosecution negotiations. In 2010, the Attorney \n     General directed the Deputy Attorney General to convene a \n     working group to help evaluate, coordinate, and improve the \n     services the Department provides to crime victims and \n     witnesses. The working group undertook a revision of the \n     Department's basic operational policy manual, the Attorney \n     General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance (AG \n     Guidelines). As you noted in your November 2 letter, the \n     revised 2011 AG Guidelines (available at www.justice.gov/olp/\npdf/ag_guidelines2011\n.pdf) took effect on October 1, 2011. As part of the revision \n     process, the working group sought input from all Departmental \n     components that interact with victims of crime and, with \n     respect to certain difficult legal issues, sought guidance \n     from the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). Regarding when the \n     rights accorded by the CVRA apply, OLC determined the statute \n     is best read as providing that rights apply beginning when \n     criminal proceedings are initiated. Even so, the new AG \n     Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors \n     should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims \n     of, and consider victims' views about, prospective plea \n     negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging \n     instrument with the court. Art. V.0.2, AG Guidelines (2011 \n     ed.).\n       Additionally, the revised AG Guidelines strengthen and \n     clarify the Department's policies by encouraging Department \n     personnel to go beyond minimum statutory requirements to \n     assist crime victims at all points in the criminal justice \n     process. Even for those who do not qualify under statutory \n     victim definitions, the revised AG Guidelines authorize the \n     provision of services and information, and support \n     participation by victims in court proceedings. See Art. 11.A \n     and Art. III.E, AG Guidelines (2011 ed.).\n       Moreover, in addition to carrying out our responsibilities \n     under the CVRA, the Department is taking other steps to \n     fulfill its mandate to provide services to crime victims from \n     the opening of a criminal investigation. Pursuant to the \n     Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the \n     Department identifies victims and provides to them service \n     referrals, reasonable protection, notice concerning the \n     status of the investigation, and information about the \n     criminal justice process prior to the filing of any charges. \n     The Department's investigative agencies provide such services \n     to thousands of victims every year, whether or not \n     the investigation results in a federal prosecution.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and thank our \nNation's veterans. They have helped define our country with their \nservice, their commitment, their sacrifice, and their legacy.\n  On November 11, 1918, the hostilities of World War I ceased. The \ncommemoration of this day was originally known\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\nas ``Armistice Day'' and was declared a Federal holiday. During a House \ndebate on the topic, one Representative suggested that Armistice Day \nwould ``not be devoted to the exaltation of glories achieved in war \nbut, rather to an emphasis upon those blessings which are associated \nwith the peacetime activities of mankind.'' By 1954 it was official \nthat November 11 was the day to honor American veterans of all wars, \nand the day would officially be known as ``Veterans Day.''\n  As we reflect on the service of heroes who have served our country in \nconflicts past including World War I, World War II, the Korean war, the \nVietnam war, the Persian Gulf war and others, we must pause also to \nhonor the dedication of the men and women who are putting their lives \non the line today to protect our freedom. This includes not only those \nserving in Southwest Asia but also those in Kosovo, those standing \nwatch of the Korean demilitarized zone, and those serving and \nsacrificing in countless other countries and regions around the world.\n  For veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, we need to highlight \nthe increasing problems they are having as they return home from \nservice, from obtaining appropriate health care to finding jobs. In \nAlaska, I hear concerns about how the Federal Government's efforts to \nreduce the national debt may impact our servicemembers and veterans. I \nunderstand those concerns and believe we must honor our commitments to \nthese men and women.\n  In my home State of Alaska, we have the distinct pleasure and honor \nof having the largest per capita percentage of veterans of any State in \nthe Union with 77,000 veterans who call Alaska home. In just a few \nmonths, Alaska-based soldiers will represent approximately 10 percent \nof America's Afghanistan presence. In Alaska, veterans are our \nneighbors, our coworkers, and our friends. I think it is fair to say \nthat Alaskans understand and appreciate the sacrifice thousands of \nyoung men and women in uniform today are making, as well as the \nsacrifice all of our veterans have made. It is all of them who we honor \ntoday.\n  Today as we honor those who have served, we also mourn. We mourn \nthose veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of \nfreedom. Alaska has lost many members of our military community in the \nAfghanistan and Iraq wars. I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the \nfamilies of all our fallen servicemembers.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize one last group: the families and \nloved ones of America's veterans. These are the folks who have had to \nsee their loved ones sent away to war zones and who worried about their \nwell being every second, of every minute, of every day until the they \nreturned. These are the people who singlehandedly manage households. \nThese are the people who deal firsthand with the invisible scars and \ninjuries of war, such as PTSD, when their loved one comes home. The \nfamily members of our veterans are heroes who bravely serve our Nation \nand rightfully deserve our recognition.\n  So on this Veterans Day, I am honored to have the opportunity to \nstand among my colleagues to honor the veterans who made the ultimate \nsacrifice, those who made it home, those who are still serving across \nthe world, and the families and loved ones of America's veterans. While \nwords cannot express the gratitude we have for our veterans, with a \nunified voice we want to say thank you.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I had the opportunity to visit Slovakia in \n2009. It was a great opportunity for me to meet with representatives of \na country that is a close ally of the United States. Slovakia and the \nUnited States share strong ties thanks to the heritage of many \nAmericans whose parents, grandparents or great grandparents came from \nSlovakia. We are also bound by our common devotion to democracy and \nhuman rights. It is an important friendship.\n  My visit to Bratislava gave me a chance to strengthen those ties. It \nalso provided me with an opportunity to share with my Slovak friends \nconcerns I have about the practice of targeting Romani women for \nsterilization without informed consent--a practice that was documented \nand condemned by the Charter 77 human rights movement more than 30 \nyears ago. Unfortunately, sterilizations without consent continued to \nbe performed in State-run hospitals in the Czech and Slovak Republics--\nreportedly even in this century.\n\n[[Page S7362]]\n\n  This week there has been an important development on that front. On \nTuesday, the European Court on Human Rights found that the \nsterilization without informed consent of a Romani woman had violated \narticle 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the prohibition \non inhuman or degrading treatment, and article 8, the right to family \nlife.\n  This is an incredibly important victory for a woman who was \nwrongfully sterilized at the time of the birth of her second child and \nwho has since struggled for 11 years to vindicate this claim. I commend \nher for her bravery and tenaciousness in the face of numerous \nobstacles. At the same time, I am aware that the damages awarded by the \ncourt can never fully compensate for what was taken from her.\n  I regret that it has taken so long to achieve this single victory. \nThus far, the Slovak Government has refused to acknowledge this past \npractice of targeting Romani women for sterilization. In the last \ndecade, in the face of growing documentation of this abuse and \nincreasing calls for the Slovak Government to acknowledge this grave \nhuman rights violation, Slovak authorities have, in turns, made threats \nagainst victims, denied the past abuse, and some voices even continue \nto call for making sterilization freely available to ``socially \nexcluded communities''--a term that is almost synonymously used to \ndescribe Roma.\n  There are other countries where sterilization without consent also \noccurred in the last century, including Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and \n33 States in the United States. But Slovakia has been singularly \nresistant to acknowledging that these abuses not only happened, but are \nindefensible by modern standards.\n  While I welcome this week's decision by the European court, it does \nnot put an end to this issue. There are two other sterilization cases \npending in Slovakia's domestic courts, and five other cases pending \nagainst Slovakia before the European court. I urge the Slovak \nGovernment not to force victims through the painful process of \nlitigating each case--a process that has immeasurable costs for all \nsides--and to establish a less burdensome process for victims to have \ntheir claims recognized. It is long overdue for Slovak authorities to \nacknowledge that Romani women were targeted for sterilization without \ninformed consent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7362-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S. MARINE CORPS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the U.S. Marine \nCorps as it celebrates 236 years of sacrifice and service to this great \nNation. In the spirit of a true marine, ooo-rah and happy birthday. \nThis week, it is fitting that our great and deliberate body, the \nSenate, passed a bill to honor and revere the Montford Point marines, \nthe first African Americans to serve in our Corps. Last night, the \nSenate passed legislation to award the Montford Point marines the \nCongressional Gold Medal. I can think of no better way to honor these \ngentleman, most of whom are now in their nineties, for being a part of \nour Nation's history during a difficult time, both abroad and at home.\n  In 1942, the U.S. Marine Corps opened its doors for African Americans \nto play a role in combat. Unfortunately, these men were not trained \nwhere marines before them had done so. Instead, from 1942 to 1949, the \nCorps trained Black marines at Montford Point Camp in North Carolina.\n  Like true marines, even with segregated training, these men fought \nshoulder to shoulder next to every marine in World War II. Their \nactions were significant during our campaign in the Pacific. Their \nservice to the Corps is now a significant thread in its history. The \nMarine Corps extols the virtues of courage, intelligence, integrity, \nand leadership. I am proud that the spirit of the Corps resonated in \nevery one of these marines, even in a time of great inequality. In \ntheater, a marine is a marine. We are brothers, regardless of color or \ncreed. The duty every marine pledges to mission and man is equal. It is \nwhat makes our Corps the great fighting force that continues today.\n  I applaud our Commandant, General Amos. Without his commitment to \nthis initiative honoring the Montford Point marines, we may not have \npassed the bill so easily. I am very proud of my Corps, humbled by all \nthe men and women who continue to join our Armed Forces, and to the \nSenate for finally recognizing these incredible veterans in the \nappropriate way.\n  I am as proud of the Marine Corps today as ever. The Corps has \ndutifully accomplished exactly what the President and this Nation have \nasked of them over the past decade. Marines have turned the tide in \nIraq and continue to wage ahead in Afghanistan. Marines continue to \nsteer the course of how to succeed in land campaigns and remain always \nfaithful, both to mission and fellow marine.\n  Today, we celebrate the Marine Corps. Tomorrow, we celebrate all our \nwarfighters, those men and women in uniform who have committed their \ntime, and put their lives in harm's way, for the defense of the United \nStates. Thank you to all those who have served. God bless all those \ncurrently deployed around the world.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to MG Raymond Carpenter, the acting director of the Army \nNational Guard, for his ongoing, selfless dedication and service to our \ncountry.\n  After enlisting in the South Dakota National Guard in 1967, Major \nGeneral Carpenter joined the Navy and deployed to South Vietnam. After \nreturning to the Guard as a Vietnam veteran, General Carpenter became a \ncommissioned officer in 1974 and has since commanded at all levels. His \nefforts have transformed the Army National Guard from a strategic \nreserve into an operational reserve force, and the Army National Guard \nis now at its highest level of readiness in its 375 year history.\n  In our most recent conflicts, and through these tough economic times, \nGeneral Carpenter has been credited for driving cost efficiencies that \nhave saved millions of taxpayer dollars. General Carpenter led the Army \nNational Guard through the drawdown in Iraq and oversaw a critical \ncomponent of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, the implementation and \nexpansion of the Guard's Agribusiness Development Teams.\n  General Carpenter's service to our Nation has come with considerable \npersonal sacrifice from himself and his family. Rather than fill the \nrole of the adjutant general of the South Dakota Guard and return home \nto live with his family, General Carpenter answered the call of duty, \naccepted the job of the director of the Army National Guard at the \nNational Guard Bureau, and uncomplainingly shouldered a three star \nworkload for his two star pay. General Carpenter put his and his \nfamily's life on hold for over 2 years and lived at the mercy of the \nnomination process, never knowing when he might be replaced by a full \ndirector of the Army Guard. I call on my colleagues in the Senate to \njoin me in honoring MG Raymond Carpenter, and I hope his successor will \nbe confirmed in the near future.\n  I know that the entire Senate joins me in expressing my appreciation \nfor General Carpenter's service to our grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7362-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7362-S7363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DOROTHY RODHAM\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise in memory of Dorothy Howell \nRodham, a truly extraordinary woman who died last week at the age of \n92.\n  Many Americans knew Dorothy Rodham through her daughter, Secretary of \nState Hillary Rodham Clinton, who credits her mother with giving her \nthe strength, self-confidence, perseverance, and faith she needed to \nthrive in politics and diplomacy.\n  Millions of Americans had the opportunity to get to know Dorothy on \nthe campaign trail for her son-in-law, William Jefferson Clinton, and \nher daughter Hillary. They saw a bright, sincere, and highly \nintelligent woman who was so proud of her family and would do anything \nfor them.\n  Some of us had known that Dorothy weathered a difficult childhood, \nbut it was only with her passing that many Americans learned just how \nharrowing it was. Abandoned by her parents at age 8, she took her 3-\nyear-old sister on\n\n[[Page S7363]]\n\na cross-country train trip to live with their unwelcoming grandparents \nin California. By her early teens, she had to leave their home and \nbegin working as a nanny.\n  Dorothy worked as a secretary in Chicago before marrying Hugh Rodham \nand raising their three children: Hillary, Hugh, and Tony. Throughout \nher life, Mrs. Rodham worked hard to ensure that her children and \ngrandchildren had the opportunities she had been denied.\n  Dorothy and I shared a great joy--our grandson Zachary. I saw first-\nhand what a wonderful influence she was for Zach, always there for him \nin every way. She was that way for all her grandchildren, including her \nfirst remarkable grandchild--Chelsea.\n  When Hillary Rodham Clinton was asked who inspired her to succeed in \npublic life, she credited the women's movement and Dorothy Rodham, \n``who never got a chance to go to college, who had a very difficult \nchildhood, but who gave me a belief that I could do whatever I set my \nmind to.''\n  Dorothy Rodham was an extraordinary woman--strong, compassionate and \nloving. She will be sorely missed by her loved ones, by her friends, \nand by the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7363-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LANCE CORPORAL LARRY GENE BAILEY II\n\n  Mr. KIRK.

Lance Corporal \nBailey joined the Marines in October 2007, and like his father, a \nVietnam Veteran, he too wanted to serve his country. His parents and \nhis country are very proud of his service and sacrifice.\n  On June 23, 2011 in Helmand province, Lance Corporal Bailey ran to a \nrooftop to provide cover for his unit under heavy fire. An improvised \nexplosive device took both of his legs and one of his arms. This young \nman's will to live and recover are an inspiration to us all.\n  With the support of his parents Mary and Larry, he has made great \nstrides in his recovery. This Veterans Day, our nation owes a great \ndebt of gratitude to families like the Baileys, whose service to our \nnation continues to preserve our American way of life.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a poem penned \nin honor of Lance Corporal Bailey by Albert Caswell.\n\n                          Make My Father Proud\n\n\nIN HONOR OF AN AMERICAN HERO LANCE CORPORAL LARRY GENE BAILEY II.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friends Gerry and \nLilo Leeds for their passionate commitment to improving the Nation's \neducation system and helping all students reach their maximum \npotential.\n  Gerard and Lilo Leeds arrived in the United States after fleeing \nGermany in 1939 with virtually no money. But armed with their \neducation, they eventually became successful entrepreneurs. In time, \nthey built and then sold a sizable media corporation and have devoted \ntheir lives to ensuring that all students have access to an excellent \neducation.\n  Initially, the Leeds founded the nonpartisan Institute for Student \nAchievement an organization that works in low-income middle and high \nschools to improve student achievement for at-risk youth. They were \nmajor supporters of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a coalition of \nconcerned parents and education advocates working to reform New York \nState's school finance system. The Leeds also established the \nnonpartisan Caroline and Sigmund Schott Foundation an organization that \nworks on early childhood education and care, gender equity, and \neducation financing issues.\n  However, Gerry and Lilo Leeds did not stop there. After seeing the \nInstitute for Student Achievement boost graduation rates in low-\nperforming schools up as high as 90 percent, they founded the \nnonpartisan Alliance for Excellent Education in 2001 to singularly \nfocus on advancing public policy to decrease dropout rates and prepare \nall students to succeed at the postsecondary level. The Alliance for \nExcellent Education has advocated on behalf of secondary school youth \nnow for over 10 years thanks to the leadership and support of the Leeds \nfamily.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Leeds have worked to improve the education of students \nfrom every background, location, and age. Lilo Leeds has made education \nfor students in less affluent communities, universal early education, \nand the advancement of women the focus of her work. She is also the co-\nfounder of the Great Neck/Manhasset Community Child Care partnership. \nGerry Leeds is the co-founder of the National Academy for Excellent \nTeacher, NAfET at Teachers College, Columbia University. Together, they \nare recipients of humanitarian awards from the Urban League, NAACP, New \nYork State United Teachers Association, and the American Jewish \nCommittee.

Mr. President, President Obama recently \nannounced that our long war and military involvement in Iraq would be \ncoming to a close.\n  For nearly a decade, our armed forces served honorably in Iraq and \ngot the job done. While I opposed the Iraq war from the beginning, my \ncommitment to our troops and our veterans has been resolute. We must \nalways remain mindful of the sacrifice and the obligations we hold to \nevery veteran.\n  It is because of those obligations that I rise today to speak about \nthe hidden wounds facing the veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars. \nThese wounds were not caused by insurgents or terrorists, but by \nexposure to environmental pollution caused by our own open air burn \npits.\n  Open air burn pits were widely used at forward operating bases, where \ndisposing of trash and other debris was a major challenge, and the \nsolution that was chosen had serious medical and environmental risks. \nPits of waste were set on fire andthey would turn the sky black. At \nthis and other bases, disposing of trash and other debris was a major \nchallenge, a challenge which was solved using a method fraught with \nmedical and environmental risks.\n  Over 10 acres of land at Joint Base Balad in Iraq were used for \nburning toxic debris. This is a base, that at the height of its \noperations, hosted approximately 25,000 military, civilian and \ncoalition personnel. Among the toxic soup released into the atmosphere \nfrom Balad were particulates from plastics and Styrofoam, metal, \nchemicals from paints and solvents, petroleum and lubricants, jet fuel \nand unexploded ordinance, medical and other dangerous waste--all in the \nair and being inhaled into the lungs of service members.\n  Air samples at Joint Base Balad turned up some nasty stuff: \nParticulate matter--chemicals that form from the incomplete burning of \ncoal, oil and gas, garbage, or other organic substances; volatile \norganic compounds such as acetone and benzene. Benzene is known to \ncause leukemia and dioxins which are associated with Agent Orange.\n  Our veterans have slowly begun to raise the alarm as they learn why, \nafter returning home, they are short of breath, or experiencing \nheadaches or other symptoms, and in some cases developing cancer. Many \nother independent organizations have also urged action on this issue, \nincluding the American Lung Association which has stated:\n  Emissions from burning waste contain fine particulate matter, sulfur \noxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and various \nirritant gases such as nitrogen oxides that can scar the lungs.\n  The organizations have called on the VA and Defense Department to \nbegin to monitor our troops and veterans who have been exposed.\n  Last week I added my voice to that call. The Open Burn Pits Registry \nAct of 2011 will give the VA the tools to help our veterans who are \nsuffering as a result of their exposure. Establishing an open burn pit \nregistry for those who may have been exposed is just a preliminary \nstep. A public information campaign, to help bring veterans forward, \nwill also be required. Once veterans are identified in the registry, \nthey will be able to receive information about significant developments \nassociated with their exposure. Furthermore, the identification of \naffected veterans could help improve the VA's ability to treat and \nunderstand the causes of these veterans' ailments.\n  As was noted this week, the Institute of Medicine released a report \nwhich concluded that while there was not conclusive evidence of a link \nbetween burn pits and medical ailments, that there was insufficient \nevidence to rule out a link as well. An online summary of the report \nstated a recommendation that:\n\n       a study be conducted that would evaluate the health status \n     of service members from their time of deployment to Joint \n     Base Balad over many years to determine their incidence of \n     chronic diseases, including cancers, that tend to not show up \n     for decades.\n\n  This registry will help our medical and scientific experts better \nanalyze who was exposed and who is suffering. In New Mexico, veterans \nhave begun to come forward about their medical conditions. Some, like \nMSG Jessey Baca, a member of the New Mexico Air National Guard who was \nstationed in Balad, Iraq, are facing serious ailments such as cancer \nand chronic bronchiolitis. It is stories like Master Sergeant Baca's \nwhich have motivated me to take action on this issue and I urge my \ncolleagues to hear the stories of veterans like him in all 50 States.\n  The Open Burn Pits Registry Act has bipartisan and bicameral support. \nIn the House, Representative Akin, a Republican, is sponsoring this \nimportant piece of legislation with a strong bipartisan group. On the \nSenate side I would like to thank my colleagues who are also addressing \nthis important issue facing our veterans. Senator Corker and I, who is \nthe Republican lead, have been joined by Senators McCaskill, Bingaman, \nSchumer, Alexander, and Bill Nelson, who have all signed on to lead \nthis charge as original cosponsors. In addition, Senator Wyden has also \nindicated that he will join as a cosponsor. I thank them for being \nchampions for our veterans suffering from these hidden wounds, and I \nwould urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7364-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       MUSIC IN JOPLIN, MISSOURI\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I want to spotlight a \ngenerous act that will help a school and a community recover from a \nterrible natural disaster.\n  Joplin, MO, was devastated this past May by the worst tornado to \nstrike the United States in 60 years. This horrific storm cut a 6-mile \nswath through Joplin, killing 162 people and destroying more than 8,000 \nbuildings, including thousands of homes and many of the city's schools.\n  The people of Joplin have worked heroically to rebuild their \ncommunity. At the end of August, students returned to school. Thanks to \ndonations from people across America and around the world, every \nstudent received a backpack with school supplies and a new laptop \ncomputer.\n  Barry Manilow saw one need that had not been met: Among the countless \nlosses in the tornado were all the musical instruments used by students \nin the band at Joplin High School and other city schools.\n  Last month, Barry arrived in Joplin with three truckloads of \ninstruments, worth about $300,000. He presented the donation personally \non the football field at Joplin High. Barry noted that his own high \nschool music program in Brooklyn, NY, had nurtured his talent and \nopened the way for his amazing musical career.\n  Barry Manilow's gift to Joplin was tremendous but not unique for him. \nThrough his nonprofit Manilow Music Project, Barry has helped public \nschools across the country to survive despite drastic cuts to school \nfunding for the arts. He not only writes the songs; he also writes \nchecks that enable school music programs to keep bringing the gift of \nmusic to our students, schools, and communities.\n  I salute Barry Manilow today and am deeply moved by his act of \nkindness. It brings me great pride to call him not only a Californian, \nbut also a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7364-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7364-S7365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING PAT TAKASUGI\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nIdaho State Representative Pat Takasugi. I join his family and friends \nin mourning the passing of this great Idahoan.\n  Pat's efforts and input on behalf of Idaho agriculture were \nindispensible. He had the experience and association through his role \nas the director of the Idaho State Department of Agriculture and a \nnumber of agricultural organizations and the on-the-ground knowledge of \nan innovative farmer that were instrumental in improving agricultural \npolicy. His advocacy for Idaho agriculture advanced its position in \ndomestic and foreign markets, and he leaves behind a legacy of skilled \nsupport.\n  We are all better for having known Pat Takasugi. His intelligence, \nhumility and dedication were exemplary. He\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\nadded the right amount of humor to every situation and approached \nchallenges with optimism. He really liked people, and he took his time \nto give everyone his full attention. That quality along with his \nsincerity contributed to the vast number of friends and acquaintances \nwho respect and adore him.\n  Pat led a life of service to our State and Nation. After graduating \nfrom the College of Idaho and obtaining post graduate credits from the \nUniversity of Idaho and Boise State University, Pat joined the U.S. \nArmy through which he served 5 years in Active service and another 5 \nyears in Reserve service. During his military service, Pat was promoted \nto the rank of captain and qualified for Airborne wings, the Ranger tab \nand Special Forces green beret. After returning to Wilder, he grew a \nfarm of 32 acres into a more than 1,500-acre-farm and was a partner in \nSnake River Produce. He also served for 10 years as the director of the \nIdaho State Department of Agriculture before he was elected in 2008 to \nrepresent Idaho's District 10 in the State legislature.\n  His list of accomplishments and associations with a number of Idaho \nand national organizations, including his service as past president of \nthe National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, is \nextensive. He advocated for good jobs, a healthy rural economy, \nbusiness development, lower taxes, less regulation, parental \ninvolvement in education, protection of private property and water \nrights and a lean and accountable government. His principles included \nbelief that ``promoting strong families and renewing an individual \nsense of responsibility are key to reversing the erosion of our \nnation's foundation.'' He worked considerately to advance these and \nother objectives on behalf of Idahoans.\n  I extend my condolences and prayers to Pat's family, friends and \nloved ones, including his wife Suzanne his three children and his \nparents Michio and Ayako. Pat was a great friend to many, and he was \nvery proud of his family. He was a talented farmer and public servant. \nPat Takasugi's contribution to our State will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7365-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING CORPORAL VOLLIE PITTS\n\n Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and pay tribute \nto CPL Vollie Pitts of Hutchinson, KS. Corpora1 Pitts proudly served \nour country in World War I and has been revered as a hero by his \nfamily, friends, and those who served alongside him. Today it is my \nprivilege to share the story of this unsung hero and honor him for his \nservice and sacrifice on behalf of our country.\n  Corporal Pitts was born on February 14, 1897, and raised on his \nfamily's farm in Salina, KS. Like so many Kansans of his generation, \nCorporal Pitts put his country's needs before his own, leaving his \nparents and three siblings behind to volunteer as a member of the \nKansas National Guard. At the young age of 19, he was first called into \nduty when his regiment was mobilized to the Mexican border in 1916. \nTheir mission was to protect Americans from Mexican outlaws who were \noperating along the U.S. border. Following the successful completion of \ntheir mission, his regiment joined with another and became the 137th \nKansas Infantry Regiment.\n  Corporal Pitts was again called into duty in 1917 to serve his county \nin World War I. In the spring of 1918, Corporal Pitts and his regiment \nmade their way to the frontlines for one of the most significant \nbattles of the First World War--the Battle of the Argonne Forest. It \nwas during this battle when Corporal Pitts courageously rushed a German \ngun emplacement, single-handedly capturing the gun and part of its \ncrew. His heroic actions that day saved countless lives, including the \nmen of his own unit. Even after he was wounded and gassed, Corporal \nPitts continued to fight until he was forced to seek help at a field \nhospital, where doctors determined his fighting days had come to an \nend.\n  Upon his arrival back in the United States, Corporal Pitts received \nan honorable discharge from the service and returned home to Kansas. On \nSeptember 2, 1920, he began a new chapter in his life and married \nGladys Reichardt. The young couple made their home in Hutchinson, \nKansas and raised two daughters, Koloma and Patricia. Several decades \nlater in 1954, Corporal Pitts passed away in Denver, CO, surrounded by \nhis family.\n  Corporal Pitts exemplified many traits we can all admire: courage, \ndedication, and selflessness. His heroic actions during World War I \nwill forever remain a testimony to his love for this country and his \nfellow Americans. America is proud and honored to call Corporal Pitts \none of our own, and we shall never forget his courage and sacrifice, \nwhich made America a stronger and freer nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7365-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7365-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7365-4", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:46 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \npro tempore (Mr. Harris) has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1487.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nthe retention of members of the reserve components on active duty for a \nperiod of 45 days following an extended deployment in contingency \noperations or homeland defense missions to support their reintegration \ninto civilian life, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, never in our Nation's history has the \nAmerican military relied more on National Guard and Reserve \nservicemembers than it has in the last 10 years.\n  More than 800,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves have \nbeen called to active duty service since 9/11, many of them serving \ntwo, three, and four tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan\n  Our military does an exceptional job of preparing these guardsmen and \nreservists for combat, but we do far too little to prepare them for \ntransition back to civilian life.\n  Our guardsmen need a transition from the trauma of combat to the \nserenity of home in Oregon and throughout our Nation. But instead our \nguardsmen and reservists are sent back to their community with little \nor no time to readjust. In a matter of a few days these guardsmen go \nfrom holding a gun in the chaos of a combat zone to holding their \nchildren in the serenity of their own home. That has to be a difficult \ntransition.\n  Unlike most active-duty troops who receive a soft landing through a \nnumber of carefully monitored reintegration programs and other support \nservices provided on an active-duty base, returning guardsmen lack the \nsupport system of a large base.\n  While active-duty soldiers come home to military bases and the jobs \nand support systems that they provide, returning Guard members are in \nmany instances left to face the increasingly stark reality of \ntransitioning to civilian life on their own.\n  The amount of personal and professional requirements placed on \nguardsmen and reservists pre- and post-deployment are mind boggling. \nWhat they need more than anything is time to wind down and tend to \ntheir lives.\n  Even under the best of circumstances, the road back from war is \ndifficult and extremely stressful. Men and women who have served in \nharm's way experience higher rates of divorce and suicide.\n  Many battle the debilitating effects and stigma associated with Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder. In the current struggling economy, nearly \nhalf of the guard members and reservists have no job to return to. Some \nfind that the jobs and careers they put on hold to serve their country \nsimply no longer exist.\n  To compound an unacceptable unemployment problem, Guard members and \nreservists are immediately taken off the military payroll once they get \nhome.\n  Imagine that reality for a second. You left your home, your family \nand your job to serve your country in harm's way for 10 months, only to \nbe welcomed back with no job and no\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\nsource of income to pay for your home or support your family.\n  If they do have a job waiting for them, to keep a steady income, \nGuardsmen must jump right back into the high stress of relearning their \ncivilian job without a chance to decompress or readjust from the stress \nof combat.\n  That is what my bill would help fix.\n  The National Guard and Reserve Soft Landing Reintegration Act would \nallow returning guardsmen and reservists to take up to 45 days to \ndecompress, reintegrate, and get their lives in order, while still \nbeing paid.\n  I started this program because I think that citizen-soldiers are one \nof the strengths of this nation. They and their families should be \nacknowledged for the level of sacrifices that they are making.\n  Addressing the post deployment-related needs of returning guardsmen \nis not only the moral thing to do; it is also strategically wise for \nour nation.\n  This is part of the promise our nation made to take care of our \ntroops. They did their best of us. We should do our best for them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1839\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to provide \nfor appropriate designation of collective bargaining units; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today, I highlight yet another assault on \nprivate-sector employers by this administration and its appointees. \nRather than empowering businesses to help bring us out of this economic \ndownturn, the White House continues to tilt the scales in favor of its \nallies--the labor unions. Nowhere is this more evident than the recent \nactions of the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB.\n  For the past 77 years, the NLRB has recognized a bargaining unit as \nall the employees of the employer, a facility, a department, or a \ncraft. A bargaining unit had to be a sufficient size to warrant \nseparate group identification for the purposes of collective \nbargaining. This standard was developed through years of careful \nconsideration and congressional guidance.\n  On August 26, 2011, the NLRB decided to recklessly disregard this \nlongstanding precedent. In its ``Specialty Healthcare and \nRehabilitation Center of Mobile'' decision, the NLRB decided that \nunions can now handpick a small group of employees doing the same job \nin the same location for organization purposes. For instance, cashiers \nat a grocery store could form one small union separate from the \nbaggers, produce stockers, or deli butchers. Unions have found it much \neasier to organize three employees rather than 30. Employers, \nespecially retail chains, fear that this could create several dozen \nunions all within the same store location--making it easier for unions \nto gain access to employees and nearly impossible to manage such \nfragmentation of the workforce.\n  Let me be clear: I do not oppose efforts by employees to unionize if \nthey choose to do so. I do, however, oppose the government interfering \nin the principles of a democratic workplace and\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\ntipping the scales in favor of one party over the other.\n  I am proud to stand up today, along with 28 of my Republican \ncolleagues, to introduce the Representation Fairness Restoration Act. \nThis bill will reinstate the traditional standard for determining which \nemployees will constitute appropriate bargaining units. The NLRB's \nactions are yet another clear example of how President Obama's \nappointees at this ``independent'' agency are clearly playing favorites \nat the expense of the American worker and our economy. We need to send \na message to the administration that the NLRB's decisions are only \nadding to the pressure and uncertainty facing businesses today. This \nrunaway agency must be reined in and I stand by private-sector \nemployers by helping restore fairness to the workplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1845. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an energy investment credit for energy storage property connected \nto the grid, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am being joined by my colleagues \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Collins on the introduction of the Storage \nTechnology for Renewable and Green Energy Act of 2011 or the STORAGE \n2011 Act. The purpose of the bill is to promote the deployment of \nenergy storage technologies to make the electric grid operate more \nefficiently and help manage intermittent renewable energy generation \nfrom wind, solar, and other sources that vary with the time of day and \nthe weather.\n  Traditionally, peak demand has been met by building more generation \nand transmission facilities, many of which sit idle much of the time. \nThe Electric Power Research Institute's White Paper on storage \ntechnology observed that 25 percent of the equipment and capacity of \nthe U.S. electric distribution system and 10 percent of the generation \nand transmission system is needed less than 400 hours a year. Peak \ngeneration is also often met with the least efficient, most costly \npower plants. Energy storage systems offer an alternative to simply \nbuilding more generation and transmission to meet peak demand because \nthey allow the current system to meet peak demands by storing less \nexpensive off-peak power, from the most cost-efficient plants, for use \nduring peak demand.\n  The growth of renewable energy from wind and solar and other \nintermittent renewable sources, like wave and tidal energy, raises yet \nanother challenge for the electric grid that storage can help address. \nThese renewable sources deliver power at times of the day or night when \nthey might not be needed or fluctuate with the weather. Energy storage \ntechnology allows these intermittent sources to store power as it is \ngenerated and allow it to be dispatched when it is most needed and in a \npredictable, steady of stream of electricity no longer at the vagaries \nof weather conditions. And equally important, it allows this \nintermittent generation to more closely match demand. Instead of trying \nto find a place to sell power at 3:00 am in the morning when demand is \ndown, wind farms for example would be able to sell their power at 3:00 \npm in the afternoon when demand is up.\n  The STORAGE 2011 Act offers investment tax credits for three \ncategories of energy storage facilities that temporarily store energy \nfor delivery or use at a later time. The bill is technology neutral and \ndoes not pick storage technology ``winners'' and ``losers'' either in \nterms of the storage technology that is used or in terms of the source \nof the energy that is stored. The electricity can come from a wind farm \nor it can come for a coal or nuclear plant. Pumped hydro, compressed \nair, batteries, flywheels, and thermal storage are all eligible \ntechnologies as are smart-grid enabled plug-in electric vehicles.\n  First, the STORAGE 2011 Act provides a 20 percent investment tax \ncredit of up to $40 million per project for storage systems connected \nto the electric grid and distribution system. A total of $1.5 billion \nin these investment credits are available for these grid connected \nsystems. Developers would have to apply to the Treasury Department and \nDOE for the credits, similar to the process used for the green energy \nmanufacturing credits the ``48C'' program. This is a 20 percent credit \nso that means the actual cost of the project that would be eligible for \nthe full credit would be $200 million.\n  The Act also provides a 30 percent investment tax credit of up to $1 \nmillion per project to businesses for on-site storage, such as an ice-\nstorage facility in on office building, where ice is made at night \nusing low-cost, off-peak power and then used to help air-condition the \nbuilding during the day while reducing peak demand. This is a 30 \npercent credit so the cost of the actual projects that would get the \nfull credit amount would be around $3.3 million.\n  The Act also provides for 30 percent tax credit for homeowners for \non-site storage projects to store off-peak electricity from solar \npanels or from the grid for later use during peak hours.\n  As the EPRI white paper noted ``(d)espite the large anticipated need \nfor energy storage solutions within the electric enterprise, very few \ngrid-integrated storage installations are in actual operation in the \nUnited States today.'' The purpose of the STORAGE 2011 Act is help jump \nstart the deployment of these storage solutions so that renewable \nenergy technologies can increase their economic value to the electric \ngrid while reducing their power integration costs as well as to improve \nthe overall efficiency of the electrical system.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a closer look at what storage \ntechnologies can do to help reduce the cost of electricity and improve \nthe performance of the electric grid and renewable energy technologies. \nIf they do, I am confident my colleagues will join Senators Bingaman \nand Collins in supporting this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1845\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote transparency, accountability, and reform \nwithin the United Nations system, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n   Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation I \nintroduced today to encourage comprehensive and long-lasting reforms at \nthe United Nations. I want to thank my colleague Senator James Inhofe \nfrom Oklahoma for joining me on this effort. I also commend the Chair \nof the House Foreign Affairs' Committee--and fellow Floridian \nCongresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for leading on this effort in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The United Nations was created in 1945 with the specific mandate of \nmaintaining the hard-fought peace that followed the end of World War \nII. Just as it was then, today our nation's security and prosperity is \ninfluenced by conflicts and events taking place in various near and \nfar-flung places. The United States cannot and should not attempt to \naddress these conflicts on its own. More than six decades later, we \nstill need a U.N. with resolve, a U.N. that acts with effectiveness and \npurpose. Sadly, the U.N.'s persistent ethics and accountability \nproblems are limiting its role. Until the organization addresses these \nimportant issues, the stature of the organization will continue to \nsuffer in the eyes of the world.\n  Examples of this troubling situation abound, from the ongoing efforts \nto circumvent direct negotiations to end the Israeli-Arab conflict, to \nthe discredited Human Rights Council led by the world's most notorious \ntyrants and human rights violators, to the proliferation of mandates \nthat have clouded the organization's mission and effectiveness.\n  My hope with this legislation is to provide an incentive for the \nUnited Nations and the President, to modernize that international body \nalong a spirit of transparency, respect for basic human freedoms, and \neffective nonproliferation. This legislation would also attempt to \naddress the anti-Semitic attitudes that have become so prevalent in \ncertain corners of the U.N. and seriously diminish the credibility of \nthe entire U.N. system.\n  At the core of these reforms is an effort to instill a sense of \ntransparency and competition at the U.N. by its adoption of a budgetary \nmodel that relies mostly on voluntary contributions. This legislation \nwould also strengthen the international standing of human rights by \nreforming the U.N. Human Rights Council in a way that it would deny \nmembership to nations under U.N. sanctions, designated by our \nDepartment of State as States Sponsors of Terrorism, or failing to take \nmeasures to combat and end the despicable practice of human \ntrafficking. Other provisions seek meaningful reforms at the U.N. \nRelief and Work Agency that provides assistance to Palestinian refugees \nof the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.\n  This legislation is needed because the structure and bureaucratic \nculture of the organization often makes it impossible or, at best, \ndownright difficult to achieve meaningful reforms. It follows on the \nsteps of previously successful Congressional initiatives on this \nmatter. Every previously successful American effort for reform at the \nU.N. has been accompanied with the threat of withholding our valuable \ncontributions. I wish this wasn't the case, but this is the record, so \nit is part of our legislation.\n  In closing, the United Nations has served as the primary multilateral \nforum to address peace and security issues throughout the world, and I \nlook forward to working with my Senate colleagues in achieving \nmeaningful transparency and accountability reforms at that \ninternational body.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Tester, Mr. Brown of \n        Ohio, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Franken, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Johnson of South Dakota, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1850. A bill to expand and improve opportunities for beginning \nfarmers and ranchers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, among the most hopeful occurrences in \nrural America is when someone is able to get started in farming or \nranching and go on to build a successful operation. Typically, the \nbeginning farmer or rancher is continuing an established family farm or \nranch, although increasingly he or she is taking on the challenge of \nstarting and growing an entirely new operation.\n  Because farming and ranching families are so vital to rural \ncommunities and our Nation as a whole, there has been a great deal of \nconcern for decades as America's agricultural producers have grown \nolder and retired, as farm numbers fell, and as men and women who had a \ngreat desire to become the next generation of farmers and ranchers were \nunable to find the opportunities and resources to do so.\n  Across America, we are fortunate to have many families and \nindividuals who possess the ability, motivation, and dedication to \nstart or continue a farm or ranch and build a rewarding life in \nagriculture. Our Nation needs more beginning farmers and ranchers \nacross all types of operations--including commercial-scale crop and \nanimal agriculture systems, organic agriculture, growing for local food \nsystems and farmers markets, and even farming in urban and suburban \nareas. We need more beginning farmers and ranchers to secure critical \nsupplies of food, fuel, and fiber for the future. We need them as \nstewards to care for and conserve our soil, water, and other natural \nresources. We need more new farming and ranching families as \ncontributing members of healthy and vibrant local communities.\n  Aspiring and beginning farmers and ranchers confront tremendous \nchallenges, yet there are some hopeful signs. According to the Census \nof Agriculture, the number of farms in the United States increased four \npercent between 2002 and 2007. The new farms tended to be smaller, have \nlower sales, and rely more on off-farm income sources. New farmers are \nalso more diverse, with significant increases between 2002 and 2007 in \nthe number of farm operators who are women, Hispanic, American Indian, \nAfrican-American, and Asian-American.\n  We know from experience that carefully designed programs can very \neffectively help beginning farmers and ranchers apply their talents and \nefforts, assemble the necessary resources, capitalize upon \nopportunities, and succeed. I am proud that in the two farm bills, in \n2002 and 2008, that we enacted while I was chairman of the Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry Committee, we adopted a number of initiatives \nto strengthen and improve programs at the Department of Agriculture \nthat assist beginning farmers and ranchers.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, joined by a number of my \ncolleagues, is crafted to extend, improve, and strengthen beginning \nfarmer and rancher programs and initiatives that we adopted in the most \nrecent two farm bills and in earlier farm bills and other legislation. \nThe Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2011 will build \nupon the successful record of the earlier legislation and its \nimplementation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in cooperation \nwith a variety of public and private institutions and organizations.\n  Let me emphasize that the beginning farmer and rancher initiatives in \nthe legislation we are introducing today, and the programs now being \ncarried out by USDA, are not designed or intended to guarantee the \nsuccess of any beginning farmer or rancher or to give anyone something \nfor nothing. All they do is to offer a helping hand, a better \nopportunity, to women and men who make the effort and apply themselves, \nwho are willing to learn and to do the necessary work to achieve their \ngoals and succeed in farming and ranching.\n  A key feature of the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of \n2011 is to extend and strengthen the beginning farmer and rancher \ndevelopment program, which we enacted in 2008. In this program, USDA \nprovides competitively-awarded grants to qualified organizations that \ndeliver training and education for beginning farmers and ranchers. This \nnew legislation makes it a new priority for USDA to issue grants to \nsupport agricultural rehabilitation and vocational training for \nmilitary veterans and to deliver training and education to help \nveterans who are beginning farmers and ranchers. The\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nbill also would extend and increase mandatory funding for this \ndevelopment program to $25 million in each of fiscal years 2013 through \n2017.\n  This legislation also strengthens in several ways the assistance USDA \nprovides to enable beginning farmers and ranchers to assemble the \nfinancial resources they need to start and build a successful \noperation. It creates a microloan program in which young beginning \nfarmers and ranchers who qualify could borrow up to $35,000 for \noperating expenses at reduced interest rates and with simplified \npaperwork. Also included in this bill is mandatory funding at $5 \nmillion a year to carry out the individual development accounts pilot \nprogram that was enacted in the 2008 farm bill. Grants under this pilot \nprogram would support at least 15 State individual development account \ninitiatives to help beginning farmers and ranchers build savings that \ncan then be invested in their agricultural operations. Several other \nprovisions of the bill update and improve the existing USDA programs to \nhelp beginning farmers and ranchers obtain loans for operating \nexpenses, land purchases, and applying conservation practices.\n  To encourage and assist beginning farmers and ranchers in maintaining \nand adopting sound conservation practices in their operations, the bill \nextends and strengthens several initiatives enacted in previous farm \nbills. For example, the legislation expands the options and financial \nincentives for maintaining conservation on land that comes out of the \nConservation Reserve Program, CRP, contracts and is leased or sold to \nbeginning farmers or ranchers. Other provisions increase the share of \nfunds and enrollment dedicated to beginning farmers and ranchers in the \nConservation Stewardship Program, CSP, and Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, EQIP, strengthen help to beginning farmers and \nranchers through the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, promote \ntheir use of whole-farm conservation planning, and boost help to them \nthrough conservation loans and cost-share payments.\n  Other features of the bill are designed to strengthen revenue \ninsurance available to beginning farmers and ranchers through USDA's \nRisk Management Agency, including increased funding to help beginning \nand socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers better understand and \nutilize insurance programs and risk management systems. In order to \nhelp beginning farmers and ranchers build markets and increase income \nthrough adding value to their commodities, the bill enhances \nopportunities for beginning farmers and ranchers to receive USDA value-\nadded producer grants and provides new, increased mandatory funding for \nsuch grants. To strengthen USDA's attention to helping beginning \nfarmers and ranchers, the legislation creates coordinators in key USDA \nagency offices in each State. It also creates a special USDA veterans \nagricultural liaison position to focus upon helping veterans understand \nand benefit from USDA programs, especially those for beginning farmers \nand ranchers.\n  In conclusion, I am proud of the initiatives we have previously \nenacted to help beginning farmers and ranchers create and pursue \nopportunities and realize their goals and dreams. By building on the \nsuccess of the existing programs, this legislation will lend more help \nto beginning farmers and ranchers and in doing so strengthen American \nagriculture, our rural communities, and our nation as a whole. I am \ngrateful to the cosponsors of this bill and urge all of my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1850\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the restoration of the Klamath Basin and \nthe settlement of the hydroelectric licensing of the Klamath \nHydroelectric Project in accordance with the Klamath Basin Restoration \nAgreement and the Klamath hydroelectric Settlement\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\nAgreement in the public interest and the interest of the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address the long history \nof water disputes in the Klamath Basin and commend the work of the \ncommunity in coming together to begin a new, collaborative era of water \nmanagement in the region.\n  When I was first elected to the U.S. Senate, one of my first trips \nacross Oregon included a visit to the Klamath Basin to gather \ninformation about the history of the water wars in the region and meet \nwith the stakeholders who were working on a solution.\n  On my way down to the Basin I was extremely skeptical that \ntraditional rivals could reach agreement on a written management plan. \nOnly a few years earlier, the region was embroiled in protests and \ncivil disobedience over sizeable fish kills and limited supplies of \nwater for irrigation. The generational battles over water had deepened \ndivides, often making it hard for parties to be in a room together, let \nalone work together.\n  When I arrived in Klamath Falls, therefore, I was deeply surprised to \nfind farmers, ranchers, fishermen, Tribal leaders and conservationists \nworking together on a comprehensive and collaborative plan that would \nend the ongoing water wars of the region, improve the local economy and \ncreate a stronger environment for the future. They told me they were \ntired of the unproductive battles of the past and of the massive \namounts they were spending on lawyers rather than solutions. They \nthought they had some chance of finding a better path forward. This was \nimpressive. I thought then that if they managed to get the Klamath \nRestoration Agreements completed and signed by all the parties, I would \ncertainly assist them with the necessary federal legislation.\n  That legislation is now the Klamath Basin Economic Restoration Act of \n2011, which I am introducing today. This bill implements both the \nKlamath Basin Restoration Agreement and Klamath Hydroelectric \nSettlement Agreement and moves the region forward. These agreements \nwould provide a more stable supply of irrigation water to farmers and \nranchers and would improve in-river water flows for endangered fish and \nthe fishermen who depend on them. The agreements would enhance the \nnational wildlife refuges that are one of the most important migratory \nbird habitats in the country. In addition, the agreement would, by \nremoving four dams, turn the Klamath into a free-flowing river once \nagain, opening miles of habitat to spawning salmon. The agreement also \nrestores a sector of the Klamath Tribe forest and resolves a \nchallenging fish passage issue for Pacific Power.\n  This agreement would create a lot of jobs. A recent analysis \nestimates that the agreement would create 4,000 jobs in construction \nand agriculture. It also estimates that with the restoration of \ncritical salmon and steelhead habitat the commercial harvest of Chinook \nsalmon would increase by 80 percent.\n  The KBRA and KHSA agreements are the result of several years of \nintense negotiation and compromise. They are inherently complicated. No \nparty obtained all they desired and not everyone is satisfied that \nthese agreements contain the best possible outcomes.\n  But what is absolutely clear is that it is an extraordinary \naccomplishment for the Klamath stakeholders to set aside their historic \ndifferences and work out this plan. They say in the West that, \n``Whiskey, that's for drinking. Water, that's for fighting.'' But \ncontinuous fighting sometimes reaches the point where little is \naccomplished.

It\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\nis clear that my colleagues share my dedication to strengthening and \nenhancing our Nation's ability to be prepared for and respond to all \nhazards that may confront us.\n  As we introduce legislation to strengthen and improve our Nation's \nmedical and public health preparedness and response programs, it is \nappropriate to reflect on the progress we have made to date, the \nseriousness of the threats facing our Nation, and the work that remains \nto be done if we are going to be prepared to respond to the full range \nof threats, whether naturally occurring, like an influenza pandemic, or \na deliberate bioterrorism attack.\n  During the 109th Congress, I chaired the Subcommittee on Bioterrorism \nand Public Health Preparedness. Building on the lessons learned from \nHurricane Katrina and September 11, Congress took a hard look at how we \ncould better prepare and respond to public health and medical \nemergencies. The Subcommittee held multiple public hearings, \nroundtables, and meetings, and Congress received significant input from \npublic health officials, medical experts, emergency managers, \nbiotechnology companies, and stakeholders from across our nation. These \nactions culminated with the passage of the Pandemic and All-Hazards \nPreparedness Act of 2006.\n  Through the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, Congress \nempowered the Department of Health and Human Services with the tools it \nneeds to protect the American people more effectively and efficiently \nin response to a public health emergency. This law established the \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or \nASPR, to unify the Department's preparedness and response programs and \nmission and answer the critical question of ``who is in charge?'' when \nit comes to medical and public health preparedness and response. Since \nits inception, ASPR has carried out significant preparedness and \nresponse planning and coordinated response efforts with federal, State, \nand local public health partners.\n  The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 also \nestablished the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, \nor BARDA, to speed up the development of countermeasures--such as \nvaccines or treatments--to protect Americans against a potential \nchemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear terrorist attack, or \nother public health emergency, such as a pandemic influenza. PAHPA also \ngave BARDA the ability to make mile-stone based payments through the \nBioShield Special Reserve Fund--a $5.6 billion medical countermeasure \nprocurement fund established by Congress in 2004 to provide assurances \nof the federal government's commitment to purchasing medical \ncountermeasures if companies embarked on years long development of \nthese life-saving products. Even without full funding, BARDA has been \nable to identify promising countermeasures and support the critical \nadvanced research and development necessary for making these products \navailable to the American people. Thanks to BARDA and the investment we \nhave made over the last few years, our nation was much better \npositioned to quickly respond to the H1N1 pandemic influenza two years \nago.\n\n  I am very proud to have authored this important bipartisan law five \nyears ago and I am proud to have again joined with Senators Harkin, \nEnzi, and Casey in a bipartisan manner to tackle the serious challenges \nthat remain in ensuring our nation is prepared to respond to all-\nhazards. In recent weeks, Congress has been reminded of the urgency of \nour work in this area. Last month, the WMD Center published a \ncomprehensive Bio-response Report Card evaluating our nation's \npreparedness against potential bioterror attacks. This report noted \nthat while we have made progress, the U.S. Government received ``Ds'' \nand ``Fs'' in certain areas associated with responding to large-scale \nbiological attacks that terrorists like Al- Qaida or others may seek to \nperpetuate against us. This report and recent analysis by the \nGovernment Accountability Office calling for improvements to our \nnation's medical countermeasure programs are a serious wake-up call \nthat cannot go unaddressed. The American people expect the President \nand Congress to do all we can to prevent an attack, and in the event of \nan attack, be prepared to respond in order to save lives. When it comes \nto protecting the American people, failing grades are unacceptable.\n  Our work on this important legislation has been guided by sound \nprinciples. First and foremost any improvements to existing programs \nand authorities must be targeted and strategic and based on the lessons \nwe have learned over the past five years, including the H1H1 pandemic \nand disasters at home and abroad. We must ensure the continuity of \ncritical medical and public health preparedness authorities and \nprograms, including the BioShield Special Reserve Fund. Given the \nsignificant fiscal challenges facing our nation, we must also ensure \nthat we are maximizing the taxpayer resources supporting this critical \npreparedness mission, as well as ensuring appropriate transparency and \naccountability for these resources and programs. Finally, we must \nensure a robust medical countermeasure enterprise, from the research \nbench to the points where patients receive care, including by ensuring \nthat the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's regulatory tools and \npathways reflect modern-day threats.\n  The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act Reauthorization of 2011 \nwould strengthen and enhance our nation's medical and public health \npreparedness and response programs and go a long way in addressing many \nof the short-comings and concerns raised by GAO and the WMD Center, as \nwell as other stakeholders. Our legislation provides the ASPR with \nenhanced policy oversight and coordination of medical and public health \npreparedness and response programs to further unify our response in the \nevent of a public health emergency. Our legislation also ensures an \nappropriate emphasis on chemical, radiological, biological, and nuclear \nthreats as part of an all-hazards approach to our National Health \nSecurity Strategy. Our legislation ensures that an emphasis on \nstrategic initiatives to advance medical countermeasures and community \nresiliency are incorporated into the National Preparedness Goals, as \nwell as the importance of considering the unique needs and \nconsiderations for individuals at-risk in the event of a public health \nemergency.\n  Our legislation would reauthorize the National Disaster Medical \nSystem, the volunteer Medical Reserve Corps, the Emergency System for \nAdvance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals, the Public \nHealth Emergency Preparedness and Hospital Preparedness Cooperative \nAgreement Programs, and the Strategic National Stockpile. Targeted \nflexibility under our bill will help our State and local partners \noptimize community resiliency at the local level. By reauthorizing the \nBioShield Special Reserve Fund, our bill sends the clear signal that \nthe U.S. Government remains committed to purchasing medical \ncountermeasures.\n  The critical role that FDA plays in our medical countermeasure \nenterprise has become clear over the past five years and our \nlegislation strengthens this enterprise by making targeted improvements \nto FDA's role in this important endeavor. For example, our bill allows \nthe Secretary to make medical countermeasures under review by the FDA \navailable in limited circumstances based on either a declared emergency \nor an identified threat, and requires the material threat posed by the \nagent of agents for which a product under review is intended is \nconsidered when reviewing medical countermeasures for approval, \nclearance, or licensure. We will stretch taxpayer dollars even further \nby allowing FDA to extend the shelf life of products stockpiled in the \nStrategic National Stockpile. Our legislation also charges FDA with \npromoting medical countermeasure expertise and developing regulatory \nscience tools to advance the review, approval, clearance, and licensure \nof these products. By enhancing the scientific exchange between FDA and \nmedical countermeasure stakeholders, FDA will not only be identifying \nproblems, but an active partner in solving them to ensure our nation \nhas the medical countermeasures necessary to protect the American \npeople. Medical and public health preparedness and response programs, \nincluding the availability of medical countermeasures, are a matter of \nnational security and our bill will ensure the appropriate, senior-\nlevel national security focus on these issues.\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\n  In addition to reauthorizing PAHPA, I am pleased to also introduce \nthe Medical Surge Capacity Act, critical legislation that I hope we can \ninclude in the final version of PAHPA reauthorization. I thank Senators \nHarkin, Enzi, and Casey for working with me on this important \nbipartisan legislation that makes strategic improvements to current law \nto enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to target and \nissue waivers under Section 1135 of the Social Security Act in as \ntimely a manner as possible based on the circumstances of an emergency. \nThis legislation authorizes HHS to implement waivers as soon as either \na public health or national emergency is declared, and enables the \nSecretary to institute 1135 waivers in ``host areas'' outside of a \ndeclared disaster area, but into which patients are being evacuated to \nreceive care.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress \nand the administration to do the important work of reauthorizing PAHPA \nand BioShield in order to ensure our nation is as prepared as possible \nin the event of the unthinkable, whether natural, or man-made.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today it gives me great pleasure to \nintroduce the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act Reauthorization \nof 2011--also known as the PAHPA Reauthorization of 2011--with a \nbipartisan group of Senators that includes Senators Burr, Casey, Enzi, \nMikulski, Alexander, Hagan, Collins, Lieberman, and Roberts. This \nreauthorization builds on a record of bipartisan cooperation to \nstrengthen our ability to respond to and prepare for medical and public \nhealth emergencies over the past decade.\n  Based on lessons learned since the original PAHPA legislation was \nsigned into law in 2006, this reauthorization continues to support the \nprogress made by the Federal Government and its State and local \npartners to protect its citizens during public health and medical \nemergencies. It also proposes a number of targeted changes that will \nimprove our ability to address a variety of threats to the public \nhealth of our Nation.\n  Such threats are diverse in origin and include exposure to chemical, \nbiological, radiological, or nuclear agents. Sometimes these threats \noccur naturally--the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, for example--or they \ncan be the result of malicious intent--such as the deliberate release \nof anthrax in 2001. A recent and very challenging example is the \nradiation leak that occurred at the nuclear plant damaged by Japan's \nmassive earthquake.\n  It is not just known threats that place the health and well-being of \nAmericans at risk; there are just as many emerging or unknown threats \nagainst which protection is critical. Because the impact of these \nthreats could be catastrophic, it is imperative that we continue to \nstrengthen our Nation's ability to adequately prepare for a public \nhealth emergency.\n  Building our Nation's response capacity requires close collaboration \namong Federal, State and local governments; hospitals and health care \nproviders; businesses; schools; indeed, all Americans. I have long \ntaken the Federal Government's role in being prepared for a public \nhealth emergency public health preparedness as it is calledvery \nseriously.\n  We have made tremendous progress in preparedness during the last \ndecade, but this reauthorization provides additional flexibility to \nState and local governments to more efficiently use Federal resources \nin preparing for public health emergencies. For example, this bill \nreauthorizes the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Grant \nProgram, which provides critical resources to State and local public \nhealth agencies, and streamlines requirements making it easier for them \nto meet program requirements and target resources.\n  Our ability to be prepared for a public health emergency also depends \non the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures. \nThese are the vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics needed to prevent or \nrespond to a bioterrorism event or other public health emergency. In an \neffort to ensure that we have the appropriate medical countermeasures, \nwe need to continue to support innovative research into promising new \nproducts and ensure that products are readily available during a time \nof emergency. We also need to address the scientific challenges of \nidentifying safe and effective medical countermeasures when human \ntrials are not available or ethical.\n  This bill addresses a number of these concerns and provides greater \ncertainty for biotech companies that operate in this space and \ncontinues to build on partnerships between the private sector and the \nFederal Government to ensure that we have the appropriate medical \ncountermeasures to prepare for or respond to a public health emergency.\n  Underlying all of our preparedness activities is the issue of how we \nensure that our most vulnerable citizens will be protected should \ndisaster strike. We know that many populations--including individuals \nwith disabilities, seniors, and children--may have unique needs that we \nhave the responsibility to address during a public health emergency. In \nthe past, when faced with catastrophic events, we have too often seen \nsuch needs go unmet. Now we must use lessons learned to ensure more \nefficient, effective, and equitable responses in the future.\n  Something that I am especially proud of is that the PAHPA \nReauthorization of 2011 requires that these individuals are an \nintegrated part of our preparedness efforts. This means that we \ncontinue to address the unique needs of at-risk populations--such \nproviding information in a way that it is understandable to all \nAmericans, including those with cognitive limitations--and plan for \nthese unique needs when it comes to drafting preparedness plans and \nconducting preparedness drills and exercises. This bill truly focuses \non addressing the need of our most vulnerable citizens by considering \nthem as critical part of our overall preparedness planning--not as an \nafterthought.\n  This bill represents a true bipartisan effort and had the support of \na number of important stakeholders. For example, we have already \nreceived the endorsements of the Alliance for Biosecurity, American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, and the American Dental Association. In the \ncoming days and weeks, we expect many more endorsements. Because the \nbill is so critical to our ability to prepare for and respond to public \nhealth and medical emergencies, I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1859. A bill to provide that section 3330a, 3330b, and 3330c of \ntitle 5, United States Code, relating to administrative and judicial \nredress and remedies for preference eligibles, shall apply with respect \nto the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security \nAdministration; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill provide certain of our Nation's veterans with the ability to \nenforce their statutorily protected veterans' preference rights in the \nFederal Government.\n  The Veterans' Preference Act, which became law in 1944, was intended \nto provide a preference in hiring in the Executive Branch to returning \nservicemembers who acquired valuable skills during their service in the \nSecond World War. Before signing this legislation into law, President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt referred to the great responsibility our Nation \nowes its veterans:\n\n       I believe that the Federal Government, functioning in its \n     capacity as an employer, should take the lead in assuring \n     those who are in the armed forces, that when they return, \n     special consideration will be given to them in their efforts \n     to obtain employment. It is absolutely impossible to take \n     millions of our young men out of their normal pursuits for \n     the purpose of fighting to preserve the Nation, and then \n     expect them to resume their normal activities without having \n     any special consideration shown them.\n\n  By 1998, it had become clear that providing veterans with a \npreference in hiring was an effective way to attract and retain \nqualified veterans in government service. However, it was apparent that \nveterans needed a mechanism to enforce their veterans' preference \nrights where an agency was not applying the law as Congress intended. \nRecognizing this need, Congress enacted the Veterans Employment \nOpportunities Act, which created a mechanism\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\nfor preference eligible veterans to appeal violations of their \nveterans' preference rights to the Department of Labor, the Merit \nSystems Protection Board, and Federal court. The Veterans Employment \nOpportunities Act also extended veterans' preference rights to \nreductions in force in the Federal Government.\n  It has come to my attention that, unfortunately, not all of our \nveterans have the ability to enforce their rights under the Veterans \nEmployment Opportunities Act. Last year, in a case called Morse v. \nMerit Systems Protection Board, the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit ruled that preference eligible applicants and \nemployees at the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation \nSecurity Administration are not covered by the Veterans Employment \nOpportunities Act, and thus do not have the same appeal rights as most \nother applicants and employees in the Federal Government. The court's \nruling is puzzling because applicants and employees at both of these \nFederal agencies have veterans' preference rights under current Federal \nlaw, but it may reflect a drafting error in the Veterans Employment \nOpportunities Act. At a time when thousands of our servicemembers are \nreturning home and seeking employment in the Federal Government, we \nmust correct this unacceptable result.\n  Recently, our country observed the 10th anniversary of the tragic \nattacks of September 11, 2001. Since that horrific day, more than 5 \nmillion Americans have served in our military, with more than 2 million \nAmericans serving in warzones. As these servicemembers return home, we \nmust be mindful of our sacred commitment to assist those who serve our \ncountry and later seek employment in the Federal Government. \nSpecifically, we must ensure that all of our federal agencies are \nhonoring the sacrifice made by servicemembers and their families by \ncomplying with veterans' preference laws.\n  Accordingly, I am introducing legislation to correct the problem \nrecently brought to light by the Morse decision by providing \npreference-eligible applicants and employees at the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the Transportation Security Administration with \nrights under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation, and \nmore fully honoring the commitment of our Nation's veterans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. Pesident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1859\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 321, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 321) commemorating the 50th \n     anniversary of the Federal Executive Boards.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise in support of a resolution \ncommemorating the 50th anniversary of the Federal Executive Boards.\n  Federal Executive Boards were established on November 10, 1961, by \nPresident John F. Kennedy through a presidential directive to \nstrengthen the coordination of government activities outside of \nWashington, DC. Today, there are 28 Federal Executive Boards across the \ncountry, where more than 80 percent of all Federal employees work.\n  Federal Executive Boards have improved the efficiency of Federal \ngovernment activities and leveraged resources. According to the Federal \nExecutive Board Annual Report, in Fiscal Year 2010, Federal Executive \nBoards saved the Federal government an estimated total of nearly $33 \nmillion. Federal Executive Boards coordinated Alternative Dispute \nResolution services by providing mediators to agencies at low or no \ncost, which saved the Federal government more than $25.2 million. \nFurthermore, Federal Executive Boards provided training to more than \n28,000 employees and saved the Federal government $7.7 million in \ntraining costs by providing instructors and conference space to deliver \ngroup training sessions, which reduced travel and lodging expenditures.\n  As we commemorate this anniversary, it is fitting to recognize the \ncontributions of Federal Executive Boards on our communities \nnationwide. Federal Executive Boards supported and raised more than $78 \nmillion in Fiscal Year 2010 for the Combined Federal Campaign, the \nlargest workplace charity campaign, supporting 20,000 non-profit, \ncharitable organizations that provide health and human service benefits \nin the United States and around the world. Last year, Federal Executive \nBoards supported the government-wide initiative Feds Feed Families food \ndrive and collected over 65,000 pounds of food. Additionally, Federal \nExecutive Boards volunteer in their communities to mentor students and \ncontribute to holiday toy, blood, and clothing drives.\n  Federal Executive Boards have also played an important role in \nemergency support. During the collapse of the I-35W Bridge in \nMinneapolis in August 2007 and the massive flooding in the southeastern \narea of the state just two weeks later, the Minnesota Federal Executive \nBoard passed critical information from local and state sources to more \nthan 100 Federal agencies to provide status updates of recovery \noperations and potential workforce impacts. Following the 1995 bombing \nof the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma \nFederal Executive Board brought together officials to discuss how \nFederal Executive Boards can best support first responders during an \nemergency.\n  During Hurricane Katrina, the Executive Director of the New Orleans \nFederal Executive Board coordinated with the Office of Personnel \nManagement and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to obtain and \ndisseminate guidance, as well as communicate issues of concern from \nFederal agencies in the area. In addition, Federal Executive Boards \ninitiated several activities to prepare Federal employees for a \npandemic. For instance, a number of Federal Executive Boards held \npandemic influenza tabletop exercises, which included nonprofit \norganizations, the private sector, and other levels of government.\n  Federal Executive Boards are vital to confronting today's challenges \nand helping agencies meet their workforce needs and missions. They are \nuniquely positioned to bring together the Federal family. Again, I want \nto say mahalo, thank you, to the Federal Executive Boards for their \nvaluable work and congratulate them on their success on this 50th \nanniversary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask further that the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 321) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 321\n\n       Whereas the Federal Executive Boards were established \n     through a presidential directive signed by President John F. \n     Kennedy in 1961;\n       Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards increase \n     effectiveness and economy of Federal agencies through \n     coordination of local approaches to national programs and \n     shared management needs;\n       Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards serve over 780,000 \n     Federal civilian employees in 28 locations across the Nation;\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards provide a forum for \n     the exchange of information between Washington, D.C. and \n     agencies in the field about programs, management methods, and \n     administrative issues;\n       Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards improve the \n     continuity of Government operations by facilitating planning \n     and coordination among local Federal agencies;\n       Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards increase the \n     efficiency of Federal spending through cost-avoidance on \n     coordinated training and alternative dispute resolution \n     programs;\n       Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards serve as the Federal \n     point of contact for intergovernmental collaboration and \n     community outreach in their locales;\n       Whereas commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Federal \n     Executive Boards will recognize members and staff of Federal \n     Executive Boards for their unyielding dedication and \n     commitment to public service, as well as the Federal agencies \n     whose support over the years has helped Federal Executive \n     Boards provide Federal employees with low-cost training, \n     emergency preparedness plans, and performance recognition \n     through interagency awards events: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Federal \n     Executive Boards;\n       (2) commends the Federal Executive Boards for their \n     unyielding dedication to the Federal community;\n       (3) encourages Federal leaders to continue support of, and \n     participation in, activities of the Federal Executive Boards; \n     and\n       (4) urges the people of the United States to observe the \n     50th anniversary of Federal Executive Boards with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/10/senate-section/article/S7392-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2011\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.
