Madam President, on the news on the way to work this \nmorning, I heard one Republican Senator who is part of the Republican \nleadership say he thought all Republicans would vote for H.R. 1, this \njob-killing--that isn't what he said, it is what I say--this job-\nkilling, shortsighted bill. He said they would do it because of the \nnumbers involved in it--the numbers involved in it. I tell everyone, my \nfriends on the Republican side, the American people are not as \nconcerned about the numbers as what is in this bill, with those mean-\nspirited riders.\n  We are concerned about the numbers. The American people are concerned \nabout the numbers. The President of the United States and Democratic \nSenators have agreed to address the numbers, and we will do that. We \nhave done it in our alternative here today.\n  But this is not a bill about numbers. H.R. 1 is a mean-spirited bill \nthat will cut the heart out of the recovery we have in America today. \nIt goes after little children, poor little boys and girls who want to \nlearn--they don't know what they want, but we want them to learn to \nread, to be able to learn. Head Start is a program that has been \nsuccessful. We have a lot of poor people in Nevada. I wish we didn't, \nbut we do. Head Start has been great for our communities. The National \nInstitutes of Health, they are whacking that--the National Science \nFoundation. Our clean energy jobs, they are going after them. National \nlaboratories. Where is the spirit of Pete Domenici--Pete Domenici, a \nlong-time Republican Senator. He and I worked as chair and ranking \nmember of that Energy and Water Subcommittee on Appropriations, trying \nto fund those very important labs. The labs do lots of good. Among \nothers, they make our country's nuclear weapons safe and reliable. What \nhas been done with this meat axe approach that they say is only numbers \nis not good for our country. I have heard my friend, the assistant \nmajority leader, talk about what is happening to one of the smaller \nlaboratories, Argonne, in Illinois. We have big ones at Livermore, at \nSandia, Los Alamos, and other labs around the country that are some of \nthe places where there is pure science--some of the few places in \nAmerica today where we have pure science. What H.R. 1 has done, what \nthey are trying to do to\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\neducation in our country--not only Head Start--but how it affects \neducation generally is unacceptable.\n  What this bill would do if it were to pass--it is not numbers; it is \nnot numbers only. What does it do to our port security? The Presiding \nOfficer is from the State of New York. Every day there are evil people \ntrying to do damage to the people and the State of New York in the \nports. Our airport security. We still have to look out for these bad \npeople, the shoe bombers and other people who come up with all of these \nvery bad ways to try to harm America.\n  So for someone over here on the other side to say they are looking at \nH.R. 1 and they will probably all vote for it because of the numbers--\nhow insulting to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1416-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to follow up on what was said by \nthe majority leader. This exercise we are engaged in here, this \nconversation about how to finish this fiscal year which ends on October \n1, is one that I think has gotten out of hand, and I will tell you why.\n  I know the debt is a serious problem facing America. I know the \ndeficit is something that threatens our economy and our way of living. \nI also know there are sensible, thoughtful ways to deal with it. One of \nthem was addressed by the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission which I \nserved on and voted for in terms of their final report. I disagreed \nwith some things, but that is the nature of a compromise and the nature \nof moving our Nation forward. What we tried to do in that commission \nwas to take a look at this challenge and not solve it in a month or 6 \nmonths, but say, How can we solve this, do it in a sensible, \nresponsible way, and still grow the economy?\n  Right now, a few feet away from where we are meeting, are some of the \nbest minds in America. They are sitting in a room, meeting with \nSenators. They represent the high-tech industries of America. I just \nheard Mr. John Chambers, who is the CEO of Cisco, talk about the \nchallenge we face and compare our status in the world to China today, \nthe No. 2 economy in the world. He compared our situation today to what \nit was a few years ago.\n  We are in a position now where we have only one out of four startup \ncompanies that we had a few years ago, and it is an indication to me \nthat if America is going to continue to lead in this world, we need to \ninvest in that which makes us strong. I am not saying the deficit is \nnot a problem. It is. But we will still have a Federal budget as we \naddress the deficit and we should invest, through that Federal budget, \nin what is important, things that build our future.\n  This morning Senator Reid of Nevada talked about the vulnerable in \nAmerica. Well, I couldn't agree more. We don't hear the words ``safety \nnet'' around here anymore, and it is unfortunate, because we know that \neven in this prosperous society there are many unfortunate people. \nThere are children who, through no fault of their own, were born into \ndysfunctional and poor families, kids whom we try to rescue from their \nplight and engage them in Head Start, to bring them into a learning \natmosphere, a classroom. I have been there, all over my State of \nIllinois. I was there two weeks ago in Chicago. I went into one of the \npoorest sections of that great city and saw a room full of 40 of some \nof the cutest kids in the world from struggling families who were lucky \nenough to be in the Head Start Program. It means that for the better \npart of the day, they are in a safe, positive, learning environment. Is \nthat a good thing? Of course it is. Whether it is my son or daughter or \nyour son or daughter, it comes down to the basics. If we don't give our \nchildren the right lift-off in their lives, many of them struggle and, \nunfortunately, many fail.\n  So when the House Republicans say the way to deal with our deficit is \nto cut hundreds of thousands of these poor children out of the Head \nStart Program and to dismiss tens of thousands of teachers and staff, \nwe have to step back and say, Are you sure? Has it reached that point? \nAre we at a point now where we have to deny these children access to \nthe kind of learning experience that makes their school experience \nlater on more successful? I don't think so.\n  An honest look at our deficit would not just go after education and \nresearch and investment in our infrastructure. It would look across the \nboard, as the Bowles-Simpson commission did. How can we rationalize at \nthis moment in time cutting Head Start for hundreds of thousands of \nkids across America, denying money to the poorest school districts in \nAmerica where they literally struggle day to day to try to turn around \nthe lives of children who are in very dire circumstances?\n  The House Republicans have suggested cutting Pell grants. Pell \ngrants. Those are the grants given to college students from lower \nincome families. I look back on my life and I guess I was one of those \nkids. My mother was a widow and I wanted to go to college, and it \nwasn't a family experience. I needed help. In those days, Pell grants \ndidn't exist, but college loans did, and the Federal college loan came \nto my rescue.\n  Well, here I stand today because of that. And for hundreds and \nthousands of students across America, the Pell grants are their ticket \nto college. That is how they can get into college, earn a diploma, and \nsucceed in life. When the House Republicans say we have reached the \npoint where we have to cut that assistance to college students across \nAmerica, you say to yourself, Is it that bad that we have to reach that \nfar?\n  Let me suggest there are other efforts we ought to look at first. I \nhappen to believe in this great, prosperous Nation that the most \nprosperous among us--the wealthiest, the people who have benefited the \nmost from this great Nation--can be asked to sacrifice more. I think \nthey should. Asking those at the highest income levels in America to \npay more in taxes at this point in our history is not unreasonable and \nit is not going to kill the economy, and it is simple economic justice. \nIf doing that means we can protect the most vulnerable and protect \nopportunity for education, I think that is fair.\n  I also question some of what we are doing. Look at the price of \ngasoline at gas stations across America today and then watch the next \nquarterly earnings report of the oil companies and tell me why we \ncontinue to funnel billions of taxpayers' dollars into subsidies for \nthe oil companies. They are doing quite well, thank you. They don't \nneed a subsidy that adds to our deficit. The same thing is true in my \nhome State of Illinois. Let me get personal about this. I happen to \nbelieve that agriculture is critical to our Nation. I believe we need \nto be there as a safety net for farmers who can't predict what the \nweather will be or what crop prices might be, but there are parts of \nour ag\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\nprogram that, frankly, need to be seriously reviewed and the Federal \ncontribution needs to be reduced. At a time when commodity prices are \nthe highest and farms are the most prosperous and profitable, the fact \nthat we are sending so much money out of the Treasury to some of the \nlargest farms in America is indefensible.\n  So I am bringing it home to the agricultural State of Illinois and to \nour Nation when it comes to oil and gas and saying that before we cut \nmoney for research, as the House Republicans suggest, at the National \nInstitutes of Health, before we deny to doctors and scientists and the \nbest minds in America the resources they need to find cures for \ndiseases, to find the next wonder drug that will revolutionize life in \nAmerica--before we do that, let's take an honest look at this entire \nbudget. The House Republican budget goes too far.\n  Let me also raise a point relative to my own appropriations \nsubcommittee. We have funded three watchdog agencies to make sure we \nnever, ever enter another recession like the one we are in now. After \nWall Street brought the economy to its knees, sent millions of hard-\nworking Americans to the unemployment line, and took $700 billion from \ntaxpayers--you will remember that $700 billion in bailout funds--the \nHouse Republicans are now fighting to prevent the cops from getting on \nthe beat, those who are going to be there to make sure Wall Street can \nnever wreak this damage again.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission was tasked by our Wall Street \nreform bill to write new rules to bring more transparency to the stock \nmarkets. The House Republican budget would cut $231 billion from the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission's budget compared to what the bill \nauthorized. That is an 18-percent cut at the very time when this agency \nshould be beefing up its ranks to keep an eye on what is happening on \nWall Street and writing new rules for enforcement.\n  That may be good news for future Bernie Madoffs but not for investors \nand families across America who count on Wall Street and financial \ninstitutions across America to deal honestly.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission was tasked by the same Wall \nStreet bill to bring some sunshine to what Warren Buffet called \n``financial weapons of mass destruction, the credit default swaps and \nother derivatives that are mostly traded on shadowy over-the-counter \nmarkets today.\n  The House Republican budget would cut $174 million from the CFTC, \ncompared to what the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended. That \nis a 69-percent cut, at the very moment when the CFTC needs better \ntechnology and many more investigators to handle its awesome \nresponsibilities.\n  Then there is a third cut in the House Republican budget. They cut \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It is brand new, created by \nthe Wall Street reform bill. The budget the House Republicans are \npushing would cap the funding for the CFPB at half of what it should \nreceive from the Federal Reserve under the Wall Street reform bill.\n  Since the day I introduced the first bill to create this bureau--in a \ndifferent form but a similar goal--with the help of Elizabeth Warren, a \nprofessor from Harvard Law School, the House Republicans have fought to \ndefeat this idea.\n  When President Obama signed the bill into law, the reformers--the \npeople who want Americans to have access to financial services they \nunderstand to use to improve their lives--won.\n  As the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee with the \nresponsibility for funding these agencies, I have done my best to make \nsure they have adequate funds to protect American investors and \nmaintain the sterling reputation of our financial institutions on Wall \nStreet.\n  As an early champion of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I \nam going to continue that fight to make sure this agency has the power \nand resources it needs.\n  I will close by saying there is such a stark contrast in the vote \nthat we will have today. We are going to be asked on the Senate floor \nwhether Members want to vote for H.R. 1, the House Republican budget. \nThe majority leader reminded us it is not just a spending bill; it is a \nbill that is fraught with every bumper sticker issue you can remember \nover the last 10 years.\n  The Republicans don't want to just cut spending, they want to inject \nthemselves into the national debate on a myriad of issues. They want to \ntake the spending bill and debate abortion, and they want to debate \nwhether we will provide Federal funds for family planning, for Planned \nParenthood across America. They want this spending bill to take funding \naway from National Public Radio and the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. They want this spending bill to take one-third of the \nresources from the EPA, which needs to make sure the air we breathe and \nthe water we drink are fit for ourselves and our families.\n  That is what they are doing. You think to yourself, if this is about \nan economic emergency and budget emergency, why did the House \nRepublicans let it devolve into this situation where it has become a \ncat fight over political issues? We can do better. The American people \nexpect us to do better. I am still meeting with five other Senators--\nthree Republicans and two other Democrats. We are trying to take the \nBowles-Simpson Commission and build this into a thoughtful effort that \nwill reduce our deficit in a meaningful way. It will take time. We are \nnot going to finish in 6 or 7 months or lurching 2 weeks at a time this \nFederal Government. We need to address our responsibilities--the \nresponsibilities to build this economy and, No. 2, to put America's \nfiscal house in order. We can do that, but we need to get beyond the \ncurrent level of political fighting into a more constructive level. I \nhope this bipartisan group I am part of will be part of the solution \nultimately. In the meantime, we will continue our efforts.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, our Nation's budget is a statement of \nour values, our priorities, and our vision for what kind of country we \nwill be handing off to our children and grandchildren.\n  Working together to pass a responsible and forward-looking budget \nthat works for the American people is one of the most important jobs we \nhave in the Senate. The outcome of this process we are talking about \nwill affect millions of families across our country, and the decisions \nwe make this week are going to go a long way toward determining if our \neconomy is going to continue moving in the right direction.\n  This morning I want to speak about two very different budgets being \ndebated today, with two very different statements about what we should \nbe focused on as a country, and two very different visions for how we \nneed to be positioned to compete successfully and win the future.\n  This should not be a partisan process. I am still hopeful we can work \ntogether on a budget plan that cuts spending responsibly and works for \nthe American people. But I am extremely disappointed that Republicans, \nwho came into office talking about the economy, have proposed an \nextreme budget that would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs, \ndevastate workers and small businesses across the country, and threaten \nthat fragile economic recovery.\n  I am disappointed that at a time when so many middle-class families \nstill need support to get back on their feet after the Wall Street \ncrisis Republicans have proposed a highly politicized slash-and-burn \nbudget that will pull the rug out from families and children.\n\n  I am disappointed that while the Senate Democratic proposal makes \nresponsible and practical budget cuts that will allow us to continue \nout-innovating, out-educating, and out-building our competitors, \nRepublicans are proposing a budget that would hack away at these \nestimates across the board and threaten our Nation's ability to compete \nnow and into the future.\n  We are going to hear a lot about big numbers today, and I will \nmention some myself. I think it is important we keep in mind that this \ndebate is about\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nmore than dollars and cents; it is about real people with real lives.\n  I recently heard from the South Central Workforce Development Council \nin Washington State, and they told me about a man they worked with \nnamed Damon.\n  Damon had been laid off from his job testing machine equipment. He \nheld that job for almost 10 years. He and his wife had to move back in \nwith his father, and he said that no matter how hard he tried he could \nnot find work that matched his skills.\n  Damon had to do something about it. He went to his local one-stop \ncareer center and sat down with counselors who talked him through what \nlocal employers were looking for, and he decided he was going to learn \ncomputer networking. He studied hard and graduated from a local \ncomputer technology program. Despite this tough economy, he was able to \nwork with the one-stop center to find a new job in a new field.\n  Damon was able to get back on his feet and support his family because \nof this program. He is not alone. Millions of Americans depend on \nworkforce training programs to get the skills they need to get back to \nwork and help our economy grow, including nearly 400,000 in my State of \nWashington.\n  House Republicans have proposed eliminating these critical programs \nand cutting off services for the workers who depend on them. At a time \nwhen so many workers are fighting to get back on the job, this would be \ndevastating.\n  I recently met with a woman named Tiffany from Chehalis, WA. She told \nme her stepson, Rodney, had some difficult family circumstances and had \nfallen behind his peers and that she and her husband could not afford \nthe private education they thought he needed to catch up. Then she \nheard about Head Start from a friend and enrolled Rodney in that \nprogram.\n  Tiffany told me she saw the difference within a few months. Just a \nshort time later, Rodney was ready for kindergarten, and he is now the \ntop reader in his first grade class. Tiffany and her family got the \nsupport they needed and they, too, are far from being alone.\n  Nearly 1 million families and their children depend on Head Start. \nThe Republican proposal we will be voting on this afternoon eliminates \nservices for 218,000 children, including more than 3,000 in my home \nState. It will close 16,000 classrooms across the country, and it will \ncause up to 55,000 teachers and staff to lose their jobs.\n  Again, this extreme slash-and-burn approach is wrong. It would hurt \nthe most vulnerable of our children and families in our country and \nleave us at a competitive disadvantage in the future.\n  The Republican proposal also slashes community development block \ngrants by 62 percent. That would eliminate services and decimate \nhousing and economic development programs in communities across our \ncountry.\n  It cuts the community health centers so many Americans depend on for \ntheir health care, eliminating funding outright for 127 clinics in 38 \nStates, reducing services at over 1,000 centers nationwide, cutting off \nhealth care for almost 3 million Americans that will cause 5,000 \nworkers across our country to lose their jobs.\n  Not only will the Republican proposal devastate middle-class families \nacross this country, it would also halt the beginning of an economic \nrecovery that our families and our small business owners desperately \nneed to take root.\n  Last month, our economy added over 200,000 private sector jobs, and \nthe unemployment rate fell to the lowest level in 2 years.\n  We have a long way to go, but I am confident that we have turned the \ncorner and are beginning to move in the right direction. Economists on \nboth the left and the right have come out and said if the Republican \nproposal from the House were to pass, the economic recovery and \nmillions of jobs across the country would be threatened.\n  In fact, one independent analysis said the Republican plan could \ndestroy up to 700,000 American jobs in this country, including an \nestimated 15,000 in my State of Washington. That would be devastating, \nand we cannot afford to let that happen.\n  That is why the Senate Democratic proposal would take our country in \na very different direction. It would cut spending--billions of dollars, \nin fact--but it would do so in a responsible and practical way that \nwould protect our middle-class families, those who need it most.\n  Our proposal continues to make the investments we need as a country \nto compete and win in the 21st-century economy. Take the highly \nsuccessful TIGER Program that I helped create. Communities across our \ncountry have been competing very hard for resources from this program \nso they can invest in transportation projects that make significant \ncontributions to the Nation, to their region, or their metropolitan \narea.\n  Today, the TIGER Program is putting workers on the job and helping to \nlay down a strong foundation for economic growth in this country. But \nthe Republican proposal would not only eliminate that program \ncompletely and slam the door on communities that want to invest in \ntheir infrastructure, it would also take back every penny of funding--\nall funding already--promised in last year's budget. That will halt 75 \nprojects in 40 States that are ready to go and put 33,000 jobs at risk. \nIt doesn't make any sense. The Democratic proposal would protect that \ncritical investment.\n  The Republican proposal would also jeopardize public health and the \nenvironment by gutting the laws that keep our air and water clean. It \ncuts nearly $2 billion in funding for clean water infrastructure, which \nour local communities need to keep our families safe, so when you turn \non that water in your kitchen you will know it is safe. It slashes the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, which, by the way, uses revenue from \noffshore oil leases to protect some of the most treasured places in our \ncountry. But that is not all. The extreme Republican proposal would \nalso slash investments for students and children, including a $700 \nmillion cut to title I funding, which will affect 2,400 schools serving \nover 1 million students. It cuts Pell grants by 15 percent, which will \nmake it so much harder for kids to go to college today.\n  The House Republican proposal would even slash some of the bipartisan \nprograms we have created to keep our families safe, including 66 \npercent cuts to both the Transit Security Grant Program that helps make \nsure our trains and subways are safe, as well as the Port Security \nGrant Program that helps protect our critical economic and national \nsecurity assets across the country. That does not make sense. If a \nterrorist attack were to occur at one of our ports or transit systems, \nit would be absolutely devastating for our families and our economy, \nwhich is why the Democratic proposal protects these critical \ninvestments.\n  Those are just a few of the examples of the radical and irresponsible \ncuts that are proposed in the Republican budget.\n  We, of course, need to cut spending. We need to bring down the \ndeficit. We all agree on that point. But we have to do it responsibly, \nand we cannot do it on the backs of our middle-class families who are \nstruggling.\n  I urge my colleagues this afternoon to support the Democratic \nproposal, and if we cannot pass something today, I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to come to the table and work with us to pass a responsible \nlong-term budget that really does reflect our priorities, gets our \nworkers back on the job, and invests in America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1418-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, later today Senators will have an \nopportunity to take a position on government spending. At a time when \nWashington is borrowing about $4 billion a day, Democratic leaders want \nto cut about $4.5 billion in government spending for the rest of this \nfiscal year and call it a day. In other words, they want to take what \namounts to a day-and-a-\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\nhalf long holiday from their out-of-control spending and then return to \nthe status quo for the rest of the year.\n  Let me add that paying lipservice to the threat caused by the deficit \nis not a substitute for responsible leadership and that the job-\ndestroying tax hikes on small businesses and American families are not \nthe answer to out-of-control Washington spending. At a time when \nincreasing gas prices are already threatening our economic recovery, a \nminivan tax that some on the other side have proposed will not solve \nour Nation's fiscal crisis. But I will tell you what it will do. It \nwill destroy jobs and impose a real burden on families every time they \nfill up at the pump--at a time when people are looking for relief \ninstead.\n  Democrats' steadfast refusal to cut another dime from the bloated \nWashington budget has left them no choice, it seems, but to propose \nraising taxes on American families and small businesses so they can \ncontinue spending at unsustainable levels. Republicans, on the other \nhand, have made a serious proposal to rein in wasteful spending. To me, \nat least, the choice before us is pretty clear.\n  As we approach today's vote, it is worth noting that even if we were \nto pass the biggest spending cuts that have been proposed so far in \nthis debate, it would not even put a dent in the fiscal problems we \nface as a result of the growth in entitlement spending. Think about it. \nDemocrats have been waging war this week over a proposal to cut $4.7 \nbillion. Meanwhile, the amount of money we have promised to spend on \nprograms such as Social Security and Medicare--money we do not have--is \nabout $52 trillion.\n  This week's debate is just a dress rehearsal for the big stuff, and \nso far Democrats are showing they are just not up to it. They either \nlack the stomach or the courage, and the President, as members of his \nown party point out, is nowhere to be found on this issue. I have \ntalked about this leadership vacuum repeatedly this week on the \nentitlements and how their unchecked growth threatens to bury all of us \nin red ink before we know it. We can argue about whether to cut $5 \nbillion or $60 billion in day-to-day expenses all we want, but the fact \nis, even if we hit the bigger number, we are still staring at a \ncatastrophe. And the President appears to be totally uninterested--\nuninterested--in leading us to a bipartisan solution the way Ronald \nReagan and Bill Clinton did the last time we faced a crisis of this \nmagnitude.\n  When it comes to another crisis, the jobs crisis, the President is \nnot just failing to lead, he is flatout barring the door with a \nmountain of stifling new regulations and calculated inaction on \noutstanding free-trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.\n  This morning, the U.S. Trade Representative is set to testify before \nthe Finance Committee to voice the administration's support of a trade \nagreement with South Korea. While we support the administration's \nposition on South Korea, the lack of leadership on these two other \ncountries which signed free-trade agreements with us more than 3 years \nago is completely disheartening. The reason for inaction is stunning. \nUnion bosses do not want to see them passed. For some reason, they seem \nto think that expanding the market for U.S. goods into Colombia and \nPanama somehow hurts them, which is absurd, absolutely absurd. The \nadministration has previously expressed tepid support for these deals, \nan acknowledgment that expanding markets for U.S. goods can only help \nU.S. workers and that the picture in Colombia is better than the labor \nbosses would have us believe, but they have failed to follow through.\n  The irony of union opposition to these trade deals is that an \nexpanded U.S. presence in Latin America can only help the workers there \nby exporting U.S. business standards and practices, and, of course, \nmore exports for U.S. firms means more jobs for U.S. workers in the \nUnited States.\n  In the last few weeks, company after company has come before Congress \nto testify how important accessing Latin American markets is for their \nfuture and to create jobs right in America. According to the chamber of \ncommerce, failing to pass these trade agreements, along with the trade \nagreement with South Korea, could cost us 380,000 U.S. jobs.\n  While we dither on these agreements, Colombia has moved on. Having \nbeen stiff-armed by the United States, it is finding other trade \npartners. Naturally, Colombia has turned to other countries and, worse, \nstill is warming relations with Hugo Chavez in neighboring Venezuela. \nLast week, Colombia President Juan Manuel Santos was quoted referring \nto Chavez as his ``new best friend''--a man who just last year accused \nSantos of plotting to assassinate him.\n  At a time when nearly 14 million Americans are looking for work, the \nPresident should be listening to those of us who come to him with ways \nto create jobs. And this is one of them. The administration has no \nexcuse for failing to act on these trade agreements. It is in the \ninterest of our country to approve them. It would create jobs at home \nat a time when we desperately need them. I am confident Congress could \npass these on a bipartisan basis today.\n  I urge the administration to act today, and not just on South Korea \nbut on Colombia and Panama. I, for one, am prepared to do everything in \nmy power to pass these agreements, all of them together, this year.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1419-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1419-S1420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CAP AND TRADE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the \nadministration's ill-advised cap-and-trade agenda and to support a \nbipartisan bill that I cosponsored. The Energy Tax Prevention Act would \nstop EPA from going around Congress and using regulations to implement \nthe administration's failed cap-and-trade agenda. The bill is necessary \nbecause the administration is marching ahead with its cap-and-trade \nagenda even though the American people clearly want to focus on job \ncreation, not policies that destroy jobs.\n  For evidence that the administration is marching ahead, one need only \nlook at the President's budget. It clearly states ``continues to \nsupport greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the United States in the \nrange of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050.'' \nNot surprisingly, these reductions are nearly identical to those \nproposed in the Waxman-Markey House cap-and-trade bill. Americans \nrejected that legislation because it would have increased taxes on \neveryone--anyone who turns on a light switch, buys American-made \nproducts, fills up their gas tank.\n  The Energy Tax Prevention Act would prevent the administration from \nusing its regulatory powers to circumvent Congress and implement this \nenergy tax that Americans rejected last year. It is about protecting \njobs--manufacturing jobs, for example--and it puts Congress back in the \ndriver's seat in charge of energy policy, taking it back from unelected \nbureaucrats at the too-often overreaching EPA.\n  Above all, this bill rejects the notion that placing additional \nenergy tax burdens on Americans is good policy. As the price of oil \nclimbs and gas prices follow, our bill says: Don't hit Americans with \nanother tax. Make no mistake, cap-and-trade policies would drive up the \ncost of everything, transportation fuels and electricity leading the \nway. Nobody disagrees with this understanding. In fact, the central \npolicy mechanism of all of these proposals is making the use and \nproduction of fossil fuels more expensive.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has weighed in on this issue, and \nthey put it this way:\n\n       . . . a cap-and-trade program would thus lead to price \n     increases for energy and energy-intensive goods and services \n     . . . Such price increases would stem from the restriction on \n     emissions . . . Indeed, the price increases would be \n     essential to the success of a cap-and-trade program.\n\n  In other words, these efforts are designed to make oil, gas, and \ncoal-fired electricity more expensive, and the\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\nsame is true for the EPA's regulatory plan. Gas prices will go up, \nelectricity will go up, farm input costs will go up, consumers will pay \nmore, and U.S. manufacturing will get crushed under the heavy hand of \nthe EPA. Meanwhile, our overseas competitors, unfettered by the cap, \nwill gobble up market share and hurt those providing good-paying jobs \nin this country. Our farmers and ranchers will not be spared either. \nThe cost of running pivot irrigation will go up. Nebraska has thousands \nof them. Diesel fuel for tractors and combines will go up. The price \ntag on fertilizer that farmers need to grow crops will skyrocket.\n  Some of my constituents might be saying: I am not a farmer, I am not \na manufacturer, so I am not affected. Unfortunately, no American can \nescape the reach of this ill-advised regulatory effort. Because \nrefineries are first targeted in EPA's regulatory schedule, because \nelectrical plants are first targeted, electric bills and the cost of \nfuel will go up. If you think gas prices are high now, brace yourself--\nmore price hikes are coming. And if you think your electric bill at the \nend of the month is already plenty high, look out for EPA's energy tax.\n  Believe it or not, the Obama administration has made it clear that \nthese higher prices are exactly, precisely what the doctor ordered. \nDuring the Presidential campaign, President Obama famously said--he was \nreally up-front:\n\n       Under my plan, electricity bills would necessarily \n     skyrocket.\n\n  Citizens probably entered the voting booth with the false hope that \nwe in Congress would never let that happen. Sadly, the Obama \nadministration has made it clear that they intend to work around \nCongress. Energy Secretary Steven Chu even told the Wall Street Journal \nin September of 2008:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels of Europe.\n\n  That is not my vision for America. And with gasoline over $7 per \ngallon in places such as Germany and France, I doubt many Americans \nshare that vision. Yet this administration has chosen to use the EPA to \nmake gasoline expensive through its ill-advised energy tax plan. The \nEPA is literally targeting our fuel refineries when gas prices are \nheaded to $4 per gallon and oil is over $100 a barrel. It doesn't make \nsense.\n\n  But just when we thought we saw a ray of hope, when the President \nsaid he wanted to slow down the regulatory freight train bearing down \non the Nation's job creators, well, something happened. He said he \nwanted to reduce the regulatory burdens on small businesses. He even \nwent so far as to put out an Executive order in January, and he \ninstructed the agencies to review ``rules that have gotten out of \nbalance, placing unreasonable burdens on business, burdens that have \nstifled innovation and have a chilling effect on growth and jobs.''\n  Well, unfortunately, the EPA apparently believes their greenhouse gas \nregulations are more important than job creation. The headline from the \nHill newspaper says it all: ``EPA Confident Obama Reg Policy Won't \nAffect New Climate Rules.'' So the EPA, all powerful, quickly dismissed \nthe Executive order saying: ``EPA is confident that our recent and \nupcoming steps to address GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act \ncomfortably pass muster under the sensible standards the President laid \nout.''\n  In other words, the EPA believes, and continues to think, their \nregulatory cap-and-trade plan is not an unreasonable burden on \nconsumers, small business, and job creators. One would have to suspend \nall rational thought to reach that conclusion. It is unbelievable. Here \nis the kicker: These EPA regulations will have no discernible impact on \nglobal temperatures.\n  Put simply, the EPA's agenda is all about more pain and no gain \nbecause the rules and regulations in the United States don't control \nplaces such as China, India, and Brazil, obviously. You see, global \nwarming is called global warming for a reason. Yet it is our farmers, \nour ranchers, and our small businesses that will be saddled with the \njob-killing costs. American job creators will have one arm tied behind \ntheir back trying to compete. Even EPA Administrator Jackson admitted \nthe House cap-and-trade bill would have negligible impact on global \ntemperatures.\n  This is all unbelievably bad for America. It is no wonder the Senate \nroundly repudiated the idea last year. Yet the EPA charges forward. We \nmust restore some measure of common sense. This bill is the right step, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1420-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1420-S1421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A SECOND OPINION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor, as I do every \nweek, as a physician who has practiced medicine and taken care of \nfamilies in Wyoming for a quarter of a century, to give a doctor's \nsecond opinion of the health care law.\n  County commissioners from around the State of Wyoming are coming to \ntown today for their annual meeting. It was 1 year ago today, at their \nannual meeting, when Nancy Pelosi--then-Speaker of the House--addressed \nthat group and said: We have to pass the bill so you can find out what \nis in it.\n  That quote has been repeated again and again and again, and people \nnow know what is in this health care law. People have found out. Every \nmonth since this law has been passed, people have found out additional \nthings about the health care law they absolutely do not like. Now that \nthe American people know what is in the bill, and they know they don't \nlike it, let's get to the fundamentals of what the American people have \nasked for. When they asked for a change in health care in this country, \nthey said they wanted the care they need from the doctor at a price \nthey can afford. The new law fails that test, and it fails miserably.\n  It has only taken 1 year to break almost every promise the President \nmade when he addressed the Congress and the country. So what I would \nlike to do now is take a look, month by month, at how those promises \nwere broken. I will start with March, since it is now March and this \nstarted with Nancy Pelosi's statement in March of 2010.\n  One year ago, the Congressional Budget Office evaluated the law to \nsee how much it would actually cost. They told us the law could only \nreduce the deficit if it did something about the long-term insolvency \nof Medicare. Instead, the Democrats and the President proposed and \nadopted and signed into law cuts of over $500 billion from Medicare. \nThis was not to save Medicare but to start a whole new government \nentitlement program, a decision the CBO said would increase the deficit \nby $260 billion.\n  Let's go to April. In April, we learned the costs for those Medicare \ncuts go way beyond dollars and cents. An analysis by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services found these cuts could drive up to 15 percent \nof hospitals out of business. For this administration, the shortage of \nhospitals apparently takes a backseat to the shortage of Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  Let us go to May. In May, we learned over 200,000 Americans with \npreexisting conditions and expensive health insurance would not be \neligible to enroll in the new high-risk pools created in the health \ncare law; that is, of course, unless they were willing to completely \ndrop the insurance they had and wait, without insurance--wait without \ninsurance--for 6 months. Only then would they qualify for what was in \nthe health care law. For many people with preexisting conditions, who \nwere paying higher premiums, they felt that would be irresponsible \nbehavior; that it would be risky, put them at financial risk. But that \nis what this administration and this government was proposing.\n  In June, after the administration sent over 4 million postcards to \nsmall businesses--you remember the postcards, the ones claiming those \nsmall businesses would be eligible for a tax credit--the Associated \nPress blew the whistle. It turned out the only small businesses that \nwere fully eligible for these tax credits had to employ fewer than 25 \npeople. So to be eligible at all, they had to have fewer than 25 \npeople. Moreover, the Associated Press reported the tax credit drops \noff sharply if the company employs any more than 10 people or if the \nannual salary was averaging more than $25,000. So if you had 10 \nemployees and paid them, on average, $25,000, you could get the tax \ncredit. But once you went to that 11th employee and gave someone a \nraise,\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\nyou started to lose the attribute the administration said was so \nvaluable.\n  That was in June. In July, the Obama administration's own Justice \nDepartment confirmed the individual mandate penalty is a tax increase. \nWell, when ABC News's George Stephanopoulos asked the President if the \nmandate penalty was a tax increase, the President said: ``I absolutely \nreject that notion.'' Well, if the President absolutely rejects the \nnotion, why is his own Justice Department contradicting him?\n  In August, without so much as a hearing before Congress, the \nPresident made a recess appointment. He tapped Dr. Donald Berwick to \nrun the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. So how big is this \nFederal agency? Well, it includes oversight of a budget larger than the \nPentagon's. Dr. Berwick believes the government must ration health care \nand that the only issue is whether we ration with our eyes wide open, \nas he said. Well, the President promised not to ration care, so why did \nhe make an appointment of someone who believes it is inevitable to \nration care and do it in a way without ever allowing the Senate--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike, Members of this body--to even have a \nhearing so this individual could explain his position, explain his \nprevious comments, explain what he has said and written? The President \nrefused and did a recess appointment of someone who never testified, \nnever came to a confirmation hearing, and he put him in charge of a \nprogram with a budget larger than the Pentagon's. Can you imagine if \nthe Secretary of Defense was made as a recess appointment without a \ncongressional hearing? It is unthinkable.\n  In September, the administration released new rules estimating that \n80 percent of small businesses would be forced to change the coverage \nof insurance they offer to their employees. These aren't my numbers, \nthese are the administration's own numbers. But it was the President \nwho said, over and over, if you like the coverage you have today, then \nyou can keep it. Now we know that was another one of the President's \nempty promises.\n  In October, responding to complaints from unions and corporations, \nthe Obama administration began handing out waivers--waivers that \nexcused individual groups from ObamaCare's expensive mandates. These \nwaivers went mostly to those politically connected to this \nadministration. Most American families still have to bear the law's \nexpensive burdens. Clearly, for this administration, playing favorites \nis more important than achieving fairness. I think every American ought \nto be able to get a waiver from this health care law.\n  In November, a majority of the American people voiced their \nopposition to this law and handed an election response that resulted in \na significant change in the composition of the House and the Senate \nbecause the American people knew they did not want this health care \nlaw.\n\n  The American people were concerned--and they even wondered if this \nlaw was constitutional--and in December, a Federal judge in Virginia \nruled it was unconstitutional to force Americans to buy a product. The \nService Employees International Union, one of the biggest unions in the \ncountry, also admitted in December that fulfilling the requirements of \nObamaCare would be financially impossible. This is the same law they \nsaid the country needed when they lobbied in favor of it.\n  In January of this year, the Medicare Actuary called the \nadministration's claim the health care law would bring down costs \n``false more than true.'' Also, a Federal judge in Florida struck down \nthe entire law as unconstitutional.\n  In February--last month--we learned the 2012 budget the IRS submitted \nto Congress specifically mentions the health care law 250 times. They \nmention it as a source of authority and funding for new powers. They \ncalled the health care law ``the largest set of tax law changes in more \nthan 20 years.'' To begin implementing these changes will require \nthousands of new Washington bureaucrats.\n  Well, that was through February, and here we are, on March 9. Did the \nAmerican people find out anything new about the health care law in \nMarch? Absolutely. Last Friday night, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices granted another 150 waivers--another 150 waivers. Now there \nare over 1,040 waivers covering 2.6 million individuals. These are \npeople who don't want to live under the Obama health care law. They \ndon't want it to apply to them. I think every American ought to have a \nright to that same waiver. Of those 2.6 million people who received \nwaivers, 1.2 million are members of unions. So that is 46 percent of \nthe waivers have been given to union members.\n  If you look at the Web site you must go to for that information, the \nSecretary has tried to disguise how they label these individuals, and \nso union plans are now called ``multiemployer plans.'' Under this \nchange in the name, at the Web site you go to learn about this, are the \nwords ``promoting transparency.'' So we have an administration that \nsays one thing but does another.\n  But the American people now know what is in the law. As they were \nstudying the law before the vote, they didn't want it. Now they know \nall about it, and they still don't want it. It is clear it is \nunsustainable, unaffordable, and unconstitutional. It is time to repeal \nand replace it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This is going to be a big discussion \nand a big issue for the next couple of years, until we decide what \ndirection we are going to take.\n  Today I want to talk about spending. Two bills are coming to the \nfloor today about spending and there will be lots of discussion about \nthe cuts the House made, the $61 billion of cuts and how this cut could \nhave been better, how this is a good thing for the government or for \nsomebody to do. Of course, I suspect most all of that will be true. \nWhat is unfortunate is that we on the Senate floor today do not get to \ntalk about what we might cut instead of these things, these things that \nwill be discussed that people think are such a good idea for us to cut.\n  The truth is, we have to make the decisions that get spending under \ncontrol. This year we are going to spend about $3.8 trillion and we are \ngoing to collect about $2.2 trillion. Even though ``trillion dollars'' \nis too big a concept to wrap your mind around, everybody understands \nthat 3.8 is a lot bigger than 2.2. If your business was spending $3.8 \nmillion and bringing in $2.2 million, you would understand your \nbusiness was not going to be in business very much longer. If your \nfamily was spending $38,000 and bringing in the door $22,000, you would \nknow that could not continue. This cannot continue either.\n  The idea we cannot make $61 billion of reductions in spending in a \n$3.8 trillion budget, $1.6 trillion of which is deficit spending, \ndoesn't make sense to me and it doesn't make sense to the American \npeople. We are going to have to have a government that can make \nchoices.\n  Right now we have government trying to do the same thing over and \nover at all three levels. Some of those things government is trying to \ndo at the Federal, the State, and the local level ought to be left to \nfamilies, where they could be left to families. Other things are the \nlegitimate job of government. But everything is not the legitimate job \nof the Federal Government and almost nothing is the legitimate job of \nall levels of government. We would be much better off if we tried to go \nthrough this process: OK, is this a problem that only government can \nsolve? If the answer is yes, then the next question is: Can't we solve \nthat problem closer to where people live and\n\n[[Page S1422]]\n\nwork, and where the problem is, where families are? Can't we solve that \nat the city level or the county level?\n  Maybe the answer is no. Then the question should be: Can't we solve \nit at the State level? Then the question should be: If we are going to \nsolve it at the Federal level, is there a constitutional definition \nthat allows us to do that?\n  There are some things that only the Federal Government can do. But \nthere are not very many things that only the Federal Government can do.\n  We are going to hear in this discussion today and in the coming weeks \nabout lots of good that can be done in our society. We are going to \nhear about some things I have worked to authorize and tried to get us \nto make a priority and still hope to keep a priority. Some of those \nprograms are actually cut in the House appropriations bill that I will \nvote for today, because my view is we have to cut spending. If we could \ncut the $61 billion this year from exactly what I wanted to be cut, \nthat would be better for me. But I am committed to cut spending in any \nbill we can get enough people to support, to put a bill on the \nPresident's desk that will say let's head toward a balanced budget. \nLet's get a balanced budget amendment. Let's head toward a balanced \nbudget. But let's ask the right questions.\n  Before I came to the Congress, I was a university president for 4 \nyears. It was a private university, Southwest Baptist University in \nBolivar, MO. We did not take any Federal money or any State money. We \nhad to pay our bills. Because we had to pay our bills, as the president \nof the university I was constantly being asked to do good things but I \nhad several different categories of ``no, this is why we cannot do \nthat.'' There are two that maybe we ought to use the most often in \nWashington, DC, these days. The first is: No, that is a good idea but \nit is not what we do. I said that a lot as the university president. As \na matter of fact, in the 4 years I was there I never had anybody come \nto me and ask me to do anything evil. I never had anybody come to me as \npresident of the Southwest Baptist University and say here is something \nbad I think we should do as an institution. Every idea I got was a good \nidea, but it was not always something we could do. So one of my \ncategories of no was ``no, that's a good idea but it's not what we \ndo.''\n  We are going to hear lots about people with challenges that somebody \nshould help. But the Federal Government is $1.6 trillion in debt this \nyear--this year; not the $14 trillion accumulated debt, $1.6 this \nyear--over $200 billion last month. Last month's deficit was within \nstriking range of the annual deficit for the 10 years that ended in \n2008. We are now spending more in deficit spending in a month than for \na decade we spent in a year. If you average out that 10 years it is \nvery close to February--and by the way, February is the shortest month. \nThat is the only month where we have 28 days of spending, and we set a \nrecord on monthly deficit spending for the United States of America \nthat was almost equal to the average annual deficit of the previous 10 \nyears.\n  Sometimes people came to me and they had a good idea that actually \nwas something the university could do. Often, then, I would have to \nsay: Yes, that is a good idea, we ought to think how we can do that, \nbut you are going to have to help me figure out what we can stop doing \nso we can start doing this. This may in fact be a better thing than \nsome of the things we are doing now, but we can't do everything. \nFamilies deal with this issue all the time. You cannot do everything, \neven if it would be good to see those things done.\n  The Federal Government is doing the wrong thing when it heads down a \nroad where you are spending so much more than you are collecting. One \nobvious answer is let's collect more. I suppose if you went to the \nCongressional Budget Office and said what would the collection amount \nbe for the Federal Government if the tax rate were 100 percent--since \nthey do not do any dynamic scoring over there, they score as if tax \npolicy doesn't matter--I guess they could add up all the payrolls of \nAmerica and whatever they added up to, that is how much money the \nFederal Government could bring in if the tax rate were 100 percent.\n  But that would not happen. Frankly, the tax rate of collecting the \n$2.2 trillion is about all we ought to be collecting out of this \neconomy. For the 65 years after World War II, the government spent an \naverage of about $1 out of $5, the Federal Government, that the economy \ncould create. Now we are spending $1 out of $4. There is a big \ndifference in a country where the Federal Government alone spends 1 \ndollar out of 4 that the country can create in goods and services as \nopposed to 1 dollar out of 5. You are not going to get a lot more on \nthe taxing side. So we have to make the reductions in spending.\n  Then you are going to hear we are making these reductions out of 12 \npercent or 15 percent of the budget. Is that fair?\n  First of all, that is the only part of the budget we can get to \nwithout significant legislative activity. That should be the next thing \non our agenda. Let's talk about the 60 percent of the budget we \nnormally do not even talk about where if you meet the definition of the \nprogram you get the money, and see if we can't figure out how to \nproduce better results for fewer dollars. That is what everybody else \nin America has been thinking about for 20 years now.\n  If you are still in business in America and you are competing in a \nglobal economy, you have been thinking how do we get a better result \nfor less money, not how do we spend more money. We need to be sure the \ngovernment is as good as the people it serves in that regard. It is 12 \nor 15 percent of the budget where we are talking reducing spending by \n$61 billion. That would not begin to be nearly enough, if you apportion \nit out. That is about one-seventh of the budget. If you multiply that \nby seven, you are still well over $1 trillion short of where you need \nto be. We need to start by taking at least this much money out of that \npart of the budget and figure out how we can also make the government \nwork better in the other 85 percent of the budget.\n  Today is what it is. Today is a discussion to prove, apparently, that \nwe cannot do anything. We can't do what the majority of the Senate \nwants to do, we can't do what the majority in the House wants to do. \nLet me tell you what the majority in the House wants to do is a minimum \nentry level to solving this whole problem. I am going to vote for it \ntoday and I urge my colleagues to vote for it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1422-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    JOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY THE HONORABLE JULIA \n                  GILLARD, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there will now be 3 \nhours of debate, equally divided and controlled between the two leaders \nor their designees.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the amendment I introduced on Friday cuts \n$51 billion from the discretionary spending request submitted by the \nPresident for fiscal year 2011. If this amendment were agreed to as \nwritten, it would mean we would appropriate $51 billion less than the \nPresident felt was necessary for the government to carry out its \nduties.\n  I do not agree with every item this President or any President \nrequests in their budget. But I also know the President's budget \nrequest did not contain $51 billion in frivolous or wasteful spending. \nThe cuts necessary to reach the $51-billion level required difficult \nchoices. This amendment makes real cuts to real programs.\n  Tens of thousands of Americans will feel the direct impact of the \nproposed cuts. But the cuts included in this amendment are based on \nhearings, testimony, and a thorough analysis of the current needs of \nevery agency and department the committee funds. By contrast, the \nRepublicans in the House have thrown together a proposal based not on \nbudgets, not on hearings, not on the demonstrated needs of agencies and \ndepartments but rather based on the campaign promise to reduce spending \nby $100 billion.\n  H.R. 1 shows clearly what happens when you run a bill based not on \nanalysis but on campaign speeches. Therefore, today, the Senate finds \nitself responding to draconian cuts that would lead to furloughs, \ndisrupt the delivery of government agencies and services, and harm \nAmerica's children, our students, our working class, and our seniors. \nAn estimated 700,000 jobs would be lost.\n  All this pain delivered in the name of deficit reduction and growing \nthe economy. Yet the facts are clear. This is the wrong direction for \nour Nation.\n  We face our current fiscal situation primarily because of falling \nrevenues brought about by unpaid-for tax cuts, especially for the \nwealthiest Americans, and because of ever-rising entitlement costs. \nEvery nonpartisan report on finding a solution to our current fiscal \ncrisis stresses the need for a comprehensive solution, a solution that \nincludes cuts in discretionary spending, both defense and nondefense, \nas well as cuts in entitlement spending, and, yes, the need for \nadditional revenues.\n  Just yesterday, the New York Times published a story about the \nefforts of the junior Senator from Virginia and the senior Senator from \nGeorgia to honestly examine what it will take to solve our fiscal \nchallenges. According to that story, even if Congress cut discretionary \nspending to zero, the senior Senator from Georgia was quoted as saying: \n``We still couldn't solve the problem.''\n  I could not agree more. The solution to deficit reduction will not \ncome from huge cuts to a small portion of the Federal budget. But that \nis what the House is proposing. What H.R. 1 will do instead is \njeopardize the economic recovery we are beginning to see.\n  This Democratic alternative attempts to make the best of a very bad \nsituation. The top line numbers tell a story. In this amendment, we are \n$23 billion below the President's request for nonsecurity spending, and \nwe are $28 billion below his original request for spending related to \nour Nation's security.\n  For the Department of Defense alone, we have reduced spending by \n$19.4 billion, including a reduction of $2.1 billion for military \nconstruction, and $17.3 billion for the rest of the Defense Department. \nAt this level, the bill is nearly $3 billion below the amounts proposed \nby the House for these activities. The recommended amounts will cover \nour defense requirements in this constrained fiscal environment.\n  However, my colleagues should all understand that with our troops \nstill serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, this is not the time to be \nlooking to defense for additional reductions. I feel that not all \nMembers understand the depths of the cuts we have had to take to get \n$51 billion under the request.\n  They should be advised, for example, that the Senate amendment cuts \n$355 million of State and local law enforcement grants. This will \nresult in some 1,400 fewer local and tribal law enforcement and \ncriminal justice jobs. In addition, the amendment cuts $526 million \nfrom FBI salaries and expenses. These cuts will halt new national \nsecurity enhancements intended to improve our intelligence and \ncounterterrorism capabilities to protect U.S. information and \ntechnology networks from cyber attacks and to assist in litigation of \nintelligence and terrorism cases.\n  This amendment cuts science funding by $573 million at the National \nScience Foundation and by $165 million at the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology. As a result, the Nation will lose \nopportunities for promising research in emerging fields such as cyber \nsecurity and nanotechnology. Instead of taking the lead, as we have \nalways done, we will slow down, allowing the rest of the world to catch \nup.\n  When it comes to the critical area of education, the Senate amendment \neliminates 17 individual education programs totaling $370 million. It \ncuts all Federal funding specifically targeted to education technology, \ngifted and talented instruction, and family literacy. The list goes on \nand on. But as significant as these cuts are, they stand in strong \ncontrast to the House Republican bill, which includes such severe \nmeasures that the bill would undermine our security, endanger our \neconomy, while costing hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\n  H.R. 1 would cut transit security grants by 66 percent, despite the \nfact that there have been over 1,300 attacks, killing or injuring over \n18,000 people worldwide on trains and subways over the last 7 years. \nThe Senate bill would maintain the fiscal year 2010 enacted level of \n$300 million.\n  The House Republican CR cuts discretionary funding for community \nhealth centers by $1 billion compared to the fiscal year 2010 enacted \nlevel. This cut would prevent any new clinic from opening. It will \neliminate funds for 127 clinics currently operating in 38 States and \nreduce current services at another 1,096 centers across the country. \nMore than 2.8 million people will likely lose access to their current \nprimary care provider, and over 5,000 health center staff would lose \ntheir jobs. The Senate bill restores the $1 billion cut, preserving \nboth the vital services being provided today and the planned expansion \nof centers estimated to treat over 7\\1/2\\ million new patients this \nyear.\n  The House CR would eliminate all funding for the Transportation \nInvestment Generating Economic Recovery ``TIGER'' Grant Program. TIGER \ngrants are highly competitive and fund transportation projects that \nmake a significant contribution to the Nation, a region or a \nmetropolitan area. The House proposal would take funding away from 75 \nprojects in 40 States across the country. Based on information from the \nTransportation Department, cutting a total of $1.2 billion from the \nTIGER Program will put 33,360 jobs at risk.\n  H.R. 1 cuts funding for the Social Security Administration \nadministrative expense by $125 million below the 2010 level. This would \ncause the SSA to freeze hiring across the agency and possibly furlough \nemployees at a time when the number of Americans filing for disability \nand retirement benefits is at record levels. The Senate bill, by \ncontrast, provides $600 million more than the House Republican \nproposal. Compared to the House CR, it will allow SSA to process about \n300,000 more initial disability claims and 150,000 more disability \nhearings and prevent delays in new beneficiaries receiving their \nretirement benefits.\n  The House bill slashes title I education funding by nearly $700 \nmillion, meaning 2,400 schools serving 1 million disadvantaged students \ncould lose funding, and approximately 10,000 teachers and aides would \nlose their jobs. At a time when schools across the Nation are already \nstruggling with budget cuts, the title I grants program serves as the \nfoundation of Federal assistance to elementary and secondary schools \nacross the country, providing financial assistance to more than 90 \npercent of our Nation's school districts.\n  Finally, with regard to our Nation's security interests, the \ndevastating funding cuts in H.R. 1 undermine our ability to stabilize \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq and to support General Petraeus's \ncounterinsurgency strategy. H.R. 1 provides $5.71 billion for the \nEconomic Support Fund, a 27-percent cut from the fiscal year 2011 \nrequest level.\n  As both Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton have made clear in \nrepeated testimony before Congress, cuts\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\nof this magnitude will seriously impede efforts to stabilize \nAfghanistan and to transition responsibility for U.S. operations in \nIraq from the military to civilians.\n  There are many more examples of damage that would come should H.R. 1 \nbe enacted into law, which is why the President has promised a veto and \nwhy I know all my Democratic colleagues will reject it when it comes up \nfor a vote.\n  The Senate amendment I offer takes a responsible approach to funding \nthe government for the remainder of the fiscal year, making difficult \ndecisions but also ensuring minimal disruptions to the economic \nrecovery.\n  We are now almost halfway through fiscal year 2011, If we are to have \nany chance of avoiding another series of continuing resolutions for \nfiscal year 2012, we simply must finish our work on the current year \nand move past this issue. Therefore, I strongly encourage my colleagues \nto support my amendment as a prudent alternative to the House measure.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe following explanatory statement regarding Division A of my \nAmendment No. 149, The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing \nAppropriations Act, 2011.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Explanatory Statement Submitted by Senator Daniel K.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that speakers on \nthe Republican side be limited to 10 minutes each, with Senator Coburn \ncontrolling up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the two proposals, the \nDemocratic proposal and the Republican proposal from the House known as \nH.R. 1. I am going to reluctantly support H.R. 1. It reduces government \nspending by about $61 billion below last year's levels. The reason I am \nreluctantly supporting it is because I don't think it goes far enough.\n  We have heard the other side rail that the cuts are too large, but \nlet me bring to the attention of my colleagues a few quotes.\n  This is from ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff:\n\n       I believe that our debt is the greatest threat to our \n     national security.\n\n  We know our national debt is over $14 trillion. This year, we are \nspending, in excess of what we take in, almost $1.6 trillion. All we \nare talking about in the House bill is reducing that amount by $61 \nbillion--a paltry amount.\n  A few other quotes.\n  This is from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on February 17:\n\n       It is an excessively high interest burden. It's \n     unsustainable. With the President's plan, even if Congress \n     were to enact it, and even if Congress were to hold to it and \n     reduce those deficits as a percentage of GDP over the next 5 \n     years, we would still be left with a very large interest \n     burden and unsustainable obligations over time.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       Our deficits are too high. They are unsustainable.\n\n  I think everybody agrees.\n\n       They are unsustainable and, if left unaddressed, these \n     deficits will hurt economic growth and make us weaker as a \n     nation.\n\n  One of the bills before the Senate starts to address it. The other \nbill virtually ignores the deficit.\n  This is from the President:\n\n       What my budget does is to put forward some tough choices, \n     some significant spending cuts so that by the middle of this \n     decade our annual spending will match our annual revenues. We \n     will not be adding more to the national debt.\n\n  It is absolutely incredible that the President could make such a \ncomment when looking at his budget. His budget takes us from $14 \ntrillion in debt to $27 trillion in debt over the next decade, almost \ndoubling the national debt. He says we are going to be living within \nour means?\n  Here is a graph. In 2010, we are at about $13.5 trillion. We see that \nover the decade we go up further, further, and down here in 2021, it is \n$26.3 trillion. This is virtually a doubling of the national debt.\n  That is why when Timothy Geithner says it is unsustainable--the \nSecretary of the Treasury appointed by President Obama--we all agree. \nSo when are we going to get spending under control? We literally have \nto quit spending money we do not have because we are bankrupting the \nvery future of America.\n  I wish to quote a few Senators from the other side of the aisle.\n  Senator Joe Manchin said:\n\n       The most powerful person in these negotiations, our \n     President, has failed to lead this debate or offer a serious \n     proposal for spending cuts.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       [The Democratic bill] utterly ignores our fiscal reality, \n     that our Nation is badly in debt and spending at absolutely \n     unsustainable and out-of-control levels. We must turn our \n     financial ship around. But the Senate proposal continues to \n     sail forward as if there is no storm on the horizon.\n\n  That is from one of our Democratic colleagues from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\n  The bill proposed by the Democratic majority fails to understand that \nthere is a fiscal crisis in this country. It is a problem of spending.\n  Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri said:\n\n       I feel strongly that the cuts are not large enough.\n\n  Senator Mark Warner said:\n\n       At some point we need to send some kind of a shock wave \n     across the Federal Government that this time we really mean \n     it.\n\n  He was talking about spending cuts. He was talking about getting \nserious about deficit reduction.\n  The House bill doesn't do enough, but at least it is headed more in \nthe right direction for getting spending under control. While I might \nnot agree with every one of the spending cuts in it, it is going in the \nright direction, and shows what we need to do as a Congress. The bill \nthe majority has put before us shows a lack of understanding as to how \nserious the deficit and the debt are as an issue for the country.\n  I wish to put this deficit reduction into some sort of context. This \nyear, the Congressional Budget Office says we will spend $1.5 trillion \nmore than we take in. That is what the deficit is this year. According \nto the President, it is over $1.6 trillion. Those are their estimates. \nThe bottom line is that we are spending about 40 cents more per dollar \nthan what we take in.\n  This graph shows the spending proposals before us. This is how much \nthe deficit is. The House bill will reduce that deficit by this tiny \nslice of the pie. The Democratic majority bill will reduce it by this \nlittle tiny slice of the pie right here. So the House bill is a small \nslice, but at least it is a larger slice than what the Democratic \nmajority has offered. The bottom line is that this is pathetic and will \ndo nothing to actually put us on a sustainable fiscal path where we can \nstart living within our means and quit spending money we do not have.\n  The House bill itself is actually a 4-percent reduction in the amount \nof money we are borrowing. If we think about it, this year, since we \nare borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar we spend, to put that in \nterms that maybe a family would understand, it would be as if a family \nmaking $60,000 a year were going to spend $100,000. Any family would \nunderstand that is unsustainable. They could not continue along that \npath. If that same family were to decrease their spending habits by the \nsame amount the Democrats have proposed, out of that $100,000, they \nwould reduce their spending habits by $168. That is all. That is how \npathetic this spending reduction is offered by the other side.\n  We have to get serious. Recently, Senator Coburn requested a General \nAccountability Office report that came back and identified over $100 \nbillion in duplicative and wasteful spending programs. This GAO report \nunderscores the negligence of the Federal Government when it comes to \nmanaging hard-earned taxpayer dollars.\n  Let me give a couple of facts from that report. It said that the \ngovernment spends $18 billion on 47 different job-training programs. \nYet the President requested another $400 million for a new program that \nwill replicate proven strategies to develop even more job-training \nprograms. Out of the 47 programs, zero are measured for effectiveness. \nYet we are going to create more instead of eliminating a lot of the \nprograms and doing the proper oversight this Congress should be doing.\n  There are 80 programs providing transportation to disadvantaged \npersons in 8 different departments. The GAO found $2 billion in costs \nfor just 29 of these programs but, with the extent of fragmentation in \nthis area, was unable to identify total costs for the other 51 \nprograms. In other words, they couldn't even identify what the total \ncosts were for these other programs. That is how messed up it is.\n  The U.S. Government also spends about $63 billion on 18 different \ndomestic food and nutrition programs and about $3 billion on 20 \nhomelessness programs. The report notes:\n\n       This can create unnecessary work for both providers and \n     applicants and may result in the use of more administrative \n     resources than needed.\n\n  Let me translate. That means we have too much bureaucracy and too \nmuch wasteful spending, so the money doesn't actually get to the people \nit is intended to help. It gets spent in the bureaucracy.\n  We also have another almost $60 billion spent on over 100 duplicated \nand fragmented surface transportation programs.\n  While I am troubled that the $61 billion from the House isn't enough \nto tackle the problem, I am astounded by what the other side of the \naisle has done. It also continues many of the wasteful programs we have \ntalked about.\n\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has come under fire. \nObviously, this morning their CEO resigned. We have seen the \ncontroversies there.\n  Their bill also spends tens of millions of dollars to help unions \norganize--overseas, not even in America. Helping unions organize \noverseas--is that what we want to be doing with American taxpayer \ndollars?\n  Today's votes are a choice between modest progress and making the \nproblem worse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The House bill needs to be the floor for what we \naccomplish out of this process. The House bill isn't nearly enough, and \nwe cannot allow this process to capture a modest improvement in the \nname of compromise by watering it down to a complete abdication of \nleadership. The stakes are too high.\n  Today, I will be reluctantly supporting H.R. 1, the House bill, which \ncuts $61 billion from last year's spending. It is a modest step in the \nright direction. The other side has put forward a proposal that should \nbe rejected out of hand because it is completely inadequate. It keeps \nus spending money we do not have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 2 minutes and for Senator Leahy to be recognized following my \nremarks for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wouldn't mind the chart from my friend \nfrom Nevada staying up because it makes my point.\n  In a few hours, the Senate will hold an up-or-down vote on H.R. 1, \nthe House Republicans' scorched earth spending proposal that counts \namong its casualties such critical priorities as border security, \ncancer research, and food safety inspectors. The House GOP proposal is \na Trojan horse, and we will not be fooled by it. It speaks in the name \nof deficit reduction, but the dirty little secret about the Republican \nspending plan is that once the dust is settled, it would only decrease \nthe deficit by $5 billion in fiscal year 2011. When we look at the CBO \nscore of the continuing resolution we are operating under and compare \nthat to the House spending bill, the difference by CBO in budget \noutlays only amounts to $5 billion in fiscal year 2011. We are talking \nabout a difference of $1.36 trillion in budget outlays under the \ncurrent CR versus $1.355 trillion in budget outlays under the \nRepublican proposal, much as the chart of my colleague from Nevada has \nshown. In other words, all of the cuts the Republicans are currently \nproposing will shave a grand total of .3 percent from the deficit.\n  Some might say it is a start, but in relation to the damage these \ncuts will do, it is a meaningless start. Their cuts to domestic \ndiscretionary spending will do nothing to create jobs or spur short-\nterm economic growth. In fact, the reverse is true. As numerous \nindependent economists point out, we will see a reduction in economic \ngrowth almost immediately if H.R. 1 is enacted, and these cuts will \nharm our ability to prepare for the future because they gut the very \npriorities we need to invest in to help our economy grow: education, \nenergy investment, technology, and infrastructure.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be given 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So if all these cuts will not improve the economy in the \nnear term and will not help economic\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n\ngrowth in the longer term and will not cut the deficit, then exactly \nwhat will they do? They will satisfy a very small but vocal segment of \nthe Republican Party. That is all.\n  So it is time for a reset. This morning I called for a reset of this \nbudget debate. I think it is important that after today's votes both \nsides in the debate take a deep collective breath. We should all take \nstock of how the discussion up to now has become distorted and seek to \nreset the terms of the debate. It may not happen tomorrow, but in the \ncoming weeks, as the negotiations led by the White House reconvene, we \nshould approach the talks with fresh eyes and a new mindset.\n  Rather than continuing the fixation on domestic discretionary cuts, \nwhich at the same time do huge damage and cut the deficit very little \njust because of the way they are spent, the next offer and counteroffer \nshould include mandatory cuts and revenue raisers such as oil royalties \ninto the mix.\n  We will only put a dent in the deficit through shared sacrifice. \nFocusing simply on domestic discretionary and even leaving out the \nmilitary will not achieve our goal of deficit reduction. Including \nmandatory cuts and revenue raisers such as oil royalties will.\n  The bottom line is this: The blame for the current breakdown in \nbudget negotiations rests with our failure to think big. A bipartisan \ncompromise simply will not be found in discretionary spending cuts \nalone. We must broaden the playing field. The solution will only come \nfrom putting other kinds of cuts, as well as revenue enhancements, on \nthe table. Doing this will also set the table for the larger budget \ndiscussions still to come.\n  I see my colleague from Vermont, so I am ready to yield the floor to \nhim.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate that. But I think what we are \ngoing to do is try to go back and forth.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, I yield the floor in any case, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. So Senator Sessions will go next. But I appreciate the \ncourtesy of the Senator from New York. I yield with the consent that I \nthen be recognized at the end of the speech of the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and congratulate him on a very successful \npatent bill that passed with an overwhelming vote. I was pleased to \nwork with him on that as a partner for 2 years when I was ranking \nmember of that committee. I think it was a good day.\n  Mr. President, we will soon be moving toward a vote on the continuing \nresolution. Apparently, there are going to be two options given to us. \nThe question I would pose to our colleagues and to the American people \nis, Do we have to do something or can we do nothing? Is nothing an \noption? That is what the Democratic proposal is--nothing, zero, nada.\n  So we had in the Budget Committee, which I am the ranking member now, \nthe testimony yesterday of Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles. Senator \nSimpson is a Republican from Wyoming, and Mr. Bowles was President \nClinton's Chief of Staff and a well-known business and Democratic \nleader.\n  This is what they told us yesterday in their written statement. Both \nof them put this in to us:\n\n       We believe that if we do not take decisive action our \n     nation faces the most predictable economic crisis in its \n     history.\n\n  They have spent months wrestling with these numbers. A majority of \nthe members voted for the reforms they proposed, and they gave a lot of \ntime and effort to it. I did not think they went far enough in some of \nthe areas. But I would say they made a real significant attempt to deal \nwith the crisis we face.\n  In their testimony yesterday they went even further. What do we mean, \na ``crisis''? We had a crisis in 2007. That put us in the deepest \nrecession we have had in decades. Greece has had a crisis. That is the \nkind of thing they are talking about. Forty percent of every dollar we \nspend is borrowed.\n  Senator Conrad, our chairman, our distinguished Democratic leader, \nasked them:\n\n       What happens, in your judgment, to the U.S., if we fail to \n     get an agreement in the range of what the commission \n     concluded is necessary?\n\n  The commission proposes a $4 trillion reduction in our deficit \nspending over the next 10 years. It should be more. That is what they \nproposed. President Obama's budget says it reduces it by $1 trillion. \nBut when the CBO scores it, they are going to find it is filled with \ngimmicks and there will not be any reduction, I predict, in the deficit \nin the Obama budget, which is disappointing. It is a do-nothing-about-\nthe-debt-problem budget.\n  So what is going to happen?\n  Mr. Bowles:\n\n       This problem is going to happen, it is a problem, we're \n     going to have to face up to, in maybe 2 years, maybe a little \n     less, maybe a little more.\n\n  Senator Simpson commented:\n\n       I think it will come before 2 years.\n\n  We are talking about a crisis.\n\n       I'm just saying at some point, I think within a year, at \n     the end of the year, if they [people who hold our debt] just \n     thought you're playing with fluff--5, 6, 7 percent of this \n     hole--they're going to say, ``I want some money for my \n     paper.'' And if there's anything money guys love, it's money. \n     And money guys, when they start losing money, panic. And let \n     me tell you they will. It won't matter what the government \n     does, they'll say I want my money, I've got a better place \n     for it. . . . Just saying for me, it won't be a year [before \n     we have a crisis].\n\n  Well, this is a serious matter. It is not a do-nothing circumstance. \nSo we have a simple choice to make today: Do we take a step, even a \nsmall step, that sends a signal to the world that we intend to take \naction to prevent the crisis, not act after a disaster hits? Or we \ncould do nothing, as the Democratic proposal does.\n  The Republican proposal will immediately lower spending by $61 \nbillion for the rest of the year. That is a reduction of about 6 \npercent of the discretionary spending budget. Most States, cities, and \ncounties in America have had bigger deductions than that, and they are \nstill here. They have not ceased to exist, and we are not going to \ncease to exist if we reduce spending 6 percent. But it will make a \ndifference. That amounts to 4 percent of the total debt. As I will show \nin a moment, it means a lot more than that.\n  The Democratic proposal proposes $6 billion, but it is clearly only a \n$4 billion reduction. That is less than a one-half-of-1-percent \nreduction in the discretionary spending budget--less than one-half of 1 \npercent.\n  Now, this $61 billion is not going to break us. The GAO recently \nfound that the government spends $8 billion on 47 different job \ntraining programs--47 different job training programs. We don't have \nany ability to save money and do more with less in this country? No \nbusiness would run the way we run the U.S. Government, and this is just \none of the typical kinds of duplication and waste that goes on in our \ngovernment.\n  We are living in a fantasy world if we think we cannot find $61 \nbillion to reduce out of more than $1 trillion in a discretionary \nbudget. Under President Obama, the discretionary spending increased 24 \npercent in the last 2 years. It has already gone up 24 percent.\n\n  What do you mean we cannot take a 6-percent reduction? We are facing \na crisis, a debt crisis. Families across the country are trimming their \nbudgets. They are doing so every day. Washington just keeps on growing \nand spending and growing.\n  We had the Education Secretary in the Budget Committee last week. \nThey propose an 11-percent increase in education spending this year. \nEnergy was in--a 9.5-percent increase this next year for energy, they \nsay. And, hold your hat, the Secretary of Transportation was in and \nproposes a 62-percent transportation budget increase.\n  So this is where we were, as shown on this chart: over $2 trillion, \nand we have jumped now to $3.7 trillion. So that is a 24-percent \nincrease. I am not making up these numbers.\n  Well, what about the deficit numbers? This year, we spend $3.7 \ntrillion, maybe $3.8 trillion. Do you want to know how much our revenue \nis this year? Mr. President, $2.2 trillion. I know this is \nunbelievable. The American people probably cannot imagine that we are \nspending $3.8 trillion and taking in $2.2 trillion, but it is true. \nForty cents of every dollar we spend is borrowed. This is why Mr. \nBowles and Mr. Simpson and every economist who has ever testified has \nsaid we are on an unsustainable path, a path that cannot be continued.\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\n  We need to take action now. This is not enough. But it is a step. I \nthink it sends a word to the world's financial markets, the bond \nvigilantes, that maybe the United States is, in fact, on the road to \ndoing something about the spending we are in.\n  Our debt will soon be larger than the economy. It will exceed 100 \npercent of GDP by the end of this fiscal year, amazingly surging our \ndebt load for the whole country. We cannot keep spending what we do not \nhave, borrowing what we cannot pay back. We cannot do this.\n  Our crushing debt burden is like an anchor dragging on our economy. \nIt slows growth. As the Rogoff and Reinhart study showed, as Secretary \nof Treasury Geithner acknowledged in the committee, it is already \nslowing our growth. He also added it is worse than that because it puts \nus at risk, as Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson say, for some sort of debt \ncrisis. It is unpredictable when and how it might occur. That is \nPresident Obama's Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Member's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So we cannot keep delaying. We cannot keep promising to \ndo something tomorrow. We have to have a vote. We will have a vote \ntoday. We need to act today. A vote for the Democratic proposal is a \nvote to do nothing. It is a vote to stay in denial. It is a vote that \nsays deficits do not matter, we can just keep on. But deficits do \nmatter. They have always mattered. They always will matter.\n  Some say you cannot make any savings from reducing discretionary \nspending. Let me show this chart because a $61 billion reduction is a \nreduction of the baseline. When you reduce the baseline, you save that \namount every year, even if you have growth in the future years. And it \nadds up. It is kind of a geometrical reduction in spending and debt \nthat we have to have, and it has been working the other way. We have \nbeen increasing dramatically. You know from your business accounting \nthat a 7-percent return on your money doubles your money in 10 years.\n  We had 24 percent the last 2 years. That is why the government is \ndoubling and quadrupling in size. But this would show, according to our \nbudget staff and the calculators, if you reduce the baseline $61 \nbillion in discretionary spending alone, it would save $862 billion in \ndeficit reduction over 10 years. If we were to freeze that baseline in \nfor just 5 years, not only would we save $860 billion, but $1.65 \ntrillion--enough money to make a real difference in one little act of \n$61 billion in the reduction of discretionary spending. We have to take \nthat step.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the help of the Senator from \nAlabama on the patent bill which passed last night. It will help us \nincrease jobs without adding anything to the deficit.\n  We made what I think was a terrible mistake when the Congress voted \nto support going to war in Iraq--I was one of the 22 who voted against \nthat war--and then voted to cut taxes and borrow the money to pay for \nthe war in Iraq. We borrowed $1 trillion to pay for a war that has not \nmade us safer. It has caused thousands of deaths of Americans and tens \nof thousands of others, and has degraded our military which will cost \nbillions to rebuild.\n  We also went into Afghanistan with the intent to catch Osama bin \nLaden, and when, according to accounts, he was surrounded, our \npersonnel were yanked out of Afghanistan and sent to Iraq, and he \nescaped into Pakistan, and $1 trillion later, we are still there. \nAgain, borrowed money for those two wars, one that went way beyond \nwhatever it was supposed to and the other one that should never have \nhappened in the first place. We also cut taxes on oil companies and \nmillionaires and everybody else. And now we have a skyrocketing \ndeficit, thanks to those mistakes.\n  Later today we will vote on H.R. 1, the House Continuing Resolution, \nand then the Senate substitute. I want to speak briefly about how the \nSenate CR compares to H.R. 1, particularly funding for the Department \nof State and Foreign Operations.\n  First, Senators should know what is in the House CR or, perhaps more \nimportantly, what is not in it.\n  It is notable that the House defines diplomacy and international \ndevelopment as non-security spending, in spite of, of course, the \nintegral part they both play protecting our security around the globe. \nIt ignores the views of Secretary of State Clinton, Secretary of \nDefense Gates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mullen, former \nChairman General Powell, General Petraeus, President Obama, former \nPresidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, and every former \nNational Security Adviser. They have all made clear that these \ninvestments do directly protect U.S. security interests, not only on \nthe front line States of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, but around \nthe world.\n  President Reagan and former Homeland Security Secretary Ridge also \nrecognized the connection between international assistance and our \nsecurity. President Reagan said:\n\n       Security assistance programs, an essential complement to \n     our defense effort, directly enhances the security of the \n     United States.\n\n  Secretary Ridge said:\n\n       The programs supported by the International Affairs Budget \n     are as essential to our national security as defense \n     programs.\n\n  Secretary Gates said:\n\n       I never miss an opportunity to call for more funding for \n     and emphasis on diplomacy and development.\n\n  There are a whole lot of other examples, from both Republican and \nDemocratic leaders, which seem to have fallen on deaf ears in the \nHouse.\n  Our Republican friends in the House should know that we cannot \ncounter the influence of al-Qaida and other violent extremists through \nmilitary force alone. They should know that helping countries such as \nSouthern Sudan rebuild after conflict, building stable democratic \ninstitutions in countries such as Egypt, preventing the trafficking of \nnuclear material and other weapons in the former Soviet Union, \neducating and providing jobs for youth who would otherwise be fodder \nfor terrorist recruiters in the Middle East, combating the corrosive \ninfluence of organized crime in Central America, preventing the spread \nof deadly viruses in Africa and Asia--viruses that are only one \nairplane ride away from the United States--or supporting NATO, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, or U.N. peacekeeping--these are all \nparts of our national security. It is the diplomats here and abroad, \nand the funds they administer, that help make U.S. leadership possible \naround the world.\n  While the House press releases claim to adequately fund operations \nand programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, that is empty \nrhetoric. Secretary Clinton has said the House CR will unacceptably \nharm U.S. interests in those countries.\n  That is only the beginning. The House CR slashes funding for refugees \nand other victims of disaster by 40 percent, at the same time Members \non the other side of the aisle are rightly urging that we help the tens \nof thousands of Libyans, Tunisians and Egyptians who have fled their \nhomes.\n  The House CR provides no funding for the Global Food Security Fund \nwhich prevents hunger and famine in Africa and Asia and improves \nAmerica's standing.\n  It eliminates funding for the Clean Technology Fund which supports \nexports of solar, wind, and other renewable energy. And by doing so it \nopens the door wider to China's exports. How shortsighted can we be? It \nis like owning a business and you have a competitor on the other side \nof town and you say, Well, we are not going to advertise. We are not \ngoing to stock our shelves. We are only going to be open a couple of \ndays a week. Gosh, I hope that competitor doesn't drive us out of \nbusiness.\n  It drastically reduces funding to operate our embassies and \nconsulates, which every American traveling, working, or studying \noverseas depends on. Every one of us as Members of Congress knows when \nan American constituent has a problem somewhere we turn to our \nembassies or our consulates to help them. H.R. 1 would slash their \nfunding.\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\n  H.R. 1 would also sharply cut funding for global health programs: \nHIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other deadly diseases--denying \nlife-saving drugs and other services to hundreds of thousands of \npeople, condemning women and children in other parts of the world to \ndeath.\n  It would renege on our treaty obligations to the U.N. and to the \ninternational financial institutions, threatening our voting shares \nwhich our competitors--including China--are eager to purchase.\n  At a time when China is rapidly expanding its influence globally, the \nHouse would have us pull back and say, you take over. You can be the \npower that other countries turn to, not the United States. Even Great \nBritain's conservative government, slashing spending left and right, is \nexempting, and even increasing, international aid, because unlike our \nRepublican friends in the House, they recognize it is a matter of \nnational security.\n  The impact of H.R. 1 is equally devastating to our domestic programs. \nFrom the social safety net to programs that maintain and expand our \ncountry's infrastructure, these programs would be slashed.\n  Numerous economists, from Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke to Mark \nZandi, recognize that the impact of H.R. 1 will be the loss of hundreds \nof thousands of jobs, at a time when our economy is beginning to \nrecover. I hear this daily from fellow Vermonters. Take, for example, \nthe mother who came into my Montpelier office a few months ago and \nexplained how the Head Start Program changed her life. Not only did \nHead Start provide a reliable, safe, educational environment for her \nchildren, it made it possible for her to pursue a college education and \nbe a strong tax-paying part of our society. But H.R. 1 would deny more \nthan 300 of Vermont's children and families these same opportunities.\n  For those unmoved by cuts to Head Start, H.R. 1 would also devastate \none of our best economic development tools: the community development \nblock grant program.\n  CDBG has a proven track record of putting people to work through \nhousing construction, public service improvement projects and downtown \nrevitalization efforts. The 62-percent cut to CDBG in H.R. 1 would \ngreatly hamper Vermont's ability to move these types of projects \nforward at a time when they are needed more than ever.\n  In the past 3 weeks I have heard from hundreds of Vermonters who rely \non the community services block grant program, which would also be \nslashed in H.R. 1. This is a program that serves 55,000 Vermonters \nwhose incomes are at or below the poverty line--some of my State's most \nvulnerable people. The impact of this cut would shutter as many as six \nof our largest food shelves, and eliminate assistance for the thousands \nof Vermonters looking for housing and heating assistance each year.\n  These are only three of the domestic programs that would be decimated \nby H.R. 1, part of a veritable laundry list of cuts that target the \nvery programs that give Americans a hand up. Very simply we are talking \nabout cutting, food, shelter, and heat, the basic necessities of life.\n  Turning again to national security, a frequently asked question is \nhow does the Senate CR compare to the fiscal year 2010 level for the \nDepartment of State and foreign operations? The answer depends on who \nyou ask.\n  In fiscal year 2010, the Department of State and foreign operations \nreceived close to $48.8 billion in regular appropriations and $4.1 \nbillion in emergency supplemental funds for these purposes in \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and Mexico. In addition, the fiscal year \n2009 emergency supplemental provided about $2 billion for fiscal year \n2010 costs related to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Israel, \nJordan, and Mexico. In other words, these programs received $54.9 \nbillion for fiscal year 2010.\n  While the Senate CR funding level is $1.38 billion or 2.8 percent \nabove the fiscal year 2010 regular appropriation for the Department of \nState and foreign operations, it is $4.75 billion or 8.7 percent below \nthe fiscal year 2010 level of $54.9 billion which supports operations \nand programs that must be continued in fiscal year 2011, a critical \nfact wholly ignored by the House.\n  Although even the Senate CR cuts funding for the Department of State \nand foreign operations by billions of dollars, rather than the slash-\nand-burn approach of the House, it does so in a manner that seeks to \nlimit the damage to our national security. Here are a few of the ways \nthe Senate CR does that.\n  Although the Senate CR cuts the State Department's operations budget \nby $606 million below the request, it provides $552 million above the \namount in H.R. 1. These funds support U.S. embassies and consulates, as \nwell as the State Department's diplomatic personnel and operations in \nAfghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq.\n  The Senate CR provides $1.5 billion for worldwide security \nprotection. Although $25 million below the request, this is $44.4 \nmillion above the amount provided in H.R. 1. This funds diplomatic \nsecurity agents, armored vehicles, and training to protect U.S. \npersonnel working in dangerous places overseas. It also, incidentally, \nprotects Members of Congress who travel abroad.\n  The Senate CR provides $625 million for educational and cultural \nexchange programs, which is $8.2 million below the request and $123.6 \nmillion above the amount provided in H.R. 1. These funds, which have \ntraditionally been strongly supported by Republicans and Democrats \nparticularly since 9/11, support exchanges between Americans and \ncitizens of other countries, including the Fulbright, International \nVisitor Leadership, and Citizen Exchange programs. The House CR would \nresult in the elimination of over 2,500 American exchanges and 8,600 \nforeign citizen exchanges.\n  The Senate CR provides $2 billion for U.S. contributions to \ninternational peacekeeping, which is $87.3 million below the request \nand $196.5 million above the amount provided in H.R. 1. These funds pay \nfor peacekeepers in the Sinai, Lebanon, Haiti, Congo, and many other \ncountries that might otherwise descend into chaos and potentially \nrequire the deployment of U.S. troops at far greater risk and expense.\n  The Senate CR provides $1.5 billion for U.S. contributions to \ninternational organizations, which is $50 million below the request and \n$28.5 million above the amount provided in H.R. 1. This funds U.S. \nmembership in the United Nations, NATO, the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, World Health Organization, and other international \norganizations that directly protect our security.\n  The Senate CR provides $39.5 million for the U.S. Institute for \nPeace, which is $7 million below the request. H.R. 1 does not include \nany funding for USIP. This funds conflict resolution and peace \nbuilding, including in Iraq, and has been supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats since Congress first established it. I ask unanimous consent \nthat an Op-ed by GEN Anthony Zinni about USIP in the March 8 New York \nTimes, entitled ``Peace-building that Pays Off,'' be printed in the \nRecord after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nExhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate CR provides $7.8 billion for global health \nprograms, which is $633 million below the request and $884 million \nabove the amount provided in H.R. 1. These funds support programs to \nprevent and treat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, polio and neglected \ntropical diseases, and to support voluntary family planning and \nreproductive health.\n  The total to combat HIV/AIDS is $5.35 billion through the Department \nof State, which is $145 million below the request and $509 million \nabove the amount provided in H.R. 1. H.R. 1 would deny life-saving HIV/\nAIDS drugs to some 400,000 people. I wonder how many House Members even \nknow that.\n  The Senate CR provides $750 million for the Global HIV/AIDS fund, \nwhich is equal to fiscal year 2010 and $150 million above the amount \nprovided in H.R. 1. At the House level, approximately 3.7 million \npeople would not be tested for HIV, more than 10 million mosquito nets \nfor malaria would not be provided, and 372,000 testing and treatments \nfor tuberculosis would be halted. Malaria, which is preventable and \ncurable, is a leading killer of African children.\n  The Senate CR provides $879 million for international disaster \nassistance, which is $449 million above the amount provided in H.R. 1. \nThese funds support aid to people displaced by war, famine\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\nand natural disasters, such as the earthquake in Haiti and floods in \nPakistan. The House would decimate our ability to respond to those \ncatastrophes. That is not the America I know.\n  Likewise, the Senate CR provides $1.68 billion for refugee \nassistance, which is equal to fiscal year 2010 and $662 million above \nthe amount provided in H.R. 1. At a time when the number of refugees \nand other displaced persons in the Middle East, North Africa, and \nPakistan is skyrocketing, and protracted refugee crises exist from \nBurma to Iraq, the House would turn its back on these people.\n  There are many other examples. The point should be lost on no one. \nThe House CR would cause lasting, unprecedented damage to our global \nleadership and our security, and cost thousands of American jobs, at \nthe same time that it would have no appreciable impact on the deficit.\n  The amounts in the House CR or the Senate CR represent only 1 percent \nof the Federal budget, but it is a critical investment in our security \nthat the House treats as a luxury we can do without. I challenge them \nto find a single current or former President, Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary of State, National Security Advisor, or, frankly, anyone with \nexpertise in this area--Republican or Democrat--who would agree with \nthat shortsighted, dangerous view.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 7, 2011]\n\n                      Peace-Building That Pays Off\n\n                         (By Anthony C. Zinni)\n\n       Williamsburg, Va.--In voting last month to eliminate \n     financing for the United States Institute of Peace, members \n     of the House of Representatives did not do their research. \n     You will find the institute's competent work behind \n     practically every American success in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n     It has undertaken missions from the Balkans and Sudan to the \n     Philippines and Somalia, where I supported the institute's \n     efforts to mediate conflicts, promote the rule of law and \n     encourage democracy.\n       This week, as the Senate considers alternatives to the \n     House budget bill, we should remember that the stakes for \n     national security and peace-building are high. The institute \n     was created in 1984, when the cold war was still at its \n     height. Congressional leaders guided by Senator Spark M. \n     Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, saw the need for an institution \n     that would strengthen the nation's ability to limit \n     international violence and manage global conflict. President \n     Ronald Reagan signed the act creating the institute. A \n     bipartisan majority of Congress has supported it since--until \n     now.\n       The Institute of Peace is like the Marine Corps or special \n     forces for foreign affairs and peace building. When others \n     are fleeing conflict around the world, you'll usually find \n     institute staff members going in. They were working in \n     Afghanistan before 9/11 and were among the first nonmilitary \n     personnel on the ground after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \n     The institute's headquarters in Baghdad has twice been \n     damaged by rocket and mortar attacks. At the height of the \n     Iraq insurgency, when virtually every other American and \n     international group pulled out their personnel, the State and \n     Defense Departments requested that the institute stay. Under \n     fire regularly, it was the only United States organization \n     outside of those departments that did not flee Baghdad.\n       But the institute's value goes beyond the bravery and \n     commitment of its staff. In 2007, when the Army's loth \n     Mountain Division arrived in Mahmudiya, a city of half a \n     million in the ``triangle of death'' dominated by Al Qaeda \n     south of Baghdad, officers asked the institute to mediate \n     between Shiite civil authorities and the Sunni sheiks who \n     controlled the area. Institute-trained negotiators convened \n     warring Iraqis to consolidate security, restore services, \n     develop the local economy, enhance local governance and \n     improve the rule of law. Gen. David H. Petraeus called it a \n     turning point in the war.\n       In the six months before the institute's intervention, \n     there had been 93 attacks on American forces in the area with \n     homemade bombs; in the six months after, just one. Mahmudiya \n     became a cornerstone of peace in the district, allowing the \n     Army to reduce its strength from a brigade combat team of \n     3,500 soldiers to a battalion of 650, with corresponding \n     savings and reductions in casualties.\n       In Afghanistan, the institute conducts mediations on issues \n     from refugees to property and water disputes. In the last \n     year, these operations have resolved 18 tribal disputes \n     throughout the country, mostly involving the abuse of women, \n     and included 30 training programs for government officials, \n     lawyers, mullahs, tribal councils and community leaders. The \n     network is even supporting dialogue along the Afghanistan-\n     Pakistan border, the earth's most dangerous frontier--home to \n     Taliban and Qaeda attacks and a wellspring of religious and \n     political extremism.\n       Congress would be hard-pressed to find an agency that does \n     more with less. The institute's entire budget would not pay \n     for the Afghan war for three hours, is less than the cost of \n     a fighter plane, and wouldn't sustain even 40 American troops \n     in Afghanistan for a year. Within the budget, peace-building \n     is financed as part of national security programs, and is \n     recognized as an important adjunct to conventional defense \n     spending and diplomacy. The institute's share of the proposed \n     international affairs budget, $43 million, is minuscule: less \n     than one-tenth of 1 percent of the State Department's budget, \n     and one-hundredth of 1 percent of the Pentagon's.\n       The idea that eliminating the United States Institute of \n     Peace would benefit taxpayers is extremely shortsighted and \n     ill informed. America deserves better from Congress than \n     eliminating something that saves American lives and taxpayer \n     dollars.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the damage \nthat would be done if H.R. 1 were to become law, and specifically to \ntalk about a few areas I have been paying particular attention to: \nscience and technology, for one, particularly related to energy policy; \nsecond, border security and law enforcement; as well as education.\n  To me, this is not a question of whether there should be cuts in our \nFederal budget. Clearly, there should be cuts. But the real issue here \nis whether we should be smart about where we make those cuts. To me, it \nis clear that H.R. 1 does not represent smart policy about where to \nmake those cuts. It represents a plan to mindlessly cut funding during \nthe remaining 5 months of the current fiscal year in order to send some \nkind of message to the world that we are serious about deficit \nreduction. In my view, H.R. 1 sends a message, but it is not the right \nmessage. The message it sends is that we, in fact, are not willing to \nlook at serious deficit reduction at this point.\n  The first area of cuts I wish to talk about contained in H.R. 1 that \nwill severely impact our Nation for years to come and have an effect on \nhow many jobs we can actually create is the area of science and energy \ninnovation. Last December, this Congress passed a reauthorization of \nwhat we call the America COMPETES Act. I was very privileged to work, \nparticularly with my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, on \nhelping to get that legislation enacted. Its purpose was to authorize \nfunding for the Department of Energy's Office of Science, for the \nNational Science Foundation, and for the National Institutes of \nStandards and Technology for the next 3 years so that by fiscal year \n2016, we would have completed a 10-year doubling of the funding for \nthose agencies. I wish to note that this effort was first started \nduring the Bush administration. It has been carried forward during this \ncurrent administration under President Obama. The effort has enjoyed \nstrong bipartisan support and garnered endorsements from leading \nindustry groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business \nRoundtable, and the Council on Competitiveness. These organizations \nrecognize that the future of our Nation depends on the strong \nscientific backbone we need for our workforce in order to out-innovate \nour competitors around the world. So it comes as a surprise to me to \nsee large cuts being proposed by the House of Representatives in their \nfiscal year 2011 funding bill to the very programs that all of us \nseemed to agree are needed to keep us competitive in the years ahead.\n  What cuts am I talking about? Let me give one example. The Office of \nScience is the Nation's largest supporter of the physical sciences, and \nthese are the very areas by which we intend to supply a new stream of \nscientists and engineers to companies such as Intel, Ford Motor \nCompany, and others. The House bill proposes to cut the Office of \nScience budget by $1.1 billion or 22 percent. The result is an \nestimated reduction of 4,500 full-time scientists and engineers working \non basic endeavors in the area of energy science. It will terminate the \nEarly Career Research Program for young faculty and ongoing graduate \nprograms in the energy sciences. National user facilities that the \nOffice of Science runs for upward of 27,000 researchers from industry \nand academia will be shuttered or put into a standby status. This\n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\nincludes the four nanoscience centers across the United States, which \nhave had breakthrough discoveries to propel our industries forward in \nthe areas of solid-state lighting, new drugs, and microelectronics.\n  Let me talk about some of the other programs impacted in the \nDepartment of Energy. The Office of Nuclear Energy, which is leading \nthe way to a new generation of smaller, less costly reactors at places \nsuch as Oak Ridge and Idaho National Laboratories, will suffer. The \nability to move this bipartisan program forward will cease.\n  In the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy--EER, as it \nis referred to in the Department--the House bill will result in over \n31,000 homes that will not be weatherized, and by July 1, it is \nestimated that something like 8,000 people who are expected to perform \nthis work will be out of jobs. The program to mix coal with biomass, \nwhich shows great promise, will be eliminated, as will programs to fund \noffshore wind.\n  Let me cite some other examples of the damage that the House bill \nwill have on other agencies in the COMPETES Act.\n  The National Science Foundation will have reductions leading to a \nloss of 10,000 university researchers and graduate students. Being so \nlate in the year--and I indicated we have about 5 months left in this \nfiscal year--it will reduce the program to train teachers in math and \nscience by 53 percent, at a time when it is widely recognized that \nother nations are outperforming us in student test scores in these \nsubjects.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Task Force on\n\n\n                                          American Innovation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: Most of the undersigned \n     organizations signed a November 5, 2010 letter to you in \n     support of the reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act. \n     We applaud the Senate for engaging in the hard work that was \n     necessary to achieve a bipartisan majority to enact that \n     legislation in the previous Congress.\n       Today, we write to urge you to continue to support the \n     goals of the COMPETES legislation. As the Senate considers \n     legislation to complete Fiscal Year 2011 appropriations, we \n     ask that you and your colleagues reject the cuts adopted by \n     the House that would significantly reduce funding for the key \n     research agencies, including the National Science Foundation \n     (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, and \n     the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well \n     as science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) \n     education programs contained in that law.\n       While we recognize that Congress faces a major challenge to \n     reduce federal budget deficits and bring the national debt \n     under control, it is critical that these cuts be implemented \n     strategically, with an eye toward the future economic health \n     of the U.S. As many of us wrote to you last year, continued \n     strong funding of basic scientific research and STEM \n     education programs would help ensure the economic growth \n     needed to restore long-term fiscal strength and national \n     prosperity. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility \n     and Reform, headed by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, said \n     it well:\n       Cut and invest to promote economic growth and keep America \n     competitive. We should cut red tape and unproductive \n     government spending that hinders job creation and growth. At \n     the same time, we must invest in education, infrastructure, \n     and high-value research and development to help our economy \n     grow, keep us globally competitive, and make it easier for \n     businesses to create jobs.\n       Despite this recommendation, the House has passed a \n     continuing resolution for FY2011 (H.R. 1) that takes the \n     opposite approach to research and STEM education. It would \n     make deep cuts to the NSF, DOE Office of Science, NIST core \n     programs, and other science agencies which would have a \n     devastating impact, magnified by being crowded into the less \n     than seven months remaining in the fiscal year.\n       For example, reducing funding for the DOE Office of Science \n     by $886 million, or 18 percent below fiscal year 2010, during \n     the last seven months of the fiscal year--an effective 31-\n     percent reduction over the seven-month period--would \n     adversely impact world-class scientific facilities, basic \n     research of national importance, and some of the nation's \n     best scientific and engineering talent. Virtually all DOE \n     national laboratory user facilities--which the federal \n     government built at tremendous expense--would cease \n     operations, affecting some 26,000 scientists and engineers \n     from universities, industry, and government who rely on these \n     unique, complex facilities to conduct their research. The DOE \n     national laboratories would also be forced to furlough or \n     layoff thousands of workers, including highly-skilled \n     research staff and blue-collar workers. Finally, the H.R. 1 \n     reduction would slow or bring to a halt the ongoing \n     construction of a number of advanced research facilities \n     aimed at keeping the United States at the technological \n     forefront and American industry from moving research and \n     development activities abroad, leading to the layoff of \n     thousands of construction workers and ultimately increasing \n     construction costs.\n       At NSF, the 5.2-percent overall cut (an effective 8.9 \n     percent over the last 7 months) would mean that 10,000 fewer \n     university researchers would receive support for critical \n     research and education. The 16.4 percent cut to vital STEM \n     education programs embedded in the 5.2 percent overall NSF \n     cut would in reality amount to a 28.1 percent reduction \n     during the last 7 months of the fiscal year. A reduction of \n     53.3% in funding for major construction projects focused on \n     developing advanced sensor networks of ocean and terrestrial \n     observatories would likely lead to schedule delays and cost \n     increases in future years, and severely jeopardize the jobs \n     of roughly 200-300 scientists, engineers, and technical \n     personnel. At a time when our nation desperately needs to \n     enhance its technological workforce, these reductions are \n     seriously counterproductive.\n       The proposed cut to NIST would require the agency to cut \n     support for contractors by 25% since savings from layoffs \n     could not be achieved in the current year. Contractors at \n     NIST play a critical role in many areas, including \n     cybersecurity research efforts, development of standards for \n     the Smart Grid, and the upgrade, maintenance, and \n     construction of NIST facilities. The cut to the Technology \n     Innovation Program would mean no new awards in the current \n     fiscal year; these would be concentrated in areas of national \n     need such as advanced solutions to repairing, inspecting, and \n     monitoring the nation's infrastructure system and efforts to \n     remove critical bottlenecks in current manufacturing \n     processes that impede U.S. competitiveness.\n       Congress took a very important step for our nation's future \n     by reauthorizing the America COMPETES Act in 2010, \n     reaffirming its commitment to the science and \n     innovation essential to long-term economic growth. We urge \n     you now to continue implementation funding and to reject \n     the cuts to research and STEM education adopted by the \n     House in H.R. 1.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Task Force on American Innovation;

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: As the Senate \n     begins consideration of a continuing resolution to fund the \n     federal government through the remainder of the current \n     fiscal year, we want to express our concern with severe cuts \n     being proposed to small but critical portions of the federal \n     research budget that drive economic growth. Robust growth \n     generates jobs, replacing benefit payments to struggling \n     families with receipts that accrue from prospering families. \n     A growing economy will reduce the severity of spending cuts \n     or tax increases necessary to bring our national finances \n     back to a sustainable trajectory.\n       The Council's 2005 Innovate America report urged that \n     America reverse a precipitous decline in physical science \n     research funding as a share of our economy. The report also \n     advocated improving the number and performance of students in \n     science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) \n     disciplines. Scientific research and skilled workers are the \n     basis for new ideas, new technologies, new products and \n     services, new companies, even entirely new industries. The \n     American economy cannot compete and grow if we neglect our \n     capacity to innovate.\n       Federal investments in these areas are necessary and \n     affordable, yet current proposals being considered by \n     Congress would reduce the budgets of the National Science \n     Foundation, the Department of Energy Office of Science, and \n     the core accounts of the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology. The cuts would be severe to each agency, but \n     merely symbolic in the context of the larger fiscal \n     challenge. The combined cuts would save 0.039 percent from \n     the FY 2011 budget proposed by the President, but would set \n     back important research, shut down key facilities, and \n     exacerbate the supply and development of skilled STEM \n     professionals.\n       Cuts to the Office of Science could endanger America's \n     leadership in areas like High Performance Computing, which \n     hold the potential for groundbreaking discoveries and game \n     changing industries. How to make greater use of this \n     comparative advantage we hold in the global economy should be \n     our focus.\n       While no program (including entitlement programs), \n     department or agency should be off the table in the debate as \n     to how to bring our nation's fiscal house in order, we urge \n     you to consider the negative implications of cuts to research \n     at a time when competing nations are investing heavily in \n     their innovation future.\n           Sincerely,\n     Samuel R. Allen,\n       Chairman and CEO, Deere & Company.\n     Michael R. Splinter,\n       Chairman and CEO, Applied Materials, Inc.\n     William P. Hite,\n       General President, United Association of Plumbers and \n     Pipefitters.\n     Charles O. Holliday, Jr.,\n       Chairman Bank of America.\n     Deborah L. Wince-Smith,\n       President and CEO, Council on Competitiveness.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The first letter is by the Council on Competitiveness, \nsigned by Sam Allen, chairman and CEO of the Deere Company; Mike \nSplinter, chairman and CEO of Applied Materials; Chad Holliday, \nchairman of the Bank of America; William Hite, general president of the \nUnited Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters; Deborah Wince-Smith, \npresident and CEO of the Council. That letter succinctly states that:\n\n       Scientific research and skilled workers are the basis for \n     new ideas, new technologies, new products and services, new \n     companies, even entirely new industries. The American economy \n     cannot compete and grow if we neglect our capacity to \n     innovate.\n\n  The other letter, from 175 universities, industries, and \nlaboratories, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, supports the \ngoals outlined in the America COMPETES Act and asks this Chamber to \nreject the cuts adopted by the House funding bill. This letter states \nthat:\n\n       Congress took a very important step for our Nation's future \n     by reauthorizing the America COMPETES Act in 2010, \n     reaffirming its commitment to the science and innovation \n     essential to long-term economic growth. We urge you to \n     continue implementation funding and to reject the cuts to \n     research and STEM education adopted by the House in H.R. 1.\n\n  I will move to the issue of homeland security. Over the last several \nyears, we have heard a lot of speeches in the Senate about the need to \nbolster border security, particularly along the southern border, and \nenhance homeland security capabilities. Unfortunately, the budget the \nHouse has presented falls short in this respect.\n  The continuing resolution would severely impact the capabilities of \nthe Department of Homeland Security and reduce essential assistance \nthat is provided to organizations at the State and local level. This \nlegislation would be a step back in terms of the progress we are making \nin securing our border and ensuring that communities and law \nenforcement agencies along the border have the necessary resources to \nhandle crime and to respond to disasters.\n  With regard to border security, the House continuing resolution would \nreduce planned technological, fencing, and security improvements along \nthe southwest border. The legislation would reduce interoperable \ncommunication capabilities, and it would cut tactical communications \nmodernization efforts by 50 percent, making it more difficult for law \nenforcement to respond to emergencies in a timely way.\n  The House bill would also provide funding for 20,500 Border Patrol \nagents, rather than the 21,370 the Senate is proposing to fund. This \ncutback in Border Patrol agents, I think, is shortsighted.\n  The measure would also severely impact aviation security initiatives. \nThe number of advanced imaging technology screening machines, canine \nteams, and explosive detection machines would also be slashed by over \n50 percent.\n  FEMA grants that help State and local governments respond to and \nprepare for disasters would be reduced by about 20 percent.\n  The House bill would drastically cut back on DHS's cyber security \nplans--cyber security coverage of the Federal civilian networks would \nbe reduced from about 30 percent to 12 percent.\n  And with respect to the DHS science and technology directorate, the \nCR would reduce funding for research and\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\ndevelopment by about $600 million--which would mean the elimination of \nentire research areas, such as border security and cyber security, and \nthe significant reduction in nuclear and explosives research and \nfunding for projects at DOE national laboratories--including a \npotential reduction of $60 to $80 million for New Mexico's labs. It is \ncritical that we make the investments in research and development now \nto ensure we stay ahead of emerging security threats.\n  The House CR also drastically cuts DOJ State and local law \nenforcement assistance programs that are critical in keeping our \ncommunities safe and preventing crime.\n  State and locals law enforcement grants are cut by 37 percent and \njuvenile justice programs are reduced by 45 percent. The bill also \neliminates funding for the Weed and Seed Program and reduces the COPS \nProgram by 25 percent--the Republican plan originally called for \ncompletely eliminating the COPS hiring program, which has been \ninstrumental in keeping police officers in communities across New \nMexico, but Democratic efforts in the House to restore the funding were \nsuccessful. The proposed cuts to the Byrne law enforcement grant \nprogram would also result in a $1 million drop in assistance coming to \nNew Mexico.\n  With respect to education, H.R. 1 contains draconian cuts that would \nlimit opportunities for millions of Americans of all ages and \neducational levels. It would cut Federal education spending by $11.55 \nbillion, or 16.1 percent. This would be, if approved, the largest \neducation cut in history.\n  H.R. 1 would cut Head Start by $1.1 billion--15 percent--resulting \nabout 2,000 fewer children in New Mexico receiving early childhood \neducation services that prepare them for success in school.\n  It would cut title I, which provides academic support to \ndisadvantaged students in public schools, by $693 million. It would \nalso cut the Pell grant maximum award by $845, or 15.2 percent. Mr. \nPresident, 57,402 New Mexican students received Pell grants in the \n2009-10 academic year, and more are expected to be eligible in coming \nyears. Many low- and moderate-income students in New Mexico would find \ncollege less affordable and less accessible under H.R. 1.\n  These House-passed education cuts would devastate New Mexico's public \neducation system, which is already facing severe State budget cuts. And \nthey would limit our country's future economic competitiveness and \nsecurity.\n  In contrast, the proposed Senate Democratic year-long continuing \nresolution proposal provides stability in Federal education \ninvestments. It maintains the Pell grant maximum award while providing \nmodest increases for title I grants, Head Start, and other critical \nFederal education programs. In today's fiscal climate, H.R. 1's drastic \ncuts to education investments are irresponsible and would have dire \nconsequences for New Mexico and the country.\n  It is not a question of whether there should be cuts--but whether we \nshould be smart about where we make the cuts.\n  To me it is clear that H.R. 1 does not represent smart policy about \nwhere to make these cuts. It represents a plan to mindlessly cut \nfunding in the remaining 5 months of the current fiscal year in order \nto send a ``message'' to the world that we are serious.\n  In my view H.R. 1 sends a message but not the right one.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of a letter from \na coalition of corporations and businesses be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Tapping America's Potential,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: We write to you as \n     companies and business organizations that understand the \n     challenge Congress faces to reduce federal budget deficits \n     and bring the national debt under control.\n       We are well aware that every constituency will plead its \n     case to be spared as you make difficult decisions. However, \n     we believe that leaders set priorities that are in the \n     national interest and determine where the federal \n     government's support is essential for U.S. competitiveness, \n     economic expansion and job growth. The private sector is \n     doing its part to ensure that the U.S. remains the world's \n     scientific and technological leader. Even in the midst of \n     recessions, when revenues are in decline, U.S. businesses \n     invest in research and development (R) because those \n     activities support future sales and market leadership. \n     American business largely preserved its R intensity \n     throughout the deep economic downturn of 2008-2009.\n       The private sector cannot replace, however, the federal \n     support for basic science and engineering research and math \n     and science education that undergirds America's national \n     economic competitiveness. Because these investments are the \n     key to future productivity growth, they must remain a top \n     national priority, even while deficit spending is reduced.\n       The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and \n     Reform, headed by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, said it \n     well:\n       ``Cut and invest to promote economic growth and keep \n     America competitive. We should cut red tape and unproductive \n     government spending that hinders job creation and growth. At \n     the same time, we must invest in education, infrastructure, \n     and high-value research and development to help our economy \n     grow, keep us globally competitive, and make it easier for \n     businesses to create jobs.''\n       That is why we supported passage of the America COMPETES \n     Act in 2007 and its reauthorization in 2010. COMPETES \n     addressed a serious national problem and began to reverse \n     nearly twenty years of flat funding, as a fraction of \n     national output, for federal innovation investments. We \n     applaud the Senate for engaging in the hard work that was \n     necessary to achieve a bipartisan majority to enact that \n     legislation in the previous Congress.\n       Even in the context of reducing overall government \n     spending, you have an opportunity to reaffirm that commitment \n     and continue to support the goals of the COMPETES \n     legislation. As the Senate completes Fiscal Year 2011 \n     appropriations, we ask that you put a priority on funding for \n     the key agencies that support basic scientific research in \n     the physical sciences and engineering, including the National \n     Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE) \n     Office of Science, and the National Institute of Standards \n     and Technology, as well as science, technology, engineering, \n     and math (STEM) education programs contained in the law.\n       As Congress determines the budget for world-class \n     scientific facilities in the U.S., basic research of national \n     importance, and some of the nation's best scientific and \n     engineering brainpower, our greatest concern is the message \n     that is communicated about America's commitment to sustaining \n     its leadership position in science and innovation. Recent \n     trends indicate that without sustained investment in basic \n     scientific research and developing U.S. STEM talent, America \n     is on a path to ceding our premiere position to international \n     competitors.\n       In this resource constrained environment, we urge the \n     Senate to prioritize and support strong funding of basic \n     scientific research and STEM education programs. They are \n     essential to U.S. innovation, which in turn produces the \n     economic growth needed to restore long-term fiscal strength \n     and national prosperity.\n           Sincerely,\n         Accenture; Advanced Micro Devices; Aerospace Industries \n           Association; Altera Corporation; American Council on \n           International Personnel; A Plus Education Partnership \n           (Alabama); ArvinMeritor; Avery Dennison; Battelle; \n           Bechtel Corporation; The Boeing Company; Business \n           Coalition for Educational Excellence at the New Jersey \n           Chamber of Commerce; The Business Council of New York \n           State; The Business-Higher Education Forum; Business \n           Roundtable; California Business for Education \n           Excellence; CEO Council for Growth (Greater \n           Philadelphia); CH2M Hill; Cognizant Technology \n           Solutions; Colorado Succeeds; Connecticut Business & \n           Industry Association, Education Foundation; Corporate \n           Voices for Working Families; The Dow Chemical Company; \n           DuPont Company; Eastman Chemical Company; Eaton \n           Corporation; Florida Council of 100, Inc.; Freescale \n           Semiconductor Inc.; GLOBALFOUNDRIES; Harris \n           Corporation; Illinois Business Roundtable; Iowa \n           Business Council; Johnson City/Jonesborough/Washington \n           County TN Chamber of Commerce; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; \n           Macy's, Inc.; Mass Insight Education and Research \n           Institute; Massachusetts Business Roundtable; The \n           McGraw-Hill Companies; Medtronic; Micron Technology; \n           Microsoft; Minority Business Roundtable; Motorola \n           Solutions, Inc.; National Gypsum Company; NDIA; Nevada \n           Manufacturers Association; New Mexico Business \n           Roundtable; Nucor Corporation; Ohio Business \n           Roundtable; ON Semiconductor Corporation; Oracle; Owens \n           Corning; Partnership for Learning (Washington); \n           Partnership for New York City; Pennsylvania Business \n           Council; The Procter & Gamble Company; Qualcomm; \n           Rockwell Automation; RR Donnelley; SAP America, Inc.; \n           Semiconductor Equipment and\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\n           Materials International; Semiconductor Industry \n           Association; Semiconductor Research Corporation; \n           Siemens Corporation; Software & Information Industry \n           Association; State Farm; Technology CEO Council; \n           Tennessee Business Roundtable; Texas Instruments \n           Incorporated; Time Warner Cable; Washington Roundtable.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President in a few hours, this body will vote.\n  This is a solemn responsibility, one not to be taken lightly.\n  At Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln reminded Americans that those who died \non that battlefield fought for government of the people, by the people, \nand for the people.\n  We are only here because the people, our constituents, sent us here. \nAnd every time we vote, we represent them. We represent their \naspirations. We represent the dreams of growing families and \nentrepreneurs. We represent the interests of taxpayers.\n  Of course, not all votes are created equal. Some are more important \nthan others. And in my view, the votes that we are taking today are \ntranscendent. They are quite literally about the future of this \ncountry.\n  Are we going to be a country with a constitutionally limited \ngovernment; are we going to be a country that limits the burden of \ntaxation on individuals and families and businesses; or are we going to \nbecome Europe?\n  Are we going to move toward a full-blown cradle-to-grave nanny \ngovernment with the majority of Americans on the public dole and a \nsmall group of individuals bankrolling an ever expanding leviathan \nstate?\n  In short, are we going to remain America--a beacon of freedom to the \nworld or do we aspire to become a second European Union with high \ntaxes, high spending, and measly economic growth?\n  Again, I remind you that we represent the aspirations of our \nconstituents.\n  I represent the people of Utah. And I can tell you that they do not \nwake up in the morning and say--You know what--America would be much \nbetter if we were more like France.\n  This is no exaggeration.\n  Right now government spending is at 25 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. And if we do nothing, that number is just going to grow, \npushing past 25 and cruising toward 28 percent of GDP. The last time we \ndid that was during World War II.\n  Republicans and Democrats have very different ideas about how to \naddress this spike in spending.\n  Either we can step off the pedal, hit the brakes, and bring spending \nback in line with historical levels--levels that respect our \nConstitution of limited government and respect taxpaying citizens or we \ncan keep the car on cruise control and drive the car off the cliff.\n  Republicans want to hit the brakes.\n  Democrats want to pull a Thelma and Louise with our economy.\n  I, for one, am not going to sit back and let them do this. Let's be \nclear about what the Democrats and Republicans are proposing.\n  H.R. 1, the bill that passed the House, appropriates $1.026 trillion \nin nonemergency discretionary spending.\n  The alternative offered up by my Democratic colleagues would \nappropriate, $1.079 trillion in total nonemergency discretionary \nspending.\n  H.R. 1, the bill passed by the new Republican majority in the House--\na majority that most closely represents the views of millions of \nAmericans who are genuinely scared about our Nation's fiscal \ntrajectory--would reduce spending by $57 billion over the current \ncontinuing resolution.\n  The Democratic alternative would reduce spending by just $4.7 \nbillion.\n  You will hear Democrats complain about the draconian cuts in the \nHouse-passed H.R. 1.\n  This is nonsense.\n  The fact is, when you look at Federal nonemergency discretionary \nspending as a whole--which has exploded under Democrats' control of \nCongress and with President Obama's acquiescence in their big spending \nways--H.R. 1 provides modest cuts.\n  The people of Utah, and the people of this country, understand this.\n  So now that Republicans are winning the game on spending cuts, \nDemocrats are seeking to move the goal posts.\n  It is now being suggested that we can bridge the gap between these \ntwo bills by going after entitlements and tax expenditures.\n  Don't get me wrong, we need to address both. But I can tell the \nMembers on the other side now that we are not going to let you shift \nthe debate.\n  This is a debate about discretionary spending. This is a debate about \nlow-hanging fruit.\n  Last week, the Government Accountability Office issued a report \ndetailing possibly hundreds of billions of dollars in government waste \nand bloat.\n  There is plenty of fat to be cut in the discretionary budget, and \ndoing so would give our constituents and Members of Congress the \ncourage to go after bigger fish.\n  Yet, Democrats can't find it in themselves to cut an additional $50 \nbillion when nonemergency discretionary spending is well over $1 \ntrillion.\n  Some are now proposing that we get into tax expenditures. Tax \nexpenditures are a debate for another time.\n  Nondefense discretionary spending has grown by 24 percent over the \nlast couple of years. We can cut that back significantly. We need to do \nso, and Americans understand that going back to 2008 spending levels is \nnot the end of the world.\n  I also want to correct the record with respect to H.R. 1 and Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Yesterday, Secretary Sebelius sent a letter to my colleague, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, suggesting that H.R. \n1 would have a detrimental impact on Medicare Advantage.\n  This assertion is Orwellian. The Secretary knows full well that \nObamaCare cuts more than $200 billion from an MA program that currently \nserves nearly 12 million seniors. According to the administration's own \nChief Actuary, these devastating cuts will reduce enrollment in this \npopular program by 50 percent. Furthermore, the CBO has also found that \nthese cuts would reduce important benefits by 50 percent for seniors \nenrolled in the program.\n  H.R. 1 is intended to halt the harmful cuts to seniors in the MA \nprogram.\n  Suggesting otherwise, as the Secretary did, is both inaccurate and \nrisks confusing millions of seniors.\n  H.R. 1 is a good bill. It is solid and responsible. And I will be \nsupporting it. But it is only a starting point.\n  The fact is, we are going to need many more cuts in discretionary \nspending.\n  The American people--the people who sent us here--have not signed on \nto the Democrats' project of Europeanizing the United States economy.\n  Citizens in every State want to roll back spending, reduce the tax \nburden on families and businesses, and--restore America's promise of \nopportunity and economic growth.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to get with the \nprogram. We will be cutting spending. And we need to cut a lot of it. \nIt may not all happen in the next 2 years.\n  The American people might need to speak again and send people to \nWashington in 2012 who will accurately represent their interests.\n  This is a big vote today. And when we look back, I think Americans \nwill say: It was just a beginning.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I used to be a Governor. I sometimes say I \nused to be somebody. As Governor, you had to propose budgets, you had \nto balance budgets, and you had to work with the legislature. I \nfollowed Mike Castle, and he followed Pete DuPont. We focused very hard \non fiscal responsibility. During the 8 years I was Governor, we had \neight balanced budgets in a row. For 7 years, we cut taxes. A couple of \nyears, we actually paid down some debt. We ended up with a triple-A \ncredit rating for the first time in the history of the State of \nDelaware. So I\n\n[[Page S1475]]\n\nfeel as though I know something about this issue. So do a number of my \ncolleagues.\n  We are having a lot of debate, as we should, over what our spending \nplans are going to be in this continuing resolution to fund the \ngovernment for another 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 months. That is well and \ngood and important. We need to get started and demonstrate that we are \nable to reduce this deficit and reduce our debt. We need to keep in \nmind that while what we do in the next 6 months is important, what is \nreally important is what we do in the next 6 years and beyond that.\n  We had a commission put together that a bunch of us supported. We \ncreated the deficit reduction commission, chaired by Erskine Bowles and \nAlan Simpson. They gave us a pretty good roadmap of how to get to a \nmore fiscally responsible place in the next few years, cutting some $4 \ntrillion out of the budget deficit. What they said is that pretty much \neverything needs to be on the table--domestic spending, defense \nspending, entitlement programs, tax expenditures, tax credits, tax \ndeductions, tax rates. They have suggested a proposal that cuts the \ndeficit by $4 trillion over 10 years, about two-thirds of that on the \nspending side and maybe one-third or so on the revenue side. I think it \nis a pretty good approach, and I commend the 18 members of the \ncommission who endorsed that approach.\n  One of my core values is, everything I do, I know I can do better. I \nthink the same is true of all my colleagues. Frankly, the same is true \nof Federal programs. What we need to do is to replace what a lot of \npeople think we have in Washington--a culture of spendthrift--and we \nneed to replace it with a culture of thrift. We need to look in every \nnook and cranny of the Federal Government and all programs and say: Can \nwe get better results for less money or can we get a better result by \nat least not spending more money? Partnering with the General \nAccountability Office, GAO, OMB, with all the inspectors general, with \nnonprofit groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste, what can we \ndo to get better results for less money? That is part of what we need \nto do long term. We still will have tough decisions, but at the end of \nthe day, we need to save some money, carve out some money. If we have \nto spend an extra dollar or two, where should we invest that money?\n  There is a guy named John Chambers, whom the Presiding Officer knows, \nand some of us met with him earlier today. He is CEO of Cisco, a big \ntechnology company. He likes to say that there are two things we need \nto do if we are to be successful as a nation, with a 21st-century \neconomy: No. 1, invest in people so we have the most productive \nworkforce, smart workers, whether postdocs or people with high school \ndegrees--productive workforce; No. 2, invest in our infrastructure.\n  Last year, the transportation infrastructure in this country got a D \nas in ``delta''--not good--a D as in ``dumb.'' That is where our \ninfrastructure is in this country. We need to invest in our \ninfrastructure, not just roads, highways, bridges, rails, and ports, \nbut broadband, water, wastewater--broadly defined infrastructure.\n  The third thing we need to do is invest in research and development \nso we can continue to be an innovation economy. The President said that \nif we are going to be successful in the 21st century, we need to \nouteducate, outinnovate, outcompete the rest of the world.\n  We need to invest in our workforce, our very young kids and folks who \nare off to college and postsecondary training.\n  We also need to invest in our infrastructure, not just roads, \nhighways, bridges, and rails, but infrastructure described broadly.\n  Finally, we need to invest in R so we can invest and outcompete the \nbest of the world.\n  At the end of the day, we have to create what I call a nurturing \nenvironment for job creation, for job preservation. We need a nurturing \nenvironment. Part of that is our obligation working with the private \nsector and others, States and local governments across the country.\n  Right now, our debt as a percentage of GDP has climbed to 65 percent, \nI am told. Sixty-five percent--our debt as a percentage of GDP. The \nlast time it was that high was at the end of World War II. It is the \nonly time it has been that high--65 percent. Other countries getting \ninto that kind of territory are Greece and Ireland. That is not smart. \nThey found out the hard way. We need to learn from them, and this is \nthe time to do it. It requires all of us to stand and do what we know \nwe need to do, to share in the sacrifice, with everything on the table. \nLet's use the deficit commission as a good role model. Let's ask the \nexecutive branch to provide the leadership they need to provide.\n  I think my time has expired, Mr. President. I note the presence of \nthe Senator from Kentucky so he can take the floor as my time has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we are discussing and debating two different \nalternatives--one from the other side of the aisle and one from our \nside--about what we should do about the budget deficit. We have a \nprojected $1.65 trillion deficit in the next year. I think both \nalternatives are inadequate and do not significantly alter or change \nour course.\n  On the Democrats' side, we have a proposal to cut about $5 billion to \n$6 billion for the rest of the year. To put that in perspective, we \nborrow $4 billion a day. So the other side is offering up cuts equal to \none day's borrowing. I think it is insignificant, and it will not alter \nthe coming and looming debt crisis we face. On our side of the aisle, \nwe have done more. The cuts are more significant, but they also pale in \ncomparison to the problem. If we were to adopt the President's \napproach, we would have a $1.65 trillion deficit in 1 year. If we adopt \nour approach, we are going to have a $1.55 trillion deficit in 1 year. \nBoth approaches do not significantly alter or delay the crisis that is \ncoming.\n  It is interesting, when we talk about cuts, everybody seems to be \ngiddy around here, saying this is the first time we have talked about \ncuts. It is better and it sounds good, but, guess what. We are not even \nreally cutting spending. What we are talking about is cutting the rate \nof increase of spending. The baseline of spending is going to go up at \n7.3 percent, according to the CBO. We are talking about reducing that \nincrease to a 6.7-percent increase. We are talking about cutting the \nrate of increase of government. The problem is, it is not enough. Our \ndeficit is growing by leaps and bounds. Our national debt is $14 \ntrillion. Our national debt is now equal to our entire economy. Our \ngross domestic product equals our national debt.\n  I think the President is tone-deaf on this issue. We had an election, \nand in the election the people said: We are concerned about out-of-\ncontrol spending. We are concerned about massive deficits. We are \nconcerned about passing this debt on to our kids and our grandkids.\n  The President recently proposed a 10-year budget, a 10-year plan for \nspending. He proposes that we spend $46 trillion. That means they are \nnot getting it. Official Washington is not getting what the people are \nsaying, and they are not getting how profound the problems are. \nSpending $46 trillion?\n  The President's plan will add $13 trillion to the debt. The \nRepublicans say: Oh, ours is a lot better. Theirs will add $12 trillion \nto the debt. It is out of control, and neither plan will do anything to \nsignificantly alter things.\n  We are spending $10 billion a day. In order to reform things, in \norder to change things around, we will have to come to grips with the \nidea of what government should be doing. What are the constitutional \nfunctions of government? What were the enumerated powers of the \nConstitution? What powers did the Constitution give to the Federal \nGovernment? And then we examine what we are actually doing, what we are \nspending money on that is not constitutional or should not be done here \nor should be left to the States and the people respectively.\n\n  Once upon a time, our side believed education was a function of the \nStates and localities. It is not mentioned in the Constitution that the \nFederal Government should have anything to do with education. Does it \nmean we are opposed to education? No. We just think it should be done \nat the State and local level.\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\n  Ronald Reagan was a champion of eliminating the Department of \nEducation. It was part of the party platform for many years. Then we \nwere in charge after 2000, and we doubled the size of the Department of \nEducation.\n  If you are serious about balancing the budget, if you are serious \nabout the debt, you have to look at taking departments, such as the \nDepartment of Education, and sending them back to the States and the \nlocalities. You have to look at programs that are growing by leaps and \nbounds, such as Medicaid and food stamps, cap them, block grant them, \nand send them back to the States. The States can manage these issues \nbetter. The closer they are to the people, the better managed they will \nbe.\n  The other compromise that needs to occur--and this is something our \nside needs to compromise on--our side has blindly said that the \nmilitary should get anything it wants and it is a blank check: What do \nyou want? Here it is.\n  We have increased military spending by 120 percent since 2001. We \nhave doubled military spending. I am for a strong national defense. I \nbelieve it is a constitutional function of the Federal Government to \nprovide for our national defense. I think it is the preeminent \nenumerated power, the thing we should be doing. But that being said, we \ncannot every 8 years double the Defense Department, double the military \nspending.\n  It is also ultimately the compromise. Within the space of a few \nyears, everyone here will come to an agreement, not because we want to \nbut because we are forced to by the events and by the drama of the debt \ncrisis. It will come. It has come to other nations. When it comes to \nus, the compromise that both sides of the aisle will have to work out, \nthe other side of the aisle will have to admit that we cannot have \nenormous domestic spending, and our side of the aisle will have to \nadmit that we cannot give a blank check to the military.\n  We will also have to look at entitlements. Everyone is afraid to say \nhow we reform entitlements. But there are two inescapable facts with \nentitlements: We are living longer, and a lot of people born after \nWorld War II are getting ready to retire. These are inescapable \ndemographic facts. We have to address them. If we simply do nothing, if \nwe do not address the entitlements, within a decade, entitlements will \naccount for the entire budget and interest. There will be no money left \nfor anything.\n  Right now, the argument is about all these other programs. There will \nbe no money left for any of these programs if we do nothing. It is \ngoing to take both sides of the aisle grappling with this issue and \nadmitting the rules and eligibility will have to change for Social \nSecurity and likely for Medicare. If we do it now, we can do it \ngradually. If we start now, we can gradually let the age rise for \nMedicare and Social Security for those 55 and under. Young people have \nalready acknowledged this is going to happen. Ask young people anywhere \nacross America: Do you think you are going to have Social Security when \nyou retire? Do you think you are going to get it at 67? Most young \npeople acknowledge it is broken. It is broken so badly that the only \nway to fix it and continue is we have to look at eligibility. But so \nmany people have said: Oh, we cannot talk about entitlements. You will \nbe unelected. You will be unelectable if you talk about entitlement \nreform.\n  The President still makes this mistake. He will not lead us. He will \nnot talk and give a leadership role to entitlement reform. Someone must \ndo it. We must stand up and be bold because the longer these problems \nfester, the longer we allow them to accumulate, the bigger the problems \nbecome and the more dramatic the answers must be.\n  If we look at Greece and these other nations that have faced a debt \ncrisis, their problem came to a head all of a sudden, and they changed \nthe age on social security like that. If we want to do it gradually and \nlet people plan for their future, we need to start now before we enter \ninto a crisis.\n  My problem with the discussion and the debate at this point is that I \ndo not think either side recognizes the enormity of the problem or the \nimmensity of the problem. Even people who would be considered to be \nthose of the mainstream--former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nsaid there is a 50-percent chance there will be some kinds of monetary \nproblems, significant monetary problems, even to the point of crisis, \nin the next few years. Many people have said Japan is locked in crisis. \nThat crisis is coming because of the debt they have accumulated. When \nthat comes to America, do we want to have government by crisis? Already \nwe can't even pass a budget. We can't pass appropriations bills. Our \nbills do not even go to the committees anymore. They come to the floor \nand we put a patchwork quilt on them. There is a chance this winds up \nbeing 2 more weeks. We have government by 2-week edict. It is not the \nway to run government.\n\n  If you want to have a significant plan for changing things, send \nbills through the committee. If you want a realistic way of running \ngovernment, have appropriations bills. If you want to be someone who \nbelieves in good, responsible government, for goodness' sake, pass a \nbudget. We didn't pass a budget last year.\n  This chart shows how big the problem is. I wish I had a magnifying \nglass because that is the only way you could see the other side's \nproposal--$6 billion in cuts. It is 1 day's borrowing. It is not even 1 \nday's spending they are talking about. It is insignificant, it is \ninconsequential, and it will do nothing to delay or alter the looming \ndebt crisis.\n  Look at the other proposal from our side. It is bigger. You can \nactually see it without a magnifying glass. But look how it is dwarfed \nby 1 year's problem. I recently proposed $500 billion in cuts. When I \nwent home and spoke to the people of my State, spoke to the tea party \npeople, they said $500 billion is not enough. They are right--$500 \nbillion is one-third of 1 year's problem. Up here, that is way too \nbold, but it is not even enough.\n  We have to counterbalance and understand the alternatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes of time.\n  Mr. PAUL. If we do nothing, all the programs people are so fond of \nextolling and saying we need money for will be gone.\n  So I implore the American public and those here to look at the \nproblem and to say to Congress: You are not doing enough. You must cut \nmore.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as a Senator \nfrom California to speak about how damaging I believe the House \ncontinuing resolution would be for the people and economy of my State.\n  I would first like to begin by expressing my approval that Congress \nis finally talking about controlling the deficit. I have been on the \nrecord for many years about our need to rein in spending, and we are \nfinally moving in the right direction.\n  I believe that government--in some ways--must adopt some of the \ndiscipline of a business. Businesses face tough choices about how to \nallocate resources. Businesses thrive when there is consistency and a \ncommitment to planning for the future. These are things that have been \nlacking in our budget process of late. And that needs to change.\n  The 2-week continuing resolution under which we are currently \noperating would not work for any business in California, and it does \nnot work for the Federal Government.\n  That being said, I must add this warning: we cannot balance the \nbudget on the backs of California's families and businesses.\n  And that, unfortunately, is precisely what the House-passed \ncontinuing resolution does.\n  In short, H.R. 1 is budget-cutting by ideology. If our friends on the \nother side of the Capitol did not like a program, they cut it. \nUnfortunately, cutting by this sort of political bias left us with a \nbill that will slash hundreds of thousands of jobs--700,000 jobs by \nsome economic estimates--and many of those in the private sector.\n  Even worse for my home State of California, the programs that House \nRepublicans chose to cut form the backbone of our job-creation strategy \nand the heart of many programs on which our working families rely.\n  Public health and education programs will be especially hard hit.\n  The budget for community health centers is cut by more than half. In \nCalifornia, these clinics serve 2.8 million patients every year--and \nfor\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\nmany, they are the only health care option available. These cuts would \nforce clinics to fire 28,000 doctors and staff.\n  Funding for Head Start is slashed by 14 percent, depriving 24,000 \nlow-income children in California access to early childhood services. \nThousands of teachers and staff will lose their jobs and parents will \nlose a reliable child care option.\n  And the title X Family Planning Program is completely eliminated. For \nCalifornia, that means 1.2 million individuals lose health care, \ncounseling and education services. And this ends the program that has \nbeen credited with preventing more than 400,000 abortions in 2008 more \nthan 80,000 of those in California.\n  H.R. 1 would also sacrifice tens of thousands of California jobs. We \nhave the second-highest unemployment rate in the Nation, and this bill \nwill send us in the wrong direction.\n  Two key priorities for California are in the crosshairs: our clean \nenergy sector and the modernization of our aging infrastructure. And \nboth of these are proven job-creators.\n  A vital Energy Department loan program will be lost, cutting $40 \nbillion worth of investment. By ending this one program, California \ndevelopers will be forced to halt 24 projects, killing 76,000 jobs.\n  Funding for energy research and development will be slashed by $1.9 \nbillion, meaning a loss of more than $200 million for California's \nlaboratories and universities. That means a direct loss of 9,400 jobs \nand enduring damage to our leadership as a global innovator.\n  Funding for a high-speed rail initiative will be eliminated, and $1 \nbillion already sent to California will be rescinded. This would likely \nend California's hopes for a high-speed rail line, and in the process \neliminate 20,000 future jobs.\n  The bill also rescinds funding for nationally significant \ntransportation infrastructure investments. For California, this ends \nsix projects totaling $59 million, including a Los Angeles metro line \nand a rail project at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n  As the economy continues its fragile recovery, we simply cannot \nafford to make dramatic spending cuts driven purely by political \nideology. Unfortunately, this is the approach employed by House \nRepublicans.\n  I support a different course in the Senate. I believe we must pair \nresponsible, targeted spending cuts with smart investments that will \nsupport California and the Nation's economic recovery, preserve jobs \nand protect families.\n  The Senate bill, introduced last week, takes a more pragmatic \napproach. Like the Republican plan, the Senate bill imposes significant \nspending cuts, but it does so through prudent action that will not \njeopardize our Nation's economic recovery.\n  The Senate bill cuts $51 billion from the President's fiscal year \n2011 budget request, eliminates earmarks and advances additional \nspending cuts proposed by the President for fiscal year 2012. However, \nin contrast to the House bill, this legislation continues support for \ncritical health, infrastructure, education, and energy investments, and \nprovides necessary funding for essential services the American people \ndepend upon every day.\n  Yes, Mr. President, we need to rein in spending. But we can't do that \nif we use a political litmus test to pick and choose which programs to \ncut.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join with me in opposition to these \nshort-sighted and damaging budget cuts.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today we are faced with two alternative \nversions of a fiscal year 2011 funding bill. The version that came over \nfrom the other body contains an endless list of problems. It slashes \nfundamental programs that are important to the health and well-being of \nevery America, unleashes attacks on our bedrock environmental laws that \nprotect clear and safe water as well as healthy air, and undermine our \nefforts to reassert America's leading role in education, research and \ninnovation. Casting a vote against this bill will be easy.\n  The alternative bill offered by the Senate Appropriations Committee \nis dramatically better. It is a good faith effort at tackling the \ndeficit while maintaining critical investments in America's future. \nThis bill, however, is not without its problems.\n  The Senate version of the fiscal year 2011 spending bill restores a \nsubstantial portion of the cuts to the nation's water infrastructure \ncontained in H.R. 1. I applaud the committee's effort to protect this \ncritical investment, but it doesn't go far enough. As a nation, we see \n650 water main breaks per day. That is the rate of one every 2 minutes \nand results in the loss of $2.6 billion in water annually. The story on \nwastewater systems is equally dismal, resulting in sewage overflows and \nbroken pipes on a daily basis. Our drinking water and wastewater \ninfrastructure has been given a grade of D- from the American Society \nof Civil Engineers.\n  These system failures aren't just expensive, they are also dangerous. \nRaw sewage flows into our rivers and streams, forcing local health \nauthorities to warn local residents to avoid contact with rivers, \nbeaches and lakes. Drinking water systems are forced to issue boil-\nwater advisories to compensate for broken systems. We must do better. \nThe investments in water infrastructure in the Senate bill are a step \nin the right direction, but we should be doing more.\n  There are other examples as well. The cuts to the conservation \nprograms in the Senate version are disproportionately large. The \nWatershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program at USDA, for example, \nis eliminated entirely.\n  We need to make hard choices about our funding priorities. But we \nshouldn't be doing so without also having a frank discussion about tax \nloopholes that cost us billions of dollars annually.\n  And finally, the Senate bill is a dramatic improvement over H.R. 1 in \nterms of environmental policy. The other body approved legislative \nriders that would stop EPA from being able to protect the air Americans \nbreathe every day and it would stop dead in its tracks the Chesapeake \nBay restoration effort. The Senate bill, to its credit, eliminates \nthese terrible policy directives. The Senate bill, however, does \ninclude a provision that would legislatively de-list the gray wolf from \nthe endangered species list.\n  I continue to oppose legislative efforts to delist endangered \nspecies. We have a regulatory process that is based on scientific data, \nand we should use it. All that is needed is for the States in the \nNorthern Rockies to submit appropriate management plans to the \nDepartment of Interior so that the law can work the way Congress \nintended.\n  I have no problem today in voting against the draconian cuts and \nterrible public policy riders in H.R. 1. My support for the Senate \nalternative, which is dramatically better, is tempered by my concerns. \nMy vote for the Senate substitute is a reluctant aye. As we move \nforward to enact a fiscal 2011 spending bill, I hope we will be able to \naddress the issue I have outlined here to make sure that the American \npeople are getting the kinds of investments and savings that they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my dismay at \nsome of the irresponsible cuts in H.R. 1, particularly the elimination \nof a program of personal importance, The Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service which is home to the AmeriCorps and Volunteers in \nService to America--VISTA--programs. I stand by a commitment to reduce \nthe deficit, but we cannot be irresponsible in cuts to such essential \nprograms that help the people of West Virginia and the rest of the \nUnited States.\n  As you may know, I came to West Virginia in 1964 as a VISTA worker \nwhich is now a part of the Corporation along with other public service \norganizations. My decision to join VISTA was one of the most important \ndecisions of my life. While my goal was to help the people of Emmons, \nWV, that community came to help me much, much more. It gave me a new \nfocus of public service which has led me into a fulfilling and \nmeaningful career. Sargent Shriver was the shining light and soul of \nVISTA and many other public service initiatives. Through these \nprograms, he inspired me to find my true home in West Virginia, and I \nhave no doubt that he profoundly impacted the lives of many other \nvolunteers. VISTA, AmeriCorps and all the public service programs under \nthe Corporation provide opportunity for everyone from young people to \nseniors. As a young man, it changed the direction of my\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\nlife. It provides service opportunities which can provide educational \nvouchers and jobs skills.\n  There were over a thousand applicants in 2010 to the West Virginia \nbranch of AmeriCorps. I cannot support the continuing resolution from \nthe House which eliminates this program and says ``no thanks'' to them. \nSince 1994, over 9,300 West Virginians have served over 14 million \nhours in efforts to better communities across the state. Over 7,600 \ndisadvantaged children and youth in West Virginia will be left without \na tutor or mentor, directly impeding their ability to achieve the \nacademic gains needed to succeed. This not only damages communities \ntoday but also damages our future workforce; we cannot rob young people \nof a better future.\n  By eliminating AmeriCorps and VISTA, we are missing an opportunity to \ndevelop lifelong public servants and leaders--the public servants and \nleaders our country needs now more than ever before. Nationally, \nthrough the elimination of AmeriCorps and VISTA, we would lose the \nvolunteer service of nearly 75,000 people. Across the country, \nelimination of AmeriCorps and VISTA would have a devastating impact.\n  I was told of the story of Elvin Campbell, an AmeriCorps member and \nmilitary veteran, serving in Charleston, WV. Elvin works with homeless \nindividuals, providing them with life skills, helping them prepare a \nresume, search for a job and successfully budget their finances.\n  Last year, Elvin helped 127 people go from being unemployed to self-\nsufficient, contributing members of society. Without Elvin, there are \n127 people who would otherwise be unemployed, an investment in \nAmeriCorps is an investment in jobs across this country. Elvin is one \nof 10 veterans doing work like this throughout the Charleston area. \nThrough AmeriCorps, these military heroes help grow our economy and \nmove my State, and our Nation forward.\n  We talk quite a bit about jobs around here. Elvin's example shows us \nthat dedicated public servants can give our citizens the necessary \nskills to attain jobs throughout West Virginia. H.R. 1 eliminates \nAmeriCorps which was organized under President Clinton and expanded \nmore than 50 percent by President Bush. Democratic and Republican \nadministrations alike have realized it is a great investment, leading \nto over 60 million volunteer hours last year. In West Virginia alone, \nAmeriCorps volunteers have served over a million hours last year, \nimproving West Virginia communities across the State.\n  Without AmeriCorps, West Virginia would lose 800 AmeriCorps \nservicemembers and 115 year-long VISTA slots, translating into over \n691,000 service hours, combined. The loss of the VISTA slots is \nestimated to result in the loss of 18,720 volunteers providing over \n397,000 hours of service to West Virginia communities. Each state would \nface similar cuts and be faced with the consequences.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support these cuts in H.R. 1. Of course, \nthis program is just one of many the continuing resolution approved by \nthe House proposes for elimination. I am willing to work together with \nmy colleagues to identify real savings, but I cannot support H.R. 1 or \nthe reckless cuts it proposes.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, we need to make serious and \nsubstantial cuts and we also need to compromise. Cuts and compromise \nneed to be the dialog occurring across the aisle and with each other. I \nhave great respect for some of my colleagues on the other side who say \nwe have a structural debt problem and we have to get to it. Certainly \nwe do.\n  But it is completely wrong that we would do massive cuts all in one \nfell swoop right now with our economy in the position that it is. That \nwould cause as big a crisis as our failure to deal with our long-term \nstructural debt. So that is where the compromise part comes in. We have \nto do significant cuts now, we have to put everything on the table and \nlook at our long-term debt structure and we need to figure out how we \ndo that in a bipartisan way, because we are going to fail our country \nif no one is willing to compromise.\n  The House resolution, frankly, was not smart in the way they did the \ncuts. No one in any business would take all the cuts out of one small \nsliver of their business. They would look at their entire business to \ntry to find cost savings. It was not smart that all the pain was in one \nplace, and they are killing off the very part of our budget that has \nthe best chance of increasing economic activity in this country--the \nbuilding of roads and bridges, the educating of our kids, the research \nand the science and development. So while their cuts were more \nsubstantial than the Democrats' plan in the Senate, they were not smart \ncuts. They did not spread the pain around.\n  On the other hand, the Senate has not gone far enough. It is, \nfrankly, disappointing to me. I still think there are way too many \npeople in denial around here about the nature of the problem and how \nserious it is, and I don't think we are demonstrating to the American \npeople we understand the nature of the problem when we present an \nalternative proposal with such a small number of cuts. The sweet spot \nis somewhere in between these two approaches. Pain needs to be spread \nmore broadly throughout the budget so the pain is not so acute in one \narea of the budget, and we need to look at all the programs, put it all \non the table, and we need to be able to compromise.\n  Let me point out where I think some of the compromises could come \neasy. The Senate version, which I will not be able to support--the \nSenate Democratic version--increases the President's budget in 15 \ndifferent programs. Think about that. We are trying to cut, and our \nappropriators have come up with a plan to increase 15 of the \nPresident's budget requests by a total of $2.6 billion. We are going \nthe wrong direction. We should be, at a minimum, cutting what the \nPresident has recommended cutting. Frankly, I think we need to go even \nfurther.\n  The Pentagon. Let me give one example that came up in a hearing \nyesterday so people understand there are real savings. We have a \nPentagon that we can't audit, and we haven't been able to audit for \ndecades. It is frustrating that we don't have business systems in place \nthat allow transparency and that allow wise choices in terms of the \nexpenditure of dollars. In a hearing yesterday in the Armed Services \nCommittee, I talked with the head of the Navy and the Marines about a \nsystem they are putting in place to track equipment. Good idea; right? \nWe want to track equipment. The Army is also putting in a system to \ntrack equipment. Here is the rub. They share equipment. You might think \nthese two systems will be able to talk to each other. Oh, no, they have \nbeen done separately. They do not talk to each other. It is different \nsoftware. We are going to have to spend more money for a mechanism so \nthe two systems' tracking equipment--sometimes the equipment they are \nsharing--can see what is going on. By the way, each of these systems is \nbillions of dollars. We could save billions of dollars by saying to the \nArmy and to the Marines: Use the same software. Use the same program.\n  That is the kind of savings we can find in the Pentagon if we just \nlook at the GAO high-risk list. The Air Force has been trying for years \nto put resource management software in place. They are saying they \ncan't even get there until 2017. Are you kidding?\n  We have to be more efficient with the dollars we spend at the \nPentagon, and we will not be if we always say yes and we never say no. \nThere will be no incentive to find savings or to find more jointness \namong our different military branches in terms of administrative costs \nif we always say yes and never say no. So the pain has to be felt at \nthe Pentagon too. We cannot do this without pain being felt at the \nPentagon.\n  It has to be across the board, it has to be more substantial than \n$6.5 billion, and we all have to be willing to compromise.\n  I will be voting no on both proposals for that reason, but I am \nanxious to sit down, I am anxious to sit down at the table and find \nthose compromises.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I wish to make real cuts and move forward in a \nresponsible way to show the American people we get it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for up to 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the two \nbudget bills we will be voting on shortly that purport to cut spending \nin Washington. I appreciate the comments of my good friend from \nMissouri, Senator McCaskill, in pointing out many of the shortcomings \nof the two pieces of legislation.\n  I am here to deliver a eulogy. Both bills are dead, and they deserve \nto be dead. One bill cuts too little; the other bill has too much hate. \nNeither one is serious. Most important, neither will pass, and they \nshouldn't pass because they are unfair. They are not in the best \ninterests of Nebraskans and taxpayers across our country. About the \nonly thing they are serious about is guaranteeing shutting down the \ngovernment.\n  Nebraskans want serious spending cuts, but these bills are loaded \nwith tricks, treats, gimmicks, and games. On one side, we see a bill \nthat simply cuts too little. It purports to cut spending by $50 \nbillion, but when you push through the thicket of gimmicks, it actually \nonly cuts about $6 billion. In a budget of more than $1 trillion, a cut \nof about one-half percent isn't enough. It will not get runaway \ngovernment spending under control, nor will it begin to bring down that \nunsustainable national debt that endangers America's future. To win my \nsupport, there needs to be more cuts in spending and they need to be \nreal and reasonable.\n  That brings me to the other bill. The other bill is H.R. 1. It is \nchock-full of provisions pushing a political agenda snuck into the bill \nin the middle of the night. One provision is an attack on America's \nfarmers. It aims to block allowing the use of more American-made \nethanol in our cars and trucks. Today, cars and trucks can use gas with \n10 percent ethanol. The government has just approved a 15-percent \nethanol blend. There is no cost, but that didn't stop some from \nsneaking in an unfair ban.\n  Cutting back on ethanol at a time when gas prices are above $3.50 a \ngallon nationwide, and rising fast, is the wrong thing to do. Worse, it \nis a gift to foreign oil. Looking at all the violence and turmoil we \nare seeing on TV in a key oil-producing region of the world, it seems \nthe worst possible gift at the worst possible time.\n  Another political agenda item in H.R. 1 will eliminate public \ntelevision in Nebraska--an educational resource for our citizens and an \ninformational lifeline in many parts of Nebraska.\n  This bill makes other sneaky attempts to push a political agenda. It \neliminates poison control centers, blocks a consumer database people \nmight use to determine a product's safety, and keeps high-speed \nInternet service out of rural areas.\n  H.R. 1 also limits urban homeland security funds and sets the limit \narbitrarily at 25 cities. That will likely bar any future funding to \nthe largest city in my State. While some might not think of Omaha as a \nterror target, let me tell you it is the home to the U.S. Strategic \nCommand, a major national telecommunications hub, and is a key rail and \nhighway crossroads for freight and transportation.\n  On the spending side, the House bill makes unfair cuts to the States, \nincluding mine, that will cost Nebraskans hundreds of jobs and, indeed, \nunnecessary hardship. For example, more than 1,200 Nebraska children \nwould lose access to Head Start, which has proven to help students \ncomplete high school. The bill cuts Pell tuition grants that 43,000 \nNebraskans need to afford college.\n  In addition, the $75 million cut for homeless veterans' housing \nvouchers seems absurd. To quote the Director of the Omaha Veterans \nHospital: ``This is a very big deal for those veterans and the \ncommunity.'' This could impact 10,000 homeless veterans nationwide. In \nOmaha alone, 240 veterans have used these vouchers, and there are \nlikely 600 more who need this help to find permanent housing.\n  After all is said and done, the bottom line is Washington hasn't \ngotten serious. I will not be held accountable for the failings of the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  I can, however, be held accountable for 1 of the 12 spending bills \nthat fund the government. As chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nLegislative Branch Subcommittee, I have the responsibility to oversee \nthe spending bill for Congress. We cut spending last year, we are \ncutting spending by 5 percent this year, and we will be back for more \ncuts next year.\n  Last year, Senator Murkowski and I did this before all the campaign-\nstyle speeches about cutting began. It was clear she didn't bring a \npolitical agenda to the table, and I hope she knows I didn't either. \nThis year, in working with Senator Hoeven--also a former Governor, as I \nam--who is now ranking member on the subcommittee, I have every reason \nto believe he also will be serious and fair as we reduce spending in \nnext year's budget.\n  Cutting the spending for Congress--for our offices, committees and \nstaff, our buildings, our police--and our efforts on this Hill is an \neffort to lead by example. Our committee's bipartisan example could \nserve as a model for how the other 11 spending bills are handled. Our \nmessage, to paraphrase Harry Truman, is: The buck shrinks here.\n  Soon, we will vote on the two spending bills. One has done nothing to \nattract Republicans; the other has done nothing to attract \nDemocrats. In the end, we have bills that will divide. They do not \nunite Congress. For the reasons I have given, I will vote against both.\n\n  Then what is next? Washington needs to put aside all the games and \ngimmicks, the treats and tricks, and come together and do what is right \nfor the American people by passing the budget. They deserve it, they \nare owed it, and it is now time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this debate today is all about jobs. The \nHouse Republican budget which we will soon be voting on in this body \nwill destroy 700,000 American jobs. That is the estimate put forward by \nMark Zandi, who advised John McCain's Presidential campaign and now \nworks for the nonpartisan Moody's Group.\n  That sort of estimate is not just a voice in the wilderness, it is \nrepeated by major group after major group. Ben Bernanke, Chairman of \nthe Fed, said last week the plan would cost ``a couple hundred thousand \njobs.'' Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips put forth an estimate that \nsaid ``this House job-killing plan will reduce, in the second and third \nquarters of the next year, the economy of the United States by 1.5 to 2 \npercentage points.''\n  What is 2 percent of a $15 trillion economy? It is $300 billion.\n  Whether you view it in terms of the gross domestic product or you \nview it in terms of the number of jobs of Americans taken away by the \njob-killing Republican plan, this bill, H.R. 1, that we will be voting \non later today, is a disaster.\n  I want us to focus on this number because I can tell you, folks back \nhome in Oregon want to create jobs. They want us to put America back to \nwork. They don't want to have a plan put forward that continues to pay \nenormous bonuses to the billionaires of Wall Street and creates \nenormous special tax bonuses for the billionaires who are making their \ntax returns while taking out this huge economic meltdown on working \npeople.\n  Let's review how this all came to pass. You will recall that during \nthe second Bush administration there was a plan to launch two foreign \nwars and not pay for them, and then proceed to create Medicare Part D \nand not pay for it, and then to give bonus tax breaks to millionaires \nand billionaires and not pay for it, and reverse an enormous annual \nsurplus and turn it into an enormous annual deficit and, in the \nprocess, produce a very tiny, modest expansion, in which working people \nactually lost ground. That expansion all went to the very top.\n  That was just the beginning, before my colleagues across the aisle \ndecided they are going to deregulate retail mortgages in order to ramp \nup predatory mortgages, produce a huge balloon\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\nin the real estate market, deregulate Wall Street so they could proceed \nto securitize those mortgages and have those blow up in financial \ninstitutions across America and have the economy melt down in 2008-\n2009. That is how we got where we are right now.\n  Rather than take on a plan that creates jobs in America, the plan is \nto eliminate 700,000 jobs across this country.\n  Let's be clear. There is a tremendous amount we can do to reduce the \ndeficit. A plan was put forward a few weeks ago in which we get rid of \nthose bonus breaks for those who are in the top 2 percent of this \ncountry. It saves about $250 billion a year in real hard cash. The plan \nhas been put forward to get rid of the tax breaks for the oil and gas \nindustry which was doing very well and is doing even better now with \nthe oil market speculators driving it up to over $100 a barrel. These \nthings actually close the deficit. They do not destroy the economy. \nThey actually create the sort of plan that can create jobs across this \nNation and put people back to work and invest in the future of our \nNation rather than saying--after we blew up the economy--let's make \nworking people do even worse.\n  I am going to summarize by saying embedded in H.R. 1 is attack after \nattack. For example, taking on preventive health care, preventive \nhealth care for women across this country by taking out title X.\n  How about the attack on homeless veterans? I go throughout my State \nand folks say: A lot of our sons and daughters are coming home from \nIraq and Afghanistan and we need to support them in the transition back \nhome. It is very difficult, there is a lot of post-traumatic stress. \nInstead of supporting them, my colleagues across the aisle have \nproduced a plan that says let's take away that support for housing for \nthe homeless, housing for veterans.\n  I could go on because the list is so long and the attacks are so \nmany. But that option, while it does only a modest amount in the short \nterm to affect the deficit, proceeds to have devastating results on the \neconomy. And what will happen when the economy will collapse again, a \ndouble-dip recession courtesy of H.R. 1? Then the debt goes back up, so \nit is a loss on both fronts. We need a responsible plan to reduce the \ndeficit, not a plan to bomb the economy on the heads of our working \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will you kindly advise me when I have 10 \nminutes left, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nwhere we find ourselves. Nobody has spent more time in the last 6\\1/2\\ \nyears on this floor talking about the problem in front of us. Hopefully \nI can do that in a way that would never impugn the motives of my fellow \nSenators.\n  I enjoyed the speech of the Senator from Nebraska, because one of the \nthings he stated is we have to come together. You are not going to get \ncoming together when we have the speech we just heard, when you have a \nspeech that impugns the motives of the people in the other body trying \nto solve some of our problems.\n  The first point I wish to make is we are at a place where we are \ngoing to vote on two bills with no amendments. Since when did the \nSenate give up its ability to try to amend bills going forward? The \nreason we are not is because, had we not agreed to it, the tree would \nhave been filled and we would have either voted for cloture or not to \nhave cloture, but the fact is in this body we ought to be about \namending what we do not like in the bills.\n  If the Senator from Oregon does not like what is in the bills, he \nought to have a chance to try to change it. Yet we find ourselves with \na very short period of time to debate what is the No. 1 risk for us as \na nation today.\n  I have read all the economic studies that have been put out on H.R. \n1. I have also read what the economists on the other side say in terms \nof the false assumptions that have been made in it. I don't know which \nones are right, but the fact is we are not going to have an actual \ndebate on advancing amendments.\n  Let me describe where we are today, so everybody knows. We are adding \n$4.507 billion to the deficit every day. We are borrowing in the \ninternational market $3 billion a day. By the time I finish this talk, \nwe will have added $98 million to the deficit. Adding something to the \ndeficit, what does that mean? That is the same thing as saying we are \ntaking the opportunity away from the children and the generation that \nfollows us by putting them in debtors prison. That is exactly what we \nhave done.\n\n  I don't care where the blame lies. What we have to start doing is not \nspending money we do not have. We cannot continue to spend money we do \nnot have. It is very interesting that a week ago this morning, this \npast Monday, the GAO issued a report. It covers one-third of the \nFederal Government and lists the duplications they found. We asked them \nto do that with the last debt limit extension in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  According to my calculations, there is at least $100 billion that is \nnot touched by either of these bills that could be eliminated tomorrow \nand saved against our children's future. We do not have an opportunity \nto offer amendments to do that on this bill. Here is real data compiled \nby the Government Accountability Office where multitudes of Members \nfrom this body have called me and said how do we help you do that?\n  The first way you help me do that is make sure we have an open \nprocess on the floor where we can offer an amendment to do it. Let me \nhighlight for a minute some of the things that were in this wonderful \nreport put forward by the GAO.\n  We have 47 job training programs across 9 different agencies that we \nare spending $18 billion a year on. Not one of them has a metric on \nwhether it is successful or actually is accomplishing what it is \nsupposed to do. Why do we need so many different job training programs? \nWhy do we need any job training program if we cannot show it is \nworking? Why are we spending money on a job training program that is \nnot working?\n  We have five departments, eight agencies, two dozen Presidential \nappointees who oversee our work on bioterrorism. We don't have one \nagency responsible for it, one group of people. We are spending $6.5 \nbillion a year on bioterrorism and the right hand doesn't know what the \nleft hand is doing.\n  We have 20 agencies and 56 programs dedicated to teaching America \nfinancial literacy. We have no moral authority to teach anybody \nfinancial literacy when we have a deficit that is going to be $1.65 \ntrillion this year and we are $14.2 trillion in debt.\n  We have 80 economic development programs across 4 different agencies \nwhere we spend $6.5 billion a year. We don't know if they are working. \nMaybe they are but we ought to know it before we spend money we don't \nhave on things when we do not know if they are working.\n  We have 15 different agencies covering 30 food safety laws--15 \ndifferent agencies.\n  We have 18 nutrition programs, separate nutrition programs. We spend \n$62.5 billion a year, $30 billion of it is borrowed, and we do not know \nthe results. Why shouldn't we have one? And why shouldn't we put a \nmetric on it to know whether it is working?\n  We have 20 homeless programs. We heard mentioned the homeless \nprograms. We are going to spend $2.9 billion at seven different \nagencies, and if you add up the money over the last 10 years that we \nspent on homeless programs we can buy every homeless person in this \ncountry a $200,000 home. Yet we continue to spend money. We don't know \nif the programs are working. They certainly would be better off if they \nhad $200,000 for their care for the future rather than continue the \nprograms we have no metrics on.\n  We have 82 teacher training quality programs--82 of them. They are \nacross 10 different Federal Government agencies and we spend $4 billion \na year on them and we have no idea whether they are successful. As a \nmatter of fact, we do know if they are successful--we are not \nsuccessful in our country today. Are we getting value for what we are \nspending? Remember, 40 cents of every dollar we spend on these programs \nwe are borrowing from the Chinese.\n  We have 52 programs for entrepreneurial efforts. Since when is that a\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\nrole of the Federal Government? We have 35 programs to oversee \ninfrastructure; 27 different programs for commercial buildings; 28 \nprograms to oversee new markets outside of this country--28 programs; \n20 programs for business incubators, and 17 different grant programs \nfor disaster preparedness. We have 17 different grant programs for \ndisaster preparedness; 34 areas where Federal agencies, offices, or \nprograms have redundant objectives or are fragmented across several \ndepartments; 2,100 data centers for 24 agencies. Consolidating them \ncould save $200 billion over a decade. We cannot even offer that \namendment on this debate. That is $20 billion a year. That is a third \nof what the House wants to save.\n  We have the ability--there is the waste, there is the incompetency in \nwhat Congress has done through its duplication of efforts and its lack \nof oversight--to solve a great portion of our fiscal problems.\n  We can do it. But we cannot do it when the process does not allow for \ndebate and votes on those specific issues. I want to talk for a minute \nabout what is ahead of us as a nation because I think it is important. \nI am very sorry my friend, President Obama, has not led on this issue.\n  Let me tell you what is in front of us. What is in front of us is \nrising interest rates. What is in front of us is rising competition for \ncapital to fund our deficits. The historic rate for us on our debt as a \nnation over the last 35 years has been greater than 6 percent. Last \nyear we paid less than 2 percent for what we have on the books, less \nthan 2 percent average.\n  Our historical timeframe on when that money is due is usually about \n10-plus years. We are now financing that at 59 months. What is going to \nhappen in the world next year? Well, the difference in terms of \nsovereign financing--that is, other countries that also need to borrow \nmoney, including us--and what is available to finance that next year is \n$7 trillion. In other words, there is a $7 trillion shortfall in terms \nof what is going to be available to finance.\n  If we are going to borrow $7 trillion in the world more than what is \navailable, what do we think is going to happen to interest rates? What \nis going to happen? Well, they are going to rise. So we are going to be \nfaced with one of the following two dilemmas unless Congress gets its \nact together. Here are the two dilemmas: The first is, our average \ninterest cost goes back to its historical cost. If that happens, \nimmediately we are going to see $640 billion more a year in interest \ncosts--$640 billion. We only have less than $200 billion this year. We \nare going to see a $640 billion increase. That does not help any person \nwho has a need. All that does is that is paid out to our debtors. That \nis a very real risk for us right now.\n  That goes to say that we do not have a lot of time because what we \nknow is interest rates are going to rise. So it is mandatory that \nCongress do what the American people have known for a while we need to \ndo; that is, live within our means.\n  Now, let me describe the second problem or second solution; that is, \nwhat the Federal Reserve will do. The Federal Reserve will just print \nmore money. Well, if we print more money and we do not have any base \nfor doing that, that creates what is called inflation. It is called \ndebasing our currency.\n  What happens in America if we decide that the way we are going to get \nout of our problem is to debase our currency and print more money, like \nthe Fed is doing right now, what is called quantitative easing 2?\n  They are printing $600 billion worth of money between now and June. \nWell, what happens is the value of everything we own in real terms \ndeclines, in nominal dollars goes up, but the purchasing power of the \naverage middle-class family in this country declines tragically, and \nthe safety net this country has been known for, for those who are far \nless fortunate than the average American, will be absolutely \nunaffordable, totally unaffordable. So we are talking about the \ndestruction of the best of America, our middle class. We are talking \nabout taking opportunities away.\n  So what is the answer? The answer is not to have more partisan \nstatements by Senator Merkley impugning the motives of people who are \ntrying to do what is right even though it is different from his \nopinion. The answer is for Congress to get together and recognize the \nthreat to our future and give up long-held positions to solve the \ngreater good. That means we have to move. That means we have to \nrecognize that we cannot have it all our way.\n  How do we actually do that? Well, the one failure of Congress, in my \ntime in Congress, both in the House in the mid-1990s and now in the \nSenate since 2004, is we do not do oversight. How did we end up with \nthis report that shows $100 billion in duplications? The only way it \ncould happen is we were not watching. We were not doing the oversight.\n  So one of the things that needs to happen is the chairman of every \ncommittee ought to spend 90 percent of their time in oversight on \nthings we are already doing rather than working on creating new bills \nand new programs.\n  Second, what ought to happen is we ought to have a vigorous debate \nwith amendments on the floor of the Senate to solve some of the very \nreal problems. It is not all that hard to solve these problems. But \nwhat happens is in partisan bodies, people talk past one another. \nNobody would decline the fact that we ought to get rid of unused \nproperty. We can save $8 billion a year if we get rid of unused Federal \nproperty. Does anybody disagree with that? But we have not done it. \nThere is $8 billion. We are going to get out of this $1.6 trillion hole \na couple billion dollars at a time. We ought to do that. We ought to \nget rid of the wasteful printing at the Government Printing Office, \nsave several hundred million dollars over the next 10 years.\n  We ought to quit paying bonuses to contractors who do not do their \njob--and we have documented that multiple agencies are doing that--\nperformance bonuses when they do not meet the performance requirements.\n  We ought to collect the unpaid taxes from Federal employees; it is $3 \nbillion. Those are the settled claims; these are not the unsettled \nclaims.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.) The Chair notifies the Senator he \nhas 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair. Here is a list of ideas that comes to \n$380 billion, of things that we would, as normal Americans sitting at \nour family table, say: You are in trouble. Forty percent of your budget \nyou are spending you do not have the money for. Your credit cards are \nmaxed out. You cannot do it. What can we spend? Here it is.\n\n       There were 72 amendments last year. Two of them passed the \n     Senate. I heard the Senator from Nebraska talking about some \n     pain that might occur in his district. I want to tell you, \n     there has to be shared pain all across the country if we are \n     going to get out of the problem we are in. We can no longer \n     kick the can down the road without spilling the soup all over \n     our kids. The time for action is now. The time for leadership \n     is now.\n\n  If we look at history, what we find is the average age of a republic \nis 207 years. All republics before us have failed. How have they \nfailed? What is it that caused them to lose their economy and their \nfreedom? Was it an invading army? Was it some natural disaster? None of \nthose things. If we go back in history, every one that has failed has \nfailed over fiscal issues, the very issues that confront us today.\n  I think it is time America cheats history. I think it is time we come \ntogether and solve these big problems. It is going to be painful for \neveryone.\n  It means some Senators are going to lose their seats if they do the \nbest, right thing for America. There cannot be a greater calling than \nthat, to do the best, right thing for our country. It means following a \npattern of leadership that says personal sacrifice by me in a \nleadership position has to come first, demonstrating my ability to \nunderstand the problem.\n  So we are going to have a limited debate on two bills, both \nimperfect. But certainly one of them goes more toward the problem that \nwe have than the other. We are going to spend $3.8 trillion this year \nthrough September 30. The deficit is going to be $1.6 trillion.\n  The savings from the House cut is this little, bitty green line down \nhere. It is only $57 billion. The savings from Inouye is $4.7. You \ncannot even see a line. It does not begin to address the duplication, \nthe waste, the fraud and abuse, the incompetence of what we have \ncreated in the Federal Government. It will not solve our problems.\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\n  It will be a nice starting point for partisan debate, but it takes us \naway from what we need to do. Here is the cut. Here is the deficit. \nThis is a pie chart. It is showing--it is nothing--$57 billion is \nnothing. What we have to do to be able to compete in a world financial \nmarket is send a signal that we get what the problem is, that we are \nwilling to make the difficult and tough sacrifices and choices to \nbecome viable and reliable and have people loan us money in the future. \nWe have to extend the term and period of our debt where we buy the time \nto make these things possible so the least amount of pain--although \nvery real--comes about.\n  For goodness' sake, we have to stop spending money we do not have on \nthings we do not absolutely need.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. As Congress tries to \nget serious about cutting wasteful and reckless spending, I believe \ntaxpayer subsidy of abortion providers should be among the first things \nto go. I personally believe it is morally wrong to end an innocent \nhuman life through abortion. I also believe it is morally reprehensible \nto take the dollars of millions of pro-life Americans in order to fund \norganizations that do that. That is a view held by the great majority \nof Americans. Americans should not be forced to subsidize abortion, \nmuch less fund our Nation's largest abortion provider, Planned \nParenthood.\n  When the House passed its continuing resolution before us today, it \nadopted a provision that cuts funding to this abortion giant, and it \ndid it with significant bipartisan support. Unfortunately, that \nlanguage was stripped by Senate leadership behind closed doors. But I \nbelieve Senators should have a chance to vote directly on that measure \nfollowing a full and open debate.\n  Again, I do not personally believe abortion is a right guaranteed by \nthe Constitution. I believe that it is morally wrong. But this issue is \neven beyond that. This is not about abortion on demand in this country. \nThis debate is about whether taxpayer dollars, including those billions \nof taxpayer dollars from pro-life Americans, should be sent to \norganizations such as Planned Parenthood, which performs millions of \nabortions in this country.\n  According to their latest annual report, Planned Parenthood boasted \nmore than $363 million in taxpayer funding, $363 million. By the way, \nthat is the same year it performed an unprecedented 324,008 abortions. \nEvery year since 2000 the government has increased taxpayer funding of \nPlanned Parenthood, on average over a $22 million-a-year increase. And \nguess what. The number of abortions Planned Parenthood has performed \nhas also steadily increased, even though the overall abortion rate in \nthe United States has declined since 2008.\n  Planned Parenthood's abortion rate massively outpaces its adoption \nreferrals. In 2008, a woman entering a Planned Parenthood clinic was \n134 times more likely to have an abortion than to be referred for an \nadoption.\n  Planned Parenthood has also made a profit every year since 1987, \nincluding over a $63 million return profit in 2009. There is no \njustification for subsidizing Planned Parenthood's profit-making \nventure with taxpayer dollars.\n  There has been a recent onslaught of ads that claim Planned \nParenthood is simply a leading provider of women's health services. But \nabortions, not other health services, not true health services--\nabortions account for roughly one-third of the $1 billion income \ngenerated by its affiliated clinics.\n  Let me be clear. This provision would not cut all title X funding for \nhealth services such as breast cancer screenings, HIV testing, \ncounseling, valuable family planning services. It would simply block \nfunds, taxpayer dollars, from subsidizing America's largest abortion \nprovider. That has the support of the American people, even well beyond \nAmerica's prolife numbers. I believe the sanctity of human life is a \nprinciple that Congress should proclaim at every opportunity. Again, \nthis goes even beyond that.\n\n  The time has come to respect the wishes of the great majority of \nAmericans, pro-life and many pro-choice, who say using taxpayer dollars \nto fund huge abortion providers--Planned Parenthood is the biggest--\nsimply is not right. We have to cut. We have to get responsible. This \nis certainly a key place to start.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate on the \nconsequences of where we are in the debate on appropriations and the \nharsh and punitive consequences of H.R. 1. However, I cannot let the \ncomments made during the last half hour go unchallenged.\n  First, I wish to comment on the remarks of the Senator from Oklahoma \non duplication in government. I so respect the Senator from Oklahoma. \nWe have worked on many fiscal reform issues. But he went over a list, \nprogram by program by program, of where he says we have duplication. I \ndon't challenge his facts, but I do challenge his inertia. If these \nprograms have been in existence and have been duplicative and denied \nvalue to the taxpayer, where has he been? The Republicans were in \ncharge for 10 years, from 2000 to 2008. They were in charge of all \nthree branches of the government. So if he didn't like duplication, \nthey had the Presidency, the House, and they had the Senate. Why didn't \nthey change it? Now all of a sudden they have religion. I don't know \nwhat faith that is, but they now have the desire to talk about it. If \nthey were serious about ending duplication, it should have started a \nlong time ago.\n  Second, bring the ideas forth, look for cosponsors from other reform-\nminded people such as the Presiding Officer and myself. Let's end the \nduplication. But let's end the duplicity and in the way we talk about \nduplication. I am tired of blaming Barack Obama, who has been President \nfor 2 years, for everything that is perceived as wrong with the United \nStates. Where were they?\n  I must credit the Senator from Oklahoma. He has often brought fiscal \nfolly to the attention of the Senate. I was with him when we fought \nlavish meatballs at $4 and $7 apiece that he found. When he showed it \nto me, I joined with him in the reform package. I loved it, and I look \nforward to working with him. But don't act holier than thou now about \nduplication.\n  Now let's go to the abortion topic. I will not change this \nconversation into the ``A'' word. However, the Senator talked about \nPlanned Parenthood being profit making. It cannot be. It is a \nnonprofit. I am not even going to argue additional revenue. He doesn't \nwant to give money to Planned Parenthood because they make a profit. I \nwon't debate him on that. But the next time he supports an oil subsidy, \nI am going to oppose it because the oil companies make a profit. I am \ngoing to fight tooth and nail to end the lavish subsidies we give on \noil and gas. If we are not going to give it to Planned Parenthood \nbecause they make money, then I will not support giving it to oil \ncompanies because they make money. So there. I have said it, and I am \nproud of it.\n  This is no laughing matter, what we are dealing with on \nappropriations. H.R. 1 will have a Draconian effect on the middle class \nand a Draconian effect on jobs. Our economy is very fragile. We are \nbarely making a recovery. If we pass H.R. 1, we will place our Nation \nat risk because of the impact of the cuts on those who really do \nprotect America.\n  It will further pummel the middle class. I am not going to stand for \nfurther pummeling of the middle class.\n  I am not just a Senator from Maryland. Like the Presiding Officer, I \nam a Senator for Maryland. If we take a look at what H.R. 1 does, it \nreally whacks at Maryland's middle-class families. It cuts job \ntraining, education and access to higher education, much-needed \nchildcare and afterschool programs. Right this very minute, if H.R. 1 \npassed, we would have people lose their Pell grants. A tremendous \nnumber of Marylanders would lose their Pell grants, not only \nnumerically but their grant would be cut by over $500. For a lot of \npeople, that is the money that helps buy textbooks, pays the lab fees \nso they can go on to be a lab tech or a cyber tech in the new economy.\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\n  Let's take a look at the children. They talked about the right to \nlife. I am for a right to life after one is born. I think after one is \nborn, they ought to have a shot. I respect their position. They have to \nrespect ours. Under their Draconian cuts, 2,471 Maryland children would \nlose Head Start opportunities. Head Start is what gets them learning \nready so they can take advantage of our public schools and move on in \nlife. Let's have it for these little children.\n  Then there are those who say we need to compete. I want to compete \ntoo in the global marketplace. So what does that mean? It means we have \nto fund NIH. Under H.R. 1, NIH will be cut $1 billion. In cancer \nscreening alone, 36,000 Marylanders will lose that opportunity, and 5 \nmillion will lose it nationwide. If we look at program after program \nand how it affects women and children and access to education, we are \nthe net losers. If we are going to out-educate and out-innovate, we \ncannot pass H.R. 1, which takes me to why it is bad for Maryland jobs. \nWe have the great honor of representing iconic Federal institutions: \nthe National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Standards, \nGoddard Space Agency, Goddard and Hopkins Space Telescope Institute, \nhome to the great Hubbell telescope which serves the world in what it \ndoes. The fact is, it takes people to work there. If we do these \nDraconian cuts, it will have a tremendous impact. But I am not talking \nabout only government jobs. I am talking about private sector jobs.\n  If H.R. 1 passes, we will lose a tremendous amount in Community \nDevelopment Block Grant money. We will lose $11 million in Community \nDevelopment Block Grant money. So whether one is in Baltimore City, \nmaking its comeback under Mayor Stephanie Rawlings, or in a small rural \ncounty, it could result in 1,000 jobs being lost in construction where \nwe could be creating new housing and new opportunities for economic \ndevelopment. The Speaker of the House says if it is going to cost jobs, \nso be it. Well, so be it is not OK with me.\n  If we look at transportation alone, the cuts in transportation will \ncause Maryland to lose close to $100 million to fix highways, byways, \nbeltways, the kinds of things we need to do that deal with congestion \nand will save lives because we will have safer roads, and create jobs \nin construction. That is over 3,157 Maryland jobs. Those are private \nsector construction jobs.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have visited our great Maryland biotech \ncompanies. They have NIH doing the basic research. They value add it, \nand then they go to FDA. FDA makes sure our prescription drugs are \nsafe. When they have the FDA brand of approval, we can sell them \nanywhere in the world. But under these cuts, we are going to eliminate \n5,000 jobs. What that means is, we are going to further set back the \nbacklog in order to get a biotech, a pharmaceutical or a medical device \napproved. So it is going to cost us jobs in government in Maryland at \nFDA, but it is also going to cost jobs in the private sector in the \nbiotech field, the medical device field, and the pharmaceutical field.\n  Right now the Social Security Administration--the people who \ncalculate and make sure the checks go out on time to the right person--\nis facing possible layoffs and furloughs. We are facing nationwide an \nimmediate possibility of furloughs of 3,500 people. What does that \nmean? The checks will go out, yes. But that means if one is applying \nfor a benefit, they are going to wait a long time. If they have any \nkind of disability, the backlog could increase to as much as 3 to 4 \nyears. They can't apply for Social Security disability. If they are \napplying for disability, it means they are too sick to work. So we are \ngoing to lay off the very people who make sure our checks are developed \nin a timely way.\n  I have more to say, and I will say it as the debate continues. But if \nwe pass H.R. 1, it is a job-killing, middle-class pummeling bill that I \nam going to vote no on and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I also wish to discuss the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related \nAgencies, CJS, in the Senate Continuing Resolution, CR.\n  CJS in the Inouye CR totals $53.6 billion, which is $6.9 billion or \n11 percent below the President's request for FY 2011. This is in \ncontrast to the House Republican CR, which is $900 million lower. I \nsupport the Inouye CR and oppose the House Republican CR because it \nwould undermine our ability to outeducation, outinnovate, and outbuild \nthe rest of the world.\n  Make no mistake, the Inouye CR makes painful cuts, and further cuts \nwill hurt even more. I would like my colleagues to know I will go no \nmore. I am finished cutting.\n  Under the Inouye CR, CJS cuts $420 million from state and local law \nenforcement grants, a 7 percent cut to every grant program, including \nCOPS hiring grants, Byrne grants, grants for bulletproof vests for \npolice officers who walk the thin blue line, and grants to reduce the \nbacklog of DNA evidence.\n  The CR terminates the Weed and Seed program, which helps local \ncommunities fight gangs and crime. State and local law enforcement \nagencies will lose Federal funding they need during a time of austerity \nin their own budgets.\n  Federal law enforcement is funded at substantially below the \nPresident's request in this CR. Specifically, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, FBI, is $500 million below President's request, and the \nDrug Enforcement Agency, DEA, is $110 million below President's \nrequest. The hiring freeze will continue. Vacant positions won't be \nfilled--not just in headquarters--but in our local communities where \nagents are partners in fighting drugs and crime, and tracking down \nsexual predators who prey on our children.\n  The CR provides $6.3 billion for Bureau of Prisons salaries and \nexpenses, which is $245.5 million below the President's FY 2011 budget \nrequest. Prisons will continue to have serious and dangerous \novercrowding, putting the safety of our prison guards at risk.\n  The Justice Department's core capabilities will also be degraded. The \nCR cuts $216 million from internal technology upgrades that are \nsupposed to give the Department better financial management and \naccountability, and better communications with State and local law \nenforcement.\n  This CR cuts the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nNOAA, by $943 million. This cut will jeopardize efforts to fix ongoing \nproblems with the development of NOAA's polar satellites by not \nproviding new funding for the Joint Polar Satellite System. This could \nlead to a gap in weather forecasting data that the military and our \nprivate sector rely upon.\n  The cuts in this CR will already halt plans to pump funds into \nscientific research and discovery that leads to innovation and economic \ngrowth, and education programs that build the next generation of \nscientists and innovators. Specifically, it cuts the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration by $461 million, the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, NIST, by $165 million and the \nNational Science Foundation, NSF, by $573 million. NASA will continue \nto follow the authorizing bill with new path forward for human \nspaceflight, but the Agency won't be able to initiate new space \ntechnology programs. NIST will not have funding for new Technology \nInnovation Partnership, TIP, grants or for competitive science building \nconstruction. NSF will be halted on its path to doubling.\n  While the CR gives the Patent and Trademark Office full access to \nfees paid by inventors, it cuts the International Trade Administration, \nITA, $93 million less than the fiscal year 2011 requested level. This \nwill delay efforts to boost the economy and create jobs by helping more \nU.S. farmers, manufacturers, and service providers sell their products \noverseas.\n  We made many responsible cuts in the CR. It eliminates the $48 \nmillion Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee program, which has not made a \nloan since 2003, and cuts $44 million from the Census, eliminating \nduplicative and overlapping analysis performed by other agencies or \nissued in other ways by Census. The Inouye CR also eliminates one time \nconstruction projects at the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and \nFirearms, and the U.S. Marshals Service.\n  Even with all that, we are being asked to do more. How much more is \nit responsible to cut? I want my colleagues to know, I am done cutting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I was concerned over what the effect of \nH.R. 1 would be on Medicare beneficiaries. I wrote a letter to HHS \nSecretary Sebelius asking that question, what effect passage of H.R. 1 \nwould have on Medicare beneficiaries. I got the answer a couple days \nago. Frankly, it spent a couple days going through the White House, \nOMB, and so forth, but I received the letter last night. What does that \nletter say?\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Dept. of Health & Human Svcs.,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In a recent letter, you asked \n     specifically how Medicare and Medicaid would be affected if \n     the House-passed version of H.R. 1 were enacted. Sections \n     4016 and 4018 of H.R. 1 would preclude use of Continuing \n     Resolution (CR) funds for implementing or carrying out \n     provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n       The Affordable Care Act modifies and improves almost every \n     Medicare payment system--including the inpatient hospital \n     prospective payment system, the outpatient hospital \n     prospective payment system, the physician fee schedule, \n     Medicare Advantage plan payments, and prescription drug plan \n     payments. If H.R.1 were enacted, the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services (CMS) would not be able to use CR funds to \n     administer payments based on any rate calculated on the basis \n     of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act--which is to say \n     virtually all rates.\n       Where the Affordable Care Act effectively repealed prior \n     payment methodologies and replaced them with new ones, H.R. 1 \n     would seem to preclude any payments for the items or services \n     at issue. For example, the Affordable Care Act replaced the \n     old statutory provisions governing payments to Medicare \n     Advantage (MA) organizations with new provisions, including a \n     freeze in payment levels in 2011. Using CR funds to make \n     payments to MA organizations under the new Affordable Care \n     Act provisions would be prohibited by H.R. 1. Moreover, there \n     would not appear to be legal authority to pay MA \n     organizations under the prior payment methodology, given that \n     this methodology was repealed in the Affordable Care Act. \n     This would seem to mean that payments to MA organizations \n     would have to be suspended, risking a significant disruption \n     in services to beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage.\n       In the event that any prior payment methodologies that have \n     not been fully repealed by the Affordable Care Act could be \n     decoupled from all of the additions to the Medicare statute \n     made by the Affordable Care Act, CMS would have to perform \n     extensive analyses to determine whether it could permissibly \n     make payments of some sort. But, even if CMS could do so, it \n     would be required to undertake rulemaking to establish new \n     rates under each payment system, as the existing rates are \n     all in some way dependent on Affordable Care Act authorities. \n     The promulgation of each new rule could take several months \n     to complete. While the new rates were implemented, CMS \n     would be prohibited from paying providers and suppliers at \n     the Affordable Care Act rates.\n       In a system where millions of claims are paid each week, \n     millions of claims would accumulate, which CMS and its \n     contractors would be prohibited from paying at the Affordable \n     Care Act rates. At the point at which claims could begin to \n     be paid at the new rates, it would take many months and \n     significant resources to process the backlog--resources that \n     H.R. 1 would not provide. As a result, providers and \n     suppliers, many of which are small businesses--and, \n     ultimately, beneficiaries--would experience significant \n     disruption.\n       In addition to changes in Medicare payment methodologies, \n     beginning this year, the Affordable Care Act authorizes \n     Medicare to cover annual ``wellness visits'' for \n     beneficiaries and waives coinsurance and deductibles for \n     critical preventive services. Claims could no longer be paid \n     for any of these benefits using CR funds, as payments for \n     these benefits are authorized only by the Affordable Care \n     Act.\n       Many of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act are aimed \n     at slowing the growth rate of spending increases and \n     improving health care for beneficiaries through innovative \n     health service delivery reforms and value-based purchasing. \n     None of these reforms--such as hospital value-based \n     purchasing; payment incentives for reductions of hospital-\n     acquired conditions; and the care transitions program for \n     high-risk Medicare beneficiaries--could be implemented using \n     CR funds.\n       H.R. 1 would adversely affect health care in rural areas as \n     well. As an example, as a means to encourage physicians to \n     provide services in rural areas, the Affordable Care Act \n     established a new 10 percent bonus payment for primary care \n     services furnished by primary care practitioners and for \n     major surgical procedures furnished by general surgeons in \n     shortage areas. Without available CR funding, CMS would no \n     longer be able to provide the bonus to primary care and \n     general surgery physicians for eligible services.\n       The Affordable Care Act also gives CMS new tools to fight \n     fraud and helps us move from a pay-and-chase system to a \n     comprehensive prevention-focused strategy. By precluding the \n     use of CR funds for such efforts, H.R. 1 would substantially \n     impede CMS's proven and successful efforts to reduce fraud \n     and waste in the health care system, resulting in increased \n     erroneous payments. H.R. 1 would effectively require CMS to \n     cease enforcing new screening and enrollment standards, \n     diminish CMS's ability to suspend payments when credible \n     allegations of fraud are uncovered, and reduce resources that \n     have been made available for investments in anti-fraud work.\n       The Affordable Care Act also provided States with a number \n     of opportunities to compete for federal grants and expand \n     eligibility and services for Medicaid beneficiaries at little \n     or no cost to States. Among these are: funding for States to \n     provide incentives to prevent chronic diseases in Medicaid \n     beneficiaries, increased federal funding to provide \n     preventive services for eligible adults in Medicaid, and \n     enhanced funding to assist in providing health homes to \n     Medicaid beneficiaries. Under H.R. 1, CR funds could not be \n     used in furtherance of any of these provisions.\n       The Affordable Care Act also includes numerous other \n     policies to make health care more affordable, accessible, and \n     accountable for seniors, individuals with disabilities, \n     children, and all other Americans, as well as businesses \n     large and small. Its improvements are already woven into the \n     fabric of our health care system. A broad prohibition on the \n     use of CR funds would work to seriously impair or even halt \n     the operation of the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program; the \n     Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan; and the health \n     insurance rate review, consumer assistance, and Exchange \n     grant programs.\n       I hope this information is helpful. We would be happy to \n     answer any additional questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kathleen Sebelius,\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. According to the Secretary of HHS, the consequences for \nMedicare beneficiaries of H.R. 1 are dire, to say the least. I don't \nhave the calculations for the number of Medicare beneficiaries who \nwould be affected nationwide, but I can give my colleagues the effect \nit would have on Montana, and that way they can extrapolate that into \nwhat the effect would be nationwide.\n  Essentially, according to the Secretary's letter, she says that \nbecause the health care reform bill repealed certain provisions in \nMedicare and then replaced them with other provisions to address \nquality and help provide better health care especially for seniors, \nthat H.R. 1, because it repeals the provisions in the health care law \nput in place to provide benefits for seniors, would have the effect of \ncutting health care to seniors.\n  For example, essentially the House amendment would eliminate private \nMedicare coverage under Medicare Advantage. That is the effect of H.R. \n1. If one is a Medicare recipient under a Medicare Advantage plan, \nunder H.R. 1 they would no longer be allowed to receive benefits.\n  In my State of Montana, Medicare Advantage covers about 26,000 \nseniors. That is only the State of Montana. But nationwide, of course, \nit would be hundreds of thousands, probably close to in the millions of \nseniors who would no longer be able to benefit under Medicare \nAdvantage. They would be thrown off. That is what the HHS Secretary \nsays.\n  I will read the significant sentence. I am reading one sentence from \nthe letter, dated March 8:\n\n       This would seem to mean that payments to MA organizations \n     would have to be suspended, risking a significant disruption \n     in services to beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage.\n\n  They would be suspended, according to the interpretation of the HHS \nSecretary of the effect of H.R. 1 on Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Second, it would have virtually the same effect with respect to the \npart D prescription drug benefits; that is, health care reform began to \nclose the doughnut hole. Earlier, seniors received $250 in assistance \nfor prescription drugs. Under the health care reform bill, they would \nbe eligible for a 50-percent discount for brand-name drugs. That, too, \nwould be suspended. That is the effect of H.R. 1--to suspend. Let me \nsee if I can find the operable sentence in the letter. I do not see it \nat the moment. In a few minutes, I will find it and I will give it to \nyou.\n  Add to that the payments for preventive benefits. They, too, would be \nsuspended--wellness programs, such as for colonoscopies, mammographies, \net cetera. She says ``[c]laims could no\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\nlonger be paid for any of these benefits'' as a consequence of H.R. 1.\n  Add to that rural health care.\n\n       Without available CR funding, CMS would no longer be able \n     to provide the bonus to primary care and general surgery \n     physicians for eligible services.\n\n  There are other areas. In the nature of fraud prevention, those \nefforts would be suspended. Of course, some of the proponents who want \nto kill health care reform do not mind some additional provisions I \nmight mention--namely, moving more toward delivery system reform and \ntoward improving the quality of health care and also reducing costs.\n  I do not think the authors of H.R. 1 knew what they were doing. I \nthink they were a little quick in writing their legislation. I do not \nthink they realized the effect of H.R. 1 would be to deny Medicare \nbeneficiaries these payments. Especially, I point out that the Medicare \nbeneficiaries, under Medicare Advantage--according to the HHS \nSecretary, those payments to those persons under Medicare Advantage \nwould have to be suspended.\n  I have a hunch that if we were to look more deeply into the actual \nprovisions of H.R. 1, we would find other similar consequences. Maybe \nit would be in the Medicare Program. It might be in some other health \ncare program. But I just asked the Secretary to focus in on the effects \nto Medicare, and that is the response she gave.\n  I urge all Senators, please let's not cut Medicare Advantage \npayments. That is just not the right thing to do. Innocent seniors are \ngetting caught in this crossfire here. I am sure we have to begin to \ncut Federal spending. There is no question about that. But let's not be \nso foolhardy and unintelligently cut Medicare beneficiaries the way \nH.R. 1 does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I wish to follow up on the comments of the Senators from Montana and \nMaryland who spoke so eloquently and clearly about the consequences of \nadopting the House resolution which sets spending levels for the next \nyear.\n  In my view, a vote for H.R. 1 would be, indeed, a reckless vote \nbecause the consequences of such severe cuts in some areas, as outlined \nparticularly by the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Montana, \nwould be, in fact, reckless, and also, as it relates to my \nsubcommittee, which I want to speak about for a moment, the \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security--not an inconsequential area of our \nresponsibility: protecting the 350-plus million Americans who live in \nthe United States and trust that we are doing our jobs well enough to \nkeep them safe every day from rising threat levels from a variety of \ndifferent sources. That is what our job is on the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and I am going to be voting against H.R. 1 \nbecause, in my view, it goes too far, and it puts our homeland in \njeopardy.\n  Let me be clear. In the State of the Union, the President stated that \nal-Qaida and its affiliates continue to plan attacks against our \nNation. He stressed that extremists are trying to inspire acts of \nviolence by those within our borders. According to the Attorney \nGeneral, in the last 2 years, 126 individuals have been indicted for \nterrorist-related activities, including 50 of our own citizens.\n  The Homeland Security Secretary appeared before my subcommittee last \nweek and said that the threat of terrorist attacks is as high as it has \nbeen since 9/11. And what do the Republican leaders, just newly minted \nand elected, come to Washington to do? Slash the homeland security \nbudget. I am not going to do that, and I urge my colleagues not to do \nthat.\n  In view of these threats, we cannot reduce the homeland security \nbudget to levels that preceded the Christmas Day bombing attempt, the \nTimes Square bombing attempt, the air cargo bombing attempt, and the \nFort Hood shooting and before the escalation of violence and drugs \nalong the Mexican border. We had one of our agents gunned down just 3 \nweeks ago. What does this budget do that they are recommending? Slash \nborder security. We literally spilled blood on this floor, almost, \nbuilding that fence along the border and adding border security. Now \nthey want to dismantle it? I do not think so.\n  The bill makes deep cuts in State and local grants to train and equip \nfirst responders. Do they think it is going to be the FBI agents who \nare walking around Times Square every day looking for a smoking car? \nNo. It is going to likely be a local New York firefighter or police \nofficer or a citizen walking by noticing something and calling the \npolice. We have very small--really, relatively small--training grants \navailable. They cut that by over 50 percent. Is that smart? I do not \nthink so.\n  The House bill cuts border security infrastructure programs when \nviolence in Mexico is at an unprecedented level.\n  The House bill will cut Coast Guard acquisitions despite a need to \nrecapitalize its aging fleet and when the Coast Guard mission continues \nto expand, as was so clear not even a year ago, on April 20, when the \nDeep Horizon exploded. Whom did you call when you went to 911 and said \nthere is a rig on fire? Whom did we call? The Coast Guard. How did they \nget to the rig? On cutters and boats that we built. What did they do \nwith the Coast Guard budget? They cut it almost below maintenance \nlevels for situations such as this.\n  The House bill cuts port security and transit security when the \nMumbai, London, and Madrid terrorist attacks proved that those sectors \nare vulnerable. How many more terrorists have to attack trains before \nwe realize there is a level you cannot go beneath without putting our \ncitizens at risk? And we are perilously close to that level.\n  The House bill reduces Transportation Security Administration \nprocurement for its explosive-detection technologies that TSA needs to \nrespond, as we have developed since the attempted bombing at \nChristmastime.\n  Cyber security--I have not even spoken about this. It is very \ndifficult, and some of this is classified information, and it is not \nsomething people can really grasp as well as they can understand \nexplosives on trains and airplanes, which is, I guess, easier to \nvisualize.\n  These attacks through our Internet and through the new \ninterconnecting technologies now that our electric grid and all of our \ncompanies depend on need to be countered as well.\n  Amendment No. 149 addresses these cuts while making responsible cuts \nin lower priority programs. \n  The House bill cuts port security grants by 66 percent despite the \nfact that our ports produce over $3 trillion of economic activity and \njobs for 13 million American workers and the Mumbai attacks proved the \nvulnerability of ports. The Senate bill would maintain the fiscal year \n2010 level of $300 million.\n  H.R. 1 would cut transit security grants by 66 percent, despite the \nfact that there have been over 1,300 attacks, killing or injuring over \n18,000 people worldwide on trains and subways over the last 7 years. \nThe Senate amendment would maintain the fiscal year 2010 level of $300 \nmillion.\n  I say to all of my friends who get on a plane and expect it to be \nsafe that H.R. 1 would cut $562 million from the President's request \nfor the Transportation Security Administration to provide our airports \nwith scanners, screeners, and K-9 teams. Under H.R. 1, funding for the \nTransportation Security Administration would be below the operating \nlevel on December 25, 2009, when a Nigerian terrorist tried to blow up \nNorthwest flight 253 over the United States. As a result, TSA would \nonly be able to purchase 250 additional advanced imaging technology \nbody scanners, instead of the 500 requested, and 415 additional \nportable explosives trace detection units, instead of the 800 units \nrequested. The Senate Democratic alternative restores these cuts.\n  H.R. 1 would cut the precise agencies--FEMA, the Coast Guard, and \nState and local first responders--that are supposed to help us prevent \nor respond to future disasters. The Senate version restores these cuts.\n  Under H.R. 1, the Coast Guard would not be able to award production \nof the fifth National Security Cutter, NSC, delaying the project by a \nyear and driving up costs by $45 to $60 million. The Senate amendment \nfully funds the $692 million necessary to complete NSC, No. 5. National \nSecurity Cutters are replacing the Coast Guard's 40-year-old\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\nfleet of high endurance cutters, which are increasingly unavailable due \nto equipment breakdowns. The Senate amendment also includes funds to \nhire 55 additional Coast Guard personnel to improve their capacity to \nrespond to oilspills.\n  The Senate amendment provides $189 million more than the House bill \nfor the border security agencies--Customs and Border Protection and \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement. Within that amount, the Senate \nbill provides $150 million more than the House bill for border security \ninfrastructure and technology, providing our Border Patrol agents with \nthe assets they need to help secure the northern and southern borders. \nCuts to border technology made by the House bill would postpone for at \nleast 1 year the procurement, construction, and deployment of new \nremote video surveillance systems in Arizona and reduce by 50 percent \nfunds available for tactical communications modernization along the \nSouthwest border.\n\n  H.R. 1 provides no funding to continue construction of the DHS \nHeadquarters at the St. Elizabeths campus in Washington, DC. Congress \nhas appropriated $1.1 billion for the project, but the House action \nwould leave a half-built building, sitting in the mud. This decision \nwill delay completion of the Coast Guard headquarters by at least 1 \nyear and increase costs by $69 million. The Senate amendment provides \n$91.4 million to complete the Coast Guard headquarters.\n  The House bill cuts emergency management performance grants by 12 \npercent. The events surrounding Hurricanes Katrina and Rita highlighted \nthe critical importance of effective catastrophic all-hazards planning. \nThe Senate amendment maintains the $340 million fiscal year 2010 level.\n  H.R. 1 would reduce science and technology research and development \nfunding by 69 percent, forgoing critical investments in the next \ngeneration of explosives detection systems, chemical and biological \nweapons detection systems, radiological and nuclear detection systems, \nas well as sensors and other technologies to help secure the borders. \nThe Senate version reduces funding by only 19 percent, a difficult but \nresponsible reduction.\n  The House bill makes deep cuts to cyber security, which is \nunconscionable, since the President has said, ``the cyber threat is one \nof the most serious economic and national security challenges we \nface''. The House cuts would delay deployment of the Einstein program--\nour network intrusion detection and protection program--reducing \nprotection coverage of Federal agency networks by 12 percent, reduce \ncyber attack response efforts by 25 percent, reduce international \ncollaboration, and reduce our development of advanced tools needed to \nkeep pace with new and evolving cyber threats.\n  In order to make these restorations, the Senate amendment rescinds \nover $545 million of low priority unobligated balances and reduces \nlower priority programs by over $900 million below fiscal year 2010 \nlevels.\n  My goal is to produce a fiscally responsible Homeland Security bill \nthat provides the Department with the resources it needs to prepare \nfor, respond to, and recover from all threats, both manmade and \nnatural. It is essential that we provide the Department with the \nresources that it needs to be nimble in preparing for and responding to \nan evolving threat.\n  I urge Members to support amendment No. 149 to H.R. 1.\n  As I said, the House bill, H.R. 1, cuts port security grants by 66 \npercent, transportation security grants by 66 percent. It cuts FEMA, \nand it cuts the Coast Guard below levels that are safe.\n  Homeland Security is the newest agency. I realize we have to make \ncuts and bring our budget into balance. If this were a plan to get us \nto a balanced budget, I would support it. But it is not. It is just a \nplan that jeopardizes our homeland security and does not do very much \nat all to close that deficit gap. When a real plan is present, I will \nvote for it. Until then, I am voting no.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the badly misguided budget cuts contained \nin the legislation the House has sent to us threaten to strangle our \nfragile economic recovery before it can truly begin. The House bill \nwould weaken the social safety net that helps keep our communities \ntogether; it would end education opportunities that give Americans a \nchance to succeed; it would weaken investments in science and new \ntechnologies that we need to make our Nation competitive globally; and \nit would make our Nation less secure.\n  Our colleagues in the House have diagnosed a patient with heart \ndisease--and prescribed amputation. Their proposed cure would do little \nto heal the disease of budget deficits, and in the meantime, do a lot \nof damage to the patient. They propose to solve our budget woes by \nslashing nondefense discretionary spending--which makes up a mere 15 \npercent or so of the Federal budget. In fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice told us just this week that if we eliminated all nondefense \ndiscretionary spending--every last dime of it--we would still run \nbudget deficits by 2016. We cannot solve the budget problem this way, \nno matter how hard our Republican friends try to convince Americans \nthat we can.\n  Republicans say we should interpret their drastic, unbalanced and \nextreme legislation as sending a message on their seriousness about the \ndeficit. But the only message it sends is that they are serious about \neroding important programs from Head Start to job training to Pell \ngrants to food inspections to border security.\n  This legislation would cut $61 million from the Presidential budget \nrequest for food inspections, sending the message that we don't need to \nworry about food safety, despite the thousands of Americans every year \nwho suffer from food-borne illness. It would cut over $1 billion from \nthe Women, Infants and Children Program, sending the message that we \nshould do less to help poor families put food on the table.\n  Our Republican colleagues are serious about cutting more than $180 \nmillion from the Securities and Exchange Commission budget and more \nthan $100 million from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission budget, \nsending the message that we don't need to put cops on the beat to \npolice financial markets that all too recently devastated our economy.\n  They are serious about cutting nearly $290 million from Veterans \nAdministration efforts to provide better service to our veterans.\n  Their bill would cut $1 billion in funding for community health \ncenters, sending the message that health care for citizens who would \nlose it under this proposal is a secondary concern. They would remove \n$17 million from the research on immunization and respiratory disease, \na message that we can cut back on efforts to fight childhood illness.\n  Their bill would cut $550 million from the National Science \nFoundation research budget, and another $1.1 billion from Department of \nEnergy research. It would cut about $900 million from our support of \nrenewable energy sources and energy conservation--sending a message \nthat we need not worry about high gas prices and dependence on imported \noil.\n  Their bill would cut $2 billion from clean water programs, putting \npublic health at risk, and cut $250 million from Great Lakes \nrestoration efforts, putting at greater risk our unique Great Lakes, on \nwhich hundreds of thousands of jobs depend.\n  The Republican bill would cut more than $1 billion from Head Start. \nTheir message seems to be that 200,000 American children don't really \nneed an early childhood education boost so they can grow up to compete \nin a global economy. Their bill would also cut or eliminate Pell grants \nfor hundreds of thousands of college students. The Republican message: \nAmerican families don't need help to meet the rising cost of college.\n  Speaker Boehner's Web site proclaims that ``[s]ecuring our borders \nand stopping the flood of illegal immigration into the United States \nmust be the first priority of this Congress.'' So what does the House \nbill do? It cuts more than $120 million from the President's request \nand more than $350 million from the fiscal 2010 level from border \nsecurity efforts.\n  Now, the supporters of the House bill tell us that they regret the \nneed for these cuts, that these would be worthy programs in happier \ntimes, but that the fiscal straits in which we find ourselves make \ntheir cuts necessary. They say we have no choice.\n  That is false. We do have a choice. We can end the excessive tax cuts \nfor\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\nupper income taxpayers that President Bush put in place, and close tax \nloopholes that not only drain the treasury but send American jobs \nabroad to boot.\n  The cost to the government of those upper income tax cuts is an \nincrease in the deficit of about $30 billion a year. Ending that $30 \nbillion tax cut for the wealthy--for the roughly 2 percent of Americans \nat the very top--could allow us to avoid the drastic cuts in important \nprograms that I have mentioned, and much more besides.\n  It is very difficult in my book to treat proposals adding $30 billion \na year to the deficit by protecting tax cuts for upper income earners \nas serious deficit reduction.\n  There are also other revenues we can look to if we are truly serious \nabout deficit reduction. There are a number of tax loopholes that we \ncan close. For example, we should not continue to give corporations a \ntax deduction when they send American jobs overseas. We should not \nallow corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid U.S. taxes by \nhiding assets and income in offshore tax havens. And we should not \nallow hedge fund managers to earn enormous incomes and yet pay a lower \ntax rate than their secretaries and janitors pay.\n  When we are willing to tackle those issues, when we recognize that \nthe solution to our deficits must be comprehensive, when we acknowledge \nthat it must include revenues, when we acknowledge the need to close \nthose tax loopholes, then the American people will know we are serious \nabout deficit reduction. Then, and only then, will we be able to tackle \nthe deficit without threatening the education of our children, or \nmaking it harder to afford college, or cutting food programs for \nchildren, or damaging our support for science and technology, or making \nour border less secure, or reducing efforts to find new sources of \nenergy, or setting back so many other investments in our future well-\nbeing.\n  I commend Senator Inouye for his attempts to craft an alternative \npackage that would avoid the draconian cuts that Republicans have \nproposed. But I cannot support that legislation. It deals only with \ncuts in nondefense discretionary spending, and as a result it gives \nsupport to a pattern of debating only spending cuts as the solution to \nour deficits, when it fact the solution to this problem must include \nadditional revenue as well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to share my perspectives \nabout the funding for agencies and programs under the jurisdiction of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General \nGovernment. It has been my privilege to chair this subcommittee for \nover 4 years.\n  Overall, the Senate CR includes $23.25 billion for financial services \naccounts. This represents a cut of $2.268 billion, or 9 percent, below \nthe President's fiscal year 2011 budget request of $25.518 billion.\n  Compared to the fiscal year 2010 enacted level of $24.355 billion--\nthe amount presently available under the continuing resolution--the \nfunding in the Senate CR is a reduction of over $1.1 billion. This is a \ncut of over 4 percent below a freeze.\n  In comparison, the House funding of $20.513 billion for financial \nservices is a cut of $3.84 billion, or 16 percent, below a freeze. This \nis extreme. It is harmful. It is unacceptable.\n  The Senate approach, while making significant and difficult cuts, \nrestores $2.737 billion of irresponsible cuts made in H.R. 1. The \nSenate CR preserves reasonable funding to minimize erosions in critical \ngovernment programs and prevent harmful setbacks in the delivery of \nimportant public services.\n  Let me take this opportunity to illustrate some of the harsh, \ndetrimental reductions included in H.R. 1, and why the funding \nrecommended in the Senate CR offers a prudent alternative.\n  For the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, \nor CDFI, the Senate CR provides $247 million, a freeze to the fiscal \nyear 2010 level. CDFI funds provide seed financing in our nation's most \nchallenged communities for projects such as affordable housing \ndevelopments, retail developments, small business lending, and \ncommunity facilities such as day care centers and charter schools.\n  Each dollar of Federal spending provides confidence for private \ninvestors. For example, last year, the Community Investment \nCorporation, a CDFI in Illinois, leveraged a $1 million Federal grant \ninto $400 million of total financing from 33 banks for affordable \nhousing. CDFI funds offer a lifeline for small businesses and \ncommunities that would otherwise have no option to find financing \nduring these tough economic times. CDFI funds are truly the ``last \nmile'' of financing in struggling communities.\n  By contrast, H.R. 1 reduces funding for the CDFI Fund to a mere $50 \nmillion, a drastic 80-percent reduction below the Senate CR level. If \nenacted, H.R. 1's cuts to the CDFI Fund would result in the loss of an \nestimated $1.6 billion in private sector leveraging for investment in \nAmerica's most challenged communities.\n  This huge reduction in financing would cause the loss of 19,200 new \njobs that would otherwise be created, the loss of 14,100 affordable \nhousing units that would otherwise be built, and the loss of 3,200 \nsmall business loans that would otherwise be made. It would be a \nmistake to enact H.R. 1's cuts to CDFI. The Senate CR level is a \nresponsible way to maintain investment in our Nation's most challenged \ncommunities during these tough economic times.\n  For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $286 million is \nprovided in the Senate CR. On the other hand, H.R. 1 decimates the \nresources for this agency by slashing funding down to a meager $112 \nmillion. This is a cut of $57 million, or 33 percent, below a freeze at \nthe current level of $168.8 million. The Senate level supports \nnecessary staffing increases and key information technology investments \nto help the CFTC better protect the average investor and increase \nsafeguards against excessive speculation.\n  The House level would prevent the CFTC from meeting its mission to \nmonitor the markets. It would jeopardize CFTC's work to ensure that the \never evolving world of commodity futures--diversified products from \ngrains to gold, from currencies to carbon credits--are free from \nmanipulation, fraud, and abusive trading and sales practices. Futures \nprices--and CFTC's oversight role--impact what we pay for the basic \nnecessities of everyday life: our food, our clothing, fuel in our \nvehicles, and heat in our homes. The House sledgehammer cut to the CFTC \nis irresponsible and irrational.\n  For the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Senate CR provides \n$1.3 billion, consistent with the authorized level for fiscal year \n2011. These funds support increased legal and investigative staffing \nfor oversight and enforcement responsibilities as well as substantial \ninvestments in IT upgrades. By contrast, H.R. 1 cuts resources for the \nSEC to $1.069 billion. This is a reduction of $41 million, or 4 \npercent, below a freeze. It is a decrease of $231 million, or 18 \npercent, below the authorized level.\n  Among a long list of expected setbacks, the decreased funding in H.R. \n1 will severely limit SEC's ability to police the markets and enforce \nFederal securities laws to protect investors from deceptive financial \nschemes. It will limit SEC's pursuit of quality complaints, tips, and \nreferrals and will stall investigations.\n  Less funding will diminish the SEC's ability to conduct public \ncompany oversight, review public filings of large financial \ninstitutions, and decrease the frequency of reviews of smaller and mid-\nsized companies to less than once every 3 years. Is this really what we \nwant in the wake of the Wall Street fiasco?\n  H.R. 1 cuts mean that outmoded technology will languish without \ncritical modernization, leaving the SEC to lag far behind the \nindustries it regulates. SEC will be hampered in its ability to collect \nthe tremendous amounts of market data needed to better identify, \naddress, and prevent activities and events that can disrupt markets and \nharm investors, such as those that occurred on May 6, 2010--the ``flash \ncrash''. Why supporters of H.R. 1 want to undercut this watchdog agency \nis hard to comprehend.\n  For the Small Business Administration, the Senate CR provides $762 \nmillion, in essence a freeze at the fiscal year 2010 level due to \navailable carryover balances. In contrast, H.R. 1 reduces SBA's \noperating budget by $25 million compared to the Senate CR. This cut \nwould reduce staff across the entire SBA. Reducing staff would cause a \nbacklog in loan approvals under SBA's loan programs that support over\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\n$20 billion a year in financing for new and expanding small businesses. \nA loan approval backlog would impose delays and uncertainty in \nfinancing for small businesses during a critical time in the Nation's \neconomic recovery.\n  The cut to SBA would also scale back the ability of SBA's field staff \nto serve small businesses seeking credit and business counseling \nresources. This will deprive small businesses of critical \n``matchmaking'' connections to banks participating in SBA's loan \nprograms and to counseling programs for starting and growing small \nbusinesses. The Senate CR funding for SBA is a responsible alternative \nto H.R. 1's reckless cut. The Senate CR will keep SBA operational to \nsupport American small businesses working towards economic recovery.\n  For tax law enforcement, the Senate CR provides $5.59 billion to the \nInternal Revenue Service. It is a modest but rational increase of $87 \nmillion, or 1.6 percent, above the fiscal year 2010 enacted level of \n$5.5 billion. The funding includes critical resources for targeting \noffshore tax evasion.\n  In contrast, H.R. 1 cuts tax law enforcement to $5.219 billion, which \nis $285 million, or 5 percent, below a freeze. Cutting IRS resources is \ncounterintuitive to the goal of reducing the Federal deficit. Under \nH.R. 1, lost enforcement revenue could surpass well over $4 billion. \nReductions under H.R. 1 would necessitate furloughing all enforcement \nemployees for up to 19 business days and/or significant RIFs.\n  Among other consequences, the H.R. 1 cut means 164,000 fewer \nindividual and business audits, directly affecting the performance of \nIRS's enforcement revenue efforts and reducing overall compliance. It \nwill mean 8,400 fewer taxpayer appeals case closures, as fewer \ntaxpayers are able to turn to the appeals process to resolve disputed \ntax controversies.\n  Moreover, 310 fewer criminal cases will be completed, 216 fewer \nconvictions will be realized, and an estimated $67 million in asset \nforfeiture revenue will be sacrificed. It also means the discontinuance \nof fraud cases related to the Return Preparer Program, drug trafficking \ntax cases, and interagency efforts in coordination with the Justice \nDepartment and Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  For the General Services Administration, the Senate CR would provide \n$591 million for construction of Federal buildings, providing \ncontinuation funding for multiyear, consolidation projects and nearly \n$398 million for repair of Federal buildings and courthouses. In \ncontrast, H.R. 1 eliminates all funding for Federal building \nconstruction and all major repairs for Federal buildings. Overall, the \nSenate CR reduces GSA programs below fiscal year 2010 levels and by a \ntotal of approximately $1 billion below fiscal year 2011 requested \nlevels.\n  The House approach is irresponsible because it defers Federal \nconstruction projects, making them more expensive; results in more \nFederal leasing, which is more expensive over the long-term than \nfederally owned space; and prevents Federal agencies from operating as \nefficiently as possible due to delays in moving into new space \nnecessary to meet mission requirements.\n  In addition, eliminating the construction and repair projects could \ncost as many as 16,000 private sector jobs in the construction and \nrelated industries. It would also delay other benefits associated with \nFederal capital projects, including economic development and \n``multiplier effects'' of infusions of Federal spending into local \neconomies.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, it is likely that neither the House \nnor Senate version of the fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution will \npass this body.\n  I would like to highlight one feature of both of the bills we are \nconsidering that I believe is truly misguided. Neither bill provides \nfunding to continue the alternate engine program for the F-35 airplane.\n  In the past, Congress has supported this engine in a bipartisan, \nbicameral way as a lower cost, higher performance alternate that will \nsave billions in tax dollars and give the F35 engine program \ncompetition it badly needs.\n  There has been significant misinformation circulated about the \nalternate engine program, which, based on previous experience with \nengine competition programs, should actually reduce the Federal deficit \nby more than $20 billion.\n  During the 1980s, the Air Force and Navy jointly qualified second \nsources for the Sidewinder, Sparrow, Amraam, Maverick, Standard, \nTomahawk, and Ham missile programs. In every case, buying from both \nsources brought costs down dramatically. That same strategy brought \ncosts down and under budget for the FFG-7 frigates, DDG-51 destroyers, \nAegis Cruisers, and attack submarines.\n  Absent the F35 alternative engine program, a company that is \ncurrently $3.5 billion over budget will be the monopoly provider of the \nengine for the F35 airplane. This is not the way taxpayers want \nWashington to do business.\n  The alternate engine program supports 2,500 jobs in the United \nStates, 800 of those in Ohio. My State's unemployment rates is already \n9.3 percent, and it would be a tragedy if we eliminate jobs that are \nactually serving to reduce federal spending and protect against faulty \nor delayed access to engines needed by our military.\n  I am disappointed no funds are contained in either bill. I don't \nbelieve you walk quietly away from a $100 billion program that has \nbillions of tax dollars invested in it without a vigorous debate. In \ndeleting the alternate engine, both bills eliminated a line item today \nat the expense of significant savings downstream.\n  We are not going to end the budget deficit by haphazardly taking \ndollars out of investments justified not only by their public policy \npurpose--in this case, equipping our military in the most responsible, \nefficient means possible--but by their potential to produce major \ndownstream savings.\n  It is unclear how the negotiations on getting a budget deal will \nproceed and it is equally clear that they will be hard. But the future \nof this engine must be on the agenda.\n  Our safety and security as a nation and the seriousness of the budget \nchoices that face us are simply too important to let expediency get the \nbetter of common sense. Exploring what is best for our military and our \nbudget goals must be part of the continuing resolution negotiations.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, over the past few weeks, I have listened \nto several of my colleagues say that the Defense budget should be \nfurther reduced. Other Members are concerned that this bill cuts too \nmuch funding out of the Department of Defense.\n  I believe the Defense bill before you today strikes a fair balance \nbetween responsible reductions and protection of our military forces.\n  The defense portion of this bill provides a total of $671.5 billion \nin base and overseas contingency operation funding for fiscal year \n2011.\n  The base budget is $513.6 billion, which is $17.3 billion less than \nthe President's budget request. This bill cuts an additional $2.13 \nbillion more than H.R. 1 for defense. I believe that these reductions \nare prudent, and reflect the reality of today's challenging fiscal \nenvironment where all programs are subject to reductions.\n  But let me be clear--this bill continues to fully support our men and \nwomen in uniform and protects funding for four important national \nsecurity priorities.\n  First, the bill takes care of our military personnel. It fully funds \nthe 1.4 percent authorized pay raise and provides $887 million above \nthe budget request to cover shortfalls in the military personnel \naccounts that were identified by the services.\n  Second, the bill fully funds health care for the military and their \nfamilies. The bill provides $32.8 billion for the Defense Health \nProgram, continues advancements in medical research, modernizes and \nmaintains medical infrastructure, and develops the next generation of \nelectronic medical records.\n  In addition, the bill adds $100 million for peer-reviewed research in \npsychological health and traumatic brain injury.\n  Third, the bill fully funds key readiness programs critical to \nprepare forces for combat operations and other peace time missions, \nincluding flying hours and steaming days, depot maintenance, training, \nspare parts, and base operations.\n  Additional funding is included to provide for shortfalls identified \nby the\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\nArmy for base operations, for the Navy and Air Force for depot \nmaintenance, and tuition assistance for military spouses.\n  Fourth, the bill provides additional funding to protect our forces, \nincluding new equipment and upgrades to existing programs to ensure \nthat our military has the hardware needed to conduct operations and \ntrain during a time of war. High-priority programs are increased, such \nas:\n  The replacement of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft lost in \nbattle, and increased production of Army and Air Force helicopters \nurgently needed to support combat operations in Afghanistan;\n  Support for critical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, \nISR, initiatives, including procurement of 48 Reaper unmanned aerial \nvehicles and more than $2.5 billion of ISR programs identified by the \nSecretary of Defense as high priority for troops overseas;\n  Better protection of deployed military personnel, such as $3.4 \nbillion to fully fund Mine Resistant Ambush Protected-All Terrain \nVehicles and an additional $225 million to test and procure the Stryker \nDouble V Hull for additional protection from IEDs;\n  An additional $850 million for the National Guard and Reserve to \nensure that our Reserve components have the equipment needed to conduct \ntheir growing missions.\n  Furthermore, the bill continues our goal to transfer responsibility \nto our partners in Afghanistan and Iraq so that our forces can safely \nand responsibly withdrawal.\n  The bill provides $11.6 billion for the Afghanistan security forces \nfund, $1.5 billion for the Iraq security forces fund, $500 million for \nthe Commander's emergency response program, and $400 million for the \nAfghanistan infrastructure fund.\n  However, the Department of Defense is not immune from budget \nreductions. I believe this bill judiciously cuts defense spending, \nwhile improving fiscal accountability. Nearly 760 defense programs are \nreduced in the package before you today.\n  These funding cuts are made as a result of program terminations or \ndelays, changes to policy or programs since submission of the budget \nover a year ago, inadequate justification, authorization adjustments, \nor corrections to poor fiscal discipline.\n  For instance, the bill cuts nearly $2 billion out of the Joint Strike \nFighter program due to production and testing delays. Over $450 million \nis deleted from the bill due to the termination of the non-line of \nsight launch system.\n  The bill rescinds $1.2 billion from prior year funding in 45 \ndifferent programs due to poor execution, delays or terminations. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  This is a fair bill for the Department of Defense. It is a bipartisan \ncompromise between responsibly reducing defense spending while at the \nsame time providing for our men and women in uniform that are fighting \na war in Afghanistan, winding down operations in Iraq, and operating \naround the globe to protect this Nation's security.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want us to remember why we are here. The \nreason we are here right now debating this issue is because last year \nthe Democratic majority failed to pass a budget. They did not pass a \nbudget and did not pass a single appropriations bill. This is a $3.7 \ntrillion enterprise called the Federal Government. Last year, we did \nnot pass a budget. We did not pass a single appropriations bill. So \nthis is cleaning up the unfinished business of last year.\n  It was always said that we could not do this before the election. So \nwhen the election was over with, instead of dealing with these \nimportant budget issues, we did a START treaty, which, of course, was \nimportant to debate; don't ask, don't tell; the DREAM Act; all kinds of \nother things but never the budget. We did not deal with the budget. So \nhere we are dealing with last year's unfinished business.\n  So when my colleagues come in here and make all these arguments about \nhow terrible it is that we are having to do this and the House \nRepublicans have sent us this budget that shaves $60 billion from last \nyear's spending levels, the reason we are having to go through this \nexercise in the first place is because last year the Democratic \nmajority did not even pass a budget.\n  Where does that leave us today? Well, we all know we have a $14 \ntrillion debt--$14 trillion. I think that has sunk in with the American \npeople. To put that into perspective, historically, this last month--\nthe month of February--our debt was $223 billion. Our deficit, in other \nwords--what we added to the debt--was $223 billion in 1 month--the \nlargest single monthly total ever. We added more to the debt last month \nthan we did from the founding of our country until 1945--in just 1 \nmonth.\n  The projected deficit for this entire year is $1.65 trillion--the \nlargest ever in nominal terms. And OMB predicts it to be the largest as \na share of our economy since World War II. That is as much debt as we \nran up from the founding of our country until 1985. This is the \ndimension of the problem we are dealing with.\n  There is an old saying that if you are in a hole, stop digging. Well, \nwe continue to dig the hole deeper and deeper and deeper. So we are \ngoing to have votes today on a couple of alternatives.\n  One is the alternative that was sent over from the House of \nRepresentatives which shaves $60 billion off of last year's spending \nlevel. So there are lots of people coming down here, and there is all \nkinds of gnashing of teeth and statements of how Draconian these \nvarious cuts are going to be. Mr. President, $60 billion, remember, in \na $3.7 trillion budget is less than 2 percent. Now, to the average \nAmerican, if they were like we are at the Federal level and out of \nevery dollar they spent, they were borrowing over 40 cents and running \n$1.5 trillion and $1.6 trillion deficits year over year over year, I \nthink they would figure out a way to tighten their belts a little bit \nand be able to absorb a 1.5-percent cut over last year's spending \nlevel.\n  Now, couple that with the fact that since 2008 spending has increased \nby 22 percent. Nondefense discretionary spending, which is what we are \ntalking about here, has gone up 22 percent--10 times the rate of \ninflation. All we are talking about here is going back to 2008 levels. \nThis is not Draconian. I think the American people think this is \nreasonable.\n  So what does the other side put forward? The other side said: Well, \nwe think this is Draconian, and so we are going to put forward a \nproposal that cuts $4.7 billion--$4.7 billion compared to $60 billion. \nMr. President, $4.7 billion is what the other side puts on the table in \nterms of spending reduction in trying to do something about our runaway \nFederal debt. Well, if you look at the clock today, it is 2:45 p.m. By \nthis time tomorrow--2:45 p.m. tomorrow--we will have added over $4 \nbillion to the debt--almost as much as they are proposing to save for \nthe balance of this entire year. So they are laying forward savings of \n$4.7 billion for the rest of the fiscal year, when between now and this \ntime tomorrow we will add over $4 billion to the Federal debt. That is \nthe dimension of what we are talking about.\n\n  It is so bad that former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said recently \nthat he views the probability or the possibility of a debt crisis \noccurring in the next 2 to 3 years to be 50 percent--debt crisis. If \nthat is not enough, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nhighest ranking military official in this country, ADM Mike Mullen, \nsaid a few months back that the greatest threat to America's national \nsecurity is our national debt. How much more do we have to hear? It is \nnot just a threat to our future and to future generations; it is a \nthreat to our national security, and it is a threat to our economy.\n  We have all kinds of evidence out there that this level of spending \nand this amount of debt costs jobs in our economy. Everybody says the \nmost important thing we want to focus on is the economy and job \ncreation. I agree with that. One of the best ways to do that is to \nstart getting spending and debt under control. There is a great variety \nof research out there that studied the last eight centuries of \ngovernments and concluded that when your gross debt reaches the 90-\npercent level of your total economy--in other words, gross debt to GDP \nequals 90 percent--that it costs you about 1 percentage point of \neconomic growth every year. According to Christina Romer, the\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\nformer economic adviser to the President, every time you lose 1 \npercentage point of economic growth, you lose 1 million jobs. So if we \ncontinue to sustain this level of debt, it is costing us economic \ngrowth, which is costing us literally jobs every single day.\n  A couple of weeks ago the Government Accountability Office issued a \nreport and in it they looked at the government and the various agencies \nof government and how much it costs and looked for duplication and \nredundancy and inefficiency. What did they conclude? They concluded \nthat there are 82 programs in this country across 10 different agencies \nand departments of government that are designed to improve teacher \nquality; granted, a very noble goal, but does it take 82 Federal \nprograms and 10 agencies or departments to administer programs \nimproving teacher quality? There are 56 Federal programs out there \nwhich teach people how to manage their finances. When you are running a \n$14 trillion debt, arguably this is probably the last place that ought \nto be advising people about managing their finances. But 56 Federal \nprograms? The American people have to be looking at this, and it is \nincomprehensible to them, I think, to see what their Federal Government \nwastes money on.\n  What we are talking about here is a fairly reasonable reduction in \nnondefense, nonnational security discretionary spending. I hope today \nwe will take a step forward and demonstrate we are serious. What the \nDemocrats put forward, $4.7 billion, isn't serious. It completely \nignores and appears to be in denial of the dimensions of this problem, \nwhich I think are wholly grasped by the American people. In fact, we \nhad testimony yesterday in front of the Senate Budget Committee from \nErskine Bowles and Senator Al Simpson who headed the debt commission \nand said this is the most predictable crisis we have ever had. We see \nit coming. We know it is coming. We can do something about it, and we \nare trying to today.\n  It is about jobs. People have gotten up on the other side and said, \nWell, it is going to cut this or cut that. The majority leader said \nyesterday we can't do this because it would cut funding at the Cowboy \nPoetry Festival. When you are out of every dollar you are spending, \nborrowing more than 40 cents; when you are running a $14 trillion \ndebt--there are priorities, arguably, that are important in terms of \nFederal priorities. I don't think that probably counts as one of them \nand I don't think the American people would think so either.\n  The Senator from Montana said this is going to cut people from \nMedicare Advantage. What about the health care reform bill last year? \nThat cut $2 billion in Medicare Advantage and would leave literally a \nquarter of those people who get benefits under Medicare Advantage \nwithout that coverage today. That wasn't a big talking point for the \nother side when we were doing health care reform last year. Yet, today, \nagain, we hear typical rhetorical scare tactics. But what I want to \nremind my colleagues of and remind the American people of is that over \nthe last 2 years, nondefense discretionary spending has increased 22 \npercent.\n  All we are talking about is going back to 2008 levels. Since that \ntime, it has increased 10 times the rate of inflation. We need to start \nliving within our means. We cannot continue to spend money we don't \nhave.\n  I hope my colleagues will support H.R. 1 and let the American people \nknow we are serious about getting our fiscal house in order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 11 minutes 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Chair let me know when 2 minutes remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota \nfor his eloquent remarks. He phrased exactly the question before this \nbody on which we are going to be casting two votes within a few \nminutes, and that is this: Will we or will we not stop spending money \nwe don't have? I repeat, the question is: Will we or will we not stop \nspending money we don't have? Do we have the courage and the common \nsense and the sense of responsibility to make difficult decisions for \nthe future of our country when it comes to spending and debt?\n  Let's look at the facts. The Federal Government this year is \ncollecting $2.2 trillion--that is what is coming in--and spending $3.7 \ntrillion. We are collecting $2.2 trillion in revenue, and we are \nspending $3.7 trillion in revenue. That is a fact.\n  Here is another fact: Forty cents of every dollar the Federal \nGovernment spends is borrowed, much of it from China.\n  Here is another fact: We are piling up new debt at the rate of $4 \nbillion a day--$4 billion a day of new debt. Here is another fact: Last \nmonth was the shortest month of the year--February. The deficit--that \nis this year's deficit in just that month--was the largest in history: \n$223 billion. And our friends on the other side are suggesting we solve \na problem of this dimension by reducing spending by $4.7 billion. As \nSenator Thune said, by tomorrow, at about this time, we will have piled \nup as much more debt as they propose to save. That is not urgent; that \nis not responsible; that is not dealing with difficult decisions in the \nway people expect us to do.\n  The Republicans in the House of Representatives have stepped up and \nhave made difficult decisions. We might not agree with every single \ndetail of the decision, and the Senate will have its own priorities \nwhen we pass a bill, but I, for one--and I think many others on this \nside of the aisle--are going to vote for H.R. 1, the House-passed $57 \nbillion cut, because it is a sure step toward reducing spending and \nstopping our country from spending money we don't have. Senate \nDemocrats say, Sorry, we can only find $4.7 billion to save.\n  The purpose of the vote I will cast today is to say we have an urgent \nneed that needs to be addressed. We have a sense of responsibility \ntoward that decision. We can't solve much of it today, but we can solve \nsome of it today, and the time to start addressing this urgent need is \nnow.\n  When I became Governor of Tennessee about 30 years ago, a friend gave \nme a book written by George Reedy, Lyndon Johnson's press secretary. It \nwas called ``The Twilight of the Presidency.'' In that book, I found a \ndefinition I used as Governor because it was such a good definition of \nwhat an executive in public life is to do. George Reedy said that the \njob of the President is, No. 1, to see an urgent need; No. 2, to \ndevelop a strategy to meet the need; and No. 3, to persuade at least \nhalf the people that he is right. See an urgent need, develop a \nstrategy to meet the need, and persuade at least half the people he is \nright.\n  This is an urgent need facing our country. Forty cents out of every \ndollar we spend is borrowed; $2.2 trillion coming in; $3.7 trillion \ngoing out; 47 top economists over 2 weekends ago saying it was the most \nurgent need facing our country. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff is saying it is our biggest national security threat--the debt. \nAs Senator Thune said, debt costs jobs. Economists tell us that debt at \nthis level costs us about 1 million jobs a year.\n  Let me read what the President's own debt commission had to say about \nthis. This debt commission had six Members of the U.S. Senate as \nmembers--three Republicans, three Democrats. Five of the six voted for \nthis report of the debt commission. They said, as members of this \ncommission:\n\n       We spent the past 8 months studying the same hard, cold \n     facts--\n\n  Not opinions, facts.\n\n       Together we have reached these unavoidable conclusions. The \n     problem is real. The solution will be painful. There is no \n     easy way out. Everything must be on the table, and Washington \n     must lead.\n\n  That is President Obama's debt commission. After all the talk about \ndebt and deficits, they go on to say:\n\n       It is long past time for America's leaders to put up or \n     shut up.\n\n  That is the President's debt commission talking.\n\n       The era of debt denial is over. There can be no turning \n     back. We sign our names to this plan because we love our \n     children, our grandchildren, and our country too much not to \n     act while we still have the chance to secure a better future \n     for all of our citizens.\n\n  That report included five Members of this body, two Democrats, three \nRepublicans. That was what the debt commission had to say.\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n  Here is what the President had to say. In 2009 he said:\n\n       What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are \n     now at the end of the road. We are not in a position to kick \n     it any further.\n\n  We can only find $4 billion to save?\n  President Obama said last year:\n\n       I hope some of the folks who are hollering about deficits \n     and debt step up, because I am calling their bluff.\n\n  We can only save $4 billion?\n\n       My administration is going to seek to work with Congress to \n     execute serious entitlement reform.\n\n  And then as Senator the President said:\n\n       Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically, weakens \n     us internationally. Leadership means the buck stops here. \n     Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices \n     today on to the backs of our children and grandchildren. \n     America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership.\n\n  I ask, where is the President of the United States in this debate? \nWhere is the President of the United States? His debt commission came \nout months ago and recommended $4 trillion in savings. No support from \nthe President. The President made an eloquent State of the Union \nAddress. I sat on the front row and applauded many times. No sense of \nurgency about the Federal debt. The President offered his budget a few \nweeks ago. No plan for reducing the Federal debt.\n  Now we are taking step No. 1, which is to work on the discretionary \npart of the budget--only about 12 percent of the budget. The House is \nwilling to take difficult steps; the Senate Democratic majority says we \ncan only find an amount that equals the debt we are piling up in one \n24-hour period; and the President is missing in action.\n  I respectfully say that is not leadership. We need the President of \nthe United States to join us in an effort to stop our country from \nspending money we don't have, in making difficult decisions about \nspending, so we can assure the strength and future of our country.\n  The question before us is will we or will we not stop spending money \nwe don't have? Will we or will we not make the difficult decisions it \ntakes to reduce spending so that our country will be strong for the \nfuture?\n  The other side says they can find $4.7 billion to save. We say we can \nstart with $57 billion. I will vote for the $57 billion and against the \n$4.7 billion because that is a sure step toward a bright path for \nAmerica's future.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the remaining \ntime? There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about H.R. 1, the \nHouse bill we just voted down and which I will continue to oppose until \nmajor changes are made. With apologies to Nobel Prize-winning economist \nPaul Krugman, I would like to talk about Willy Sutton for a second. \nWhile we should not normally take fiscal lessons from criminals, Willy \nSutton had it right. He said he robbed banks because ``that's where the \nmoney is.'' Of course, he didn't target places with only petty cash. \nWhat is the point of robbing a school or a homeless shelter? There is \nno money there. But that is exactly what H.R. 1 seeks to do.\n  Instead of tackling our deficits by going after the bank, it is \ntargeting our most vulnerable. Domestic nonsecurity discretionary \nspending makes up only 12 percent of our budget. We cannot balance the \nbudget with only 12 percent of the budget on the table. We need to be \nlooking at the big picture. We need to be focusing on the bank, where \nthe money is.\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n  In President Obama's State of the Union Address he said in order to \nget back on track, to build prosperity, we need to out-educate, out-\nbuild, and out-innovate the rest of the world. Ask any small business \nowner and they will agree that though sometimes they have to trim \noverhead, they have to also make smart target investments for their \nbusiness to grow. So why does H.R. 1 do exactly the opposite?\n  The President calls for education funding that supports afterschool \nprograms from Bemidji to Worthington. Yet H.R. 1 cuts $100 million. In \nMinnesota, H.R. 1 would effectively eliminate afterschool programs for \nnearly 2,000 kids. H.R. 1 also cuts job training programs, virtually \nzeroing out the first title in WIA, even when 3,000 Minnesotans are on \nwaiting lists to get training for jobs that are going unfilled. I \ntalked to businesses all over Minnesota and they need trained workers. \nThey support the Workforce Investment Act.\n  The President calls for infrastructure. Yet H.R. 1 cuts surface \ntransportation projects across the country, including nearly $8 million \nfor a new railroad crossing in Staples and $250,000 for the St. Paul \nComplete Streets Plan.\n  The Department of Transportation estimates that H.R. 1 would \neffectively cancel 75 projects in 40 States across the country and put \nmore than 30,000 jobs at risk nationwide.\n  The President calls for innovation. Yet H.R. 1 cuts $2.5 billion in \nlifesaving biomedical and health research at the National Institutes of \nHealth and National Cancer Institute. The United States and my home \nState of Minnesota have been the world leaders in innovative biomedical \nresearch. Under H.R. 1, the United States will be forced to detour from \nour path toward breaking biomedical frontiers. I think we can agree we \nmust not be penny-wise and pound-foolish when it comes to investing in \nour Nation's future.\n  H.R. 1 does exactly the opposite of what our country should be doing \nduring an economic recovery. H.R. 1 does not target Willy Sutton's \nbank, it goes after schools and roads and cancer research.\n  I have a few ideas for targeting the bank where the money is. Let's \nstart with big oil and gas. Over the past decade, the past 10 years, \njust the five largest oil and gas companies have made $1 trillion in \nprofit--not revenues, profit; $1 trillion in profit. Yet we are giving \nthem tax subsidies that have been in place since as far back as 1916. \nEliminating these wasteful subsidies will bring in about $64 billion \nover 10 years. Let's do that.\n  Another bank: Waste and fraud in the health care system. Provisions \nin the health reform law reduce waste. The value index that I and \nothers pushed for in the health care reform bill is going to ensure \nthat we reward value, not volume, in Medicare.\n  In Texas, for example, Medicare reimbursements are about 50 percent \nhigher per patient than they are in Minnesota. Yet in Minnesota we have \nbetter outcomes. Why? Because we deliver higher value health care at a \nmuch lower cost. Imagine how many tens of billions or hundreds of \nbillions of dollars we could save if every State delivered health care \nlike Minnesota does, like my State does.\n  Also, in Medicare the government pays too much for Medicare \nprescription drugs. Because Medicare represents so many people, it \ncould negotiate prices directly with the drug companies and deliver the \nsame benefits for seniors at a lower cost. The VA already does this. \nThis simple change could save taxpayers up to $24 billion a year or \n$240 billion over 10 years. This is where the money is. I am not the \nfirst to point out there is waste in health care, but we can do \nsomething about it. Guess what. H.R. 1 would cut $250 million from \nhealth care fraud and abuse control.\n  Another bank is the Department of Defense. We all agree we cannot \nskimp on national security, believe me. When our troops are at war, two \nwars, we can do nothing to skimp on their safety, their security, their \nreadiness, their ability to fight these wars, or on them when they come \nback from the war. H.R. 1 makes cuts to programs for homeless vets.\n  We do not want to skimp on national security, but when the military \nsays it doesn't need or want something, we should listen. When it says \nit doesn't need the F-35 alternate engine, the Marine Expeditionary \nFighting Vehicle, or the Non-Line of Site Launch System, we should not \nbuy them. This could save billions of dollars.\n  Then, of course, there is revenue. H.R. 1 does nothing to shore up \nrevenue at a time when we still have our troops overseas engaged in \ncombat. We have always paid for our wars before. This time we passed \nhuge tax cuts for the wealthy, and just a couple of months ago my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle insisted on extending these \ntax breaks on income over $1 million. We had a vote on this. It was not \nenough to extend the tax breaks on the first million or the second \nmillion or the third million or the tenth million or the twentieth \nmillion or the fiftieth million or the hundredth million. Ending the \ntax breaks for millionaires could have brought in around $35 to $40 \nbillion every year. On the back of the envelope, that is $350 to $400 \nbillion over 10 years--I added a zero.\n  The President has stated this was only a temporary extension, and I \nplan to hold him to that. If we are going to be talking about making \nshared sacrifices and cutting homeless vets and cutting Head Start, \nlet's make sure those shared sacrifices are really shared.\n  All these ideas need to be on the table, not just 12 percent of our \nentire budget. If we are at all serious about reforming our budget, and \nI am talking about serious about this, it has to include the bank. We \nhave to go where the money is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I voted for passage of H.R. 1, the House-\npassed continuing resolution, which will fund the Federal Government \nfor the remainder of the fiscal year. I supported this measure because \nI believe it is a critical first step toward reining in our deficit and \ndebt and putting us back on a path to fiscal solvency.\n  I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues in the House. Their \nefforts required a lot of compromise and tough decisions. I supported \npassage of H.R. 1, but I have serious concerns with the defense-related \nspending of this bill.\n  The defense-related spending on H.R. 1 is not sufficient for us to \ncarry out our responsibilities to the men and women who are serving in \nthe military and fulfill our national security requirements. Therefore, \nif we are going to embark on another 2-week continuing resolution, as \nit appears that reports indicate may be the case, then I will be \ncompelled to propose an amendment that will then fund our Nation's \nnational security requirements for the remainder of the year. That \nnumber, as I have determined it, is approximately $535 billion for \nnormal defense appropriations, and $159 billion for war funding, known \nas overseas contingency operations.\n  The Secretary of Defense, with whom I have disagreed from time to \ntime--which I think is natural and appropriate--I believe is perhaps \nthe finest Secretary of Defense who has ever served this Nation in many \nrespects. I am sure there are others who were outstanding. But in \nrecent memory, I have not met a person who has led our Defense \nDepartment with the qualities of leadership and dedication as Secretary \nGates. I pay close attention--and I hope all of us do--particularly to \nthe fact that we have Americans in harm's way in two wars and the \nturmoil that now is present in the Middle East, in the Arab world, in \nthe Maghreb.\n  The Secretary of Defense has said unequivocally that he cannot \nguarantee\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\nwe are defending this Nation's vital national security interests if we \ncontinue on a 2-week by 2-week by 2-week sequence. There is not the \nkind of funding nor the kind of assurance to the men and women serving \nthat we can adequately train and equip and make them fight at their \nhighest efficiencies and capabilities. I disagree--and I will list some \nof the areas where I disagree--with the funding requirements. I don't \nagree with the number the Secretary of Defense has said, which is $540 \nbillion. I think we can do it with $535 billion.\n  The fact is we can't subject our Nation's national security to a 2-\nweek by 2-week process. It is not the way the Defense Department can \nfunction and this Nation can defend itself and its vital national \nsecurity interests. We owe it to the men and women serving in harm's \nway as we speak.\n  The aspects of the Defense Appropriations bill that need to be taken \naway, eliminated, are $300 million for medical research. I am sure the \nmedical research is important, but it has nothing to do with national \ndefense. Within that $300 million is $15 million for peer-reviewed \nAlzheimer's research, $150 million for peer-reviewed breast cancer \nresearch, $12.8 million for peer-reviewed lung cancer research, $20 \nmillion for peer-reviewed ovarian cancer research, $80 million for \npeer-reviewed prostate cancer research, and $4.8 million for multiple \nsclerosis--all of which are worthy causes, but none have anything to do \nwith defending this country. If they want them to be funded--and they \ndeserve to be in many respects--they should come out of the Health and \nHuman Services Appropriations, not out of Defense.\n  What has happened around here over the years is what I'll call the \n``Willie Sutton syndrome.'' He was the famous bank robber. They once \nasked him why he robbed banks. He said: That is where the money is. So \nsome special interests have wanted funding for various projects that \nare either good or bad, or programs that are either good or bad, which \nhave nothing to do with defense. We cannot afford those anymore. If we \nwant to fund a program, it should come out of the appropriate area of \nresponsibility of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Both bills include about $70 million for private organizations and \ncharities, such as $24 million for the Red Cross, $1.2 million for the \nSpecial Olympics, $20 million for youth mentoring grants--all worthy \ncauses and all not defense related.\n  Both bills direct $550 million for nondefense public infrastructure \nprojects, such as $250 million for improvements to local schools that \nare not part of the Department of Defense school system. If they need \nto be funded, take it out of the proper appropriations moneys. It also \nincludes $300 million for roads.\n  Equally troubling is the way the bills make objectionable changes to \nthe overseas contingency operations funding--the OCO. The overseas \ncontingency operation funds are specifically for Iraq and Afghanistan. \nBoth of the bills cut the Iraq security force funding by $500 million. \nThey also shift funding for nine F-18 Hornets from base to the overseas \ncontingency operations, despite the fact that we have not lost an F-18, \nand that is $500 million. It shifts $500 million in funding for UAVs \nfrom the base, where they were properly requested, to OCO. They should \nnot be designated to overseas contingency operations. They fund 20 \nadditional missile defense interceptors for $190 million, and they \ninclude more than $37 million in funding support for the southwest \nborder for the National Guard. I strongly support funding for the \nsouthwest border--to have it secured--and I will continue to advocate \nfor that, but it doesn't apply to overseas contingency operations.\n  As we proceed, I intend to work to remove the nondefense-related \nspending from these bills, restore that funding to DOD priorities, \nincluding full funding for our troops in combat and the costs needed to \nmaintain and restore their equipment.\n  I don't know if the government will be shut down. I don't know where \nthere will be compromise. I don't know if we will engage in entitlement \nreform and all of the different scenarios that we could draw as to what \nis going to happen here at high noon in the great drama of our Nation's \nCapitol. We cannot forget that we are in 2 wars; that we have 100,000 \ntroops in Afghanistan and approximately 50,000 in Iraq--those are rough \nnumbers--not to mention other civilians and members of the diplomatic \ncorps and other parts of the U.S. Government.\n  We cannot force them to live 2 weeks by 2 weeks by 2 weeks and not be \nsufficiently funded. I will be glad to engage with my colleagues in \nvigorous debate. Maybe they are able to find more ways to save money \nfrom our defense spending--and I am sure they are there, and I look \nforward to working with them. But as the Secretary of Defense has tried \nto make it as clear as possible to the Members of Congress--and I wish \nthe President would weigh in more heavily--we cannot continue \nfunctioning and preserve our national security this way.\n  That is why if we do another 2-week continuing resolution, I will be \ncoming to the floor to propose an amendment to provide funding for our \nNation's defense for the remainder of the year.\n  I take a backseat to no one in my zeal to cut unnecessary spending. I \nam aware we have mortgaged our children's futures. I know we cannot \nstop spending the way we are. But the first priority of government--the \nfirst priority--is to ensure the safety and security of its citizens. \nThat is why we must appropriately fund our Department of Defense and \nall its associated functions and especially provide the equipment and \ntraining and protection, as much as we can, to the men and women who \nare serving and sacrificing so the rest of us can live freely.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we had votes this afternoon on the \ncontinuing resolution proposal from the House, and the Senate did not \napprove that. We did not have the 60 votes necessary to accept that. \nThe Democratic proposal, which I would suggest does nothing about the \ndebt, failed. I guess there were four or five party defections. If we \ntake what direction those defections meant, all of those defections \nwent to the more conservative side in that several thought the House \nreductions in spending were not enough, and several Democratic \ncolleagues thought the Democratic majority leader's proposal did not go \nfar enough.\n  I would just say that what we need to do--and it is very important \nthat we achieve it--is to move toward a gradual, credible, sustained, \nmature reduction of the deficits this country has faced, and that takes \nsome tough decisionmaking. It doesn't require us to act in an extreme \nor drastic way, but it means sustained serious changes in the \ntrajectory in which we are headed.\n  I would just note that the House proposed reducing our nondefense \ndiscretionary spending $61 billion over the rest of the fiscal year. If \nwe take only the discretionary account, that amounts to about a 6-\npercent reduction. If we take the entire Federal spending, it is less \nthan a 2-percent reduction in the entire Federal spending. So it is \nutterly implausible that this reduction in spending is so significant \nthat it will impact adversely our economy today--that is one of the \narguments they are throwing out--particularly in light of the fact \nthese don't consider that we are dealing with outlays of money that \nwould not even be spent in this fiscal year. It will be spent in the \nnext year or two as we build a project--a road or something--that takes \nseveral years to complete. So the actual reduction in outlay in this \nyear would not be that significant, and it will not reduce the fragile \ngrowth rate we are in.\n  What it does, though, is save $61 billion out of this year's \nappropriations. Over a period of 10 years, that will result in \napproximately $860 billion in savings because it reduces the baseline \nby this amount, and it carries out each with the 10 years of the $61 \nbillion reduction, plus the interest saved on all this debt since all \nof this money is borrowed. We are so deeply in debt, any reduction \nreduces our debt, it reduces\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\nour interest payment, and it puts us on a sound path.\n  I do not believe the House sent us anything that is reckless or \ndangerous or extreme. The majority leader yesterday said it was \nreckless and used those kind of pejorative terms. It is not. It is a \nreasonable step that has a significant impact, pushing $1 trillion, \nactually, over 10. Do a few more little things and we would save $1 \ntrillion on our debt over 10 years, and that is significant.\n  I would point out, Mr. President, we have had substantial increases \nin our budgets in the last 2 years--in 2010, in 2011--over the 2008 \nbudget proposal. We have added 25 percent increases in spending in \nthese discretionary programs. Some of them have received substantially \nmore than that. So taking down these numbers will not put us into the \npoorhouse. It is not going to substantially alter the nature of the \nvery Republic that we are here to serve or the government that is \nsupposed to serve the people. It is not going to savage our government. \nIt is not going to savage the programs.\n  For example, these reductions on which we voted, if they became law, \n$61 billion over the rest of this fiscal year would bring us still \nabove the 2008 levels by 4.3 percent. In 2008 we were spending $378 \nbillion on these programs. If this reduction were to be accomplished, \nthe spending for the rest of this year would be $394 billion. That is \nmore than we were spending in 2008, and I believe it is a reasonable \nreduction.\n\n  I suppose, after this vote, that leaders and wise heads and people I \naffectionately call ``masters of the universe'' will all get together \nand they will start deciding what we are going to do: You didn't win \nyour vote and we didn't win our vote, so let's just sit down here and \nlet's divide up the pie and you give a little bit more, and we don't \nwant to cut too much spending, you know, and we will just not agree to \nanything like these spending levels.\n  I think that would be a mistake. I believe the American people in \nthis last election were very clear that they expected us to do \nsomething about this reckless Washington spending. It was dominant in \nthe election. There was a shellacking in this election of the big \ngovernment big spenders. They went down all over the country--what was \nit, 87 new House Members elected, the biggest surge in years, every one \nof them, virtually, promising to contain the reckless spending in \nWashington.\n  I cannot understand what it is that people do not comprehend about \nthe nature of the circumstances we are in. Forty cents of every dollar \nwe spend today has been borrowed. Every economist who testified has \nsaid we are on an unsustainable path.\n  Mr. Erskine Bowles testified, President Clinton's former Chief of \nStaff, a successful businessman himself, the head of the debt \ncommission, along with Alan Simpson, a former Senator. He said we could \nhave a debt crisis in 2 years--maybe a little less, maybe a little \nmore--at the rate we are going. Their joint statement said this country \nhas never been in a situation in which we have such a predictable \ncrisis. Senator Simpson declared that he thought we could have a debt \ncrisis in less than a year. He said: I think it is less than a year, \nnot 2 years. Alan Greenspan in January told the Wall Street Journal \nthat there was a little better--not much--than a 50-50 chance that we \nwould have a debt crisis in 2 to 3 years. These are ominous warnings. \nYou can't spend $3.8 trillion and bring in $2.2 trillion and think you \ncan continue that. It is the largest deficit in the history of the \nAmerican Republic.\n  The President's budget that he just submitted to us projects no \nbudget in 10 years less than $600 billion. The last 3 years of his 10-\nyear budget, those deficits are going up to $900 billion. It is the \nwrong trend. This is not a course we can sustain. We have to get off of \nit. We could be reaching the precipice sooner than we think--1 year, 2 \nyears, 3 years--if we do not get off this path. We need to take action \nnow.\n  There is one opportunity; that is, this continuing resolution which \nallows us to make some reductions--enough to send a message that there \nare sufficient votes in this Congress to reverse the path we are on. \nAre there sufficient votes? I believe there are. Partisanship was in \nthese last two votes. We know that. People were pressured on both \nsides. But the people who did not follow party lines were moving on to \nthe right side, the more conservative, restrained side of spending. I \nthink that suggests there is some momentum out there to do something \nother than just split the baby on this, how much we are going to reduce \nspending.\n  The proposal of the majority leader is really a $4.6 billion \nreduction. That is less than one-half of 1 percent of the discretionary \nbudget and a mere fraction of the total Federal spending this year. \nThat is nothing.\n  The choice is, are we going to do nothing or are we going to do \nsomething? Are we going to listen to the warnings that we are facing a \npredictable crisis financially or not? We can do this. This is not \ngoing to be a dramatic reduction in spending. Frankly, I would like to \nsee it go a good bit lower, as a number of people in the Senate I know \nbelieve. But most of us believed it was significant, it puts us on a \ndownward path, and it saves $61 billion this year and $850 billion over \n10. That is a pretty good amount to save in 7 months of this fiscal \nyear, and we will come back next year and we will do more and better \nwork.\n  We are going to have to bring entitlements into the discussion, but \nthe President is going to have to step up on that. If he is going to \noppose that, nothing is going to pass on entitlements, that is for \nsure. So we need some leadership, and we can move this in the right \ndirection.\n  I am disappointed there were not more votes for the House proposal, \nbut at least on the Republican side it got every Republican vote except \na few who believed it did not go far enough in reducing spending.\n  I believe the message needs to be, to whoever is meeting in these \nsecret chambers without the American people and without--I won't be in \nthere, I am sure. They will be meeting and making these plots. They \nneed to know we are not just looking for any token cuts. We need to do \nsomething that is significant. We need to stay with the House number. \nThat is what we need to do. It would be so good for this country. The \nwhole world would say: This new Congress, they are taking a noticeable \nstep. They actually reduced spending. Maybe in the United States they \nare ready to get their house in order. Maybe we do not mind continuing \nto buy their bonds. Maybe they will be able to honor their debts \nwithout debasing their currency. Maybe it is a good investment.\n  I believe that is what we need to be saying because otherwise we \ncould be in a situation in which our debt surges, the interest on our \ndebt surges, and the value of our currency is debased, and that will \nput us on the road to political as well as economic decline.\n  As ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, we have been wrestling \nwith these issues. I thank Senator Conrad, our chairman. He has had \nsome good hearings and good witnesses and good testimony, but it is \ntime for action, not just talk. We need to do something.\n  This is the bill that is before us. This CR is a vehicle by which we \ncan speak to the American people, speak to the financial markets, say \nto the entire world that the United States realizes that our path is an \nunsustainable one, and we are going to do something about it. We are \nmoving off that path. We are going to take the hard road. It will be a \ntougher road for a while, but it is the road to prosperity, it is the \nroad to growth, and it is the road to more jobs.\n  Excessive debt slows down the economy, as Reinhart and Rogoff's book \nand testimony show, as Secretary Geithner testified before the \ncommittee. It has already slowed our growth, he has acknowledged, and \nhe is afraid we could have a debt crisis on an adverse incident that is \nexacerbated by the very high levels of debt we are under.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1495-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               JOB LOSSES\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I do not intend to speak long. I know \nwe are getting ready to wrap up. I will not interfere with that. But I \ndid not want the day to end without a reminder of the concern that H.R. \n1 and the significant, serious cuts it imposes will produce \nsignificant, serious job losses. That is not something being \nmanufactured on our side of the aisle. It comes from careful analysis \nfrom very neutral forums.\n  Many people will have seen this graphic already. Chairman Bernanke of \nthe Federal Reserve is one of the observers who has looked at the bill \nand said it will cut significant jobs. I believe his testimony was that \nit was not trivial, that it would be hundreds of thousands of jobs. \nEconomist Mark Zandi has advised Republicans and Democrats. He is a \nneutral, independent economist. He has calculated that the GOP plan \nwould cost 700,000 jobs. When we consider the good news that we have \njust heard of job growth in the past reporting period, which was, I \nbelieve, around 170,000 jobs--less than 200 anyway--the idea of wiping \nout 700,000 jobs acquires a real scale and a real significance.\n  Finally, at the bottom is Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs is no great \nfriend of the Democratic Party. It is a group of financial advisers and \ninvestors who look at data as dispassionately as possible, because if \nthey are wrong, they don't make money. Goldman Sachs has estimated that \nthe spending cuts will hurt economic growth. My memory is, they \nestimated it would be 2 percentage points off of our economic growth. \nWhen we consider that our economic growth is under 3 percent right now, \nif we take two of the percents out, we are basically getting pretty \nclose to flat-lining the American economy. So prudence dictates that we \ngo about the necessary adjustments to get rid of our debt and our \ndeficit in a way that does not snuff out the gradually emerging \nrecovery.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, we have just gone from 11.5 percent \nunemployment down to 11.3 percent. It is still pretty darn serious out \nthere. While clearly things appear to have bottomed out and started to \ngo in the right direction, nothing prevents what everybody calls the \ndouble dip. Things such as the gas crisis we are experiencing now have \nbeen discussed as potentially creating a double dip. To knock out \nhundreds of thousands of jobs, to knock 2 full percentage points out of \ngrowth out of a ratio that is not much over 3 percent is a very big hit \nto the economy. It may be wiser to allow the economic recovery to \ncontinue a little bit further, as the Bowles-Simpson group recommended, \nthat you couldn't snuff out the recovery early. Let the blaze catch a \nlittle more. Let it get going, and then we can move into these areas.\n  I will come to the floor later to talk about not just prudence but \nalso fairness. There are two issues we need to address as we face up to \nour debt and deficit challenge. We have to do it prudently. We also \nshould do it fairly. The way the House does it does not meet the \nstandard either of prudence or fairness. On prudence, I think we have \npretty strong agreement when Ben Bernanke and Mark Zandi and Goldman \nSachs all talk about significant job losses as a result, and fairness \nis a topic for another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1495-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1495-S1496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING JAMES ARTHUR ``ONION'' EASTHAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary \nlife and legacy of an upstanding hero of the Commonwealth, the late Mr. \nJames Arthur ``Onion'' Eastham. A native of Somerset, KY, Mr. Eastham \npassed away peacefully on December 28, 2010. He was 87 years old.\n  Born in Pulaski County, KY, James not only served both his community \nand country selflessly, but touched the lives of all who had the \npleasure of meeting him. His courageous and patriotic spirit led him to \njoin the U.S. Marines Corps where he served as a staff sergeant and \ncrew chief aboard a B-25 bomber, and in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater \nwhere he was awarded two Bronze Stars for duty at and during the Luzon \nand southern Philippine campaigns. He was also presented with the \nimpressive award of the Philippine Liberation Ribbon with a Bronze Star \nfor his bravery during combat with the enemy.\n  After the war, James continued to serve his community as a regional \nsalesman for Morton Salt Company, as a longstanding member of the \nKiwanis Club and the Somerset Masonic Lodge No. 111, and as a member of \nthe First Baptist Church where he taught Sunday school and served as a \nchair of a building committee for the church's new sanctuary. It was no \nsurprise that James's conscientious and excellent character earned him \na spot on the Somerset City Council for 18 years, where he played \nactive roles in helping to establish the Somerset Community College and \nfinding a location for what is now the Lake Cumberland Regional \nHospital. It is evident that both his family and the people of his \nclose-knit community respected and valued James's tireless dedication \nand steadfast leadership, as he will always be fondly remembered as a \nman who stood firm in his beliefs.\n  I could surely continue to praise the works and accomplishments of \nthis brave and humble man, but I will simply ask that my colleagues \njoin me in remembering a true gentleman who poured his heart into \nserving, protecting, and strengthening his family, his country, and the \nCommonwealth. My thoughts go out to his beloved wife, Virginia; his \nthree children, Jimmy, Wayne, and Lisa; his sister Edna; his \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren, and many other beloved friends \nand family members.\n  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article about a \ncontribution that was made in James's name to the Reid S. Jones Fund, a \nfund named in honor of his dear friend that helps veterans make \neducational advancements. I ask unanimous consent that the full article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Jan. 30, 2011]\n\n   Foundation Launches Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund With Contribution \n                    Honoring James ``Onion'' Eastham\n\n       The Jones Educational Foundation Inc., a 501(C)3 not-for-\n     profit corporation based in Somerset, has launched the Reid \n     S. Jones Memorial Fund with a $1,000 contribution made by Dr. \n     Sonya Jones honoring the late James Arthur ``Onion'' Eastham.\n       According to Dr. Jones, president and CEO of The Jones \n     Foundation, the donation is intended to pay tribute to the \n     friendship between James ``Onion'' Eastham, a man who was \n     regarded highly in the Somerset community, and her father.\n       Further, the fund is meant to honor veterans from all the \n     wars in which the United States has fought. The initial \n     donation honors veterans who served in the European and \n     Pacific theaters of World War II.\n       ``I had been thinking about the Foundation setting up a \n     fund for veterans in Dad's name ever since I made a donation \n     in his memory to help restore the Soldiers and Sailors \n     Memorial building at Union College,'' Mr. Jones said.\n       Reid Jones graduated from Union in 1959. He went on to do \n     graduate work in education at Eastern Kentucky University.\n       ``When Mr. Eastham passed away in late December, I knew it \n     was time,'' Dr. Jones added. ``Dad thought so much of his \n     friend that I felt he would want me to do something special \n     to honor Onion's memory.''\n       Reid Sievers Jones (April 24, 1926 to April 15, 2005) \n     entered the U.S. Army at a crucial point in the history of \n     World War II. he was stationed in Germany, and he fought in \n     the Battle of the Bulge. He was a survivor in what has been \n     called ``one of the bloodiest battles'' of World War II.\n       Conducted in the dense, mountainous region of Belgium, the \n     Battle of the Bulge was Adolf Hitler's last major offensive \n     against the Allies. The battle ran from Dec. 16, 1944, until \n     Jan. 25, 1945.\n       When he enlisted in the Army as a private, Reid Jones was \n     18 years of age. He married Elva Sears on Dec. 30, 1944, \n     shortly before shipping out to the European front. He was \n     promoted to the rank of staff sergeant and remained in \n     Germany for a short time after the war to help begin the \n     process of reconstruction.\n       James ``Onion'' Eastham (Sept. 22, 1923, to Dec. 28, 2010) \n     served in the Asiatic-Pacific theater where he was awarded \n     two bronze stars for duty at and during the Luzon and \n     Southern Philippine campaigns.

He is remembered, particularly by former \n     students at Shopville High School as a firm teacher who was \n     not afraid to exercise discipline when he thought it was \n     needed.\n       Later, in the 1960s, he joined Fram Corp., based in \n     Providence, RI, as a district sales manager. Frequently, he \n     was recognized for exceeding sales quotas. He was \n     instrumental in placing Fram products in Wal-Marts across the \n     southeastern United States.\n       Reid Jones was a 32nd degree Mason and a member of Oleika \n     Shriners Temple in Lexington. He served on the board of \n     directors of First United Methodist Church.\n       In addition to being an influential member of Somerset City \n     Council, James ``Onion'' Eastham was a member of the Somerset \n     Masonic Lodge #111 and a long-standing member of the Kiwanis \n     Club. He was also a member of First Baptist Church where he \n     taught Sunday school and served as chair of a building \n     committee for the church's new sanctuary.\n       As a member of Somerset City Council from 1964 to 1982, \n     Eastham played an active role in helping to establish \n     Somerset Community College and finding a location for what is \n     now Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital. He considered running \n     for mayor, but his job as a regional salesman for Morton Salt \n     Co. created time constraints that caused him not to seek \n     office.\n       According to Clarence Love, city clerk during the years \n     Eastham served on council, ``he was very conscientious.'' In \n     Love's opinion, Eastham was an ``excellent councilman.''\n       Jimmy Eastham said he thought his father most likely would \n     be remembered most for ``standing for what he believed in.''\n       The Reid S.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary \nlife and legacy of an upstanding hero of the Commonwealth, the late Mr. \nJames Arthur ``Onion'' Eastham. A native of Somerset, KY, Mr. Eastham \npassed away peacefully on December 28, 2010. He was 87 years old.\n  Born in Pulaski County, KY, James not only served both his community \nand country selflessly, but touched the lives of all who had the \npleasure of meeting him. His courageous and patriotic spirit led him to \njoin the U.S. Marines Corps where he served as a staff sergeant and \ncrew chief aboard a B-25 bomber, and in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater \nwhere he was awarded two Bronze Stars for duty at and during the Luzon \nand southern Philippine campaigns. He was also presented with the \nimpressive award of the Philippine Liberation Ribbon with a Bronze Star \nfor his bravery during combat with the enemy.\n  After the war, James continued to serve his community as a regional \nsalesman for Morton Salt Company, as a longstanding member of the \nKiwanis Club and the Somerset Masonic Lodge No. 111, and as a member of \nthe First Baptist Church where he taught Sunday school and served as a \nchair of a building committee for the church's new sanctuary. It was no \nsurprise that James's conscientious and excellent character earned him \na spot on the Somerset City Council for 18 years, where he played \nactive roles in helping to establish the Somerset Community College and \nfinding a location for what is now the Lake Cumberland Regional \nHospital. It is evident that both his family and the people of his \nclose-knit community respected and valued James's tireless dedication \nand steadfast leadership, as he will always be fondly remembered as a \nman who stood firm in his beliefs.\n  I could surely continue to praise the works and accomplishments of \nthis brave and humble man, but I will simply ask that my colleagues \njoin me in remembering a true gentleman who poured his heart into \nserving, protecting, and strengthening his family, his country, and the \nCommonwealth. My thoughts go out to his beloved wife, Virginia; his \nthree children, Jimmy, Wayne, and Lisa; his sister Edna; his \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren, and many other beloved friends \nand family members.\n  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article about a \ncontribution that was made in James's name to the Reid S. Jones Fund, a \nfund named in honor of his dear friend that helps veterans make \neducational advancements. I ask unanimous consent that the full article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Jan. 30, 2011]\n\n   Foundation Launches Reid S.

Jones Memorial Fund with a $1,000 contribution made by Dr. \n     Sonya Jones honoring the late James Arthur ``Onion'' Eastham.\n       According to Dr. Jones, president and CEO of The Jones \n     Foundation, the donation is intended to pay tribute to the \n     friendship between James ``Onion'' Eastham, a man who was \n     regarded highly in the Somerset community, and her father.\n       Further, the fund is meant to honor veterans from all the \n     wars in which the United States has fought. The initial \n     donation honors veterans who served in the European and \n     Pacific theaters of World War II.\n       ``I had been thinking about the Foundation setting up a \n     fund for veterans in Dad's name ever since I made a donation \n     in his memory to help restore the Soldiers and Sailors \n     Memorial building at Union College,'' Mr. Jones said.\n       Reid Jones graduated from Union in 1959. He went on to do \n     graduate work in education at Eastern Kentucky University.\n       ``When Mr. Eastham passed away in late December, I knew it \n     was time,'' Dr. Jones added. ``Dad thought so much of his \n     friend that I felt he would want me to do something special \n     to honor Onion's memory.''\n       Reid Sievers Jones (April 24, 1926 to April 15, 2005) \n     entered the U.S. Army at a crucial point in the history of \n     World War II. he was stationed in Germany, and he fought in \n     the Battle of the Bulge. He was a survivor in what has been \n     called ``one of the bloodiest battles'' of World War II.\n       Conducted in the dense, mountainous region of Belgium, the \n     Battle of the Bulge was Adolf Hitler's last major offensive \n     against the Allies. The battle ran from Dec. 16, 1944, until \n     Jan. 25, 1945.\n       When he enlisted in the Army as a private, Reid Jones was \n     18 years of age.

Mr. President, Congress has been working on the America \nInvents Act going back many years. It has gone through numerous \niterations and changes have been made over time. Accordingly, I want to \ntake a few minutes to discuss some important legislative history of a \ncritical piece of this bill--section 2 of the legislation, which amends \nsection 102 of title 35 of the United States Code. There has been a \ngreat deal of attention paid to subsections 102(a) and (b) and how \nthose two subsections will work together. Senator Bennet and others \nhave asked about this issue in particular.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. I agree with the chairman that it is \nimportant that we set down a definitive legislative history of those \nsubsections, which will be important for each and every patent \napplication.\n  Mr. LEAHY. One key issue on which people have asked for clarification \nis the interplay between patent-defeating disclosures under subsection \n102(a) and the situations where those disclosures are excepted and have \nno patent-defeating effect under the grace period provided in \nsubsection 102(b).\n  In particular, some in the small inventor community have been \nconcerned that a disclosure by an inventor might qualify as patent-\ndefeating prior art under subsection 102(a) because, for example, the \ninventor's public disclosure and by a ``public disclosure'' I mean one \nthat results in the claimed invention being ``described in a printed \npublication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the \npublic''--might in some situation not be excluded as prior art under \nsection 102(b)'s grace period. There is absolutely no situation in \nwhich this could happen given the interplay between subsections 102(a) \nand 102(b) as these subsections are drafted.\n  We intend that if an inventor's actions are such as to constitute \nprior art under subsection 102(a), then those actions necessarily \ntrigger subsection 102(b)'s protections for the inventor and, what \nwould otherwise have been section 102(a) prior art, would be excluded \nas prior art by the grace period provided by subsection 102(b). Indeed, \nas an example of this, subsection 102(b)(1)(A), as written, was \ndeliberately couched in broader terms than subsection 102(a)(1). This \nmeans that any disclosure by the inventor whatsoever, whether or not in \na form that resulted in the disclosure being available to the public, \nis wholly disregarded as prior art. A simple way of looking at new \nsubsection 102(a) is that no aspect of the protections under current \nlaw for inventors who disclose their inventions before filing is in any \nway changed.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Vermont is correct. For the purposes of \ngrace-period protection, the legislation intends parallelism between \nthe treatment of an inventor's actions under subsection 102(a) that \nmight create prior art and the treatment of those actions that negate \nany prior-art effect under subsection 102(b). Accordingly, small \ninventors and others will not accidentally create a patent-defeating \nbar by their prefiling actions that would otherwise be prior art under \nsubsection 102(a) as long as they file their patent applications within \nthe grace period provided by subsection 102(b). But, the important \npoint is that if an inventor's disclosure triggers the 102(a) bar with \nrespect to an invention, which can only be done by a disclosure that is \nboth made available to the public and enabled, then he or she has \nthereby also triggered the grace period under 102(b). If a disclosure \nresulting from the inventor's actions is not one that is enabled, or is \nnot made available to the public, then such a disclosure would not \nconstitute patent-defeating prior art under 102(a) in the first place.\n  But even if the disclosure was enabled and available to the public so \nthat it did qualify as prior art under subsection 102(a), subsection \n102(b) would require that the disclosure be disregarded if it occurred \nduring the 1-year grace period before the patent was sought. Indeed, a \ndisclosure that does not satisfy the requirements to be prior art under \nsubsection 102(a), nonetheless constitutes a disclosure that is fully \nprotected under the more inclusive language of subsection 102(b). This \nrelationship between these subsections will fully protect the inventor \nand, together with the provisions of subsection 101 limiting patenting \nto inventors, prevent others from obtaining a patent on the inventor's \ncreation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree. One of the implications of the point we are \nmaking is that subsection 102(a) was drafted in part to do away with \nprecedent under current law that private offers for sale or private \nuses or secret processes practiced in the United States that result in \na product or service that is then made public may be deemed patent-\ndefeating prior art. That will no longer be the case. In effect, the \nnew paragraph 102(a)(1) imposes an overarching requirement for \navailability to the public, that is a public disclosure, which will \nlimit paragraph 102(a)(1) prior art to subject matter meeting the \npublic accessibility standard that is well-settled in current law, \nespecially case law of the Federal Circuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. An additional clarification we have been asked about deals\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\nwith subparagraph 102(b)(1)(B). There has been some confusion over how \nthis provision will work. It is my understanding that this provision \nensures that an inventor who has made a public disclosure--that is, a \ndisclosure made available to the public by any means--is fully \nprotected during the grace period. The inventor is protected not only \nfrom the inventor's own disclosure being prior art against the \ninventor's claimed invention, but also against the disclosures of any \nof the same subject matter in disclosures made by others being prior \nart against the inventor's claimed invention under section 102(a) or \nsection 103--so long as the prior art disclosures from others came \nafter the public disclosure by the inventor. Is that the Senators' \nunderstanding of this provision?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct. Subparagraph 102(b)(1)(B) is designed to \nwork in tandem with subparagraph 102(b)(1)(A) to make a very strong \ngrace period for inventors that have made a public disclosure before \nseeking a patent. Inventors who have made such disclosures are \nprotected during the grace period, not only from their own disclosure, \nbut also from disclosures by others that are made after their \ndisclosure. This is an important protection we offer in our bill that \nwill benefit independent and university inventors in particular.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1497-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Specialist Joshua R.

Campbell. \nSpecialist Campbell, assigned to the 546th Transportation Company, \nbased in Fort Bragg, NC, died on January 29, 2011, of injuries \nsustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his \nvehicle. Specialist Campbell was serving in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was 22 years old.\n  A native of Bennett, CO, Specialist Campbell enlisted in the Army in \n2008. He served a tour of duty in Afghanistan, during which his \ncommanders recognized his extraordinary bravery and talent. Specialist \nCampbell's decorations include the Army Good Conduct Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, and the NATO Medal.\n  During his 2 years of service, Specialist Campbell distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and absolute \ncommitment to his fellow soldiers. Fellow soldiers remember him as a \nconsummate professional with an unending commitment to excellence. They \nremember his generous character and positive disposition.\n  Specialist Campbell's family remembers him as a dedicated son, \nhusband, and father. They also remember him as someone always willing \nto reach out and help others.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' \nSpecialist Campbell's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Specialist Campbell will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Specialist Campbell's entire family--I cannot imagine the sorrow \nyou must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss will \nbe eased by your pride in Joshua's service and by your knowledge that \nhis country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and \nhis sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1497-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1497-S1498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 2011\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nInternational Women's Day.\n  Since the beginning of last century, determined and courageous women \nhave fought hard and made important strides towards ensuring that women \nare guaranteed equality and basic human rights. Too often in the past, \nwomen were seen as victims that needed to be protected or saved. But \ntoday, on the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, women \nshould be viewed as they really are: farmers, entrepreneurs, \nbusinesswomen, teachers, policewomen, caretakers, doctors, lawyers, \npoliticians, mothers, wives, astronauts and presidents.\n  While we should reflect on incredible progress that women have made \nin pushing for greater rights and equal opportunities, we must be \nvigilant about the facts on the status of women around the world. We \nknow women are still being discriminated against; still being abused; \nand still being treated unjustly. We know about the trafficking of \nyoung women and girls; the lack of maternal health care; the lack of \naccess to an education or basic economic opportunities. These are the \nfacts.\n  What we also know is that empowering women around the world to \nparticipate in the political, social and economic life of their \ncommunities and their families is one of the most important tools that \nwe have to alleviate poverty. Decades of research and experience prove \nthat when women are able to be fully engaged in society and hold \ndecision making power, they are more likely to invest their income in \nfood, clean water, education, and health care for their children. This \ncreates a positive cycle of change that lifts entire families, \ncommunities and nations out of poverty. Simply put, when women succeed, \nwe all do.\n  Right now, over a billion people worldwide live on a dollar a day or \nless let's be conscious of the fact that women are most likely to be \namong them. This is a problem that affects all of humanity--when women \nare poor, entire communities suffer because they are not free to earn \nan income, feed their families, or protect themselves and their \nchildren from violence. And their efforts are critical to rebuilding \nfragile countries like Afghanistan and Haiti. Until women around the \nworld have improved access to economic, political and social \nopportunities, the great challenges we face today will go unresolved.\n  Many people do not realize is that violence against women and girls \nis a major source of poverty. Violence and poverty go hand and hand. \nViolence prevents women and girls from getting an education, going to \nwork, and earning the income they need to lift their families out of \npoverty. We know that one in three women will be the victim of physical \nor sexual abuse in her lifetime. But we also know that women have the \npotential to lift families and communities out of poverty.\n  And this undeniable connection means that we cannot ignore or \nsacrifice women's rights for political expediency. If meaningful \nreforms for women are rolled back or not implemented at all, \nparticularly in places like Afghanistan, real and sustainable \ndevelopment will fail. Although conditions for women in Afghanistan \nhave improved since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, they still face \nserious challenges in many aspects of life. And we cannot accept the \nstatus quo that women face in many of these countries as the ``cost of \ndoing business.'' The U.S. government must continue to press the \nfundamental values of the rights of women--to vote, to attend school, \nto own land, to live their lives without violence, to make their own \nchoices--if we expect to see a sustainable peace in Afghanistan.\n  Even in countries not in a state of conflict, women's equality and \naccess can make the difference between life and death for her family. \nJanet Wamalwa owns a 1-acre farm plot in rural Kenya that used to lay \nbare and was difficult to cultivate. Like many areas of sub-Saharan \nAfrica, her land was plagued by soil erosion and low productivity. And \nfor a subsistence farmer like 32-year-old Janet, when her crops don't \ngrow, her family doesn't eat. And when the mother of five could not \nmake ends meet, the first cost-savings remedy was to pull the children \nfrom their studies. To save money, Janet said that they lived on one \nmeal a day during the dry season.\n  But no more. Today, Janet's crops are thriving and her family is \neating better because of several sustainable farming techniques she \nimplemented with the help of an international NGO and Kenya's Ministry \nof Agriculture. Janet's approach is just one example of how small-scale \nfarmers in Africa--\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\nmost of whom are women--can use a diversity of simple practices to \nstave off hunger, earn an income and, ultimately, improve their lives, \nand the lives of those around them. And for Janet, the benefits have \nbeen life-changing. Now, she said her children's overall nutrition is \nbetter. Meanwhile, the extra income Janet earns from selling products \nin local markets means she can pay her children's school fees.\n  If we ignore the reality and the influence of empowering women, the \nresults will undoubtedly be negative. When development programs fail to \nconsider gender differences, women are the ones that are left behind. \nThe World Bank states that, at the macroeconomic level, there is \nevidence that removing gender disparities spurs growth. According to \none estimate, growth rates in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East \nwould have been 30-45 percent higher had these regions closed the \ngender gaps as East Asia did during the school years of 1960 and 1992. \nIn Kenya, if women farmers were given the same level of agricultural \ninputs and education as men, they could increase their yields by more \nthan 20 percent.\n  Therefore, if we open women's access to the means of agricultural \nproduction such as: farming land, fertilizers, farm labor, credit and \ntechnical skills--the end results are crucial to guaranteeing food \nsecurity and enhancing the nutritional status of children. When we \ninvest in women and they have the opportunity to augment their own \nincomes, their families and communities thrive.\n  As we in Congress and in the administration move forward with the \nvital process of revamping and modernizing our foreign assistance, we \nhave an opportunity to make women's empowerment a central focus of U.S. \nforeign policy. We must all remember the lesson that an investment in \nthe empowerment of women is an investment in the future. As chairman of \nthe International Development and Foreign Assistance Subcommittee at \nForeign Relations, I vow to make that the case. Investing in women is \nthe best way to secure stronger communities and economies around the \nworld.\n  Today, let us reaffirm the commitment to end gender-based \ndiscrimination in all forms, to end violence against women and girls \nworldwide, as we encourage the people of the United States to observe \nMarch 8 as International Women's Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1498-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TRACY VALENTINE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

Mr. President. today I recognize the Honorable \nNancy Wilson Cook of Kenton, DE. A legislator, stateswoman, sister, \nmother, grandmother and friend, I have known Nancy for many years and \non many levels. I am very proud to be honoring her today.\n  Born in Philadelphia, Nancy grew up in New Castle County and attended \npublic school in the Colonial School District, graduating from William \nPenn High School. Nancy also attended the University of Delaware before \nmarrying her beloved husband, the Honorable Allen J. Cook, and starting \ntheir family.\n  Always curious about the political process, Nancy got her first taste \nof the political world when she worked as an attache to the late State \nSenator Calvin McCullough. For the next 20 years Nancy worked in \nLegislative Hall, in the Capital City of Dover, taking in the \ndemocratic process. Following the passing of her husband, Nancy was \nelected to the 15th District Senate seat held by Allen, during a \nspecial election.\n  A role model of integrity and service, Nancy served not only as a \nState senator, but as a leader within the Democratic caucus. Nancy \nserved as chairwoman and vice-chairwoman of the prestigious Joint \nFinance Committee, and is the longest-serving Joint Finance Committee \ncochair in Delaware history. As the first Democratic woman to be \nelected to the Delaware State Senate, Nancy held other leadership roles \nduring her tenure including serving as senate majority whip, chairwoman \nof the Senate Highways and Transportation Committee, and chairwoman of \nthe Joint Capital Bond Bill Committee. She also served as a member of \nthe Senate Committees on Agriculture; Adult & Juvenile Corrections; \nChildren, Youth & Families; Insurance & Elections; and, Revenue & \nTaxation.\n  An icon in the Delaware General Assembly, Nancy's legislative \naccomplishments are vast. During my terms as both Delaware's treasurer \nand Governor, Nancy and I worked closely together on many financial \nissues facing the State of Delaware. Known for her immense knowledge of \nand experience with Delaware financial matters, I valued her input on \nmany major decisions.\n  Throughout my 8 years as Delaware's Governor, Nancy's leadership \nhelped my administration pursue a commonsense agenda that led to eight \nbalanced budgets, tax cuts in 7 of those 8 years, and major increases \nin employment allowing Delaware to achieve a AAA bond rating for the \nfirst time in its history. Nancy has been a strong ally for me on many \noccasions including creating Delaware's 21st Century Fund, the \nunprecedented State long-term infrastructure investment fund. In 1996, \nshe was a very strong supporter of the purchase of the Port of \nWilmington, which began the port's rejuvenation into one of the world's \ntop ports.\n  Another of her many noteworthy accomplishments was in the late 1970s \nand early 1980s with the enacting of the constitutional amendments and \nrelated legislation to establish Delaware's balanced budget amendment--\ncreating the State's ``Rainy Day Fund'' and a formula for reducing bond \nindebtedness. Nancy was also very active with the Legislative Council \nleading the way for the conversion and renovation of both Legislative \nHall and the Tatnall Building allowing for better public access to the \nGeneral Assembly and the Governor. She has also been a strong supporter \nof the Wilmington Riverfront, serving on the board of directors of the \nRiverfront Development Corporation, as well as information technology, \nhistorical and cultural affairs and the Delaware Heritage Commission's \nDelaware Oral History Project.\n  Nancy leaves a legacy of commitment to public service for her family \nand the rest of us to follow. I join her friends and family, son Tommy, \nhis wife Beth and their daughter Morgan; stepson Allen, his wife Judy \nand their children Allen III, Dale, and Shawn and their wives and \nchildren in congratulating Nancy for her dedication and service.\n  On behalf of all Delawareans, I applaud Nancy W. Cook for her \noutstanding commitment to the State of Delaware and extend to her my \nvery best wishes for every success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1498-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1498-S1500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   2010 ALFRED P.

Mr. President, 4 years ago yesterday, a \nman who had spent more than 28 years serving the United States of \nAmerica disappeared from Kish Island in the Persian Gulf. His name is \nBob Levinson, and he is a dedicated husband and father, a retired FBI \nagent, and one of my constituents.\n  Today Bob Levinson remains missing, and we must bring him home.\n  On March 8, 2007, Bob traveled to Kish, an Iranian free trade zone, \non a business trip. From what we know, he checked into his hotel, \nchecked out on March 9, got into a taxi, and then disappeared.\n  In the 4 years since then, I have worked closely with the State \nDepartment and the Swiss government to lodge a number of requests for \ninformation with the Iranian government. Bob's wife Christine has \ntraveled to Iran and visited Kish on a fact-finding mission. She and \nher children have remained steadfast and determined in their mission to \nbring Bob home.\n  Just last week, Secretary Clinton offered a glimmer of hope: we now \nhave recent indications that Bob is alive and being held somewhere in \nSouthwest Asia. Secretary Clinton also asked the Government of Iran to \nundertake humanitarian efforts to return him home safely.\n  Today, on the fourth anniversary of Bob's disappearance, I join \nSecretary Clinton's call for the Government of Iran to do all it can to \nreunite Bob Levinson with his family. The Iranians have long offered \ntheir assistance, and now it's time for them to make good on that \ncommitment.\n  Christine Levinson and her children have waited 4 long years for Bob \nto come home.

Mr. President, since settlers first occupied the \nvast forest areas found in my home State of Maine, the logging industry \nhas been a vital part of the state's economy. Last year, approximately \n2,600 were employed by the forestry and logging industry, and over \n4,000 were employed in wood product manufacturing. Maine loggers have \nconstantly been at the forefront of advances in their industry, \nincluding inventing the Peavey hook and the Lombard log hauler. Despite \nthese great advancements, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, OSHA, considers logging to be one of the most dangerous \nindustries in the United States. Today I commend and recognize Portage \nWoods Products LLC, a logging company in my home State of Maine, for \nreceiving the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program, SHARP, \naward, OSHA's highest honor for small businesses that show an exemplary \ncommitment to workplace safety and health.\n  Portage Woods Products LLC, a division of Maine Woods Company LLC, \nlocated in the northern Maine town of Portage, knows what it takes to \nbe a successful small business without compromising safety and \nintegrity. The Pingree family has been invested in logging since 1841. \nCurrently their small business employs 63 individuals and distributes \n$2.6 million in payroll. In 2006, the Pingrees acquired and integrated \nPortage Woods Products, or PWP, into Maine Woods Company. The Portage \nWoods site is the only fully integrated hardwood manufacturing complex \nin the Northeast.\n  Throughout its history, PWP has strived to uphold its mission, ``to \nmanufacture quality hardwood lumber at the lowest cost while providing \nfor a safe work environment.'' To do so, the firm incorporates accident \nprevention into its training of employees, and asks workers to remember \nthat, ``no job is more important than your safety!''\n  Clearly, Portage Woods Products makes safety a priority, and in \nDecember 2010 OSHA recognized this aspect of the business by honoring \nthe company with the SHARP award. This is truly distinctive, as less \nthan 1,600 small worksites currently possess this honor. I commend the \ncompany's high achievement and its laudable commitment to safety. I \nknow firsthand that small businesses face unparalleled burdens in \ncomplying with all types of regulations, which only makes this \naccomplishment all the more impressive.\n  Portage Woods Products has demonstrated that when a company sets \ngoals and prides itself on safety, it is possible to attain excellence. \nI thank everyone at PWP and Maine Woods Company for their dedication \nand commitment to a safe and productive work environment, and offer my \nbest wishes for another 150 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1500-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1500-S1501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CHARLES ``CHUCK'' WIELGUS\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize Charles ``Chuck'' Wielgus of Colorado Springs, a recipient of \nthe 2010 Great Comebacks Award for the Western Region. This award \nhonors 12 individuals throughout the United States who have struggled \nwith a chronic intestinal condition and have exhibited extraordinary \nstrength and courage in fighting to ensure that this condition does not \naffect their ability to live life on their terms.\n  Chuck was serving as executive director of USA Swimming in 2006 when \nhe was diagnosed with stage III colorectal cancer. His diagnosis \nrequired radiation and chemotherapy therapy, as\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nwell as ostomy surgery.

Mr. President, today I recognize Bland County, VA, \nwhich celebrates its sesquicentennial this month.\n  Bland County possesses the strong sense of community that makes \nVirginia an outstanding place to live and work. The county has a rich \nhistory, and is the only county in the Commonwealth that came into \nbeing during the Civil War.\n  Called ``the land between the tunnels'' because of its unique \nlocation, Bland County has more miles of the Appalachian Trail than any \nother county and contains more than 76,970 acres of the Jefferson \nNational Forest. It is a place where people are willing and eager to \nwork, and where the spirit of independence runs freely and fiercely \nalong its ridges and through its valleys.\n  Bland County will commemorate the 150th anniversary of its founding \nwith celebrations held on March 30, the date the county received its \ncharter from the Commonwealth of Virginia. I would like to offer my \ncongratulations to the citizens of Bland on this milestone anniversary \nand wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1501-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1501-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/09/senate-section/article/S1501-4", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bills were read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 525.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants for \nStates to implement minimum and enhanced DNA collection processes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Katie \nSepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2011. I am pleased that Senators \nKyl, Udall of New Mexico, Schumer, and Bennet of Colorado are joining \nme today in sponsoring this important piece of legislation. Congressman \nSchiff and Reichert are also introducing this bipartisan bill in the \nHouse.\n  Similar legislation, which was championed in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Teague, overwhelmingly passed that body \nlast year with a bipartisan vote of 357 to 32. Unfortunately, efforts \nto move the legislation last year were unsuccessful in the Senate. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill \nin the Senate this Congress.\n  The bill is named after Katie Sepich, a promising graduate student \nattending New Mexico State University who was tragically murdered in \n2003. The man who killed Katie was arrested for aggravated assault \nabout 3 months after the murder. Although police had collected the \nkiller's DNA from the crime scene, because there was no requirement \nthat DNA be taken from individuals arrested for serious felonies, \npolice weren't able to get a match until about 3 years after the murder \nwhen the man was sent to prison after being convicted of unrelated \ncrimes.\n  If New Mexico had the arrestee law then that it has today it would \nhave taken 3 months, not 3 years, to solve the crime. Katie's mother, \nJayann, has worked tirelessly at the state and Federal level to give \nlaw enforcement the tools they need to promptly solve crimes and ensure \nthat other mothers don't have to suffer the same horrible ordeal that \nher family has.\n  We can't get Katie back, or the other lives that have been lost to \nthese senseless crimes, but we can do something to help solve cases and \nprevent similar crimes from occurring in the future. One such step is \nto enhance the capacity of States to collect the DNA of individuals \narrested for certain felony crimes, which would substantially increase \nthe ability of law enforcement to match DNA found at crimes scenes with \nthat of suspects and individuals who have been previously arrested, \ncharged, or convicted of crimes.\n  The Federal Government and about half the states, including New \nMexico, currently collect arrestee DNA for serious offenses. This has \nproven to be a very effective tool in solving cases, and it makes sense \nto incentivize States to continue and to expand this effort. Since New \nMexico implemented ``Katie's Law'' in 7007, there have been about 100 \nmatches of arrestees. It is also important to note that DNA collection \nhas not only demonstrated its effectiveness in terms of saving lives \nand preventing crimes, but it has also proved to be an important means \nof ensuring that innocent individuals are not mistakenly jailed for \ncrimes they did not commit.\n  Let me take a moment to specifically describe what this legislation \nwould, and would not, do. First, this legislation is aimed at creating \nan incentive for states to enact arrestee DNA collection program's. It \nis not a mandate. States that meet minimum collection guidelines could \napply for DOJ grant assistance in covering the first-year costs that \nthey have incurred or will incur in implementing the standards. If they \nenact laws in accordance with the enhanced guidelines, States would be \neligible for an additional bonus payment.\n  Second, the bill encourages DNA testing for serious felonies, such as \nmurder, sex crimes, aggravated assault, and burglary. It is narrowly \ntailored to apply to the most serious crimes. Third, the legislation \nprovides that all of the expungement provisions under Federal law are \napplicable. Arrestees who have their DNA included in the Federal \ndatabase may have their records expunged if their conviction is \noverturned, they are acquitted, or charges are dismissed or not filed \nwithin the applicable time period. Furthermore, the bill provides that \nas a condition of receiving a grant States must notify individuals who \nsubmit samples of the relevant expungement procedures and post the \ninformation on a public Web site.\n  Lastly, I would like to address the concerns some have raised about \nthe constitutionality of collecting arrestee DNA. Although courts have \nupheld the collection of arrestee DNA, I recognize that the question of \nwhether the collection of a DNA sample from an arrestee is consistent \nwith the Fourth Amendment isn't a completely settled question of law. \nSome courts have viewed the collection as something akin to \nfingerprinting and other courts have viewed it as a more intrusive \nsearch, such as the taking of a blood sample. However, the Department \nof Justice has stated that it believes that this legislation is \nconstitutional and is supportive of encouraging states to pass DNA \narrestee laws. I believe that such programs, with appropriate \nsafeguards in place, have demonstrated that they can be a very \neffective mechanism to save lives, solve crimes, and prevent wrongful \nconvictions.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Moran, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Barrasso, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Risch, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 518. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an exclusion for assistance provided to participants in certain \nveterinary student loan repayment or forgiveness programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to \nreintroduce legislation with my friend, Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, \nthat will exempt Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program, VMLRP, \nawards from federal income taxation. I drafted this bipartisan bill \nwith the intention of increasing veterinary services in underserved \nshortage areas that lack adequate veterinary expertise.\n  The United States Department of Agriculture's, USDA, Veterinary \nMedicine Loan Repayment Program was authorized in 2003 by the National \nVeterinary Medical Services Act, NVMSA, to help qualified veterinarians \noffset a significant amount of the debt they accrue while pursuing \ntheir degrees if they in turn serve in high-priority veterinary \nshortage areas for a certain length of time. However, the awards are \ncurrently taxed at a rate of 39 percent. This taxation is \ncounterproductive and only delays delivery of veterinary services to \nareas that are in desperate need.\n  In determining whether an area is eligible for assistance under the \nVMLRP, USDA has the ability to declare ``shortage situations,'' in \nwhich the Department makes declarations of veterinary shortage areas. \nCurrently, there are two circumstances that lead to such designations. \nThe first is by geography, when a given geographic area suffers a \nshortage of veterinarians overall. The second occurs when areas suffer \na shortage of veterinarians who practice in a particular field of \nveterinary specialty. My home State of South Dakota currently has four \ndesignated shortage situations. Two of these designations are statewide \ndesignations noting a shortage of practitioners in veterinary \nspecialties. On a national scale, there are 1,300 counties in the \nUnited States that have less than one food animal veterinarian per \n25,000 farm animals. Additionally, there are 500 counties that have at \nleast 5,000 farm animals and not a single veterinarian. Bear in mind, \nthe demand for veterinarians across our country could increase 14 \npercent by 2016.\n  South Dakota is truly a wonderful place to call home, but it is not \nalways an easy place to earn a living. This is especially true for \nyoung people who are just starting out and are saddled with crushing \nlevels of school debt. I have long fought for legislation that makes it \neasier for students to pay off their loans and to encourage others who \nmay be reluctant to pursue higher education degrees, due to a lack of \nfinancial resources, especially when it comes to costly professional \ndegrees including veterinary medicine. My legislation will help \nstudents pursue their educational goals, while also providing important \nservices to underserved rural areas by enhancing the assistance \nveterinary graduates receive in exchange for meaningful public service.\n  Agriculture is the top contributor to our South Dakota economy. For \nthose farmers and ranchers who make their living in agriculture, this \nis more than a job; it is a way of life. Our ranchers, many of whom \noperate in very rural areas, rely on the access they have to qualified \nveterinarians to care for their livestock. Adequate access to \nveterinary care in rural areas is critical for both human and animal \nhealth, as well as animal welfare, disease surveillance, public safety \nand economic development across America. Everyone in America benefits \nfrom the veterinary services provided in even the most remote areas of \nour nation. As such, I am committed to doing all I can to help bring \nveterinarians to underserved parts of our state.\n  I am proud to have fought for the establishment of the VMLRP program, \nand through my seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have \nworked year after year to secure its proper funding. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the taxes assessed on these benefits prevent us from using \ncongressionally appropriated funding to the fullest extent. For every \nthree veterinarians selected for the loan repayment awards, an \nadditional veterinarian could also be selected to serve in an \nunderserved shortage area if the program was made exempt from taxes. \nSuch a tax exemption is not without precedent; Congress exempted from \ntaxation the assistance received by participants in the National Health \nServices Corps, NHSC, in 2004, and I hope that my colleagues will join \nme in extending this same type of assistance to veterinarians \nparticipating in the VMLRP program.\n  It should be noted that nearly 140 organizations from across the \nnation have announced their support for a tax exemption for VMLRP, \nincluding the American Veterinary Medical Association, American \nAssociation of Equine Practitioners, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the American Sheep Industry Association, the National \nFarmers Union, and the South Dakota Veterinary Medical Association, \nSouth Dakota Farm Bureau, South Dakota Farmers Union, South Dakota \nCattlemen's Association, South Dakota Stockgrowers Association and \nmany, many others.\n  Agriculture is the economic engine that drives our rural communities, \nand without viable family farms and ranchers, our small towns and Main \nStreet businesses throughout South Dakota and our nation would face \nsignificant hardships. It is absolutely essential that our agricultural \nproducers have access to the services they need to be successful and \nresponsible, and the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \nEnhancement Act will help make that possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Veterinary Medical Association Governmental \n           Relations Division,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\nStatement of Support for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \n                            Enhancement Act\n\n       The undersigned organizations urge Congress to pass the \n     Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program Enhancement Act, \n     which will provide a federal income tax exemption for \n     payments received under the Veterinary Medicine Loan \n     Repayment Program (VMLRP) and similar state programs.\n       Since Congress passed the ``National Veterinary Medical \n     Services Act'' (PL 108-161) on Dec. 6, 2003, it has \n     appropriated $9.6 million for awards. About $3.75 million of \n     this amount will be used by the Agriculture Secretary to pay \n     taxes on the awards. Every dollar spent on taxes is one less \n     available for loan repayment awards. If awards are made tax \n     exempt, one additional veterinarian can be selected for every \n     three awarded under current law.\n       The first 62 veterinarians were selected for VMLRP awards \n     in September 2010. These veterinarians will practice food \n     supply medicine and veterinary public health in federally \n     designated shortage situations across the country. The \n     selected group of veterinarians will receive up to $25,000 \n     annually for three years to repay student loans. Each VMLRP \n     award including taxes for three years costs approximately \n     $104,250 per veterinarian ($75,000 for loan repayment and \n     $29,250 for taxes).\n       Congress set a precedent for tax exemption. The National \n     Health Service Corps (NHSC) loan repayment program \n     (counterpart program for human medicine) was exempted by \n     ``The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004'' (H.R. 4520, P.L. \n     108-357), enacted on Oct. 22, 2004. Prior to this legislative \n     change, NHSC loan repayment awards were treated as taxable \n     income.\n       Veterinarians selected for VMLRP provide a wide array of \n     necessary veterinary services for farmers' and ranchers' \n     livestock including beef and dairy cows, poultry, swine, \n     goats, sheep, and farm horses. VMLRP veterinarians ensure \n     animal health and welfare while protecting the nation's food \n     supply. They provide veterinarian-accredited medical \n     procedures including routine services (vaccination, \n     castration and dehorning) and emergency services (for acute \n     illness, trauma, dystocia or obstetrical difficulties). Other \n     services performed include those required for interstate \n     movement of livestock, including commuter agreements and \n     animal health testing requirements needed to ship livestock. \n     VMLRP veterinarians perform tuberculosis checks and \n     accredited blood sample services for Brucellosis, Bluetongue, \n     and Bovine Viral Diarrhea. Additionally, they may provide \n     reproduction management consultation services and \n     consultation in health care programs and nutrition, disease \n     surveillance and diagnostics for state and federal disease \n     programs and foreign animal diseases. They may also play a \n     role in a state's\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\n     veterinary emergency response team and take part in disease \n     control and eradication programs.\n       Exempting veterinary medicine loan repayment and \n     forgiveness program awards from federal income taxation will \n     lead to more communities having needed veterinary services \n     sooner than they may otherwise. We strongly support Congress' \n     efforts to ensure that our nation's livestock are healthy, \n     that our food supply is safe and secure, and our public \n     health is protected.\n

A bill to terminate certain hydropower reservations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto remove the encumbrances from land patents for a dam project that \nwill never be built. This will enable the current owner of the land to \nsell or bequeath his land more easily.\n  Donald Smith and his family acquired two parcels of undeveloped \npublic land in Madera County, California by patent of the United States \nin 1983 and 1987. These parcels, comprising 103.26 acres and 41.323 \nacres, respectively, are adjacent to U.S. Forest Service land.\n  In the early 1980s, the U.S. Government anticipated that a \nhydroelectric power project might someday be built in the vicinity, \ncausing all or a portion of these lands to be inundated with water. \nAccordingly, when it issued the 1983 patent to Mr. Smith, the Bureau of \nLand Management included a ``flowage easement'', reserving the right of \nthe government to flood the lands for a power dam. In the mid-1980s, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission determined that this \nreservation and others like it were ``non-essential'', and that no dam \nwould be built. Accordingly, no easement was included in the 1987 \npatent, although some believe it was erroneously omitted.\n  Flowage easements constitute a cloud on the title to land, \nrestricting its market value and the orderly disposition of his estate. \nSince FERC, and all potentially interested parties, including BLM, \nSouthern California Edison and the U.S. Forest Service, have agreed \nthat the easement in this instance serves no purpose, and no dam\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nwill be built, clear title should be restored. The Solicitor of the \nDepartment of the Interior has decided this requires an Act of \nCongress.\n  Mr. Smith is now a senior citizen, and seeks to assure that his heirs \nwill not be burdened by this matter and will benefit from the full fair \nmarket value of these now-verdant and recreational lands. Through \nenactment of this simple bill, the Congress will finally affirm a \ndecision made by FERC in 1986, and restore ``clean'' title for benefit \nof Mr. Smith, his heirs and assigns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nintegration of mental health services and mental health treatment \noutreach teams, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing the Positive Aging Act, \nwhich will help to increase older Americans' access to quality mental \nhealth screening and treatment services in community-based care \nsettings.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important \nfor States like Maine that have a disproportionate number of older \npersons. Fifteen percent of Maine's population is 65 or older, and, \nwith the highest median age, Maine is the ``oldest'' State in the \nnation. Moreover, our percentage of older adults is increasing, and, by \n2030, more than one in five Mainers will be over the age of 65.\n  One of the most daunting public health challenges facing our Nation \ntoday is how to increase access to quality mental health services for \nthe more than 44 million Americans with severe, disabling mental \ndisorders that can devastate their lives and the lives of the people \naround them.\n  What is often overlooked, however, is the prevalence of mental \nillness among our Nation's elderly. Studies have shown that more than \none in five Americans aged 65 and older experience mental illness, and \nthat as many as 80 percent of elderly persons in nursing homes suffer \nfrom some kind of mental impairment. Particularly disturbing is the \nfact that the mental health needs of older Americans are often \noverlooked or not recognized because of the mistaken belief that they \nare a normal part of aging and therefore cannot be treated.\n  While older Americans experience the full range of mental disorders, \nthe most prevalent mental illness afflicting older people is \ndepression. Ironically, while recent advances have made depression an \neminently treatable disorder, only a minority of elderly depressed \npersons are receiving adequate treatment. Unfortunately, the vast \nmajority of depressed elderly don't seek help. Many simply accept their \nfeelings of profound sadness and do not realize that they are \nclinically depressed.\n  Moreover, those who do seek help are often underdiagnosed or \nmisdiagnosed, leading the National Institute of Mental Health to \nestimate that 60 percent of older Americans with depression are not \nreceiving the mental health care that they need. Failure to treat this \nkind of disorder leads to poorer health outcomes for other medical \nconditions, higher rates of institutionalization, and increased health \ncare costs.\n  Fortunately, important research is being done that is developing \ninnovative approaches to improve the delivery of mental health care for \nolder adults by integrating it into primary care settings. This \nresearch demonstrates that older adults are more likely to receive \nappropriate mental health care if there is a mental health professional \non the primary care team, rather than simply referring them to a mental \nhealth specialist outside the primary care setting. Multiple \nappointments with multiple providers in multiple settings simply don't \nwork for older patients who must also cope with concurrent chronic \nillnesses, mobility problems, and limited transportation options. The \nresearch also shows that there is less stigma associated with \npsychiatric services when they are integrated into general medical \ncare.\n  The Positive Aging Act builds upon this research and authorizes \nfunding for projects that integrate mental health screening and \ntreatment services into community sites and primary care settings. \nSpecifically, the Positive Aging Act of 2011 would authorize the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to fund \ndemonstration projects to support integration of mental health services \nin primary care settings. It would also support grants for community-\nbased mental health treatment outreach teams to improve older \nAmericans' access to mental health services. To ensure that these \ngeriatric mental health programs have proper attention and oversight, \nit would mandate the designation of a Deputy Director for Older Adult \nMental Health Services in the Center for Mental Health Services, and it \nwould also include representatives of older Americans or their families \nand geriatric mental health professionals on the Advisory Council for \nthe Center for Mental Health Services. Finally, it would require state \nplans under Community Mental Health Services Block Grants to include \ndescriptions of the states' outreach to and services for older \nindividuals.\n  We are fortunate today to have a variety of effective treatments to \naddress the mental health needs of American seniors. The Positive Aging \nAct will help to ensure that older Americans have access to these \nimportant services. I therefore urge my colleagues to sign on as \ncosponsors of the legislation, which has been endorsed by a broad \ncoalition of mental health and senior organizations, including the \nAlzheimer's Association, the American Geriatrics Society, the American \nPsychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the \nAmerican Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, and the National Council \non Aging.\n  Mr. President, I ask uanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Mikulski: On behalf of the \n     undersigned organizations, we are writing to applaud your \n     ongoing commitment to the mental and behavioral health needs \n     of older Americans and express our strong support for the \n     Positive Aging Act, which you are planning to introduce in \n     the near future. This important legislation will improve \n     access to vital mental and behavioral health care for older \n     adults by supporting the integration of mental health \n     services in primary care and community settings.\n       An estimated 20 percent of community-based older adults in \n     the U.S. have a mental health problem. These disorders can \n     have a significant impact on both physical and mental health, \n     often leading to increases in disease, disability, and \n     mortality. In fact, men age 85 and older currently have the \n     highest rates of suicide in our country and depression is the \n     foremost risk factor. Evidence suggests that up to 75 percent \n     of older adults who die by suicide have visited a primary\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\n     care professional within 30 days of their death. Although \n     effective treatments exist, the mental health needs of many \n     older Americans go unrecognized and untreated because of \n     poorly integrated systems of care to address the physical and \n     mental health needs of seniors.\n       The Positive Aging Act takes an important step toward \n     improving access to quality mental and behavioral health care \n     for older adults by integrating mental health services in \n     primary care and community settings where older adults reside \n     and receive services. By supporting collaboration between \n     interdisciplinary teams of mental health professionals and \n     other providers of health and social services, this \n     legislation promotes an integrated approach to addressing the \n     health and well being of our nation's growing older adult \n     population.\n       We commend you for your leadership and commitment to the \n     mental and behavioral health needs of older adults and look \n     forward to working with you to ensure passage of the Positive \n     Aging Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Foundation of America; \n     American Assisted Living Nurses Association; American \n     Association for Geriatric Psychiatry; American Association \n     for Long Term Care Nursing; American Association for \n     Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work; American Association \n     for Psychosocial Rehabilitation; American Association on \n     Health and Disability; American Foundation for Suicide \n     Prevention/SPAN USA; American Geriatrics Society; American \n     Group Psychotherapy Association; American Mental Health \n     Counselors Association; American Nurses Association; American \n     Occupational Therapy Association; American Orthopsychiatric \n     Association; American Psychiatric Association; American \n     Psychological Association; American Psychotherapy \n     Association; American Society on Aging; Anxiety Disorders \n     Association of America.\n       Association for Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare; Bazelon \n     Center for Mental Health Law; Clinical Social Work \n     Association; Clinical Social Work Guild 49; Council of \n     Professional Geropsychology Training Programs; Depression and \n     Bipolar Support Alliance; Direct Care Alliance; Geriatric \n     Mental Health Alliance of New York; Gerontological Society of \n     America; Illinois Coalition on Mental Health and Aging; Iowa \n     Coalition on Mental Health and Aging; Jewish Federation of \n     Metropolitan Chicago; Jewish Federations of North America; \n     Kansas Advocates for Better Care; Kansas Suicide Prevention \n     Committee; Mental Health America; Midland Area Agency on \n     Aging; National Alliance for Caregiving; National Association \n     for Behavioral Health; National Association for Children's \n     Behavioral Health.\n       National Association of Area Agencies on Aging; National \n     Association of Social Workers; National Association of State \n     Mental Health Program Directors; National Center for Assisted \n     Living; National Coalition on Care Coordination; National \n     Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care; National Council \n     for Community Behavioral Healthcare; National Council on \n     Aging; National Council on Problem Gambling; National \n     Foundation for Mental Health; New Hampshire Coalition on \n     Substance Abuse, Mental Health & Aging; Oklahoma Mental \n     Health and Aging Coalition; PHI--Quality Care through Quality \n     Jobs; Psychologists in Long Term Care; US Psychiatric \n     Rehabilitation Association; Witness Justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 532. A bill to establish the Patriot Express Loan Program under \nwhich the Small Business Administration may make loans to members of \nthe military community wanting to start or expand small business \nconcerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Mark Pryor, in introducing the Patriot Express \nAuthorization Act of 2011. This legislation codifies a critical Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA, lending program for America's veterans \nand Reservists, as well as their spouses.\n  It is critical that we support our nation's veterans and, in \nparticular, our service-members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. \nRegrettably, the unemployment rate for veterans of these two wars is \n12.5 percent--a full 3.6 percent higher than the national unemployment \nrate for the overall population. Many of these brave men and women have \naspirations of owning their own business, and I was proud to work with \nSenator Kerry to pass the Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business \nReauthorization and Opportunity Act of 2008, which President George W. \nBush signed into law three years ago. This legislation contains a \nnumber of provisions to help veterans and Reservists who own or are \nseeking to own a business, and created an Interagency Task Force on \nVeterans Small Business Development, which President Obama formed by \nExecutive Order last spring, to assist veterans with government \ncontracting and capital access opportunities in particular.\n  One way the SBA has supported veteran entrepreneurs is through the \nPatriot Express Loan Initiative, which was established as a pilot \nprogram in 2007. According to the data from the SBA, Patriot Express \nsupported nearly 7,000 loans totaling $560 million to small businesses \nowned and operated by eligible participants in just three and a half \nyears. While the program was scheduled to expire in December, the SBA \nextended it for an additional three years, through 2013. That said, \nthis legislation would provide certainty to the program by placing it \nin statute.\n  Coupled with the counseling and training assistance provided by the \nSBA's Office of Veterans Business Development, the Patriot Express loan \nprogram is a signal to our nation's veterans, Reservists, service-\nmembers, and their families that the Federal government takes seriously \nits obligation to give back for all they have done to defend our \nnation. These loans will help participants start or expand their firms, \npurchase equipment or inventory, and ultimately, create jobs. I am \nproud to cosponsor this legislation with Senator Pryor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Lee):\n  S. 533. A bill to amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure to improve attorney accountability, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \ncivil justice legislation. This legislation is desperately needed for \nseveral reasons--the most important of which is to cut down on the \ncosts and expenses that are preventing private businesses from creating \njobs for our fellow citizens during these difficult times.\n  The billions of dollars wasted on frivolous lawsuits cost Americans \njobs and severely damage our economy. The precise cost of America's \nlawsuit culture is staggering. The tort system's direct costs in 2002 \nwere $233 billion, the equivalent of a 5 percent tax on wages. Today \nthat number is even higher; the annual direct cost of American tort \nlitigation exceeds $250 billion.\n  Indeed, frivolous lawsuits are helping to prevent the ``innovation'' \nthat the Obama administration is touting as the key to ``job creation'' \nand economic recovery. For example, firms with recent initial public \nofferings are most at risk to be sued. In fact, companies are most \nlikely to be sued in their second year of public trading. In other \nwords, the very corporations most likely to be the source of \nsignificant new job creation are at the highest risk of being sued just \nwhen they are seeking expansion capital through public offerings.\n  In particular, frivolous lawsuits hurt small businesses. Small \nbusinesses rank the cost and availability of liability insurance as \nsecond only to the cost of health care as their top concerns, and both \nproblems are fueled by frivolous lawsuits.\n  Our front-line defense against frivolous lawsuits and the misuse of \nour legal system is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nThis rule is intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the \noffending party. The power of Rule 11 was diluted in 1993. This \nweakening is unacceptable to those of us who want to preserve courts as \nneutral forums for dispute resolution.\n  That is why I am introducing the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2011, \n``LARA,'' which amends Rule 11 to restore its strength and ability to \ntruly deter frivolous lawsuits. Senator Mike Lee of Utah is \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  Representative Lamar Smith, the Chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, is introducing an identical bill today in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Specifically, LARA takes three strong steps to help thwart frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  First, LARA reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that made \nsanctions discretionary rather than mandatory.\n  One of the most harmful changes that took effect in 1993 was to make \nsanctions for proven violations of Rule 11 discretionary. This means \nthat if a party files a lawsuit simply to harass another party, and the \ncourt decides that this is in fact the case, the offending party still \nmight not be sanctioned. This is unacceptable. The offending\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\nparty might not be punished at all, which provides no deterrence for \nthe offending party or anyone else who wants to misuse the courts. My \nbill reinstates the requirement that if there is a violation of Rule \n11, there are sanctions.\n  Second, LARA requires that judges impose monetary sanctions against \nlawyers who file frivolous lawsuits. Those monetary sanctions will \ninclude the attorney's fees and costs incurred by the victim of the \nfrivolous lawsuit.\n  Finally, LARA reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that allow \nparties and their attorneys to avoid sanctions for making frivolous \nclaims by withdrawing them within 21 days after a motion for sanctions \nhas been served.\n  Because of Rule 11's ``safe harbor'' provision, many frivolous claims \nare never fully reviewed by federal judges. Under the ``safe harbor'' \nprovision, a person who is victimized by a frivolous claim must hire an \nattorney to draft a motion for sanctions. That motion cannot, however, \nbe filed immediately. Rather, under Rule 11(c)(2), the motion is served \non the offending attorney 21-days before it is filed. During that \nperiod, the offending attorney can withdraw the frivolous claim and \nthereby avoid any sanction. LARA would prevent such injustices by \neliminating the ``safe harbor'' provision.\n  Although LARA would only amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the procedural rules in State courts are often amended to \ntrack changes in the Federal rules. Consequently, it is our hope that \nmany states would amend their rules governing frivolous lawsuits to \nreflect the changes implemented by LARA, just as they did when Rule 11 \nwas last changed in 1993.\n  Without the serious threat of punishment for filing frivolous \nlawsuits, innocent individuals and companies will continue to face the \nharsh economic reality that simply paying off frivolous claimants \nthrough monetary settlements is often cheaper than litigating the case. \nThis perverse dynamic not only results in legalized extortion, but it \nleads to increases in the insurance premiums all individuals and \nbusinesses must pay. That is money that could be going to create new \njobs.\n  I want to work with those who are willing to be reasonable. I know \nthat some have expressed concerns with similar bills in the past. We \nhave considered those concerns and have drafted a bill that takes them \ninto account. For example, this bill expressly provides that nothing in \nit ``shall be construed to bar or impede the assertion or development \nof new claims, defenses, or remedies under Federal, State, or local \nlaws, including civil rights laws.''\n  Requiring mandatory sanctions is not an extreme position. It is a \nreasonable and effective solution to the problem of runaway frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  Indeed, a mandatory sanctions requirement is currently the law in the \narea of securities litigation. In 1995, we enacted the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act, PSLRA, over President Clinton's veto. \nIt essentially reinstates the 1983 version of Rule 11 for the purposes \nof securities litigation that falls within its coverage, and makes the \nimposition of sanctions mandatory. Upon a final adjudication of a case, \nthe PSLRA requires courts to make written findings on whether the \nparties have complied with Rule 11. In other words, no motion for \nsanctions needs to be filed.\n  At the conclusion of the case, a judge must review the case for \ncompliance with Rule 11 and, if he finds that there has been a \nviolation, he must impose sanctions.\n  So addressing the damaging impact of frivolous lawsuits has had \nbipartisan support in the past. That bipartisan support should be even \ngreater during these difficult economic times.\n  Let's look at a few examples of the type of lawsuits that businesses \nmust contend with:\n  In July 2009, three New Jersey residents, backed by an advocacy \ngroup, filed a class action lawsuit against several hot dog \nmanufacturers claiming they were exposed to carcinogens by eating hot \ndogs. None of the plaintiffs had actually developed cancer. The lawsuit \nsought damages in the amount of the total cost of the plaintiffs' hot \ndog purchases and a requirement that the companies place a new label on \npackages and advertising reading: ``Warning: Consuming hot dogs and \nother processed meats increases the risk of cancer.''\n  The case was dismissed on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Thus, a Federal \ncourt held that the plaintiffs had failed to even allege a claim, as a \nmatter of law.\n  In another case, a customer alleged that a wild bird ``attacked'' her \nwhile in a Lowe's outdoor garden center, causing her head injuries. She \nclaimed negligence and a violation of the Illinois Animal Control Act. \nShe maintained that the wild birds created a dangerous condition on the \nproperty and that Lowe's failed to exercise ordinary care to ensure \nthat the premises were reasonably safe and failed to prevent the birds \nfrom entering the garden center.\n  A Federal court entered summary judgment in favor of Lowe's holding \nthat a ``reasonable plaintiff'' either would have noticed the birds or \nunderstood that contact with them was possible in any outdoor area with \nplants. The court also held that Lowe's was not the ``owner'' of the \nbirds, a necessary element of the customer's statutory claim.\n  These are just two examples of the scores of frivolous lawsuits that \nAmerican businesses must contend with each year.\n  Requiring sanctions when judges find lawsuits are frivolous will \ndeter these types of cases from being brought. The savings will result \nin cost savings for businesses and new jobs for American workers.\n  The time for words and rhetoric has long since passed. If the \nPresident means what he is saying about creating jobs, then we must \ntake action. We need to help private business spur job creation. LARA \nis action. LARA is a step in the right direction.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to work with me and to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Burr, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Brown of \n        Ohio, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Tester, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Portman, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 534. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na reduced rate of excise tax on beer produced domestically by certain \nsmall producers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Crapo and I are reintroducing \nlegislation to assist small brewers across the country. The Brewer's \nEmployment and Excise Relief, BEER, Act of 2011 would reduce the excise \ntax on domestic small beer producers as well as update the definition \nof what constitutes a small brewer to reflect today's market. Senators \nWyden, Snowe, Schumer, Cornyn, Leahy, Burr, Mikulski, Scott Brown, \nMerkley, Wicker, Sherrod Brown, Chambliss, Tester, Cochran, and \nCantwell are cosponsors of this legislation.\n  As our economy continues on a track to recovery, we should remain \nfocused on reducing unemployment and putting American's back to work. \nThis legislation will do just that by helping an industry that is \nhiring and plans on expanding. Massachusetts is home to 38 small \nbreweries.\n  Though there has been a continued increase in consumer demand for the \nunique brews created by these small brewers, these beer producers \noperate at a distinct disadvantage when compared to the largest brewers \nin this country. While demand is growing, small brewers account for \njust 5 percent of beer sales nationwide and they face higher costs for \nproduction, raw materials, and market entry when compared to their much \nlarger counterparts.\n  The BEER Act legislation will revise the classification of a domestic \nsmall brewer, a definition that has not been updated since 1976. Under \ncurrent law, small brewers are limited to those that produce 2 million \nbarrels of beer per year. This legislation would update and raise the \nceiling for the small brewer tax rate to 6 million barrels per year to \nreflect the original intent of differentiation between the large and \nsmall brewers. The largest beer producer in America used to produce 45 \nmillion barrels annually and that has increased to over 100 million \nbarrels.\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\n  This legislation will also lower the excise tax rate on these small \nbrewers on their first 60,000 barrels produced from $7 per barrel to \n$3.50 per barrel. Currently for the production over 60,000 barrels up \nto 2 million barrels, these brewers pay $18 per barrel in taxes, the \nsame amount that the large brewers pay. This legislation would reduce \nthat rate for small brewers to $16 per barrel.\n  Small brewers employ nearly 100,000 people nationwide. This \nlegislation will provide tax relief for this important industry, and \nallow these companies to expand both their production and their work \nforce. A March 2010 economic analysis of this legislation done by Dr. \nJohn Friedman of Harvard University has estimated that the legislation \nwill stimulate job creation at a rate of 2,700 new jobs in the first \nyear to 18 months, with an additional 375 new jobs each year for the \nfollowing 4 years.\n  The benefits do not simply begin and end with the ability for these \nsmall breweries to grow. This legislation would benefit the consumer \nbuying a 6 pack of Sierra Nevada or Harpoon in their local supermarket \nwhere prices on craft beer would be reduced by about 20 cents per case. \nThe farms in the states that produce the barely, hops, and other \nmaterials that go into these fine brews would also see an increased \ndemand for their products.\n  This legislation would provide important benefits to America's small \nbrewers and spur economic activity.
