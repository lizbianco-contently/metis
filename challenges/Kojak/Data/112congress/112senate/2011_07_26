Madam President, there has been a lot of talk in the last \n24 hours about so-called dueling plans to raise the debt limit and \navert a dangerous default to this nation's financial obligations. As \nfar as I can tell, the only dueling going on in Washington today is \nbetween the Republican Party's multiple personalities--and there are \nquite a few.\n  Last night I introduced an amendment that I thought was fail-safe. It \nwould prevent default using only proposals Republicans have already \nsupported. Yet House Republicans had harsh words for the Democrats' \nplan yesterday--odd, considering every bit of our proposal was taken \nfrom the Republican playbook. Let me explain the plan.\n  It would avert default while cutting $2.7 trillion from the deficit \nin the next decade. It would cut more money, more quickly, than the \ncompeting proposal introduced by Republican leaders yesterday, and it \nwould last for a long time, not just a few months so we would be back \nin the trenches doing the same thing at Christmastime we are doing now.\n  The proposal includes no revenues, as House Republicans insisted it \nmust not. It holds harmless even the most wasteful of tax breaks and \ngiveaways to big oil companies and billionaires, which Republicans have \nvowed to protect even if it costs our economy in the process.\n  It establishes a joint congressional committee to find additional \nsavings this year and guarantees that the committee's recommendations \nwill be an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, no amendments, no \nfilibuster, yes or no. We have done this before. It worked well with \nour base closing legislation a few years ago.\n  Every single spending cut in the proposal has already been endorsed \nby Republicans. I repeat: Every single spending cut in the proposal has \nalready been endorsed by Republicans. The cuts have already been voted \nfor by Republicans in both Houses of Congress.\n  In short, it is everything the Republicans have demanded wrapped up \nin a\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\nbow and delivered to their door. But now Republicans say their demands, \nwhich have been met in full, are not enough. They insist instead that \nwe pass their plan, a similar plan in many respects, save for several \ncrucial details.\n  Their plan also raises the debt ceiling but for only a few months. It \ncuts spending and includes no revenue increases. These are the major \ndifferences: It does not cut as much from the deficit as the \nlegislation I introduced last night--in fact, not nearly as much. It is \na short-term fix that Republicans know is untenable to Democrats and \nthe White House and Congress. In short, the Republican plan they know \nwill not pass the Senate of the United States.\n  Not long ago, it was untenable for the Republicans. This is what \nSpeaker Boehner said about short-term measures in May. Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives John Boehner said this in May:\n\n       I am not really interested in a short-term increase in the \n     debt limit. Our economy won't grow as long as we continue to \n     trip it up with short-term gimmicks from Washington.\n\n  House Majority Leader Cantor echoed the sentiment in June:\n\n       I'm not sure how if we're not willing to make tough \n     decisions now, we'll be willing to make them later. . . . It \n     is my preference that we do this thing one time. . . . \n     Putting off tough decisions is not what people want.\n\n  We agree. We agree. Certainly we agree.\n  This is what the Washington Post said about Republicans' bizarre \nabout-face yesterday: ``It seems that perhaps the only meaningful \ndifference between the two plans is that the Democratic plan gets it \ndone in one fell swoop, while the GOP proposal does a short-term deal \nfollowed by another a year later, something that financial analysts say \ncould lead to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and that \nRepublicans themselves once opposed.''\n  In fact, rating agencies have said as late as last night that the \nplan that I introduced will not cause a downgrading of our credit. The \none the Republicans introduced will.\n  The Republicans are insisting we relive the endless negotiation and \npartisan wrangling of the last 6 weeks again 6 months from now with no \ngood outcome guaranteed. I have said a short-term solution is no \nsolution at all. It puts us right back in this untenable position a few \nshort months from now. It gives the markets no stability, it gives the \nAmerican people no certainty, and it gives the credit rating agencies \nno choice but to downgrade U.S. debt, a move that would cause interest \nrates to rise and effectively increase taxes for every American--every \nAmerican.\n  Market analysts and credit rating agencies have said a short-term fix \nwould risk many of the same effects as a default, and that is a risk \nour economy cannot afford. If Republicans continue to oppose the \nreasonable proposal I brought to the floor last night--and which we \nwill vote on here in the Senate soon--it will be for political reasons \ndriven by the ideological tea party. It will be crystal clear that \nRepublicans do not care if we default on the debt. That is sad but \ntrue. After all, we have given them a plan that should, by all rights, \nbe guaranteed to pass the House, and with Senate support here, which we \nshould have, it should pass both Houses. Yet they have trashed it right \nout of the gate.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post called this debate over whether to \ndefault on the full faith and credit of the United States of America \n``surreal'' and ``bizarre.'' Those were their words. This commentary is \nvalid. Reasonable Republicans have been offered absolutely everything \nthey have asked for. Still they refuse to take yes for an answer, all \nbecause of a cadre of unreasonable tea-party-driven House Republicans. \nThat is too bad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4884-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I want to thank Leader Harry Reid for \nstepping into the breach in this situation and offering us a way out of \nthis what I consider to be a Republican-made crisis. Why do I say that? \nThe debt limit has been increased 89 times since 1939, 55 times under \nRepublican Presidents and 34 times under Democratic Presidents.\n  Never has either party brought us to this brink of default. Never. \nNever. Never in the history of America. It is a manmade crisis. It is a \nRepublican-made crisis. It has never happened before. The real \nchallenge we face is clearly with our deficit and our debt. The good \nnews is that we had this crisis before, this challenge before, and we \nstepped up to the plate. We passed a budget when Bill Clinton was \nPresident that not only balanced the budget--and we did not need a \namendment to the Constitution to do it, we did it by working it out, by \ncutting out the waste and the fraud and abuse in government, by \nchoosing to invest in important areas such as education, high-tech--\nbiotech at that time, which created jobs, which created so many jobs in \nthis country--23 million jobs. That was the absolute result of this \nvery good budget.\n  A budget expresses the hopes and dreams of the people, the priorities \nof the people. That challenge was met before, so we know how to do it. \nYou sit down, you figure out what is a waste of spending, what is \nimportant spending, and you pursue policies that create jobs. We did it \nbefore, we can do it again. It is a challenge, but we can do it because \nwe did it.\n  Others will say in order to do it you have to have a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. Well, the facts do not back that up. In \norder to get a balanced budget, you simply have to balance the budget. \nYou simply have to do the hard work to get it done.\n  This manmade crisis, this Republican-made crisis, is totally \nunnecessary. I never heard one of these folks who says, let's go into \ndefault--I never heard them speak out during the George W. Bush years \nwhen we raised the debt ceiling seven times, and some of them were \naround during the Reagan years, and 18 times the debt ceiling was \nraised. Under George W. Bush, my Republican friends raised the debt \nceiling by 90 percent. President Obama is asking for an increase of \nabout 18 percent. So, America, figure it out. All of a sudden, after \nputting two wars on the credit card, tax cuts to millionaires and \nbillionaires on the credit card as my Republican friends did, a \nprescription drug policy which was not paid for--none of it was paid \nfor--they put it on the credit card. And now they say: Oh, woe is me. \nWe have a debt.\n  Well, they should have discovered that before. In 8 years George W. \nBush turned a $236 billion surplus into a $1.3 trillion deficit, and \nthat is what President Obama inherited. We have a moment of opportunity \nhere, and I think what Senator Reid has done is given us a way out of \nthis mess. We put into place $2.7 trillion of cuts, and we give a sense \nof certainty to the marketplace for 18 months that this debt ceiling is \ntaken care of.\n  Let's get back to business around here of taking care of this long-\nterm deficit and debt challenge, and creating jobs for our people and \nprotecting Medicare and Social Security and all of the rest that we \nhave to do.\n  We have to build infrastructure. I am the chairman of the committee \nthat is in charge of the highway bill. We have good bipartisan \ncooperation, but we need to get this resolved.\n  The Boehner plan is so short term it sends a chill through the \nmarketplace. I used to be a stockbroker many years ago. When the \nPresident got a cold, the stock market went down. It is very sensitive \nto these things. The Boehner plan, according to some commentators, will \ncause a downgrade of our securities.\n  I don't think we should be in the business of downgrading America. We \nshould be in the business of lifting America, of letting the people \nknow we are taking care of their business.\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\n  The Republicans' interest is going after the middle class, the \nworking poor, to protect the millionaires and the billionaires. Here is \nwhere we are with that policy: The 400 richest Americans have more \nwealth than the first 50 percent of the American people. Imagine, the \nrichest 10 percent of all Americans controls two-thirds of America's \nnet worth. The average CEO receives 180 times more in compensation than \nthe average production worker. In 1965, CEOs made 24 times more in \ncompensation. Now it is 185 times.\n  What we hear when we suggest millionaires and billionaires pay just a \nlittle bit more to help America get out of this challenge we face is an \nalmost out-of-control defense from the Republicans about why we should \nnot even consider asking them to pay even 2 cents more. They say: Don't \ntax the job creators. I said to my staff: Let's take a look at who are \nthe job creators and what they earn.\n  As everybody knows, the small businesses are the biggest job \ncreators. I wish to make it clear that only 1.4 percent of taxpayers \nwith any business income make over $500,000 per year. What I am saying \nis, they say don't tax the job creators, and we are looking at taxing \npeople over $500,000 a person. That is only 1.4 percent of the job \ncreators. We are not touching 98 percent of the job creators. So don't \nget up there and say we want to tax job creators--not true. We do want \nto ask millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share.\n  On July 21, 200 millionaires signed a letter asking congressional \nRepublicans to consider sealing the budget gap with increased revenue--\nhigher taxes on them. They say:\n\n       Despite our willingness to provide additional support to \n     the country financially to assure its continued well-being, \n     despite the overwhelming support of the idea among the \n     American people, despite the reality that millionaires like \n     us are paying lower taxes now than at any other time in the \n     last 60 years, and despite the fact that the Bush tax cuts \n     are the single largest cause of the deficit, you have \n     repeatedly refused to consider reasonable steps to address \n     our country's fiscal challenges.\n\n  They say they are reiterating their demand that we look to the \nmillionaires and billionaires. Look, our challenges of deficit and debt \ncan, in fact, be met. We know the road. The road is clear. The road was \nbuilt by President Bill Clinton and the Democrats at that time and \neventually a lot of Republicans came on with us--eventually. In the \nbeginning, they predicted gloom and doom from the Clinton budget.\n  I have a bunch of quotes from Members who are still here on the \nRepublican side who said the Clinton budget is going to lead to a \nrecession, it is going to lead to unemployment, and it is going to lead \nto deficits. But we went into a great period of prosperity, with 23 \nmillion jobs, a budget in balance, and a debt about to be extinguished \ndown the road. That all got upended by the Republican plan to lower the \ntaxes on the richest Americans and put it on the credit card, to go \ninto two wars and put it on the credit card, pass a prescription drug \nbenefit and protect Big Pharma by saying Medicare cannot negotiate for \nlower prices. They put that on the credit card.\n  It is no wonder we face this problem. When President Obama got in, we \nwere bleeding jobs at 800,000 a month--almost 1 million a month. \nPresident Obama and all of us knew there was a frozen banking system. \nWe had to make sure that credit system was working. We had to make sure \nwe created some jobs. We passed the stimulus bill. Despite all the talk \nabout how it didn't work, experts say it stopped a depression. So, yes, \nwe had to add those things as well.\n  Now it is time to pull together as Americans. This isn't about \nRepublicans or Democrats. The people of this country agree that \nmillionaires and billionaires should pay more. Right now, what Senator \nReid has said is let's set that aside, get on with our work and get out \nof this mess and, for 18 months, give a sense of certainty to the \nmarketplace and let's address the issues.\n  John Boehner, who spoke to the Nation last night, is presenting a \npatchwork quilt that expires in a few months, and we will be back to \nthis nightmare. We face downgrades of our creditworthiness. Let's get \nbehind the Reid proposal and work together and get this country back on \nits feet. Uncertainty is the worst option.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is a historic week in the Senate. \nShe has spelled out what we face. I guess most people around America \nare looking at Washington and Capitol Hill and asking if there are any \ngrownups left; can't adults sit down there in both political parties \nand solve our Nation's problems? It is a legitimate question because we \nare up against the deadline of August 2, the expiration of America's \nmortgage, the debt ceiling. It means that for the first time in \nhistory, if we don't act, we will default on our debt.\n  That is significant because the United States enjoys a reputation \naround the world--the highest economic reputation around the world, a \nAAA bond rating, which is as good as it gets. If a person asks for \ncredit and they have that rating, they are in great shape; they can \nborrow what they need at a good interest rate. That is what we have \ntoday. If we fail to do what we are supposed to do between now and \nAugust 2 and default on our debt, it will be the first time it has \noccurred, it will mean the promise of America to pay its bills has been \nbroken, and it will mean our creditors around the world will have \nquestions about whether we can be trusted. When creditors have \nquestions, they cover the risk by raising interest rates. So if the \ninterest rate on America goes up 1 percent--just 1 percent--it costs us \n$130 billion a year, added to our debt; projected over 10 years: $1.3 \ntrillion for every 1 point interest. So tempting fate and going to \nAugust 2 in that circumstance is not good, not just because America's \ndebt grows but because interest rates around America will then rise \nwith it. So if one is borrowing money for a car, a home or on a credit \ncard, their interest rates will go up. Congress, without passing a tax \nbill, has just imposed a new tax on us. It will be the tax for \ndefaulting on our debt ceiling.\n  What we are trying to do this week is to work out some sort of an \nagreement between Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, and the \nPresident to avoid this crisis. As the Senator from California \naccurately said, this is not a crisis similar to a natural disaster or \neven a terrorist attack; this is a manufactured political crisis on \nCapitol Hill. We don't have to have this. It has never happened before. \nWhat we are doing with this kind of a ``High Noon'' scenario, waiting \nuntil the last minute to solve our problem, is creating a problem that \nwill cost us dearly. There are ways around it.\n  Majority leader Harry Reid is going to come forward on the Senate \nfloor on behalf of the Democrats, and we hope with Republican support, \nwith a plan to deal with this deficit and this debt ceiling. What the \nmajority leader will propose is that we will make cuts in spending, \nwhich will reduce our deficit $1.2 trillion in cuts over 10 years. I \nthink it is a significant indication that we are serious about our \ndebt.\n  In addition to that, what we will have is an increase of our debt \nlimit until February of 2013. It is only in Washington, as one of my \ncolleagues said this morning, that 18 months is considered a long-term \ncommitment. What we know is that if we don't make a long-term extension \nof the debt ceiling, we are going to have to go through this scenario--\npolitical scenario--again and again. Each time we do, it calls into \nquestion the credit status of the United States. So what we are going \nto try to do this week with bipartisan support is move forward in \ndealing with this crisis in a responsible way--reducing spending, \nextending the debt ceiling; and I can say that everything included in \nSenator Reid's proposal, which he brought to the floor, has been either \nproposed by or voted in favor of by Republicans. It is a bipartisan \napproach. I think it is an honest approach. I am hoping we can reach an \nagreement on it.\n\n  I see my colleague from Maryland. I ask him if he is asking for time \nin morning business and how much time.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time remains in morning \nbusiness on the Democratic side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 13 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be brief and then yield to my friend from \nMaryland.\n  I believe we can deal with our debt responsibly. I say that having \nbeen\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\nthrough a year and a half working on this issue. I am still not an \nexpert, but I know a lot more about it than I did from the start. \nDemocrats and Republicans worked together on the President's deficit \ncommission and came up with a plan supported by 11 out of the 18 \nmembers, including myself, and a number of Republican Senators and \nDemocratic Senators, including Kent Conrad, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. We all supported it. We believe there is a way to reduce the \ndebt by $4 trillion over 10 years and in a sensible, balanced way, \nbringing into consideration not only spending cuts but also reform of \nour entitlement programs and revenue.\n  On the entitlement programs, many Senators and many people get \nnervous when we talk about Social Security and Medicare. I will say I \nam committed to these programs. I believe in them. The reason I stayed \nwith this conversation is because I wish to make certain that at least \none, maybe more, at the table feel as I do about the importance of \nSocial Security and Medicare. I believe we can make reasonable changes \nin each of those programs, preserve the basic benefit structure, \nparticularly for working Americans, and make sure they have the promise \nof the security which these programs bring.\n  I know people in retirement wonder if the savings are going to last, \nwhether their pension will be around. But they know for sure that \nSocial Security will be there. I wish to make sure that promise is \nkept, not just for 25 years but for 50 years and beyond. We can do it, \nand making modest changes now can achieve it.\n  On Medicare, health insurance for the elderly and disabled people, \nMedicare is a bigger challenge. In 6 years or so, we start running out \nof money. Let's do things now that will avoid that crisis. We don't \nwant that. We want to make sure people have the peace of mind of \nknowing they have health insurance. We can do it in a sensible, \nresponsible way. Let's do it together, not with a determination of \nending the program. I will never let that happen on my watch. We need \nto make sure the program has a long solvent life.\n  When it comes to revenue, there is a way to do this.\n  Madam President, $1.2 trillion is lost each year in our Tax Code to \ndeductions and credits and exclusions and special treatment given to \nsome and not to others. We can take a look at that and do it in a way \nthat says we are going to preserve the basics that we need. Yes, we \nneed the mortgage interest deduction. Yes, we need the charitable \ndeduction.\n  We need to make sure people have health insurance exclusions from \ntheir income. We can still do that and lower the amount of tax \nexpenditures and use that money to reduce the deficit. That is a \nreasonable way of raising revenue in a sensible manner.\n  Men and women of good faith in both political parties can do this. \nLet's pass Senator Reid's proposal and avert this crisis and tackle the \nlong-term deficit and debt challenge in a balanced way, by putting \neverything on the table. We did it with the deficit commission. We did \nit with the Gang of 6. We can do it again with the support of the \nAmerican people to encourage us beyond our critics--that will always \nhappen--to the kind of conclusion where people will once again feel \npride in what goes on in Washington.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me first thank our assistant \nDemocratic majority leader for his incredible work on the Bowles-\nSimpson Commission. Senator Durbin was a real voice of reason and \nbrought together diverse views. We need that this week. And then with \nthe Gang of 6, with our colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the \naisle, he was able to bring us together in achieving two goals--and \nthat is what we need to do--one is we need to raise the debt limit and, \nsecondly, we need a credible plan to deal with the deficit. I think \nSenator Durbin has added greatly to accomplishing those goals, reaching \nacross party lines, and understanding that it cannot be what the \nDemocrats want or what the Republicans want but we have to work \ntogether.\n  But I must say that at this moment, we are 7 days away from the \nAugust 2 date. So we have two goals. Goal No. 1 is to raise the debt \nlimit so that we don't default on America's obligations. Raising the \ndebt limit needs to be our goal No. 1. We have already incurred this \ndebt. This is not about increasing America's spending; this is for \nspending that has already occurred, and now we have to pay the bills.\n  The cost of default is unimaginable to the American people. We will \npay more as taxpayers because the cost of government borrowing will go \nup. We know that. That is not speculation; we know that. But the cost \nto every American will go up because the cost of home mortgages will go \nup, the cost of credit card interest will go up, and student loan costs \nwill go up. All of the borrowing costs in America will go up. It will \nalso hurt our economy. It will cost us jobs.\n  It makes no sense whatsoever to be here without raising the debt \nlimit. Senator Reid's proposal does that through 2012. It gets the job \ndone. Speaker Boehner's proposal does not get it done--another short-\nterm extension.\n  We should listen to the experts in the market. Christian Cooper, who \nis a currency expert and trader, said:\n\n       From the markets' point of view, a two-stage plan is a \n     nonstarter . . . There is significant risk of a downgrade \n     with a deal that ties further cuts to another vote only a few \n     months down the road given the significant resistance to do \n     the right thing now.\n\n  Speaker Boehner's proposal just kicks the can down the road for a \ncouple more months without resolving the problem. And that is Goal No. \n1. The Reid plan accomplishes that.\n  Goal No. 2 is having a credible plan to get our debt under control. \nThe President was right as he explained last night how we got here. He \nwent through how, under the Bush administration, the previous \nadministration, we took a surplus to a deficit by cutting taxes not \nonce but twice, by two wars that were not paid for, by spending \nprograms that weren't paid for, and now we are in a situation where we \nhave a nonsustainable deficit. That is accurate.\n  It is our responsibility to make sure we have a credible plan to deal \nwith the deficit. Leader Reid's proposal gives us that glidepath. I \nthink all of us would like to see a grand deal, a grand bargain. That \nis not going to be achieved by August 2. Senator Reid's proposal gives \nus the glidepath for a responsible, credible plan to bring our debt \nunder control. Speaker Boehner's proposal does not do that. It just \nbasically says we will deal with it at a later time.\n  Look at the downpayment. Leader Reid gives us $2.7 trillion of \ndeficit reduction now that we can enact by August 2, while Speaker \nBoehner gives us $1.2 trillion. It is clear that $2.7 trillion really \ngets us much closer to the $4 trillion goal we all know we need to \nachieve, but it also gives us a game plan to be able to achieve the $4 \ntrillion in deficit reductions we all know we need to do.\n  Madam President, you and I are in agreement on how we can get that \ndone now. We know that. We have a plan. The problem is that we can't \nget that done by August 2 because we can't get the Republicans in the \nHouse to move on a balanced plan. We understand that.\n  Well, the Reid proposal preserves all options but gives us a way to \nget to the $4 trillion of deficit reduction that is clearly needed. It \nallows the use of a joint committee that will use a balanced approach. \nWe have models they can look at. The Bowles-Simpson Commission is a \nbalanced approach to bring in a credible plan to deal with the deficit. \nThe Gang of 6 gives us a balanced approach in order to deal with our \ndeficits. So we have the model before us in order to get it done.\n  Let me tell you why I think Leader Reid's proposal is the best way \nfor us to proceed 7 days before the August 2 deadline. It gives the \nRepublicans basically what they have asked for. We can't do this by \nDemocrats alone. We need Democrats and Republicans working together. \nThe Reid proposal represents the views of the Members of the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle. Why do I say that? From the beginning, the \nRepublicans have been saying we have to have a dollar-for-dollar \nreduction in debt for a $1 increase in the debt ceiling. There is no \nrelationship between our current spending and what the debt ceiling \nrepresents because, as I said earlier, it represents what we have \nalready spent. But, OK, that has been what the Republicans said we had \nto\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\ndo. Leader Reid's proposal does that--a $2.7 trillion reduction in the \ndeficit with a $2.7 trillion increase in the debt ceiling.\n  The second thing the Republicans have asked for--not all but many--is \nthat we can't consider revenues in the package. Now, I disagree with \nthat. I don't believe you can have a credible plan to deal with the \ndeficit unless you include revenues, getting rid of the loopholes, \ngetting rid of shelters. We could do that without increasing rates. We \nhave said that many times. But the Reid proposal--what we would vote on \nby August 2 that accomplishes our goals--will do it without additional \nrevenues. It preserves the right of revenues in order to have a \ncredible plan to reach the $4 trillion target, but we get our $2.7 \ntrillion without any revenues--something the majority of Republicans \nhave been asking for.\n  The third point: The $2.7 trillion in cuts the majority leader put on \nthe table represents cuts that have been negotiated between the \nDemocrats and Republicans. Madam President, $1.2 trillion was included \nwith Vice President Biden, the $1 trillion in cuts in regard to our \noverseas operations was included in the Ryan budget, and the list goes \non. So these are cuts that are achievable, that have already been \nnegotiated or agreed to between Democrats and Republicans.\n  I applaud Senator Reid. I think Senator Reid understands the \nseriousness of us moving forward. It allows us to move to increase the \ndebt ceiling and preserve our rights to negotiate and get the grand \nbargain done and has a fallback mechanism with a joint committee that \nwould have required votes on the floor to make sure we all have a \nchance to vote up or down. It preserves our options, allows America to \nmove forward, and allows us to concentrate on job growth and security, \nwhich should be our focus as we rebound our economy for the future of \nour Nation. For all those reasons, I hope my colleagues will support \nthe effort of Senator Reid to bring us together to avoid the \nunspeakable default that could occur 1 week from today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Last night, the President explained to the Nation the \ncrisis we face right now as he sees it. His hope was to lift the debate \nout of the gritty legislative particulars, and we all understand that. \nUnfortunately, the situation the President described last night bears \nvery little resemblance to the realities on the ground right here in \nWashington.\n  I know the President would rather give speeches about our problems \nthan resolve them, but he wasn't elected to talk about the United \nStates; he was elected to lead it. In our system of government, that \nmeans working with people and a Congress with which you sometimes \ndisagree. This is not a unique situation. Other Presidents have been in \na similar situation where they had to work with a Congress composed of \npeople, many of whom disagreed with them.\n  Last night, the President rejected not just the only proposal that \nhas passed either House of Congress, he rejected the only plan the \nDemocrats have proposed as well, a plan that would increase the debt \nlimit without raising taxes. Just a few days ahead of a potential \ndefault, the President announced that he is the only person in \nWashington still calling for a massive tax hike, even as his party has \ndropped their own demands for what we know will make the current \nunemployment situation even worse.\n  In short, the President is now clinging to two things we all know \nCongress can't support: a massive tax hike and the biggest debt limit \nincrease in history aimed, in his own words, at getting himself past \nthe next election. As Speaker Boehner said last night, that is just not \ngoing to happen. There is bipartisan opposition to it in Congress. So \nit was deeply irresponsible, in my view, for the President of the \nUnited States to present the American people with a false choice last \nnight between tax hikes on the one hand and default on the other.\n  The real choice is this: a bill that can get us past this moment of \ncrisis, that cuts Washington spending, and that actually gets through \nCongress, or one that can't. Republicans have offered the only proposal \nthat attempts to get at the root of the problem and that actually has a \nchance of getting to the President's desk. That is why we will continue \nto press for the legislation Speaker Boehner has proposed, and that is \nwhy we will fight against anything that pretends to solve the problem \nbut doesn't. The majority leader proposed a plan yesterday that is \nnothing more than another attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the \nAmerican people.\n  The decisions we make in the next 72 hours will have a real impact on \nevery American. These decisions should be made based on how they will \naffect the people who are struggling to get a job, not how they affect \nsome politician's chances of getting reelected.\n  The President can claim to be concerned about this impending crisis, \nbut one question continues to linger above every press conference he \nhas called or every speech he has delivered: Where is his plan to \nresolve it? Republicans have proposed multiple plans that have support \nin both parties. It is time for the President to put his electoral \ninterest and preferences aside and do what is needed. Americans are \nwaiting. Americans are waiting for the President to do what they \nelected him to do--not to lecture but to lead.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, throughout the course of this debt \nceiling debate, the American people have watched in utter disbelief of \nwhat they have seen. They understand we need to get our fiscal house in \norder; they see what has gotten us into this mess; and they want it \nstopped before they agree to give us blanket authority to raise the \ndebt limit. What they are saying is we must spend within our means just \nas they have to do.\n  We have a way to do that. It is the cut, cap, and balance plan. It \nhas already passed the House. The companion bill, with 39 cosponsors, \nhas the support so it should be considered in this Chamber as well. I \nam proud to say I am one of those 39 cosponsors of the Senate bill. I \nsigned onto the cut, cap, and balance bill because the American \npeople--and more specifically the people of Arkansas--have demanded \nthat we address this crisis now, not later. They know Washington is not \ngood with remembering to follow through on the things they promise to \ndo later.\n  Some will say this is too simple an answer. They say the fiscal mess \nin which we find ourselves is a complex problem. It is not though. Just \nlook at the numbers.\n  This year alone we will spend $3.7 trillion while collecting only \n$2.2 trillion. We borrow 40 cents of every dollar we spend.\n  President Obama and the Democratic majority in this Chamber will say \nthe way to fix this problem is to raise taxes. They may try to use \nother words and phrases such as revenue enhancers while talking about \nraising taxes, but make no doubt about it, they want to put the onus \nback on the American people.\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\n  There is a major problem with this approach. Washington does not have \na revenue problem; it has a spending problem. Again, the numbers back \nthis up. Traditionally, government spending is about 19 percent of our \ngross domestic product. Since President Obama has been in office, \ngovernment spending has been much closer to 25 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. This administration has raised Federal spending to \nthe highest peak since World War II.\n  How do we solve this spending problem? We do it through cut, cap, and \nbalance. Cut now--the House bill immediately cuts over $100 billion in \nspending; cap for the future--the spending cap mechanism in this bill \ncaps spending over the next 10 years, bringing it down to less than 20 \npercent of our gross domestic product within the next 5 years--and the \nbalance is for a balanced budget amendment, something our entire \nRepublican caucus supports in the Senate, as do many in the Democratic \nmajority, at least according to their on-the-record statements.\n  This bill prohibits the Treasury from borrowing unless a balanced \nbudget amendment is sent to the States for ratification. Let's pass a \nbalanced budget amendment and give the people back home the decision \nabout whether they want to require us to operate under a balanced \nbudget amendment. I think you will find they overwhelmingly do. \nUnfortunately, the Senate majority, with no plan of their own for \nreining in the out-of-control spending, will not allow us to have a \ndebate on this bill.\n  Last Friday they moved to table the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act, \neffectively ending any consideration of the bill. All this reminds me \nof the debate over the House-passed budget we had a few months ago. The \nmajority over here had strong words of criticism but no budget proposal \nof their own. Again, strong words of criticism and no plan of their \nown. Only this time it is worse.\n  With our Nation on the brink of default, the majority clearly \nbelieves it is better to score political points than have a debate on \nthe merits of our proposal. They control the floor, the agenda, and the \namendments that are accepted. If any member of their caucus wants to \nchange the bill, they certainly have that option. But instead of having \nthe debate, we get political theater from the majority.\n  This is not what our constituents deserve. They deserve a real \ndebate. They sent us here to work together to prevent a catastrophe on \npar with what has happened in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. They want \nto see us get our fiscal house in order. That is what the root cause of \nthis crisis is all about. We are not just having a debate on raising \nthe debt ceiling. If that were all this discussion was about, it would \nhave been over months ago. Nobody wants a default.\n  The debate that is going on today is about a much bigger problem: the \nout-of-control spending that has put us in this position time and time \nagain. Cut, cap, and balance is one way to solve the problem. It is a \nsolution that helps us avert an immediate meltdown and brings a sense \nof fiscal responsibility to Washington where it is so badly needed.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nMilitary Pay Act of 2011. We were on the brink of closing down \ngovernment earlier this year, this spring, and we came to a responsible \nconclusion and continued our government. We were also able to continue \nthe tax cuts that have helped spur our economy as best they could in \nlight of the spending and the debt that has been accumulated. Now we \nare looking at yet another potential government shutdown. It is so \nimportant that we make priorities.\n  We know what is happening right now in Washington. Everyone is \nfocused on whether there is going to be an agreement to lift the debt \nceiling because if there is not, then we have the potential for \ndefault, depending on the decision of what gets paid first. We do have \nrevenue coming in that can be spent even if the debt ceiling is not \nlifted. However, the President can choose the priorities. What I am \nasking we do today is set some of those priorities. What I am asking is \nwe take our military personnel out of any limbo. Let's go back to what \nwe did earlier this year when we were in the continuing resolution \ndebate which also had the potential for shutting down government. When \nthat happened in April, I joined with my colleague on the House side, \nRepresentative Louie Gohmert. We both introduced a bill, the Ensuring \nPay for Our Military Act, Senate bill 724. We have 80 cosponsors of \nthat legislation. We have 80 out of 100 in the Senate who stepped up to \nthe plate and said: Yes, we need to take care of our military even if \ngovernment shuts down. That was April. Since then, I have introduced a \nnew bill. The new bill is Senate bill 1365, the Protecting Military Pay \nAct of 2011. That one sets two priorities. It sets paying our debt, the \ninterest on our debt and our military. Those are the two priorities. \nSocial Security is in a different account, and it will automatically be \npaid from that account. I actually am cosponsoring another bill that is \nalso cosponsored by many Senators and many House Members that would \nrequire the President pay our debt, interest on our debt, our active-\nduty military and also Social Security recipients even though that \nwould automatically happen. The legislation I introduced in April that \nwould take care of our active-duty military is supported by the \nMilitary Officers Association of America; the AMVETS, the American \nVeterans; and the National Military Family Association. The new bill I \nhave introduced that has the debt to be paid off along with our \nmilitary sets the priorities, and here is what it does: It says if we \nhave any kind of government shutdown or we have a situation where we do \nnot lift the debt ceiling and, therefore, we have to prioritize our \nspending according to the revenue that is coming in, there are two \nthings that will be done: We want to pass the law so there can be no \ndiscretion that you will pay the debts and you will pay the military. \nYou will pay the active-duty military. That is what the bill does \nsimply and clearly.\n\n  Here is the situation: If the debt ceiling is reached, $29 billion \nwould be set aside for August to the payment of our debts, $2.9 billion \nwould be added to that for active-duty military pay. So you are \nallocating out of the billions that would be coming in in August, you \nwould allocate those as the first two priorities and Social Security \nwould be paid out of the Social Security fund. I am going to ask our \nmajority leader to let these bills come up--at least one of them that \nsays we will pay the debt, we will pay our military, and we know that \nSocial Security will be paid.\n  It is tremendously damaging for our military to be getting the news \nin Afghanistan and Iraq of all the upheaval in Washington because they \nare getting the news, of course. For them to worry: Oh, my gosh, what \nhappens August 2 if my paycheck isn't there for my wife or my husband \nto be able to use that to pay the mortgage or the basic expenses? I \nwant to put it in perspective. We have people in the military with \nboots on the ground by the thousands who are making under $20,000 a \nyear. Those are people who are living paycheck to paycheck. They don't \nhave the luxury of having a big savings account with that kind of \nincome, especially if they have children. My goodness, they are making \nunder $18,000 a year, some of these younger junior members of the \nenlisted corps, so I don't think we ought to make them worry for 10 \nseconds if they can pay their basic bills for their housing and the \nfood for their families.\n  In my State of Texas there are 28,000 brave men and women deployed in \nthe support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are more than \n97,000 servicemembers deployed who are married and have children \nwaiting for them at home. There are 145,000 troops deployed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who are working long hours every day in the desert heat to \nprotect our freedom, to make sure we are doing everything we can to \nroot out the terrorists who\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\nhave attacked America. These men and women all raised their right hand \nand volunteered to go to defend this Nation. The very least we can do \nwhile we are in this kind of budget negotiation, which is making a lot \nof people nervous--I have faith that we are going to do the right thing \nin the end, but it is not clear yet and we are a week away. I don't \nthink we ought to make these people think about whether it is going to \nhappen and if there is going to be a delay in a paycheck.\n  I hope we will be able to bring this bill up. I can guarantee if the \nmajority leader will bring up my bill, it will pass. It has 80 \ncosponsors. The new bill is the same thing except it makes the debt \npayment the priority, which you would hope would not have to be done, \nbut nevertheless let's assure that our debtors know we are going to pay \nthe interest on the debt, and our military--who are in harm's way right \nnow--will not worry about their family having the paycheck they need.\n  We have about a week. All of us had hoped it wouldn't take this long, \nbut we have our different views, there is no question about it. I am \none who believes we should raise the debt ceiling only with reforms \nthat will assure the markets not just for the next week or the next 6 \nmonths, but for the long term, that not only are we going to pay our \ndebts but we are going to bring down the cost of government so we will \nnot have to raise the debt limit again.\n  We must take the reform actions we can take right now. We can fix \nSocial Security for 75 years with relatively little cuts in increases \nwith Social Security COLAs and with a trajectory that will put us on an \nactuarial table for an age that has certainly changed since Social \nSecurity passed. Very little change. It wouldn't affect anyone who is \nin the upper area of going into Social Security. The bill I have \nintroduced wouldn't affect anyone age 58 and above or 55 and above. We \ncan do the big things that will show our debtors and the rest of the \nworld we can live within our means and our democracy can work to do the \nthings that will make us good not for the next week, not for the next 6 \nmonths, but for our children and grandchildren. That is what we ought \nto be doing right now, and I have faith. We are going to have to do \nsomething temporary for the next few months while we work out the \ndetails, but I know if we get together, we can do this. I don't want \nour military to have to worry about it for 1 week or 3 months or 6 \nmonths because they deserve better.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE.

I am happy to cosponsor the legislation of the Senator \nfrom Texas. She is absolutely right, there is no more deserving group \nof people in this country than our military and we need to make sure \nunder no circumstance they are not paid, and her legislation would do \nthat. I hope we can get it to the floor and that it is acted upon very \nquickly.\n  We are a week away now from the time in which we would have to \nrequest additional borrowing authority in order for our Federal \nGovernment to pay its bills. We have known it is coming for some time. \nWe know generally at least when that date is. It strikes me as most \nAmericans observe this debate, the thing they are probably most \nconcerned about is how this is going to impact them and their economic \ncircumstances. Frankly, I think all of us ought to be looking at this \nwith an eye toward how is this going to impact the economy. What is \nthis going to do to get people back to work and to grow the economy? \nThere has been a lot of discussion about that. The President made yet \nanother speech last night in which he tried to claim the high ground in \nthis debate. Frankly, I think the President has relegated himself to \nthe sidelines in this debate simply because many of the things he was \nproposing to do as a part of this debt limit increase would be very \ncounterproductive when it comes to the economy. I would also add that \nthe President continues to sort of assign blame and blame the previous \nadministration for the circumstances in which we find ourselves and, \nclearly, he inherited a difficult set of economic circumstances. I \nthink we would all concede that.\n  What I would argue is the President has made that situation worse. He \nhas made it much worse. If you look at since this President took \noffice, we now have 2.1 million more people unemployed than there were \nwhen he took office. We have seen the Federal debt grow by 35 percent \nsince this President took office. The number of people receiving food \nstamps today has gone up by 40 percent since this President took \noffice. He has added $11,000 to the debt of each individual in this \ncountry since he took office. Gas prices are up. They increased almost \n100 percent since this President took office. The cost of health care \nhas gone up 19 percent since this President took office despite \nassertions during the debate on the health care bill last year that it \nwas actually going to reduce health care costs. We have seen all of \nthese economic circumstances worsen on this President's watch.\n  It strikes me as we look at this debt debate that we ought to be \nthinking about what can we do to get out of this economic downturn. We \nare growing at a very sluggish rate, a little under 2 percent. We have \nunemployment that is over 9 percent, 9.2 percent. As I said, there are \n2.1 million more people unemployed than when the President took office. \nClearly the focus of our discussions as we lead up to this vote on the \ndebt limit ought to be about the economy, getting people back to work, \ngrowing the economy.\n  Frankly, I think there are a couple of things we have to do to get \nout of the debt situation. One is we have to cut government spending. \nSecondly, we have to get the economy growing and expanding again. So, \nclearly, that ought to be the focus.\n\n  When I said the President, in his proposal--at least as it has been \nreported because we haven't seen any proposal from him, but in the \nreporting about his discussions with congressional leadership, it has \nbeen suggested that the President has consistently advocated for more \nrevenues, more taxes, and, in fact, as recently as last Friday, when \nthere was still ``a big deal'' on the table--we were still looking at a \npossibility of actually striking an agreement--the President upped the \nante even further. He moved the goalpost yet again. He wanted $400 \nbillion more in higher taxes.\n  It strikes me, and I think most Americans right now, that the worst \nthing we can do in an economic downturn and when we have 9.2 percent \nunemployment is raise taxes. There isn't a tax I can think of that will \ncreate a single job in this country. It would only make it more \ndifficult and more expensive for our small businesses to create jobs. \nSo that was a nonstarter. I think it became clear over time that it was \ngoing to be a nonstarter despite the President's insistence that tax \nincreases be a part of whatever deal gets struck here.\n  As we find ourselves where we are now, I think it is important to \nthink about where we have come from and to look at the time that has \nnow passed and where we stand today. I think it is important to point \nout, as we talk about budgets and we talk about spending and we talk \nabout debt, our job is to pass a budget. That is where it all starts. \nWe haven't passed a budget now in 818 days. In fact, the last time the \nSenate approved a budget was back on April 29, 2009. So it has now been \n818 days since the most recent budget was approved by the Senate.\n  So we are operating without a budget. Imagine how complicated it \nwould be for any State government, any business in this country, if \nthey continued to operate without a budget. That is what we have been \ndoing in Washington now for 818 days.\n  So January 6 of this year came around and we knew this debt limit \nvote was coming and was out there. Secretary Geithner wrote to Congress \nasking that the debt limit be increased. That was back in January. At \nthat time, the Obama administration was also pushing for a clean debt \nlimit increase; in other words, a debt limit increase that did not \ninclude any kind of spending reductions or spending reform. He just \nwanted a $2.4 trillion blank check to raise the debt by that amount.\n  Well, we came to February of this year--of 2011--when it came time \nfor\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\nthe President to submit his budget to Congress. That budget seemed to \nbe in complete denial of the reality we find ourselves in today because \nthat budget would spend $46 trillion and add almost $10 trillion to the \npublicly held debt over the next decade, as well as increase taxes by \nsomewhere on the order of $1.5 trillion, $1.6 trillion. So it had more \nspending, more debt, and higher taxes at a time when we are in an \neconomic downturn, when we have high unemployment, and we have year \nover year deficits that are adding massively to the debt in this \ncountry. So the President's budget was met with a thud, as one would \nexpect, when it was presented to the Congress.\n  As we went on in the year, in March of this year--March 31 to be \nexact--the Senate Republicans introduced a balanced budget amendment. \nWe recognized that in order for us to get our fiscal house in order, to \nstart living within our means, to quit spending money we don't have, we \nhave to have some kind of a discipline imposed on the Congress, a \nrequirement that we balance our budget every year, as do so many \nStates. There are 49 States in this country that have some form of a \nbalanced budget amendment in their constitution, some sort of \nrequirement that forces them to make their books balance at the end of \nthe year. So we introduced a balanced budget amendment, and we still \nhope at some point to get a vote on that. That hasn't happened yet, but \nthat is certainly something we want to enter into this debate because \nwe think it is important not only to deal with the spending in the near \nterm, but also to come up with a solution in the long term, and a \nbalanced budget amendment would certainly accomplish that.\n  On April 11 of this year, Chairman Paul Ryan of the House Budget \nCommittee introduced his budget in the House of Representatives. Of \ncourse, on April 13, right after the submission of that budget, the \nPresident then gave a ``revised budget'' speech. It was interesting \nbecause Congressional Budget Office Director Elmendorf later stated \nthat the CBO--the Congressional Budget Office--doesn't score speeches, \nso they really couldn't attach any sort of numbers to the President's \nspeech because they don't score speeches. We have yet to see any kind \nof an actual submission of a plan from the President prior to his \nprovisional budget submission, which, as I said, came in with higher \ntaxes, higher spending, and higher debt.\n  On April 15, in accordance with the schedule required under the \nBudget Act, the House passed their budget. So the Republicans on the \nSenate Budget Committee asked the President to submit a revised budget \nbased upon his speech. That revised budget was never submitted. We had \na House-passed budget. We had the President's sort of on the sidelines, \nout of the debate, and then in May of this year Republicans on the \nSenate Budget Committee--and I am on that Senate Budget Committee--were \ntold to expect a budget markup which never materialized. So we still \ndidn't have a budget in the Senate. The budget passed by the House of \nRepresentatives was roundly criticized by the Senate and by Democrats \nin Washington. But it is the only budget proposal--actual proposal--\nthat has been voted on and that we have literally seen in over 818 days \nnow.\n  We knew this vote on the debt limit was starting to get closer, so \ndiscussions picked up in terms of having some meetings to determine how \nwe might proceed and what we might do to put a package in place that \nwould allow us to raise the debt limit, but do it with significant \nspending reforms and spending reductions. Vice President Biden held his \nvery first meeting on May 5 of this year--2011--and those discussions \ncontinued on for some time.\n  We also had on the floor of the Senate on May 25 of this year the \nPresident's budget he submitted to Congress back in February. So we \nactually had a vote on that. That vote was 97 to 0 in opposition to the \nPresident's budget. There wasn't a single Republican or a single \nDemocrat in the Senate who said the President's original budget \nsubmission was something they wanted to be associated with or wanted to \nsupport. So not a single vote in the Senate for the President's \noriginal budget submission.\n  So we continued on into June, and I think there was hope there would \nbe some agreement between the President and congressional leadership on \nhow to proceed with this debt limit vote that comes up ahead of us now \nsometime next week. Those discussions continued, as I said, as recently \nas last week and finally started to unravel and fell apart, at which \npoint it became clear we were going to need a solution and an answer.\n  So, again, the House Republicans put together and passed a proposal \ncalled cut, cap, and balance which would have cut spending now, \nimmediately, capped spending in future years, and put in place a \nbalanced budget amendment which would ensure that in later years we \nwould have the kind of discipline that is so important and so lacking \nin Washington. That was on July 19, 2011, when the House passed that \nlegislation.\n  So it came over to the Senate. We had a vote on it in the Senate on \nJuly 22, last week, and the Senate Democrats voted to table the cut, \ncap, and balance approach and denounced it as not a serious effort to \ndo anything about the fiscal circumstance in which we find ourselves.\n  We didn't get a chance to debate it and get to an up-or-down vote. We \nhad a tabling motion and a vote on a tabling motion by the Democratic \nleader and as a consequence it was defeated. So we don't have anything \nyet in place that would deal with the debt limit coming up ahead of us \nnext week.\n  So that is where we are today. As I said, the House Republicans have \nagain taken the leadership and put forward yet another proposal, and I \nexpect they are going to vote on it sometime later this week, perhaps \nas early as tomorrow. We evidently now have before us something the \nSenate leadership, Senator Reid, has put forward we may end up having a \nvote on this week. But somehow, some way, we have to get to where we \nsolve this before next Tuesday.\n  I am not among those who believe it is an option for us to get past \nnext Tuesday and then try and figure out what happens next. I believe \nwe need to act. We need to act in a way that is responsible, but we \nneed to act in a way that addresses the real issue, which is not the \ndebt limit but the debt.\n  I wish to point out when the President originally requested--and I \nthink he reiterated that request in April--a clean debt limit, there \nwas an assumption that Congress would just give him a $2.4 trillion \nincrease in the debt limit without any kind of attempt to rein in the \nreal problem, which is the debt.\n  So we have been consistently advocating to try to get spending \nreductions, spending reforms into this equation. The President has \nconsistently advocated in favor of tax increases. To him, this is \ndefined as a revenue problem, not a spending problem. Most of us see \nthis as a spending problem. When we have spending as a percentage of \nthe entire economy that is literally at the highest level since World \nWar II, we have, fundamentally, a spending problem. It cannot be \nresolved by raising taxes on small businesses; it needs to be resolved \nby cutting spending.\n  When we cut spending, I believe we will also put in place the \nconfidence the economy needs to start picking up and growing again, and \nwe will get the other component, the other element that is so important \nto getting out of this mess; that is, an expanding, growing, vital \neconomy that is creating jobs and creating greater prosperity for the \nAmerican people.\n  So this is where we are. We are in the last week. I think the \nPresident is essentially missing in action. His proposal to raise taxes \nwhich he talked about again last night in his speech is old news. It is \nyesterday's news. We know that is not going to pass in the House of \nRepresentatives, and it probably wouldn't pass in the Senate. Right \nnow, the simple math is we have to be able to pass something by next \nTuesday. We have to put something forward that can secure 217 votes in \nthe House of Representatives and 60 votes in the Senate.\n  Some of us maybe aren't going to like certain elements of what is \ngoing to be put forward. But what I can tell my colleagues is, we have \ncome a long way in terms of steering this debate away from the \nPresident's original budget proposal which, as I said, doubled the debt \nover 10 years, massively increased spending, massively increased taxes, \nand from the point where the President was asking for a\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\ndebt limit increase devoid of any spending cuts or spending reforms--\nsimply a $2.4 trillion blank check that would allow him to raise the \ndebt limit--to a time where we are actually talking about significant \nreductions in spending both in the near term and in the long term. \nWhether the proposal that passes the House this week ends up being what \nwe ultimately vote on in the Senate, it is the only viable option out \nthere.\n  The President doesn't have a plan. He never has had a plan. The \nSenate Democrats don't have a plan. They haven't had a budget in 818 \ndays and have yet to put forward anything until, as I said, this most \nrecent idea Senator Reid came up with. But we are up against the clock. \nWe need to get this done. The American people expect us to get it done. \nThe market expects us to get it done. Not doing so would put at great \nrisk our credit rating and our ability as a great nation to function \nand to attract the type of credit we need to keep our government going, \nunfortunately.\n  I hope in the end what comes out of this is some reforms that will \nput us on a path where we are starting to take that debt down, where we \nare not literally borrowing over 40 cents out of every dollar this \ngovernment spends. That is where we need to end up.\n  But for now at least we have to get a measure in place by next week \nthat doesn't raise taxes in a way that would hurt the economy; that \ngets discretionary, nondefense spending, and, for that matter, defense \nspending under control in the near term and puts in place a process by \nwhich we can get a result on reforming entitlement programs and dealing \nwith what we call the mandatory part of our budget.\n  So that is where we came from. It has been an interesting path to get \nhere, but there is a lot of revisionist history that gets put forward, \nand I wish to remind my colleagues where we came from because I think \nit is important and informs the decisions we will make today.\n  For the President to suggest for a minute that somehow the House \nRepublicans are to blame for where we are today is not consistent--in \nfact, it is completely contradictory--with the facts. It is the House \nRepublicans who passed a budget on time back in April. It is the House \nRepublicans who passed a plan last week, a cut, cap, and balance plan \nto deal with this debt limit. It is the House Republicans who tomorrow \nwho will vote on yet another proposal put forward after the President \nupped the ante last week and made it clear that the only way he would \naccept a deal would be with significant tax increases on the American \npeople and the American economy at a time when we can ill-afford it.\n  So I hope as we proceed into this week--and the days are numbered--we \nwill get a piece of legislation on the floor of the Senate that can \nsecure the 60 votes necessary for us to avoid having to meet that \ntrigger next week and to do something that would address the long-term \nissue of spending and debt, get spending under control, and actually, \nin my view, put the conditions in place that would enable economic \ngrowth and job creation in this country; so we can cut spending and \ngrow the economy, which, in my view, are the two elements we need to \nput the country back on a better path.\n  So with that, I ask my colleagues to work with us this week against \nthis deadline to get in place a solution to this problem that deals \nwith the fundamental issue; that is, the issue of Washington's \noverspending, and start to rein that in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I want to start out today by \ncomplimenting the Senator from South Dakota. He has gotten it \nabsolutely exactly right. I wish to associate myself with the comments \nhe has made.\n  We are 7 days away from literally a crisis in our country. We are \ndown to a point where it is getting even difficult to try to figure \nout, with the timelines naturally built into the process, how you get \nfrom here to there in 7 days, and yet that is what faces us.\n  Last night, like many Americans, I watched and listened to the \nPresident and listened to Speaker Boehner. I must admit, when it comes \nto the comments made by the President, I do not understand where he is \ncoming from. He talks about higher taxes and more revenue when the \nreality is, at this late date, he is the only one talking about that.\n  I have been one of those people who has said for a long time we \nabsolutely need to engage in a process of reforming our Tax Code. It is \ntoo complicated. It is almost an antigrowth piece of work. I am anxious \nto work with my colleagues. But with 7 days left to try to suggest \nthere will be a massive amount of new taxes does not make any sense. \nThat is not in the Reid plan. It is not in the Boehner plan. Yet there \nit is.\n  Well, here we are. We are literally 7 days away. As I said, as I \nwatched those comments last night, it looked to me like campaign \nrhetoric. It looked like positioning for the next election. It looked \nlike class warfare. What it did not look like to me was Presidential \nleadership. Yet our creditors around the world are watching this debt \nlimit debate unfold, and they are as shocked as all of us are by the \nlack of leadership coming out of the White House.\n  This weekend, the President was presented a bipartisan approach. I \nfound it reassuring over the weekend to know that our leaders in the \nSenate here were talking and trying to work their way through this \nterribly complicated issue, very difficult issue. I thought with that \nkind of effort, when an approach was presented to the President, he \nwould naturally embrace the approach. With only 1 week left, that made \nthe most sense to me. Yet, surprisingly, the President rejected the \napproach. The reason? Well, the reason is, as he has said so many \ntimes, the President does not want to have to deal with increasing the \ndebt limit next year during his campaign for a second term.\n  I find that shocking since last night, when he addressed the Nation, \nhe expressed great concern about our debt limit negotiations being in a \nstalemate. Yet he could have used that opportunity by accepting the \nbipartisan proposal that had been presented to him a day or so earlier. \nHe had the opportunity to show the type of leadership our country needs \nand is crying out for, but he decided to reject the plan and retreat to \npolitical talking points.\n  The President also said he would veto Speaker Boehner's approach to \nraising the debt limit for 7 months, claiming it kicks the can down the \nroad--claiming that is what it would be.\n  Let's look at that. Let's examine what the President is trying to \nconvince this Nation of. Over the last 25 years, Congress has increased \nthe debt limit 31 times. Mr. President, 22 of those 31 times were for \nless than a year. Yet the President claims he will veto anything not \nextending into 2013? It defies logic to decry our debt and then veto \nanything unless it allows more record-setting debt. That is exactly \nwhat he is pledging he will do: veto anything less than the largest \ndebt limit increase in the history of the United States of America--the \nlargest.\n  His last debt limit increase in January was the largest in history at \nthat point--$1.9 trillion--yet instead of hitting the brakes and \nsaying, ``Whoa, time out, this is getting us in trouble,'' the \nPresident is doubling down, demanding yet another record-setting budget \nbuster.\n  Who does the President think is going to pay off all this debt? It \nwill be our children and our grandchildren. Passing multiple trillion-\ndollar debt limit increases without addressing our addiction to \nspending does far more to kick the problems down the road. It sends the \nproblems over the cliff, in fact. Yet, despite this reality, the \nPresident continues to accelerate, as we get closer and closer to the \ncliff. The President recently said this:\n\n       The only bottom line I have is that we have to extend the \n     debt ceiling through the next election, into 2013.\n\n  While numerous issues accompany this line of thinking, let's hit some \nhigh points.\n  Our national debt is more than $14 trillion, and the President is \nrequesting to increase it to $16 trillion--the largest in our Nation's \nhistory. So why is the bottom line only about the length of the \nextension, not about spending reductions that put our country back on \ntrack?\n\n[[Page S4892]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the President's only fundamental concern is how do we \nkick this past the next election. Above all else, not good policy, not \nwhat is best for our citizens, but the No. 1 goal is how to get past \nthe next election. This is, unfortunately, his bottom line. Simply \nastounding that the campaign of hope and change has become such \nbusiness as usual. Simply raising the debt ceiling absent any \nmeaningful spending reforms will not work.\n  Now we find ourselves in one heck of a mess. With about a week to go, \nthe latest in the debt limit saga is a proposal that was introduced \nlast night by Senator Reid. But here is why this latest plan has so \nmany problems. Policywise, it does not hold together. The plan claims \n$1 trillion in savings from reductions in troop forces. These savings \nassume the troop surge extends into perpetuity, which never was the \nplan. So it assumes savings from stopping spending that was never \nscheduled or even requested. It is like reaching into the air and \ngrabbing savings. Essentially, this plan counts savings that were \nscheduled to happen.\n  Second, the plan counts $400 billion in interest savings on that \nsavings relative to the troop money that was not going to be spent, was \nnot asked for. In other words, not only does the plan count nonexistent \nsavings, it then compounds the policy problem by counting nonexistent \ninterest savings on that savings. You simply cannot count savings that \nwere never intended to happen.\n  We are dealing with a ticking timebomb here. We have rating agencies \nsaying: My goodness, your debt is so out of control that unless we see \na plan, we will not be fooled by the gimmicks. Yet this policy approach \ndoes not hold together. You see, the rating agencies, justifiably so, \nwant to see real budget savings that actually help to improve our \nbalance sheet.\n  We are at a critical time in our Nation's history. With 1 week left, \nthe American people are yearning for bold leadership, not another shell \ngame. Heated rhetoric and charged accusations are not going to fix the \nfiscal situation.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues on a solution, and I urge \nthe President to do the same. Let's quit defending what is \nindefensible; that is, worrying about getting the can kicked down the \nroad past the next election, and let's try to figure out how best to \naddress this.\n  There was a plan that came out recently. It was a plan dubbed from \nthe Gang of 6, and the Presiding Officer and I have had some interest \nin that plan. But we all acknowledge it is going to take time to put \nthat plan in place, to debate that plan, to bring it to the floor, to \ndo the things that are necessary. We have to take action now. I am a \npart of a group that says: Look, let's take a long hard look at that \nplan. Let's see if that is the plan we can move down the field to \nsuccess.\n  But we have just 7 days left. We need to face the reality that 7 days \nfrom now we will be within hours of hitting our debt ceiling. \nIncidentally, to those who are arguing: No, it is not August 2, well, \nif it is not August 2, it is close to August 2. We are facing a real \nproblem where there will not be enough money to pay the bills.\n  Many say: Pay the interest on the debt. Make sure you get that done. \nI am not opposed to that. I do not want to default on our debt. But \nthat means we have about 50 cents on the dollar in August, according to \na cashflow statement done by the Bipartisan Policy Group, and that \nmeans that 50 percent of those out there who would otherwise receive \nsome type of payment from the Federal Government will not get it \nbecause there simply is not enough money to pay the bills.\n  So what does Speaker Boehner's plan do?\n  Well, it is a plan that is realistic. It says, look, we have to come \nto grips with where we are in the next 7 days or we can simply suspend \nrational thought, believe that the record-breaking debt increases to \naccommodate record-setting debt are somehow a plausible course. It is \nnot.\n  I am more apt to believe the President's own words. When the debt \nlimit increase was $781 billion to raise our borrowing authority to $9 \ntrillion, then Senator Obama was in the place where we are in today, \ndeciding on whether he would vote for a debt ceiling increase, and he \ncalled the situation then a ``failure of leadership.'' He went on to \nsay ``increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \ninternationally.''\n  Well, we were at $9 trillion then, an unforgivable amount of money. \nToday we are at $14.5 trillion, and the steam engine is firing away, \nbuilding up more and more debt.\n  Senator Obama's words were as truthful then as they are today. Yet \nnow he has done a 180. His Presidency has hit the turbo booster when it \ncomes to record debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time reserved for the Republicans has \nexpired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4892-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4892-S4893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RAISING THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are now 1 week away from the \nunthinkable prospect of the United States of America defaulting on its \nloans for the first time in our history and not making good on promises \nwe have made to families, veterans, senior citizens across the country.\n  I am deeply disappointed we have gotten to this point. If we cannot \ncome to an agreement by August 2, the consequences for our Nation and \nour economic recovery will be dire. A few weeks ago, the Bipartisan \nPolicy Center put out a report that was actually authored by a former \nBush Treasury official about what would happen if Congress failed to \nact and if the administration was forced to make desperate spending \ndecisions in August. The scenarios were very grim.\n  Potentially at risk were the benefits and health care we owe our \nveterans, loans for struggling small businesses, food stamps for people \nwho are struggling to buy groceries, Social Security checks for our \nseniors, unemployment benefits for millions of workers who are \ndesperately looking for jobs today, and even Active-Duty pay for our \nmilitary.\n  If the debt ceiling is not raised, we also face the very real and \nfrightening possibility of our economy falling back into another deep \nrecession, interest rates going up for our families and consumers, \nmillions of workers losing their jobs, and small businesses being \nforced to close their doors. These risks are unacceptable. People are \nstill recovering in this tough economy and they cannot afford to have \nthe rug pulled out from under them.\n  Many families from my home State of Washington have reached out to my \noffice throughout this debate, trying to figure out what they would do \nif the support they depend upon to stay in their homes, to put food on \ntheir tables is suddenly cut off. They have a pretty simple message: \nGet it done, compromise, and put American families first.\n  One letter came from Anne Phillips from Tacoma, WA, who after 18 \nyears of work was laid off during the recession. Anne told me about how \nshe felt she was doing the responsible thing by getting herself up, \ndusting herself off, going back to college. But now she is worried sick \nbecause of the fact that the interest rate she pays on her student \nloans, which she relies on to pay for school, would shoot up if we \ndefault.\n  In her letter, Anne made clear who the real victims of default would \nbe. She said: ``Ultimately people like me, my husband, my family, and \nall the people I know who are doing their best every day to make the \ncontribution to society will pay the expense.''\n  Anne is not alone in her concern. I have heard from veterans such as \nKenneth Huff, a retired master sergeant from Olympia, WA. He spent 28 \nyears serving our country. He told me how through a life in the \nmilitary he learned the value of compromise and how he is tired of the \nway the peoples' work is not being done.\n  He wrote:\n\n       I agree. We can cut back on spending. I know we can do a \n     better job. But not on the backs of the very poor, the middle \n     class, veterans and our seniors who are on Social Security \n     and Medicare.\n\n  I have also heard from Social Security recipients such as Alisa Terry \nfrom Bellingham, WA, who told me how important that monthly check is to \nher and what it would mean if she did not get it next month. She says:\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\n  Social Security is my lifeline. It stands between me and \nhomelessness.\n  These families and seniors deserve to have the certainty of a Federal \nGovernment that stands ready to pay its debt. They do not deserve to \nturn on the news every day and read about the political games House \nRepublicans are playing with their lives and economic future. Democrats \nhave been at the table. We have been ready and willing to compromise \nfor months and months. We know we need to get this done. We have \noffered compromise after compromise. We have come to the middle and \nbeyond. We have offered serious and deep cuts in Federal spending--very \nhard for some of us to do.\n  We have put it on the table and then we offered even more. But again \nand again, the House Republicans have said no. They refuse to \ncompromise, and they refuse to come to the middle. Time and time again, \nthey seem to be more interested in satisfying the most extreme elements \nof their base than on finding real solutions for the people of this \ncountry.\n  The House Republicans even sent us a bill they called cut, cap and \nbalance that was not only widely understood to be a political gimmick \nbut it had no chance of becoming law, and not only would it have been \nabsolutely devastating for families and seniors across this country but \nit managed to waste precious time in Congress at a point when that \nresource is getting scarcer and scarcer.\n  So we are down to the wire. Political games need to end. They need to \nstop finding ways to say no and start figuring out what they can say \nyes to. The bill we introduced last night is a compromise. I do not \nbelieve it is perfect, but it gets us where we need to get to protect \nfamilies and small businesses across America from market uncertainty, \nnot just for a month or two. That is not what American families need. \nThey need to know they have that economic certainty and that we will \nnot be back in this ball game in just a few short months, going through \nthe same process, with people worried about their Social Security \nchecks and veterans worried again and with the markets uncertain.\n  The legislation that was introduced last night does make deep and \nserious cuts in government spending, savings that have either been \ndiscussed and agreed on in previous negotiations with Republicans or \nthat Republicans have actually used in the budgets they recently passed \nthemselves.\n  It does protect Medicare and Social Security that was promised to our \nseniors. It does not increase revenue, something many of us have argued \ntime and time again needs to be a part of a balanced approach to a \nconclusion. But we understand compromise is important. So it does not \nincrease revenue and that appears to be something my Republican \ncolleagues have almost single-mindedly focused on in this process. So \nwe have given in on that.\n  It puts our country on a more sustainable fiscal track, and it allows \nus to continue the important work to reduce the debt and deficit \nwithout the threat of economic calamity hanging over our heads such as \nthe current House proposal does.\n  On this side, Democrats have bent over backward to get this done. We \ncompromised. We compromised again and then again. The bill that was \nintroduced last night on our side is the fruit of many compromises. We \ndid this not because we think this is the ideal way to tackle this \nissue--Democrats do want a larger and a more balanced package that we \nbelieve will address our problems in a responsible way for years to \ncome--but we put this forward because we know the American people want \nresults, not rhetoric, and we know the consequences of inaction are far \ntoo high.\n  I call on our Republican colleagues to support this legislation, stop \nplaying politics with the American economy, and work with us to solve \nthis problem for the American people.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't intend to use but 1 minute \nbecause I spoke yesterday on this nomination, but I would urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of Paul A. Engelmayer to be \ndistrict judge. He is very well qualified, and I would encourage a \n``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I made a statement about the need \nfor the Senate to consider all 27 judicial nominees reviewed by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and now awaiting final action by the Senate. \nI was disappointed that the votes on Paul Engelmayer to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Southern District of New York and Ramona \nManglona to fill a 10-year term on the District Court for the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which had already been \nstalled for 3\\1/2\\ months, were not considered yesterday. These are the \nkinds of qualified, consensus judicial nominations that in past years \nwould have been confirmed promptly. I hope and trust that at least they \nwill be considered and confirmed today.\n  After their confirmations, there will be 25 judicial nominations \nfully considered by the Judiciary Committee awaiting final action by \nthe Senate. Twenty of them were unanimously reported, without a single \nnegative vote. Regrettably, the Senate has not reduced vacancies as \ndramatically as we did during the Bush administration. Federal judicial \nvacancies around the country still number too many, and they have \npersisted for far too long.\n  By the August recess in the third year of the Bush administration, \nthe Senate had confirmed 143 Federal circuit and district court judges. \nAs we approach the August recess in the third year of the Obama \nadministration, the comparable number after confirmation of Paul \nEngelmayer and Ramona Manglona today will be only 91.\n  We have a long way to go to do as well as we did during President \nBush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial nominations. \nThe Senate confirmed 100 of those judicial nominations during the 17 \nmonths I was chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. \nSo far, as we near the end of President Obama's 30th month in office, \nthe Senate has only been allowed to consider and confirm only 91 of \nPresident Obama's Federal circuit and district court nominees. Despite \nthe needs of the Federal judiciary, the delays in confirmation of \nPresident Obama's consensus judicial nominees continue to the detriment \nof the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this past Sunday a New York Times editorial \nentitled ``In the Wake of Fukushima'' noted:\n\n       If nuclear power is to have a future in this country, \n     Americans have to have confidence that regulators and the \n     industry are learning the lessons of Fukushima and are taking \n     all steps necessary to ensure safety.\n\n  Following the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March, \nit is clear that maintaining America's confidence in the safety of our \nnuclear reactors is paramount. The disaster at Fukushima should not \nlead to a freeze of the nuclear industry; instead, it should be an \nopportunity to upgrade the safety of our nuclear fleet. Both industry \nand the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission assure us that currently \nthere is no immediate threat to the operation of our nuclear plants.\n  Nuclear power is especially important to my home State of Illinois, \nwhere nearly half of all electricity in the State is nuclear. With 11 \nof 104 operating nuclear power plants and stations in our State, we \nhave more reactors than any other State in the Union.\n  In the near term, it is my hope that nuclear regulators and the \nindustry will take actions necessary to increase safety measures and \nintegrate emergency operating procedures. Furthermore, nuclear plants \nshould swiftly implement sensible measures to increase flood \nprotections, enhance containment-venting capabilities, install remote \nmonitoring controls of spent fuel pool conditions, and upgrade the \nability to cope and maintain operations by a single station sustained \nfor initially 8 hours and eventually up to 72 hours utilizing \npreplanned and prestaged resources.\n  Moving forward, one of our top priorities should be enhancing flood \nprotection at reactors. Obviously reactors, for their cooling, need to \nbe near large bodies of water, subject to flood. Fukushima highlighted \nthe need to take additional protections to guarantee that current \nbackup pumps and generators are also protected against flood or other \nseismic events. A recent flooding on the Missouri River is a \ndemonstration of the need for such enhancements. Although flood \nbarriers and procedures have so far protected the Fort Calhoun nuclear \npowerplant in Nebraska, this is not the time to look away from making \nfurther efforts on protecting reactors from floods.\n  One of the ringing lessons of the Fukushima disaster is the need for \nenhanced capabilities for nuclear operators to cope with prolonged \npower outages. Every U.S. nuclear powerplant should be able to cope \nwith a prolonged loss of power for at least 8 hours for an initial \nperiod and eventually 72 hours using only the resources onsite so that \npowerplant operators can utilize preplanned and prestaged equipment and \nmuster other resources if necessary. We should be prepared for \nsimultaneous events for multiple reactors onsite and should be able to \nmaintain key power functions in the face of varying circumstances, \nincluding debilitated infrastructure, lack of communication, and \nespecially the loss of onsite power.\n  It is clear that operators' ability to cope with the prolonged loss \nof power was critical at Fukushima. We know that the tsunami hit the \nFukushima Daiichi powerplant and wiped out all alternating power and \nbackup power necessary to provide resources to the cooling pumps. This \neventually caused overheating in both reactor vessels and cooling \nponds. The ability to perform these critical functions and to monitor \nthem--providing power to fans and pumps and to remotely open and close \nvents and valves--the inability of the Japanese to perform these \nfunctions caused them to lose control of key areas or to maintain \ncooling to critical spent fuel ponds and reactor vessels.\n  The Japanese also were unable to remotely monitor conditions, \nespecially in their spent fuel pools, and struggled continuously to \npump enough water into the reactors. Operators need to have proper \ninstrumentation at far, remote locations so they can continue to \nunderstand what is happening in reactors and cooling ponds if an event \noccurs.\n  Furthermore, we need to install proper venting upgrades on all \nreactors with the Mark II containment design. This is an important step \nin preventing any kind of overpressurization and in reducing the risk \nof operations that we saw so clearly at Fukushima.\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\n  In the United States, there are 23 reactors with the Mark I \ncontainment design. We have known since 1989 that there are flaws with \nthe pressure containment system of the Mark I boiler reactor. As a \nprecaution, industry upgraded the Mark I containments with the hardened \nvent to deal with the excessive pressure in the containment.\n  According to the NRC task force's 90-day report, which examined the \nsafety of U.S. nuclear powerplants, the hardened vents are not \nuniversally installed on the Mark II containments in the United States. \nThe task force noted further that because the Mark II containments are \nonly 25 percent larger than the volume of the Mark I, it is conceivable \nthat the Mark II containments, under a similar situation, would suffer \nthe same consequences as Nos. 1 through 4 at Fukushima. We should \ninstall hardened vents on all Mark II containment reactors and not \nallow any more time to pass before making deliberate improvements to \naddress these safety concerns.\n  As we press forward with nuclear power generation, I believe the NRC \nshould also update our emergency planning zones. This is the evacuation \nzone that is preplanned around every nuclear powerplant. It seems \nprudent now, in the light of the experience of Fukushima, that we \nshould expand the emergency planning zone to the Japanese radius of 20 \nkilometers or 12.5 miles around each nuclear reactor. These EPZs should \nbe updated with the latest 2010 census data of the number of Americans \nresiding around these reactors, and the NRC should require enough \nradiation dose medication to handle at least two full EPZ evacuations \nif necessary.\n  We also know that the spent fuel pools posed a serious threat to the \nsafety of the site. Throughout the crises, Fukushima crews struggled to \nmaintain water levels at the spent fuel pools to prevent an escape of \nuncontained radiation into the environment. For those of us who know a \nlittle bit about reactors, this was a surprise because normally we are \ntotally focused on what is happening inside the reactor, but at \nFukushima, as much attention had to be paid on overheating in the spent \nfuel ponds.\n  This warning should serve as the beginning of an effort for us to \nrelook at the issue of spent fuel in the United States, especially \nspent fuel which is stored near our drinking water sources. We all know \n96 percent of all the fresh water in the United States is in the Great \nLakes, and I am concerned that we store approximately 1,000 tons of \nhighly radioactive spent nuclear fuel just 200 yards from the Lake \nMichigan shoreline at the now defunct Zion nuclear reactor. Any \nproposal to stop the permanent disposal of nuclear waste in Nevada is a \nproposal to continue storing highly radioactive nuclear fuel right next \nto America's source of 96 percent of its fresh water.\n  I believe we should now continue to reinvigorate the process of \nbuilding the Yucca Mountain facility. Any proposal to not build Yucca \nis a proposal to pose a clear-and-present, long-term danger to the \nenvironmental future of the Great Lakes.\n  The bottom line is we should not let the lessons learned from the \nFukushima disaster become a forgotten story, and that the NRC task \nforce and its 90-day report issued after the Fukushima disaster is a \nserious document that now should lead not just to further studies and \nconsultant reports but comprehensive action, such as hardened vents, \nsuch as making sure we have remote monitoring of spent fuel ponds, and \nthat all reactors be able to operate first 8 and then 72 hours without \noutside power, and that we take the other measures to upgrade our \nmeasure, such as expanding the EPZs.\n  Tomorrow I will be testifying before the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and as the junior Senator of the State of Illinois, the \nmost nuclear State in America, I will carry a strong message: Nuclear \npower has a strong future in the United States but one that should be \ngoing forward in light of the lessons of Fukushima.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4895-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4895-S4897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEBT LIMIT AND TAX INCREASES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last night we heard from President Obama in \na prime-time address from the East Room of the White House. The topic \nwas raising the Federal debt limit. According to Treasury Secretary \nGeithner, the Federal Government may breach the statutory debt limit as \nearly as August 2, 2011. That is 1 week from today.\n  Remarkably, the President, in yet another prime-time address, again \nhectored the American people about the need for politically charged tax \nhikes as a cure-all for our deficit and debt problems.\n  We have to hand it to the President; he is a true believer. For the \nPresident, there seems to be no problem in Washington that can't be \nfixed with tax increases. Even his own party has moved beyond him on \nthis. To be certain, Democrats have not become the party of tax relief. \nFor example, the plan offered by the majority leader does not address \nthe 10-year tax increase of $3.5 trillion that is said to kick in on \nJanuary 1, 2013. But last night on CNN, one reporter got it about \nright. This is how she put it: ``Nobody is talking about tax increases \nexcept Barack Obama.''\n  For weeks the President and his surrogates on and off Capitol Hill \nhave been talking about tax increases as the solution to our debt \ncrisis, but the President was on his own last night. It was a speech \nvery much divorced from the reality of our situation.\n  Republicans are insistent that the solution to a spending crisis is \nnot giving government more money to spend, and here is the dirty \nsecret: Many members of the President's own party are not keen on tax \nincreases either. They know the President's politically driven tax \nincreases, in the context of trillions in deficits and debt, will do \nlittle to restore the Nation's fiscal footing. They know more \nsignificant tax increases will hit the middle class and small business \njob creators very hard. But even as his troops have left him, President \nObama soldiers on, leading the fight for higher taxes and spreading the \nwealth around.\n  The President talked last night about the need for a balanced \napproach. Here is what he means by that: To balance the budget his way, \nwe will have to raise taxes by roughly $2 trillion. So what does he \nthink of the plan of the Senate's distinguished majority leader? After \nall, the majority leader has put forth a plan that does not contain tax \nincreases--or at least that is the claim. Presumably, the President \nwould, therefore, oppose the majority leader's plan as unbalanced. But \nthat would assume the President is not playing politics with this \ndebate. That would assume he is more concerned with solving our \nNation's debt crisis than appealing to his base, getting his approval \nratings up, and positioning himself for reelection.\n  Somehow, in spite of his absolute insistence on the need for tax \nincreases and a balanced solution to the debt limit debate, the \nPresident supports the majority leader's proposal.\n  The President likes to present himself as the only reasonable man in \nWashington. But as he proved again with his latest politically driven \ninconsistency, he is as partisan as they come. To the disappointment of \nhis campaign advisers, it is clear the American people are demanding a \nleader who will be straight with them rather than focus on election \nyear positioning.\n  If the President and his party came clean with the American people, \nthis is what they would acknowledge: Nondefense discretionary spending \nis at historic highs. The Nation's biggest spending programs are \ncompletely out of control and set for bankruptcy. Over the next 10 \nyears, the President's budget would drive this country into debt by an \nadditional $13 trillion. Most importantly, they would acknowledge that \nthe Nation's problem is principally too much spending, not too little \ntaxes.\n  I don't envy my friends on the other side of the aisle. They are in a \ntough place. On the one hand, the liberal base refuses any structural \nreforms to the spending programs that are driving the country's debt to \nthe brink. On the other hand, absent these structural reforms the \nmiddle class and job creators will have to be hit with historic tax \nincreases. Obviously, they cannot be open about this second point or \nthey risk the ire of American voters.\n  Those who represent San Francisco and the upper west side might be \nable to go home and sell these tax increases,\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\nbut for Democrats responsible to entire States, not just small liberal \nenclaves, such tax increases are a much tougher pitch.\n  So what is a Democrat to do? Democrats can't propose meaningful \nspending reductions, but they can't support job-killing tax increases. \nSo this is what they will do. They choose to ignore the real problem. \nThey offer no plan. They refuse to present a budget--they actually \nrefused to present a budget for more than 800 days. They dodge and \nweave. One minute the President is for real reforms to Medicare. The \nnext minute he is accusing Republicans of trying to destroy Medicare \nfor recommending reforms, and they hope their friends in the media \nignore the failure to offer a real solution.\n  As we can see from this chart, the problem is spending, and we need a \nsolution commensurate with that problem. As we can see, spending is the \nred line; taxes happen to be the blue line. Spending as a percentage of \nGDP is much higher than the historical average. The average level of \nspending has been around 18 percent since World War II. Since President \nObama took office in 2008, spending has surged to over--actually 25 \npercent at one point of our economy--way above the 18 to 20 percent \nnorm. Tax receipts have dipped, but they are expected to come back. CBO \nestimates, however, that spending is currently set to stay at around 24 \npercent.\n  As we can see, spending is the red line that goes off the charts \nduring 2009, 2010, and on into 2020. Taxes have always been right where \nthey are. They went pretty high, came down, and now they are back up. \nAs we can see from the chart, President Obama's 2012 budget does not \nhelp one bit in reducing this level of spending. The President's budget \nis not balanced by any means.\n  Again, the problem for the President is this: Even while he was \nexplaining to Joe the Plumber the moral and civic imperative of \nspreading the wealth around, he was promising not to raise taxes on \nindividuals making less than $200,000 or families making less than \n$250,000. But if he is going to balance the budget by attempting to pay \nfor current levels of discretionary spending that Lyndon Johnson only \ndreamed of and spending programs that are permanently in the red, he is \ngoing to have to hit the middle class hard. He is going to have to \nbreak his promise--not exactly a political win.\n  Even as he talked about moving the Democratic Party to the left and \nabandoning the comparative moderation of the Clinton administration, he \nremembers well the fate of Walter Mondale. When accepting his party's \nnomination for President in San Francisco in 1984, Walter Mondale \npromised Americans that he was going to raise their taxes. President \nReagan went on to win in a 49-State landslide. President Obama is not \ngoing to suffer the same fate as Walter Mondale, so he avoids \ndiscussion of the tax increases on the middle class that he really \nbelieves in. Instead, in this debate he is focused on a number of \npolitically opportunistic red herrings that will have minimal impact on \nthe Nation's debt crisis.\n  The purpose of these red herrings is to distract Americans from the \nreal driver of our deficits and debt and the real choices Democrats \nhave to, but are refusing to, make. Let's just look at a few of these \nexamples.\n  The President has been talking incessantly about the need to tax \ncorporate jets. Well, if we were to raise the appreciable rate on \ncorporate jets from 5 years to 7 years as the Democrats propose, it \nwould yield, at least according to the economists, $3.1 billion--that \nis with a ``b''--over 10 years.\n  Just to be clear, as we are discussing these paltry numbers--numbers \nwhich the President would have us believe are key to restoring the \nmarkets' confidence in the American economy and our ability to manage \nour debt--the United States will run a budget deficit this year of $1.5 \ntrillion. Our national debt is $14.3 trillion. The President's budget \nassumes an additional $13 trillion in debt on top of that, and the \nPresident is talking about the tax treatment of corporate jets which, \nif he got his way, would raise $3.1 billion over 10 years.\n  This is about as effective as one of my fellow Utahans standing in \nhis driveway in Little Cottonwood Canyon during a blizzard and flicking \na snowflake off his shoulder and claiming he was finished shoveling for \nthe day.\n  To hear the President talk, one would think this proposal is \nabsolutely critical to balancing our budget. To put it in perspective, \nover the next 10 years of debt this Nation is set to take on it would \nequate to roughly 20 hours and 23 minutes of debt reduction.\n  Let's not forget about the essential matter of cutting back the \nmortgage interest deduction for yachts used as second homes. Again, the \nPresident acts as if this is one of a handful of policies that will \nrestore America's prosperity. But if Congress enacted this change, we \nwould cover the 10 years of debt from the Obama budget for all of 15 \nhours and 47 minutes.\n  Of course, the Democratic talking points would not be complete \nwithout an attack on the oil companies. The President has talked about \nmaking American oil companies pay their fair share by reducing or \neliminating domestic energy incentives. This proposal would raise $21 \nbillion in revenue. That would cover a whopping 5 days, 18 hours, and \n47 minutes of debt that the President is prepared to take on over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Then there are the rich. Tax the rich. Make them pay their fair \nshare. This class warfare might be appropriate in Europe and countries \nwith a feudal history, but in the United States, a nation conceived in \nliberty and the proposition that all men are created equal, families \nand entrepreneurs just don't buy it--and for good reason. Taxing the \nrich hits job creators and undermines economic growth. But as deficit \nreduction policy, it falls short as well.\n  In the name of bipartisanship, I am going to use data from the Tax \nPolicy Center, or TPC, to demonstrate my point. According to TPC models \nand estimates for 2011, American households earning more than $1 \nmillion account for 12 percent of the Nation's pretax income and pay 19 \npercent of Federal taxes and carry an average tax rate of 29 percent. \nEven more critical from my perspective, these taxpayers also account \nfor 38 percent of all flow-through income. Flow-through income is \npredominantly earnings from ownership of small businesses.\n  So raising rates on the rich will hit squarely on those who create \nand expand the small businesses that need to be the engine for our \neconomic recovery. But let's be clear about something. Higher taxes on \nthese wealthy individuals will not only have adverse economic \nconsequences, it will not even provide the deficit and debt reduction \nsuggested by the left.\n  Even if all of the income of those earning more than $1 million a \nyear were confiscated with a 100-percent rate--with the unlikely \nassumption of no taxpayer behavioral response--for the year of \nconfiscation, these higher taxes would yield about $893 billion. My \ngosh, our deficit this year is $1.5 trillion--just in 1 year. The most \nwe would get is $893 billion, and that is if we are lucky.\n\n  This is a one-shot opportunity. If we confiscated this wealth, those \nindividuals would no longer work, save, create more wealth, and \ngenerate more tax revenue. And confiscating all the income from those \nearning over $1 million does not even fix 1 year--not even 1 year--of \nthe 10 years of projected Obama debt. It would cover 244 days, 16 \nhours, and 34 minutes.\n  All the demagoguery on jets and yachts and oil companies yields about \n1 week of deficit reduction from the President's 10-year debt.\n  Even throwing in a one-time confiscation of all the income for \ntaxpayers above $1 million, we can only add 244 days. Add it all up, \nand what the President is proposing amounts to less than one-tenth of \ndeficit reduction from the debt President Obama will add over the next \n10 years.\n  Last night, the President tossed some more class warfare into the \nmix. He mentioned taxing hedge fund managers. Here is how he put it:\n\n       How can we ask a student to pay more for college before we \n     ask hedge fund managers to stop paying taxes at a lower rate \n     than their secretaries?\n\n  The proposal he is talking about would tax carried interest as \nordinary income. The Joint Tax Committee has provided an estimate on \nthis, and over 10 years this change in the Tax Code would generate \nanother $21.4 billion. That is about as much as the oil company tax \nObama is proposing of $21.1\n\n[[Page S4897]]\n\nbillion. This would cover approximately 5 days and 21 hours of the \nPresident's 10-year debt.\n  This morning, someone on television was bemoaning the fact that \nDemocrats are not going to the mat for tax increases the way the \nPresident has. He suggested the congressional Democrats do not have the \ncourage to support tax increases.\n  With all due respect, the person lacking in courage is the current \noccupant of the Oval Office. The President had an opportunity this \nsummer. Was he going to lead on the debt crisis or would it be more of \nthe same--red herrings piled on top of straw men in an effort to \ndistract the American people from his own complicity in this debt \ncrisis.\n  Yet the President chose not to own up to the American people. The \nquarterback punted. He offered no solutions. Concerns about reelection \nwere of greater priority than the imminent downgrading of the Nation's \ncredit rating--a downgrade that will work as a tax increase on \nhomeowners, students, and the Treasury itself, which is responsible for \nservicing the $14.3 trillion in existing debt.\n  Unable to propose tax increases on the middle class and unable to \nreform entitlements due to liberal dead-enders, he chose to offer \nplatitudes and class warfare that might play well with some \nconstituencies but do nothing to address the fundamental problem this \nNation faces.\n  This country cannot avoid the choices that are coming. We have to get \nour spending under control. That is why I supported cut, cap, and \nbalance. That is why I think S.J. Res. 10--the balanced budget \namendment I introduced along with my colleague and friend from Utah, \nSenator Lee, and all 47 Senate Republicans--is absolutely essential. It \nwould fix this problem once and for all.\n  But the President opposes it. He talks a lot about empowering people. \nWell, the Founders of this country empowered the American people to \nmake changes to the Constitution. The Constitution provides for that. \nWhy not give them the opportunity to pass this amendment? Remember, if \nthe Democrats do not like it, all they have to do is get 13 States to \ndisagree. We have to get 38 States to ratify. Why not let the people \ndecide this? Why are they so afraid to let the people decide this?\n  Let me offer an answer. Because Democrats are terrified the American \npeople would ratify it and their big spending practices would go the \nway of dinosaurs. The American people are sick and tired of spending. \nMothers and fathers understand that the Federal Government is going to \nbankrupt their children and leave them an America that is less free and \nless prosperous.\n  The American people are frustrated. They might not have the data at \ntheir fingertips, but they understand what I just laid out quite well. \nWe are not going to solve our problems by raising taxes. Increasingly, \nthe President is an island in his call for more tax increases. \nRepublicans do not support him. Independents do not support him. Now \neven Democrats do not support him.\n  It is time to move on. We need to rein in our debt, and we need to \nact boldly in doing so. So far, the President has failed to lead on \nthis issue, choosing instead politically convenient talking points. But \nI would remind my dear friend in the White House, it is never too late \nto mend this problem.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Mr. President, I will be brief. I have been asked by a \nnumber of people how I feel about the efforts made to get the United \nStates out of the quandary in which it now finds itself over the debt \nlimit. Let me be very clear. I applaud President Obama and Majority \nLeader Reid for real leadership and persistence over many months in \ntrying to find a bipartisan solution to the debt crisis.\n  Senator Reid has put forward a solution that would end the current \ncrisis and reduce our unsustainable national debt. This is a solution \nthat has the potential to draw support from lawmakers from both parties \nwho are willing to put common sense and the national interests above \npartisanship and ideology, those who would say rather than party first \nlet's go country first now we have a framework for a solution.\n  By repeatedly walking away from the table and insisting on their way \nor no way, those who are holding the American people and our economy \nhostage are playing ideological games with serious consequences for \neveryone else. Through their tactics they threaten great risk to the \nwell-being of ordinary Americans. The longer this goes on, the greater \nthe danger of lasting damage below the waterline of our democracy. \nRight now Leader Reid's $2.7 trillion debt reduction package is the \nbest chance--really is the best chance this country has--to avoid a \ndefault and a credit rating downgrade that would damage our fragile \neconomy. It would also impose a credit tax hike on every American \nfamily. If we downgrade our credit rating, we are going to be sending \nhundreds of billions of dollars in interest to other countries, money \nthey can spend on medical research, on schools, on transportation, and \nalternative energy. They can spend it in their country--we will be \npaying the bills--and all because the Congress did not come together on \na solution on this issue.\n  Most people looking at this wonder why have we not moved. Senator \nReid has a plan that can move. It says we will spend this money--the \nmoney we have--not shipping it overseas to other countries but spend it \non the needs of our own country. The plan consolidates terms agreed to \nin the ongoing negotiations. It proposes a solution that ends the \ncurrent crisis. It accomplishes wide-ranging savings, and has enough \nbipartisan support to pass.\n  It would end the roller coaster of unpredictability that shackles our \neconomy by instead offering financial stability through 2012. Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid beneficiaries will be spared a loss of \nbenefits. The American people will begin to recognize these savings \nfrom withdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan. Essential education, job \ncreation, housing, and environmental investments for America's economic \nrecovery and for a strong economic future would be protected from the \nslashing cuts proposed by House Republicans.\n  The irony is Republican leaders previously had backed all of the \nspending reductions called for in Leader Reid's plan. I do not agree--I \nsuspect all of us do not agree--with all aspects of this proposed \nsolution. But we are not going to have 100 solutions on this floor, we \nare going to have 1 we can vote on. I wish this would have included new \nrevenue, especially by ending such costly and outdated tax benefits as \nthose still enjoyed by the biggest oil companies to help us pay off our \ndebt even more quickly.\n  I want to help pay for the debt incurred by the inexcusable earlier \ndecisions to enter two wars without paying for them. I continue to \nbelieve that a surcharge for the wealthiest would mean they would pay \nmore of their fair share after so many years of tax cuts that tilted \nfar more toward the wealthiest of Americans rather than to the middle \nclass.\n  I find it interesting when I hear lectures from those who voted for \nan unnecessary war in Iraq--Iraq, a country that had nothing whatsoever \nto do with 9/11, a country that before we invaded it had no al-Qaida \nbut has plenty now--say we will vote for this war, and for the first \ntime in our history we will not pay for it, we will borrow the money. \nWe will cut taxes. And to pay for it we will borrow the money. Look \nwhere we are now. We will eventually owe $3.5 trillion for that war.\n  You know, it is far easier--and I say this to everybody like myself--\nthey may see every single thing they want here--it is far easier to \nwalk away from the negotiating table than to make the hard choices \nneeded on behalf of the American people. We need serious\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\nstatesmanship on both sides for this to work, both sides to get a \nsolution, and both sides to do it before it is too late.\n  The economic health of our country, the jobs of thousands of hard-\nworking Americans, should not be mired in politics. It is well past the \ntime--and I realize there is a House faction that is driving much of \nthe decisions there. It is well past time for that faction in the House \nof Representatives to put politics aside and accept a long-term deficit \nreduction plan that does not force America's most vulnerable to \nshoulder the burden.\n  Just as many Vermont families are forced to make difficult financial \ndecisions, Congress has to be open to considering all available \noptions. We do this in my State of Vermont without gimmicks. We do not \nhave any constitutional amendment on balanced budgets or anything such \nas that. We just balance the budget.\n  In that regard, I recall a Member who said: Let's have a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, knowing it would be \nyears from now. But we actually had a balanced budget during the \nClinton-Gore administration. Not a single Republican voted for it. \nDemocrats voted for it, and we balanced the budget. We created a \nsurplus. We started paying down the national debt, and created 24 \nmillion new jobs. Let's go back to those days. Forget the sloganeering. \nForget the bumper sticker solutions. If things were that easy, it would \nhave been done long before now. Start going back to doing what we are \nelected to do, what we are paid to do, and also what we are expected to \ndo. Seek a solution, not a gimmick; not a deal, a solution that \nbenefits all Americans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4898-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET COMPROMISE\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I don't need to tell anybody in this \nChamber that our Nation is at a crossroads. We are at a crossroads. We \nhave said for many months that we would be at this point, and now we \nare here. For months, we have said we will need to make tough choices \nand difficult decisions, and now we are at that very point when we need \nto make those tough choices and difficult decisions to rein in the debt \nand the deficit, and to put our fiscal house in order, even as we raise \nthe debt ceiling.\n  This decision is difficult, tough, and excruciating for us. But it is \nhardly different than what American families are doing all around this \ncountry, and in Connecticut, because I have seen them and I have heard \nfrom them. So have you in this Chamber--families who are struggling to \nmake ends meet, to stay in their homes, to keep their families \ntogether, to make those cuts in their spending, which we are now \nrequired to do in this Chamber for the Nation.\n  It is a historic responsibility. We cannot keep kicking the can down \nthe road. That is the analogy that has been drawn countless times in \nthis Chamber, around the country, and by the President of the United \nStates himself. The point is that the time for action is now--not delay \nor indecision, but real action that achieves a credible solution, which \nwill demand compromise.\n  Compromise is the essence of the American Republic. It is the way our \nNation was founded--through compromise, people coming together, \nbringing differences to the table and resolving them. Families in \nConnecticut and all across the country are making these kinds of \nchoices every day when they buy a car, a house, decide to go to school, \nand even marriage requires compromise. Compromise is the essence of the \nAmerican Republic and the way we do business in this Chamber, in this \ncity, in State capitals around the country, and in places of business \nand all places where momentous decisions are made.\n  The American people expect nothing less of us than they do of \nthemselves. There is no avoiding these tough choices and compromises \nnow that will help us get our debt and deficit under control in a \nmeaningful way.\n  The markets and the Nation need a real plan, not a short-term or \nstopgap effort. We must demonstrate that we are committed to finding a \nreal solution. A short-term plan would not provide the kind of \ncertainty and reliability the markets are desperately seeking at this \npoint. A short-term or stopgap solution risks many of the same dire \neconomic consequences that would be triggered by a default itself.\n  A financial Armageddon now, a catastrophic failure to raise the debt \nceiling now, is exactly the same risk 6 months from now if we attempt \nto address our present issues through a short-term, stopgap measure. \nThat financial Armageddon will affect every American family, every \nAmerican small business, every American worker, and every job seeker. \nIt is about jobs and economic recovery, because a failure to raise the \ndebt ceiling will increase the cost of borrowing for every homeowner, \nevery car buyer, every small business, and every person who has a \ncredit card or otherwise seeks capital or credit in the market. By \nraising the cost of borrowing, it will simply crush our fragile \neconomic recovery. It will be a job killer for this Nation. It is time \nnow for compromise that will avoid those dire consequences for the \nAmerican people.\n  The Reid proposal is a compromise in the best sense of the term. It \nis a solution that meets all the criteria our Republican friends have \nbeen insisting on for weeks. It does not include revenue increases. It \nincludes enough spending cuts to meet the amount of debt ceiling \nincrease, dollar for dollar. It includes spending cuts that have been \napproved by many Republicans. Many of those spending cuts have been \nvoted for.\n  Most important, from my standpoint, and from the standpoint of many \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle, it does not make spending cuts on \nthe backs of our seniors and our most vulnerable citizens. It avoids \nspending cuts to Medicare and Social Security that would imperil or \ndiminish the benefits of those programs.\n  Let me tell you about this compromise, the Reid proposal. It is not \ntransformational. It is not a grand bargain. It is incremental. It \nachieves progress step by step by step--the way progress has been made \nin this great Nation from its founding--step by step by step. It \nrepresents, as perhaps one of the columnists might have described it--\nin fact, this morning in the New York Times, David Brooks said there \nhas been an outbreak of sanity. This proposal represents an outbreak of \nsanity in roiled waters of emotionalism, personality conflicts, \npolitical acrimony.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will join us in seeking and ensuring \nstability for the markets and our fragile economic recovery, focusing \non what concerns the American people now, and should, which is job \ngrowth. It is about jobs. We should get on with that historic path of \ncreating jobs and enabling small businesses to borrow at rates they can \nafford, without hiking those interest rates as a result of a financial \ncrisis that is truly avoidable. Failure would be the result of our own \ndoing and our own failure in this Chamber.\n  We need to keep our economy moving in the right direction. I am \nhopeful, even confident, that we can come together with good will on \nboth sides to overcome our differences and achieve that compromise that \nthe Reid proposal represents.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the President. In making these remarks, I wish \nto emphasize that I am not trying to be presumptuous or disrespectful \nin any way to the Office of the Presidency or to the President \npersonally. I wish to make that very clear. It is just that I am trying \nto think of an allegory to try to get my point across, and it\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\nseemed to me this might be the way to do it.\n  We have our national unemployment rate at its highest level all year. \nWe have the debt ceiling rapidly approaching the crisis everybody is \ntalking about, and one would think we could do everything we could to \nsupport those industries very critical for job creation and economic \ndevelopment. There is one industry I am referring to in particular; \nthat is, general aviation, and I was trying to think, how could I get \nmy point across.\n  Since we had Speaker Boehner, Leader McConnell, and the distinguished \nmajority leader Senator Reid conducting the very best they can to get a \nsolution, perhaps the President, although his time is very valuable, \ncould talk to somebody such as me, a ranking member of a committee, \nvery worried about what is happening with our country, very worried \nabout what we can do to get this debt ceiling fixed and we can get a \nlong-term solution with regard to our entitlement programs. Perhaps he \ncould actually invite me down maybe later--a lot later, certainly no \ncameras--in regard to a little basketball game of horse because \neverybody knows the President is a very good basketball player, as a \nmatter of fact an extremely good basketball player. I am not going to \nmake that claim, but there was a day on blind-side picks and a few \nother things I could do.\n  But I would emphasize to the President, bouncing the ball to him just \non a bounce pass, and say: Your ball, Mr. President. The ball is in \nyour court. I would like to emphasize, while we are playing, that \nbasically he shouldn't be more concerned with increasing the debt \nceiling past the 2012 elections than working on a long-term solution \nfor solving the crisis. That would just be a suggestion. He would \nprobably go to the left corner and sink a three about that time. I \nwould want to emphasize to the President that he is singling out and he \nseems to be fixated on one specific industry that affects me and other \nspecific industries as well, and I don't know how we pick and choose \nwho should pay more taxes, who should pay more in terms of sacrifice, \nin terms of picking and choosing industries.\n  But at any rate, I would tell the President when I had the ball--I \nwould probably be dribbling a lot or trying to, if he wasn't playing \ntough defense--and I would say: Mr. President, since negotiations \nstarted last month on raising the debt limit, you have, on multiple \noccasions over and over again, singled out the general aviation \nindustry as an example of big business that serves only the wealthy and \nshould contribute more to lowering the deficit. The only problem with \nthis claim is it is not real, it is not factual, it is not correct. \nConsequently, I don't know whether it is in his head or maybe the \nwriters who write that valuable information for him that general \naviation only serves millionaires and billionaires. Then, after I shot \nand missed it, I would say: Your ball again, Mr. President. I would say \nas he was trying to drive around me, rather successfully: The truth is, \nthese aircraft actually serve as an essential business tool for a \nmultitude of businesses of all shapes, all sizes, farmers, ranchers, \nmanufacturers, business men and women, to access multiple offices and \nfacilities that are spread across this great Nation. These folks are \nnot fat cats. I would like the President to understand that managers \nand sales teams and technical experts, those are the people we are \ntalking about who are in that corporate aircraft to be sure, but it is \ngeneral aviation that serves the general public's welfare. They are \noften required to visit numerous offices in a short amount of time in \nregions of the United States that aren't served by large airports.\n  By that time, the President has scored a couple layups and two more \njump shots and I have yet to hit a shot. But I will persevere. I would \nsay to him as we were playing there on the court: Mr. President, in \nfact, 90 percent of our country's airports aren't even accessible by \ncommercial aircraft--certainly, the Presiding Officer knows that--and I \nthink they represent just those plain folks you have been talking \nabout, just the folks who are in the middle, just the folks who are \nhaving a tough time, just the folks who have been laid off.\n  Then we have a paradox of enormous irony where, in the stimulus bill, \nthere was a tax incentive for general aviation that helped some of \nthose folks get those jobs back and it is that which you are attacking, \nwhich is your own suggestion or at least that of the majority in the \nSenate.\n  General aviation employs 1.2 million workers and annually contributes \n$150 billion to the U.S. economy. That is a mouthful. By that time, the \nPresident has probably stolen the ball and scored another layup. \nPlaying horse, we have five. I would probably ask him to play 10 or \nspot me 10.\n  Just last year, I would point out to the President, general aviation \ndelivered 1,334 aircraft valued at over $7.9 billion, over half \nattributed to exports, and that is what the President wants to achieve \nin his trade policy. I would tell him: Sir, your goal is doubling U.S. \nexports over the next 5 years. You don't do it by calling general \naviation fat cats and singling out that industry for political blame.\n  Let's talk about tough times and tough going. Similar to every other \nbusiness sector, general aviation has struggled during the recession. \nAt that particular time, I would claim the President fouled me with a \nsharp elbow and I would take a free shot and I would say: Wait a \nminute. Unfortunately, this has resulted in layoffs among many high-\nskilled, high-paying jobs in this industry, and that is a two-shot \nfoul, by the way, so I have a little time. I would say: To help offset \nthese job losses and incentivize the purchase of these aircraft, \nDemocratic Members included a provision in the infamous stimulus bill \nto accelerate the depreciation schedules for a wide range of capital \ninvestments.\n  In Kansas, for Cessna Aircraft, accelerated depreciation was a key \nfactor for Cessna and its suppliers being able to retain 1,000 jobs. \nJobs held by folks whom I would tell the President are not fat cats. \nAgain, they are just folks. They are doing the job to produce a product \nin the United States that we are very proud of, and we certainly don't \nwant them to go to Mexico or to go to Canada. Some have already left.\n  So it came as a pretty big shock that you, Mr. President--and I am \nstill on my second shot on the free shot. He is now asking me to quit \ntalking and start shooting. But I would say: It comes as a pretty big \nshock to those workers that yourself and the Democratic Members in both \nChambers would direct an attack on this industry.\n  This is true. I don't know how many Members of the Senate--not too \nmany but, my word, I don't know how many Members of the House have \nheard that--corporate jet. Corporate jet. It has a ring to it, I guess. \nBut at any rate, why would you repeal a tax provision that has \ncontributed to job creation at a time of severe economic downturn; in \nfact, the one you actually suggested.\n  But there is more. There is more, Mr. President. Your ball. On top of \nthis, budget negotiators are considering implementing user fees on \ngeneral aviation as a way to generate revenue. We have been down that \nroad. Let me be very clear. If user fees on general aviation are \nimplemented, we could very well see the beginning of the end of this \nvery critical industry.\n  With all that is going on--and I hate to remind you of this. By the \nway, I just scored a hook shot, Mr. President. It wasn't very pretty, \nbut it rolled in. So it is about eight to one, something like that. At \nany rate, I am coming back.\n  When you mention corporate jets six times in two paragraphs in one \nspeech and that is repeated on the various pundit shows on TV over and \nover again as a fat cat industry, that is most unfortunate.\n  I think we need to get serious about spending. I have thought so for \nsome time, and I think every Member here does as well. We have our \ndifferent ideas on how to do it. But I also believe it makes sense to \nconsider those provisions that would actually have a measurable impact \non reducing our more than $14 trillion national debt.\n  I would ask as I bounce the ball back to the President and he heads \nfor that left-hand shot in the corner again and I am hustling to try to \nkeep up, I would ask: Do you have any idea, if you just taxed all \ngeneral aviation, what that would amount to? Just changing\n\n[[Page S4900]]\n\nthese schedules, these depreciation schedules for corporate jets; i.e., \ngeneral aviation only contributes $3 billion over 10 years. We borrow \naround $40 billion every 10 days. Repealing this tax provision would \nclose our national budget deficit for 1 hour--1 hour--1 hour in terms \nof a measurable effect. Yet we still pick on general aviation, calling \nthem all fat cats.\n  Sadly, this isn't the first time we have seen this happen; that the \nCongress of the United States, a different President has singled out \ngeneral aviation. In the 1990 budget deal, the majority created a new \nluxury excise tax that applied to boats and aircraft. The tax was \nrepealed in 1993. Because, as the Democratic-controlled Senate Finance \nCommittee report explained, during the recent recession the boat and \naircraft industries have suffered job losses, increased unemployment. I \nguess those are plain folks, they qualify, not fat cats. It said:\n\n       The committee believes it is appropriate to eliminate the \n     burden these taxes impose in the interests of fostering \n     economic recovery in those and related industries.\n\n  That is a lot of words, especially when you are out playing horse in \nweather that is pretty hot. Today--maybe it is better today so maybe it \nwould be a better deal. I couldn't agree more with that. We have been \ndown this road before. I think it is unfortunate.\n  Last, before I watch him make his last shot and I go down to the T, \nat least on the court I hope I would have made my argument to the \nPresident that singling out general aviation as ``fat cats'' is simply \nnot accurate, it is class warfare. That is a little tough. Maybe I \nwouldn't say that on the court, maybe sort of nudge him a little bit \nwhen I got underneath the bucket.\n  At any rate, it is going to take courage to put this country's fiscal \nhouse back in order. There is no question about that. But it is \nabsolutely essential for us to do it in a responsible manner and not by \nscapegoating, not by singling out important sectors of industry that \nhave long played a vital role in the economic development of both my \nhome State of Kansas and our country as a whole. I would simply say: \nYour ball, your game, Mr. President, but let's not single out general \naviation anymore.\n  It might have been the case if he were on a corporate jet with Kobe \nBryant or somebody, maybe a Hollywood actor, maybe going to a \nfundraiser, maybe he got it in his head everybody who has a corporate \njet, i.e., general aviation, as opposed to going from Kansas to North \nDakota to check on some farm ground, that that is the case. I hope that \nis not the case anymore.\n  That is the end of the ball game but it is not the end of the debate. \nI hope we have a debate without singling out an industry. That is \nunfair and not accurate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed as in morning business for about 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4900-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4900-S4903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ECONOMIC STEWARDSHIP\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, this is a dangerous time for our country. \nWhat amazes me, for the time I have been here and privileged to serve \nthe citizens of Massachusetts for 27 years now, is that never have I \nseen a moment where the consequences of inaction can have as \npotentially damaging an effect on our country as the consequences may \nif we are downgraded in our debt--just downgraded, not even \ndefaulting--yet some of our colleagues in the Congress, particularly on \nthe other side of the aisle in the House, are, despite all the \nevidence, all of the judgments made by knowledgeable people--by \neconomists, by business people, by outside observers, about the danger \nand inadequacy of what they are proposing--despite that, they are \ninsisting, not as a matter of common sense or as a matter of logical \neconomic policy but insisting as a matter of politics and ideology on \nholding the entire economy of our country hostage and be damned with \nthe risks.\n  Notwithstanding what that may mean--for 401(k)s, for families, what \nthat may mean for investments that are on the brink because of the \nfragility of the economy, notwithstanding any of the advice of people \nwho deal with money on a daily basis in terms of investments, these \npeople, many of them who have never served in public life in their \nlives, never been part of a compromise but have come here with one \nideological purpose--these people are putting the entire Nation at \nrisk.\n  There are a lot of people here, particularly here in the Senate on \nthe other side of the aisle, who know this is dangerous and who know \nthe risks we are taking and who know there are better alternatives. But \nbecause of the politics of the situation they are being locked in, not \nallowed to stand up and exercise--or at least unwilling at this point \nto stand up and exercise their judgment and, frankly, their \nresponsibility as sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States \nof America, to come here and do the business of our country.\n  The deadline for default may be just a week away but no one should \nhave any illusion that what is happening right now today is already \nhurting the economy of our country. It is already hurting our country. \nThis is embarrassing for the Nation. It is embarrassing for the United \nStates of America to be having such a dysfunctional display for \neverybody in the world to see that we who run around the world \npromoting democracy are unable to make our own democracy work right \nhere at home. The fact is, all you have to do is read today's article \nin the Boston Globe with the headline ``Uncertainty Has Massachusetts \nFirms Wary Of Hiring.''\n  That is what is happening right now. This is already having a \nnegative impact. Maybe that is what some of the people on the other \nside of the aisle in the House want. Maybe they want the economy to \ncome down so they can win politically and point to the President and \nsay: Oh, it is his fault we don't have the jobs, even though they are \nweakening the economy with their obstinacy and with their ideological \nrigidity.\n  Today's article says:\n\n       Still cautious from the last recession, many business \n     owners worry that government leaders will be unable to reach \n     an agreement, while others are concerned about exactly the \n     opposite: that any agreement will invariably include spending \n     cuts and weaken an already lackluster recovery.\n\n  This is no way to provide economic stewardship. Most important, it is \nno way to run a government. There are countless institutions that rely \non the United States, for us to go out and help other nations to be \nable to recover economically. I met yesterday with the Finance Minister \nand Deputy Prime Minister of Greece. Greece is taking enormous steps \nright now to try to bring its debt down and all of the euro zone has \njoined in that effort, and Italy and Spain are likewise at risk in \ntheir economies. But the IMF is a critical component of that recovery \nand the United States is a critical component of the IMF efforts and we \nhave a significant amount of our capital at risk in the IMF. What \nhappens there is important to what happens here, but this place is not \nbehaving as though there is that interconnectedness. Let me tell you \nwhat I hear from a lot of smart people--smarter than I am--about the \neconomics. I can listen to them, and I can tell they are deadly serious \nwhen they say we are playing with fire with respect to the Greek \nrecovery and with respect to Italy and Spain and the rest of Europe. If \nthey start to go down, then we have a cascade, and it begins to have a \ngreater impact on the United States of America. That is what is at risk \nin this dangerous game of political chicken that is being played by \npeople of such ideological rigidity that they are unwilling to even \ncompromise.\n\n  I heard an interview yesterday with one Senator and a television \ncommentator of one of the cable shows who asked him repeatedly: What \nare you willing to compromise on? In the end, it became clear he was \nnot willing to\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\ncompromise on the fundamental notions of how we arrive at an agreement. \nWe need to reach out across the aisle--both of us, Democrat, \nRepublican--and come together on a deal, on a solution to a critical \nproblem that challenges all of us where there is a solution staring us \nin the face. We need to do that before, as a result of the inability of \npeople to make that compromise, before those who take that position of \nideological rigidity do greater harm to our economy and to our \ncountry's reputation. We need to put an end to the time clocks that are \nrunning out how long it is before a default which sends an enormous \nmessage of uncertainty and incompetence, of dysfunctional politics on a \ndaily basis. Every tick of that clock drums into people the inadequacy \nof what is happening here right now.\n  Back in 1983, President Ronald Reagan, whom many of the people who \nare taking this position of complete obstinacy revere--they ought to \nlisten to what he said because President Reagan wrote:\n\n       The denigration of the full faith and credit of the United \n     States would have substantial effects on the domestic \n     financial markets and on the value of the dollar on the \n     exchange markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such a \n     result.\n\n  Now almost 30 years later some House Republicans have turned their \nback on the legacy of Ronald Reagan. Instead, they continue to play \nthis cynical game of chicken with the President, with the Congress, \nwith the American people, with our economy, with our reputation, with \nour future, by refusing to negotiate a clearly achievable, clearly \ndefinable compromise agreement that would extend the debt limit, \nsomething that happened 17 times under Ronald Reagan. What is their \nnegotiating strategy? Don't negotiate. Do what we say no matter what \nthe danger or how ill thought-out the consequences may be.\n  David Stockman, the former Office and Management Director under \nPresident Reagan, said the following about the House Republican budget:\n\n       I think the biggest problem is revenues. It is simply \n     unrealistic to say that raising revenue isn't part of the \n     solution. It is a measure of how far off the deep end \n     Republicans have gone with this religious catechism about \n     taxes.\n\n  In taking this extreme approach, the House Republicans have also made \na dirty word out of a basic tenet of American democracy--compromise. Do \nthey know nothing about history? Have they forgotten about the Missouri \nCompromise? Have they forgotten about countless great compromises that \nbrought people together to pass some of the great efforts of our Nation \nwith respect to the social structure of our country? The House \nRepublican Party has taken this approach, even though they know and \nagree with what Ronald Reagan said 30 years ago, and they know it is \ntrue today.\n  Experts are telling us that even a short-term crisis could lead to a \npermanent downgrading or stain, if you will, on the Treasurys of our \ncountry. It could prove particularly damaging to the willingness of \nforeign investors to buy Treasury. If foreign investors start to shy \naway from Treasurys, then they will become much less liquid. As Lou \nCrandall, who is the chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, said:\n\n       You could never get that liquidity premium back if you \n     create a precedent. That's the thing that would be \n     irreparable. The end result of such a scenario: higher \n     interest rates in the United States.\n\n  I just met a few moments ago with a businessman who is engaged in \nmajor investments in this country and elsewhere, on an international \nbasis, who reinforced to me the danger of what we are facing right now \nin just the downgrade. What he said to me is that nobody can tell us \nwhat the real impact of that downgrade is going to be. What happens to \nvaluations all the way down the economic food chain? What happens to \ncredit? What happens to the judgments about interest? What happens to \nthe judgments about the auctions and the next market and so forth? \nNobody knows. He can't tell me, and he does this for a living and has \nvery successfully for a lifetime. That is what they are worried about.\n  There is a moment--nobody knows when exactly it is--there is a moment \nwhen as we get close enough and the dysfunctionality becomes the \noverwhelming, dominating feature of this effort, where someone is going \nto cut and say: OK, time to downgrade. Then what happens? What kind of \ndownward spiral flows out of that? I don't know, but I know we should \nnot be pushing it to the limit and taking that risk.\n  Why are people taking that risk? Why are people, despite all the \ncommentary that says we ought to be reaching across the aisle, we ought \nto sit down the way we used to around here, why are they doing this? I \nwill tell you why. They want only one way of approaching this \nsolution--their way. They want to so dramatically cut Federal spending \nand cut entitlements without increasing revenues at all. No matter how \nsuccessful people have been at the upper end of our economy, no matter \nhow much money people have made, they say we can't even ask a \nbillionaire for $100. We can't even ask a billionaire for $500. \nNothing, nada, no. That is it. That is the reason they are willing to \ntake the country to the brink. They know they do not have enough votes \nto even pass the budget they are screaming about still, but they are \nnot running around trying to find the alternative. They are going to \npush it anyway, have a vote on it anyway, send a dramatic, stupid \nmessage of incompetence to the world and drag the United States of \nAmerica down with it.\n  It is stunning what a group of extremists can do who are trying to \nget their unrealistic and impossible budget passed, which even a lot of \nRepublicans know they are not going to vote for. The Boehner plan would \nrequire Draconian entitlement policy changes. To meet the $1.8 trillion \nin cuts over the decade without any increase in revenues, policymakers \nwould be forced to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits, and that \nis not a scare tactic. That is an absolute reality of what would have \nto happen if we proceed to do those cuts the way they are structuring \nthem, and we would eviscerate the safety net for low-income children, \nfor parents, for senior citizens, and for people with disabilities.\n  One of the worst and most disturbing components of this plan, the \nBoehner plan--it is incomprehensible to me--they want to do this whole \nthing all over again in 6 months. There is no economic reason we have \nto do it again in 6 months because they purposely left out the money \nthat could come from reducing our engagement in the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, which is going to come. They purposely left that money out \nso it wouldn't show the amount of savings that could get us through \nnext November. The reason they purposely left it out is so they can \ncome back and do this same exercise again next February and make all \nthe discussion in America about debt and deficit, when we are perfectly \nprepared to have a serious discussion not about raising the debt on it \nbut about solving it, about doing it. We don't need a constitutional \namendment to do our duty. We don't need a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I know what I am talking about on that because I \nwas here when we balanced the budget in the 1990s without a \nconstitutional amendment. We balanced the budget five times since World \nWar II, and we have done it each time without a constitutional \namendment.\n  Let's not have this phony structured setup that is pure politics. I \nam sure they are raising a lot of money from their base on it every \nsingle day, but that is not what this ought to be about. This ought to \nbe about solving the economic problems of our country. A short-term \nplan is not necessary and it is, most importantly, not wise. If we go \nthrough this exercise again in 6 months in the same way we have gone \nthrough it in the last few months, we are going to drive this economy \nright down and down.\n  Maybe that is what they want so they can then blame President Obama \nand turn around and blame the Democrats who are responsible in the \nSenate. There is no other rationale for wanting to come back and do \nthis in 6 months, when we could do this with the joint committees that \nare in both the Boehner plan and in Senator Reid's plan. We have the \nability to set up a structure, similar to the BRAC closing commissions, \nwhere we have to vote, where we are forced to do this on an accelerated \nbasis, where we tie ourselves into a process that requires the Senate \nto do its duty and the Congress to do its duty. We can lock that in \nright now. We are not kicking anything\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\ndown the road if we do that and require us not to have a balanced \nbudget amendment that goes out all across the country for States to \nhave to ratify but, rather, do the job we were sent to do and do it in \nthe next few months. That is what we could be doing. If we don't do \nthat, then the downgrade that may take place somewhere in the next days \ncould drive up interest rates, and that will have a negative drag on \nthe economy to boot. A student with a student loan will feel that \nimpact. Somebody with a car loan is going to feel that impact. Anybody \nwith a credit card is going to feel that impact. People with mortgages \nwill feel that impact. That will mean more money out of pocket to make \nup for the dereliction of duty of the Congress.\n  These are completely dangerous and uncharted waters we are sailing \ninto. I think at a time when the global economy is facing enormous \nproblems, any downgrade of our Nation's credit rating could have \ndisastrous effects for our financial system in terms of those other \ncountries which I have talked about, and I think it is an unacceptable \nrisk. It should require us to find the compromise and find it now. I \nmight add that the Boehner plan is not even supported on Wall Street.\n  Let me quote Christian Cooper, who is the head of the U.S. dollar \nderivatives trading in New York at Jefferies & Company. He said:\n\n       From the markets' point of view, a two-stage plan is a \n     nonstarter because we know it is amateur hour on Capitol Hill \n     and we don't want to be painted into this corner again.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       There is significant risk of a downgrade with a deal that \n     ties further cuts to another vote only a few months down the \n     road given the significant resistance to do the right thing \n     now.\n\n  Frankly, I think that is logical. Every American can understand that. \nIf a person has some money to invest and they are sitting there \nwatching what is happening right now, and then they learn our way of \ndealing with it is going to be to have another vote in 6 months for the \nsame reason--to lift the debt ceiling--when everybody knows we don't \nhave to do that, would that person say, oh, that is a really good, \nclear climate for investment; let's go put our money into whatever it \nis out there because we know Congress is going to do the right thing? \nNo. No way, I say to my colleagues. Everybody knows that.\n\n  The fact is, the President has said he is going to veto the Speaker's \nplan. Senators know he is going to veto it. We know it is a bad plan. \nWe ought to stop discussing proposals that are going to go nowhere and \nget the job done on something that can bring everybody together.\n  In an effort to forge a bipartisan compromise, Senator Reid has \nreached way beyond what many Members of our caucus really wanted to do \nor think is the appropriate balance. But we are acting responsibly in \norder to try to get the job done. So we are willing to extend the debt \nceiling through 2012 without revenues at this time, with the \nunderstanding that we will have the ability to come back to the floor \nwith the process of a joint committee providing it is tied to a very \nclear schedule, with very clear requirements about no filibusters, with \nvery clear requirements about amendments and voting.\n  Madam President, the spending cuts in Senator Reid's proposal are \nonly those to which Republicans have previously agreed. So no revenues, \ncuts of $2-some trillion, we go through the year to give certainty to \nthe marketplace, and we have cuts in there that the Republicans have \nalready agreed to, and, again, a fixed period of time. I think that \nproposal gives our economy the certainty it needs in order to create \njobs now, not 6 months from now and not maybe sometime next year.\n  Everybody understands how anemic America's job creation is now. The \nlast the job market needs is this kind of brinkmanship, gamesmanship, \nand cynical effort to hold the entire economy of our country hostage \nwhen better proposals are actually on the table and in front of us \nwhich everybody can understand.\n  The majority leader's proposal includes the capacity for that joint \ncommittee to include recommendations and legislative language on tax \nreform. We all know we need tax reform. I believe the Senate and the \nHouse ought to do their jobs, both of us. Senator Reid's plan actually \ncalls on the Senate to live up to its ultimate responsibility. The \nSpeaker's plan has no such language--nothing that requires that kind of \nparticipation.\n  The deficit commission was chaired by former Republican Senator Alan \nSimpson. All of that work is being ignored right now. The so-called \nGang of 6 did an outstanding job, in my judgment, of helping to put \ntogether a bipartisan plan which actually included revenue and I think \n20-some Republican Senators were prepared to support a thoughtful, \nbalanced plan that had both revenues as well as cuts. So we can find \ncommon ground. We need to find that common ground.\n  Over the last year, we have seen a number of bipartisan plans put \nforward on the debt limit. I think the effort of the Gang of 6 \nexemplified the best tradition of the Senate, where a group of Members \nreached across the aisle and worked with each other to tackle the tough \nissues. That is how we got a budget deal in 1990. That is how we got a \nbudget deal in 1997. We have done this before, and we did it growing \nour economy--creating 23 million new jobs and creating a surplus of \n$5.6 trillion. Had we stayed on that course, we would next year be \npaying down the debt of our Nation completely for the first time since \nAndrew Jackson was President of the United States. Everybody here knows \nwhy we went off track. I don't mean to go through that again now, but I \nthink we will not be able to resolve this current impasse until \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle--and especially in the House \nwhere there seems to be the greatest ideological resistance to common \nsense right now--decide to put aside their ideology and decide what is \nbest for the United States of America.\n  We can't be responsible if we don't get serious first. Far too much \nis at stake for the Senate to do anything less than the Senate was \nintended to do at moments such as this. We are called the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. There aren't many Americans who would look \nat us right now and give us that appropriate moniker. We have to earn \nit. I think in the next hours we can do that.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues for their forbearance.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, may I inquire as to how much time I have \nallotted?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business \nwith Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair. I doubt I will do this, but if I get \nup to 8 minutes, if the Chair would let me know so I will have 2 \nminutes to wrap up.\n  The last time I was on the floor was July 14, and I was very \nconcerned--maybe upset--about the fact that it appeared where we were \non this debt ceiling discussion was looking for a political way for \neverybody to raise the debt ceiling without anybody taking ownership. \nObviously, that wasn't what I came to the Senate to do. I came down and \nhad choice words for both sides of the aisle in that regard.\n  I actually come here today with a glimmer of hope. The reason I say \nthat is, to my knowledge, in this debt ceiling debate we may be--I \nthink this is the first time legislation has actually been offered from \nboth sides of the aisle to look at spending reductions over the course \nof this next year. To me, that is progress. I think we ought to focus \non the fact that, finally, here in this body, we are on the right \nsubject. We sort of wandered around in the wilderness for several weeks \nas this debt ceiling was coming up and focused on many things that were \nnot going to solve the problem. Then, a couple of weeks ago, we focused \non trying to figure out a way for us to all usurp--get rid of--our \nresponsibilities in dealing with this.\n  I am kind of uplifted because, as was mentioned, a Democratic Senator \nhas a proposal, a Republican House Member has a proposal, and now, \nfinally, we are on the topic that matters; that is, we have proposals \nbefore us that are beginning to look at what we might do to look at \nspending reductions.\n  The fact is, the reason this debt ceiling debate is what it is is \nbecause all of\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\nus are concerned about future deficits. All of us are concerned about \nwhere our country is going. All of us are concerned about the fact that \nif we don't deal with this issue responsibly, we are going to end up \nwith a downgrade in our debt regardless, even if we make it. If we had \na clean debt ceiling vote, which, obviously, is not going to occur \nnow--if we had a clean debt ceiling vote, we would be right back at the \ntable trying to figure out a way to keep from having a downgrade. So \nfor what it is worth, I am choosing today to come to the floor and to \nbe slightly optimistic because both sides of the aisle are beginning to \nlook at ways of reducing that issue.\n  As to the rating agencies, actually we don't put a lot of faith in \nthem, I know, but smart people who actually buy Treasurys have said the \norder of magnitude that we need to deal with as it relates to deficit \nspending over the next short period of time is a minimum of $4 \ntrillion, and that $4 trillion has to be real, and that $4 trillion \nneeds to be accompanied by entitlement reforms.\n  What I would say is, right now, I don't think there is any proposal \nthat is being discussed that is strong enough, and I don't say that to \nknock any of the authors. There is nothing out there that I am aware of \nthat is being discussed by the media or being discussed in either \nChamber that really deals with this issue. Most of us have taken \nthe position that we want to use the debt ceiling vote to force \ndramatic reductions in deficits, dramatic reductions in spending and, \nfortunately, we have gotten to that place, finally. We have just gotten \nthere in the last 24 hours.\n\n  So this is my hope: We know none of the proposals out there now are \nstrong enough. None of the proposals out there--I am talking about in \nlegislative language. There are a lot of people working in other ways \nto try to come up with a solution, but there is no legislative language \nout there yet that actually forces us to do the things we need to do to \nachieve not being downgraded, if you will, after this debt ceiling vote \noccurs.\n  So it appears we are going to be voting on a proposal the majority \nleader has offered. It is very apparent to me it is not going to pass. \nI know there are some activities that may be taking place in the House \nover the next 24 hours, but at least we have both sides of the aisle \ntalking about the right topic, finally. It has taken us a while to get \nhere.\n  I urge us to sit down and figure out a way to make the proposals that \nare being discussed real--make sure they don't have gimmicks--and that \nthey force us to do those things we need to do to make sure we don't \njust kick the can down the road and pass something that looks like we \nhave actually taken action, but to pass something instead that actually \nwill address the issues we have before us.\n  So, again, I have a glimmer of hope. Both sides of the aisle have \noffered proposals. No doubt in both cases they are not nearly strong \nenough, but both sides have offered proposals that look at reducing the \ndeficits over the next year or so. So I urge people to sit down--as \nMembers have done recently on other proposals, let's sit down and \nfigure out a way to make some proposal strong enough so we know that \nnot only have we moved past this debt ceiling vote, but we have also \nput in place those actions that will cause us to make it through this \nentire next year, in a way that we know we are not going to be \ndowngraded by the credit rating agencies and have other issues.\n  There is not a proposal before us today that does it, but both sides \nof the aisle are talking about proposals. That, to me, is a sign for a \ndegree of optimism. If we need to extend the debt ceiling issue for a \nweek while we work out the details or whatever, let's do it. But let's \ndon't let this opportunity where we finally have both sides of the \naisle talking about the right subject, let's don't let this opportunity \ngo by. Let's solve this problem while the focus is on it.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to take to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet).

I thank the majority leader, and I appreciate his \ncourtesy, as always, in so many issues that come before the Senate.\n  I wish to say a couple of things. One is fundamental, and that is \nthat the crisis we face--and I think my Senate colleague from Tennessee \nwould agree--is not the debt limit, it is the debt. It is the surging \ndebt. The debt limit is Congress's power, and it says to the \nadministration: You can't borrow any more money. We only authorize so \nmuch money to be borrowed. Like a 102-degree mark in our thermometer, \nit is not the thermometer that is the problem. It is the underlying \nfever that the thermometer indicates. So reaching the debt limit so \nsoon after we raised it is an indication we have something unhealthy in \nour system that needs to be dealt with.\n  Senator Reid has very difficult challenges before him. It is not \neasy. But as I like to remind him, he asked for the job and, hopefully, \nhe can make progress at this point in time.\n  But to raise the debt ceiling, the majority leader knows a couple of \nthings must be done. He knows, one, the Republican Congress and the \nAmerican people want to see changes in our spending. It is on a \nreckless path. We cannot continue on this path. So the idea is, \nshouldn't we change what we are doing that has put us in a situation in \nwhich 40 cents of every $1 we spend today is borrowed?\n  This year we will pay $240 billion in interest on our national debt. \nUnder the budget the President submitted to us--which was voted down, I \nwill acknowledge, 97 to 0 in the Senate; but it indicates the debt path \nwe are on--it would cause in the tenth year interest to be paid in 1 \nyear of $940 billion--a stunning figure. The Federal road program is \nabout $40 billion. Federal aid to education is about $100 billion. We \nwould be surging from $240 billion to $940 billion in interest on this \nrising debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office, our experts.\n  I would note also that President Bush's last year was an \nextraordinary deficit of $450 billion--but President Obama's deficits \nhave been $1,200 billion, $1,300 billion, and it is expected this year \nto be $1.5 trillion--$1,500 billion--in 1 year. These are the 3 years.\n  In the first 2 years of President Obama's administration, his \nnondefense discretionary spending surged 24 percent. This does not \ncount the stimulus of almost $900 billion that we sent out the door \nthat was supposed to stimulate the economy.\n  Speaker Boehner, and I think with the support of the American people, \nhas said: Well, we can do a long time. We can do a fairly large \nincrease in our debt ceiling to allow the country to continue to borrow \nor we can do a short one, but we in the House, in the Republican House, \nbelieve we have to confront our problems. So I would propose, and he \nhas stated, that the House would vote to raise the debt ceiling but \nonly to the extent to which spending has been reduced an equal amount.\n  If you reduce spending enough over 10 years, you get an immediate \nincrease in the debt ceiling of an equal amount now. If you reduce \nspending over 10 years a larger amount, you could increase the debt \nlimit a larger amount. It has become a vehicle, an opportunity for the \nAmerican people to understand how we are spiraling out of control, and \nhow it is Congress that needs to figure out a way to rein this in. It \nis unsustainable, the path we are on. So this $1 increase in the debt \nceiling for $1 reduction in spending kind of caught on. People seem to \nbe going along with that. It seems to be fairly reasonable.\n  Senator Reid claims he has a plan that would reduce spending $2.7 \ntrillion over 10 years and this would allow him to raise the debt \nceiling about that amount, and this would allow us to, in effect, raise \nit enough that we would not have to talk about this again for almost 2 \nyears--about 22 months.\n  Well, OK. That sort of seemed to meet what Speaker Boehner had \nsuggested. But I am the ranking member\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\nof the Budget Committee. I have been a real critic of what has been \ngoing on. I have been predicting we were going to end up at the last \nminute and a bill was going to be thrown on the floor, and I was \nconcerned it was going to be filled with gimmicks. It was not going to \nbe honest, and we were going to be told if we do not pass it, the \nRepublic is going to fall, and no matter what is in it, we have to pass \nit. And do not worry about it, trust us on these numbers.\n  Unfortunately, that is where we are getting. Senator Reid, in his \n$2.7 trillion in claimed deficit reduction--about $1.2 trillion of that \nis savings from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Well, that has not \never been projected to stay at the current level of $158 billion a year \nfor 10 years.\n  Speaker Boehner, when he proposes to reduce spending for a shorter \nterm, does not count savings from the declining war expenditure because \nthat is not a baseline expenditure and we have never extended and \nplanned to do that. We never planned to spend $158 billion a year in \nthe next 10 years. This is inevitably going to drop. Some say it could \ngo to zero, some say to $50 billion, saving $100 billion or a little \nmore a year for the next decade. So the Budget Committee Republican \nstaff calculates this is over $1 trillion in inaccurate estimations of \nspending reductions. It just is. It should not be counted. Speaker \nBoehner does not count it in his numbers.\n  Senator Reid also claims $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction from \nspending caps by capping discretionary spending. Well, those caps are \ncounted from a baseline that ignores the savings that were enacted in \nthe full year CR that we did the year we are in.\n  What happened was, we had a higher level of spending. There was an \nelection last fall. A new Republican House was elected--huge numbers of \npeople who were elected who said: We have to do something about \nspending. So we had a fuss over what our spending levels should be this \nyear because we were operating not under authorization of \nappropriations bills but a continuing resolution, and that number was \nreduced. So the spending level for this year now is not the same as it \nwas when the year began. The current level of spending is the number we \nought to be talking about when we say we are going to save money. \nCorrect? It should not be the number that was higher but has been \nabandoned and been reduced. That reduces the amount of legitimate \nclaims in discretionary savings to less than $800 billion. Then he \nclaims $100 billion in mandatory savings. But it is likely--from our \nstaff looking at them--it would amount to no more than $60 billion.\n  The bottom line is, we have looked at this a lot of different ways. I \nbelieve the numbers I am going to repeat to you today will be sustained \nin any competitive argument about it. I believe these are honest and \ntrue numbers. The bottom line is that the total real savings that are \nproposed by the Reid plan are not $2.7 trillion but $1 trillion. If you \ndo $1 trillion in savings, and you raise the debt limit by $1 trillion, \nthen that would extend to 6 or 8 months or so into early next year, \nwhich is, I suggest, where we ought to be. Because this amount of \nsavings--$1 trillion--is nowhere near what we need to do to get off the \ndebt course we are on.\n  As Senator Corker indicated, most of the financial experts tell us we \nneed at least $4 trillion in savings, not $1 trillion. So if we are \njust going to get $1 trillion so we can vote in this crisis period to \nraise the debt limit before August 2 so the checks can go out and \neverybody can be paid and the government can operate--and I hope we can \ndo that; we need to do that--but if all we are going to get is $1 \ntrillion, this is just an interim step. This is not a real fix at all, \nbut it is an interim step. If so, we need to be right back on this \nissue soon. That gives us an opportunity to do so early next year or \nlate this year because we have not solved the problem.\n  Mr. President, $1 trillion is not enough. Madam President, $4 \ntrillion is not enough. Depending on how you calculate the debt that \nhas been projected to accrue over the next 10 years, it is somewhere \nbetween $9 and $13 trillion. So $1 trillion is not going to do anything \nto change the disastrous debt course we are on.\n  By the way, the President--I want to say this because he was pretty \ntough last night blaming Republicans for all kinds of problems. Let me \nsay, the Republican House passed--and I voted for in the Senate--a \nbudget for 10 years that changes the debt course of this Republic. It \nputs us on a sound financial path. It reduced spending by as much as $6 \ntrillion over 10 years. It even reduced taxes to create more economic \ngrowth and make us more competitive in the world marketplace. It was a \nthoughtful, long-term, serious budget that would do real, positive \nthings for America.\n  The Senate has not passed a budget, not had one marked up in the \nBudget Committee. The leadership here in the Senate refused to allow it \nto happen. Senator Reid said it would be foolish to pass a budget. We \nhave gone now over 2 years without a budget. It is unthinkable in the \ndebt course we are on--how disastrous it is, how unsustainable it is, \nhow unlike anything that has ever happened in our history--to have this \nkind of debt path and we do not have a budget.\n  The President said a few weeks ago: Well, I have a plan that cuts $3 \ntrillion. Is it like Senator Reid's $2.7 trillion plan? It was never \nmade public. It was never spelled out. If he has a $3 trillion plan to \ncut spending, well, let's see it. Maybe we could extend the debt limit \nmore, if he is going to cut $3 trillion in honest numbers. If he has \nthose numbers, as he says he has--in between attacking Republicans for \ncausing all the problems--let's see them. Maybe that would be a basis \nfor something.\n  But I suspect it is no more accurate than this plan because when the \nPresident proposed his budget, as the law required him to do, early in \nthe year, he said: My budget calls on us as Americans to live within \nour means and to not increase the debt, when according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the lowest single budget deficit that \nwould occur under his 10-year budget would be $750 billion--nowhere \nclose to a balanced budget--and in the out years that deficit would be \ngoing up. So I will challenge the President, if he has a $3 trillion \nplan, let's see it.\n  Some people say we need to raise the debt limit for a longer period \nof time and we cannot afford to have a short term increase. They say \nthis is somehow a wrong thing to do, and so forth. I would point out to \nmy colleagues, it is not unusual at all. A $2.7 trillion increase in \nthe debt--if that were to occur--would be very high. It would be a 19-\npercent increase in the current debt limit, putting the debt limit 50-\npercent higher than when President Obama took office. It would be the \nlargest debt increase in history, the fourth debt limit increase during \nPresident Obama's tenure in office, the fourth time it has been raised. \nSo this is not unusual.\n\n  I warned from the beginning that if we skirted the legislative \nprocess in favor of closed-door White House meetings and so forth, we \nwould find ourselves in the eleventh hour with gimmick-filled \nlegislation being rushed through a panic-driven Senate. This is not \nresponsible governance from our leadership here in the Senate.\n  As I feared and as I have just described, the majority leader's bill \nhas not achieved close to the promised savings he says it would. From \nthe $2.7 trillion in cuts claimed, the troop-spending cuts in the \nproposal are closer to $1 trillion over 10 years--less than a third of \nwhat was advertised--while he is asking for a nearly $3 trillion \nincrease in the debt limit. Spending cuts next year would be only $3 \nbillion less than the enacted amount for 2011. This falls short of the \nidea that a dollar in cuts should accompany a dollar in debt limit \nincrease. Senator Reid's proposal is structured in a way that is \nclearly designed to further degrade and undermine the budgetary process \nof the Senate, and it allows the majority not to have to come forward \nand produce a budget plan.\n  Given the late hour, rather than rush through legislation to the \nPresident--the largest debt ceiling increase in history--we should \npursue a more responsible approach, a short-term extension with real \ncuts through the immediate time period the extension covers, not 10 \nyears down the road. Then, using the extra time we have, Congress \nshould pursue a binding framework, such as the cut, cap, and balance \nplan, to bring these gimmicks to an end and to alter\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\nour debt course. We should try the one thing we refused to do from the \nbeginning: open hearings, regular order, and a real legislative process \nand public participation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4905-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record an editorial from the July 21 edition of the Washington \nPost. I completely agree with this editorial.\n  The metric is not how many long overdue individual sanctions are \nmade. We must instead be focused on our goal: preventing the \nacquisition of a nuclear weapons capability by the Islamic Republic of \nIran.\n  I fear we are spiraling at an accelerating speed to the point when we \nhave but one option left to stop the Islamic Republic of Iran's illegal \nnuclear weapons ambitions. If that happens, history will judge that we \nwere put into this position by our own failure to avail ourselves of \nother options while we still had them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 21, 2011]\n\n            Sanctions Aren't Slowing Iran's Nuclear Progress\n\n       According to a recent story in The Post, the Obama \n     administration is ``quietly toasting'' the success of \n     international sanctions against Iran. The Islamic republic is \n     having increasing difficulty arranging imports, including \n     food, and the central bank is reportedly short of hard \n     currency. Billions of dollars in foreign investment projects \n     have been canceled, and few banks, insurance companies or \n     shipping firms are willing to do business with Tehran.\n       There are also signs of political stress. President Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad is bitterly at odds with conservative clergy and \n     a majority of parliament and appears to have lost the support \n     of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran's closest \n     ally, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, is slowly but \n     steadily losing ground to a popular uprising, raising the \n     prospect that Iran's once-firm foothold in the Arab Middle \n     East will be reduced to an isolated Hezbollah militia in \n     Lebanon.\n       We don't begrudge the White House a toast or two over these \n     developments; the administration has worked hard and \n     relatively effectively to make the sanctions work. But it's \n     important to note a stubborn reality: There has been no \n     change in Iran's drive for nuclear weapons or in its \n     aggressive efforts to drive the United States out of the \n     Middle East.\n       If anything, Tehran has recently grown bolder. Last month \n     it announced plans to triple its capacity to produce uranium \n     enriched to the level of 20 percent--a far higher degree of \n     processing than is needed to produce nuclear energy. Western \n     diplomats and experts say that Iran is preparing, and may \n     have already begun, to install a new generation of powerful \n     centrifuges in a plant built into a mountain near the city of \n     Qom. As British Foreign Secretary William Hague wrote in an \n     op-ed published by the Guardian last week, it would take only \n     two to three months to convert uranium enriched at Qom into \n     weapons-grade material. That means that Iran could have a \n     ``breakout'' capacity allowing it to quickly produce a weapon \n     when it chose to do so.\n       Mr. Hague told the British Parliament last month that Iran \n     also has been secretly testing medium-range missiles capable \n     of carrying a nuclear warhead. Britain believes there have \n     been three such tests since October. Meanwhile, Iranian-\n     backed militias have launched a new offensive against U.S. \n     forces in Iraq. According to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta \n     and other senior officials, Tehran has supplied sophisticated \n     rockets and roadside bombs for attacks on U.S. troops, 15 of \n     whom were killed during June.\n       Iran's ability to sustain its nuclear program and its \n     meddling in Iraq reflect the fact that these initiatives are \n     controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, which has not been \n     affected by the political feuding in Tehran and has first \n     claim on the oil revenue that Iran continues to reap. \n     Economic and political hardship also has had no apparent \n     impact on Mr. Khamenei, who has maintained the regime's \n     refusal even to negotiate with the U.N. Security Council, \n     much less obey its resolutions.\n       The bottom line is that the threat from Iran is not \n     diminishing but growing. Where is the policy to reverse that \n     alarming trend?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4905-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4905-S4906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DEFENSE CUTS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a piece from Politico by my colleagues in the House, \nChairman Forbes, Chairman Turner, Congressman Bishop, and Congressman \nConaway.\n  I fundamentally disagree with the President when he said in a recent \ninterview with NPR:\n\n       A lot of the spending cuts that we're making should be \n     around areas like defense spending as opposed to food stamps.\n\n  I wish the President would listen to the advice of Secretary Gates, \nwho said in his AEI speech this May:\n\n       I revisit this history because it leads to an important \n     point for the future: when it comes to our military \n     modernization accounts, the proverbial ``low hanging \n     fruit''--those weapons and other programs considered most \n     questionable--have not only been plucked, they have been \n     stomped on and crushed. What remains are much-needed \n     capabilities--relating to air superiority and mobility, long-\n     range strike, nuclear deterrence, maritime access, space and \n     cyber warfare, ground forces, intelligence, surveillance and \n     reconnaissance--that our nation's civilian and military \n     leadership deem absolutely critical.\n\n  My colleagues in the House are absolutely right when they wrote:\n\n       The time to draw a line in the sand, and go on the offense \n     to support national security must be now.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, July 25, 2011]\n\n                    On the Offense Over Defense Cuts\n\n (By Representatives J. Randy Forbes, Michael Turner, Rob Bishop, and \n                             Mike Conaway)\n\n       America's all-volunteer military is the most well-trained, \n     well-equipped fighting force the world has ever seen. But the \n     strength of our armed forces should not be taken for granted.\n       Without sustained investments in our troops and their \n     equipment, the military power our nation now wields in \n     defense of our security--including our economic security--\n     will slowly be hollowed out. The result is likely to be an \n     America that can go fewer places and do fewer things in \n     defense of its global interests.\n       While that may sound good to those who remain uncomfortable \n     with America's leadership role in the world, starving the \n     military will not make us any safer, given the global demands \n     on our security interests.\n       The U.S. military confronts readiness shortfalls and a \n     growing array of risks and security challenges. That is why I \n     am deeply concerned about the avalanche of military spending \n     cuts being discussed--from President Barack Obama's $400 \n     billion proposal to the Senate's Gang of Six proposal that \n     could cut up to $886 billion.\n       The time to draw a line in the sand, and go on the offense \n     to support national security must be now.\n       Let's be clear: Defense spending is not what put us in this \n     position, and gutting the defense budget to pay the bills is \n     unlikely to get us out of it. As a percentage of our gross \n     domestic product, the defense budget remains just 3.6 \n     percent. This figure is low by all historical standards.\n       Even if we start slashing major portions of the budget--say \n     $50 billion each year over the next decade--that figure would \n     still only add up to a fraction of the nation's debt. Yet the \n     additional risk to the nation could be substantial.\n       Today's military is worn out from a decade of operations \n     that have pushed already aging platforms to the edge. More \n     than half the Navy's deployed aircraft are not fully combat \n     ready, as we recently discovered at a House Armed Services \n     Readiness Subcommittee hearing, and approximately one in five \n     of our Navy ships are deemed unsatisfactory or mission \n     degraded.\n       With known shortfalls in the Navy maintenance accounts, the \n     Defense Department would be severely challenged to meet the \n     expected service life of its equipment. Even more concerning \n     are the assessments from our Combatant Commanders in the \n     unclassified portion of the Quarterly Readiness Report to \n     Congress. This paints a distressing picture of a military \n     stretched thin by nearly 10 years of war and a sustained lack \n     of resources.\n       Even as our forces have been aged rapidly by the high tempo \n     of operations in the past decade, the president has cancelled \n     a generation of weapons programs in just the last two years. \n     While much of the nation has smart phones and iPads, the Army \n     is still operating on an Atari-like system.\n       With readiness shortfalls and pressure to modernize aging \n     platforms, how can we pretend we can defend the country with \n     even more defense cuts? Our national defense planning must be \n     based on an open and objective review of the threats we face \n     and the resources required to meet them. Unfortunately, we \n     now have that process in reverse.\n       In many ways, it's like a family who is about to purchase a \n     new home. The correct course would be to have an inspector \n     look at the house and tell the family what the problems are \n     and what they will cost to fix. What if, instead, that family \n     told the inspector that they only had $1,000, and they wanted \n     the inspector to go through and identify only $1,000 worth of \n     problems to fix?\n       This is analogous to the way the Defense Department and the \n     Obama administration expect Congress to approach national \n     defense. They dictate how much we will spend on defense \n     without fully and objectively detailing the risks we face, or \n     the choices we must make.\n       This wouldn't be a sensible course for the new homeowners. \n     So why does it pass as acceptable for managing our national \n     security?\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\n       In the past two years, the administration has executed two \n     rounds of defense cuts, with the masthead of another likely \n     on the way as part of an agreement to lift the debt ceiling. \n     With growing readiness problems and a generation of military \n     modernization either cut or on the chopping-block, we are now \n     facing a $400-$900 billion defense cut looming over the \n     horizon.\n       While our armed forces are charged with defending our \n     national security, it is the Congress' responsibility to \n     provide them with the resources to accomplish the tasks we \n     set for them. Our men and woman in uniform diligently execute \n     these tasks.\n       It is time for the Congress to do its job and provide \n     adequately for the common defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4906-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, July 26, 1990, 21 years ago today, was a \ngreat day in our Nation's history. When President George Herbert Walker \nBush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, we could see the \nfuture before us, full of possibility and opportunity for people with \ndisabilities. It was one of the proudest days of my legislative career.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act is one of the landmark civil \nrights laws of the 20th century--a long-overdue emancipation \nproclamation for Americans with disabilities. The ADA has played a huge \nrole in making our country more accessible, in raising the expectations \nof people with disabilities about what they can hope to achieve at work \nand in life, and in inspiring the world to view disability issues \nthrough the lens of equality and opportunity.\n  In these times of often bitter political partisanship, it is valuable \nto remember that passage of the original Americans with Disabilities \nAct was a robustly bipartisan effort. As chief sponsor of the ADA in \nthe Senate, I worked very closely with Senator Bob Dole and others on \nboth sides of the aisle. We received invaluable support from President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush and key members of his administration, \nincluding White House counsel Boyden Gray, Attorney General Richard \nThornburgh, and Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner. Other Members of \nCongress also played critical roles in passing the ADA--first and \nforemost, Senator Ted Kennedy; but also Senator Orrin Hatch, and \nRepresentatives Tony Coelho, Steny Hoyer, Major Owens, and Steve \nBartlett.\n  Before the ADA, life was very different for folks with disabilities \nin Iowa and across the country. Being an American with a disability \nmeant not being able to ride a bus because there was no lift, not being \nable to attend a concert or ballgame because there was no accessible \nseating, and not being able to cross the street in a wheelchair because \nthere were no curb cuts. In short, it meant not being able to work or \nparticipate in community life. Discrimination was both commonplace and \naccepted.\n  Since then, we have seen amazing progress. The ADA literally \ntransformed the American landscape by requiring that architectural and \ncommunications barriers be removed and replaced with accessible \nfeatures such as ramps, lifts, curb cuts, widening doorways, and closed \ncaptioning. More importantly, the ADA gave millions of Americans the \nopportunity to participate in their communities. We have made \nsubstantial progress in advancing the four goals of the ADA--equality \nof opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic \nself-sufficiency.\n  But despite this progress, we still have more work to do. One of the \ncritical challenges we still need to address is the persistently low \nemployment rates among Americans with disabilities. According to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, less than a third of working-age people \nwith disabilities--around 4 million individuals--are currently \nemployed.\n  This is shameful, and we need to do better. In April, at a disability \nemployment summit, I challenged the employer representatives in the \nroom to work to increase the size of the disability labor force by 1 \nmillion individuals by 2015. Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, endorsed this goal and encouraged his colleagues to meet \nor exceed the 1 million number because ``it's a good thing to do, and \nit's good for business.''\n  But if we are going to get serious about growing the size of the \ndisability work force, we need to start by recognizing that people with \ndisabilities have been disproportionately impacted by the bad economy. \nCompared to the general workforce, in the last 2 years, adults with \ndisabilities have left the labor force at a rate six times the rate of \nadults without disabilities.\n  I am committed to doing everything within my power to turn these \ntrends around, and to increase employment opportunities for all \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  If all of us--Members of Congress, business leaders, employers, and \npeople with disabilities--work together, I believe that we can meet the \ngoal of 1 million new workers with disabilities--and ensure that all \nindividuals with disabilities have real opportunities for employment \nthat meet their goals, interests, and high expectations.\n  I would like to take a brief moment on this ADA anniversary to \nremember a leader in the disability community who recently passed \naway--Max Starkloff.\n  Max, who acquired his disability at age 21, was a well-known advocate \nfor disability rights, both in his hometown of St. Louis, MO, and \nnationally.\n  In the 1970s, while still living in a nursing home, Max founded \nParaquad, which became one of the first Centers for Independent Living \nin this country. Max began his lifetime of advocacy for the rights and \nindependence of people with disabilities long before the ADA, and \ncontinued it all the way up until his recent passing.\n  The examples of his advocacy are too numerous to catalogue, but here \nare a few examples:\n  In 1972, he convinced St. Louis officials to install curb cuts in \nsidewalks.\n  In 1977, Max's advocacy led to the use of lift-equipped buses in the \nSt. Louis metro area.\n  In 1979, Max helped to integrate accessible design in an apartment \ncomplex that he and Paraquad opened in St. Louis, including counters \nthat could be moved up and down to accommodate wheelchairs, wide \ndoorways, and stoves that could be used by individuals with limited \nmobility.\n  Max, and his wife Colleen, worked tirelessly for the passage of the \nADA in 1990.\n  In 1997, Max's advocacy over a two year period resulted in the St. \nLouis Zoo making their facilities accessible for all.\n  Most recently, Max devoted himself to an issue that is near and dear \nto my heart--improving employment opportunities for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Although Max Starkloff is no longer with us, his accomplishments and \ngood work live on, and improve the lives of Missourians with \ndisabilities on a daily basis.\n  So as we celebrate the anniversary of this great civil rights law, we \ntake time to remember the remarkable progress that we have made in the \npast 21 years.\n  On July 26, 1990, when he signed ADA into law, President George \nHerbert Walker Bush spoke with great eloquence. And I will never forget \nhis final words before taking up his pen. He said, ``Let the shameful \nwall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.''\n  Mr. President, today, that wall is indeed falling. And we must join \ntogether, on a bipartisan basis, to continue this progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4906-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4906-S4907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING OFFICER CHESTNUT AND DETECTIVE GIBSON\n\n  Mr. WICKER.

As a Member of the U.S. House \nof Representatives at this time, I interacted with these officers on a \nregular basis. Their tragic, violent deaths profoundly affected us all.\n  We want these officers' family members and friends to know that these \ntwo fine police officers did not die in vain; if not for their \ncourageous and immediate response, many more innocent people could have \nbeen injured or killed on that day in 1998.\n  On this date, we take a moment to remember the sacrifice made by \nthese\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\nlaw enforcement officers on our behalf. We keep them, their families, \nfriends, and former colleagues in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank all law enforcement \nofficers serving at the local, State, and Federal level who put their \nlives on the line for the American public every day. Our Nation is \nfortunate to have so many fine men and women serving as law enforcement \nofficers in Mississippi and across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4907-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in an era when Congress is actively debating \nhealth care programs that are of enormous consequence to our economy \nand our collective future, it is important to acknowledge that today, \nMedicare and Medicaid play an essential role in ensuring access to \nhealth and long-term care services for nearly 100 million Americans. In \nfact, these programs are embedded in the daily lives of nearly one of \nevery three Americans.\n  Medicaid is the program that currently pays for about half of all \nlong-term care services in our country. Jointly financed and \nadministered by states and the Federal Government, it is a program that \nall of us--taxpayers and beneficiaries and health care providers \nalike--have a major stake in seeing continue and succeed.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I know that for \nmillions of older and disabled Americans who are confronting the need \nfor long-term care services, anxieties are often high. The costs \nassociated with long-term care can be catastrophic, and many families \nturn to Medicaid for assistance.\n  In many parts of the country, Medicaid offers only limited choices of \nwhere and how to receive services. However, I am pleased and proud that \na few States, Wisconsin among them, have developed Medicaid programs \nthat are designed to offer beneficiaries real choices in where they \nwill receive long-term care. The choices usually include nursing homes, \nassisted living residences, adult daycare, and personal care services \ndelivered at home. Wisconsin and some other states are also \nincreasingly offering beneficiaries the option to self-direct their \ncare through programs that allow them to directly hire an aide--perhaps \na family member or a friend--who can provide personal care within the \nconfines of an approved individual budget.\n  Wisconsin's Medicaid managed care program that covers long-term \nservices and supports is known as Family Care, and it is one that the \nstate has worked to develop for many years under several \nadministrations, starting with former Governor Tommy Thompson. Family \nCare is well ahead of where many States are in terms of offering older \nadults and those with disabilities a real choice of how and where they \ncan receive long-term care services.\n  Today, one in five Wisconsin seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities are enrolled in Medicaid. A similar proportion in six \nother States--California, Mississippi, Vermont, Louisiana, New York and \nMaine, as well as the District of Columbia, rely on the program. In \nevery State, the number of older adults and individuals with \ndisabilities who are enrolled in the program numbers is in the tens of \nthousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions. Last year, 321,700 \nseniors and individuals with disabilities in Wisconsin received \ncoverage through Medicaid.\n  During the last several weeks, I have heard a great deal from \nconstituents--beneficiaries, aging and disability organizations, and \nofficials--who have expressed concern about recent developments in \nFamily Care. It is my understanding that the state budget that was \nrecently signed into law includes a provision to cap, or freeze, the \nnumber of individuals in the program, and thereby remove the ability of \nthose who become eligible in the future to choose whether they wish to \nreceive services in a nursing home, at home, or in a community-based \nsetting such as an assisted living residence.\n  The State anticipates that the cap could save $265 million in the \n2011-2013 budget. Yet predictions also abound that waiting lists for \nhome and community-based services for newly eligible beneficiaries will \nbegin to rapidly grow again, after a period of years in which the \nFamily Care Program worked to eliminate delays in receiving services. \nSuch delays could prove costly, because when appropriate and cost-\neffective interventions cannot be accessed by frail elders and \nindividuals with disabilities, more medically intensive services are \nlikely to be required later. Moreover, individuals who wish to receive \nlower cost in-home services--but who may find that institutionally \nbased care is their only option--are predicted to wind up costing some \ncounties significantly more.\n  This year, with the first cohort of boomers turning 65, we are \nlaunching our Nation's ``age wave.'' It is an exciting era for older \nadults, and it will be accompanied by new possibilities and challenges \nfor our country. Wisconsin, which is aging more rapidly than many \nStates, has a clear responsibility to continue to provide the best \npossible long-term care services to each and every one of its older and \ndisabled citizens. In the coming weeks and months, I urge State and \nlocal officials to work closely and cooperatively with the Federal \nGovernment to keep Family Care strong. Over the last 12 years, Family \nCare has proven itself to be a valuable, popular, and cost-effective \nprogram--one that can be improved, yes, but one that also has a proven \ntrack record. It is my hope, and the hope of tens of thousands of \nbeneficiaries of the program, that it will be preserved and carefully \nprotected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4907-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nCambridge International, Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of \nmetal belting and wire cloth, on the occasion of its 100th anniversary. \nCambridge International is a thriving, dynamic manufacturing company \nthat is a testament to the resiliency of American manufacturing. The \ncompany is located in Cambridge on Maryland's Eastern Shore and is a \nworld leader in engineering and manufacturing metal mesh, conveyor \nbelts, wire cloth, filter leaves, and other industrial materials. The \ncompany exports its products worldwide, requiring sales facilities in \nthe U.S., Mexico, and Brazil.\n  Since the company was founded on September 17, 1911, Cambridge \nInternational has grown to more than 400 employees and has three \ndivisions: Industrial Belting, Architectural Mesh and, most recently, \nEnvironmental Technologies, CET. CET is developing new products to meet \nthe needs of older existing manufacturers. Starting with the firm's own \nheadquarters, CET has completed a $4.8 million renovation that included \ninstalling energy efficient heating, ventilation, and cooling, HVAC, \nand lighting systems and bathroom and equipment upgrades. Installation \nof a wood waste gasification system will ultimately allow Cambridge to \npower new production equipment in its manufacturing facilities. CET \nproduct offerings include an electrostatic precipitator, ESP, that \nfunctions at an efficiency level above the Environmental Protection \nAgency's pollution control standards for components for major waste-to-\nenergy projects. Cambridge International is hiring 36 new employees to \nsupport its new green manufacturing division and CET is creating a \ngreen job market that will continue to grow and offer expanding \nemployment opportunities.\n  Cambridge International is a valued business and employer in \nMaryland. As Cambridge International celebrates its first 100 years of \nmanufacturing, I ask my colleagues to join me in looking forward to \nCambridge's next century of manufacturing innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4907-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4907-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4907-S4908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4908-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1103.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing \n     Congress and the United States Drug Enforcement Agency to \n     make it illegal to possess, use, or sell the drugs MDPV and \n     Mephedrone; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 53\n\n       Whereas, MDPV (methylenedioxypyrovalerone) and mephedrone \n     are the\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\n     main ingredients of underground drug products being marketed \n     as ``bath salts'' or ``plant food,'' and which are being sold \n     online, at convenience stores, and in smoke shops under names \n     like Tranquility, Zoom, Ivory Wave, Red Dove, and Vanilla \n     Sky. According to numerous reports, the chemicals found in \n     these bath salts and plant foods cause effects similar to \n     those caused by cocaine and methamphetamines, including \n     hallucinations, paranoia, and suicidal thoughts. In one case \n     a user was reported to have resorted to self-mutilation after \n     abusing the substance. In several cases, users have died \n     after overdosing or because of violent behavior; and\n       Whereas, law enforcement personnel need the authority to \n     get MDPV and mephedrone off the streets and prosecute people \n     who are trying to profit from selling these dangerous drugs. \n     State and local law enforcement officials in dozens of states \n     have encountered MDPV or mephedrone in the last two years. \n     Absent restrictions on their possession, use, or sale, law \n     enforcement can only watch as MDPV and mephedrone abuse \n     becomes more widespread; and\n       Whereas, MDPV and mephedrone should be placed in schedule I \n     of the federal controlled substances list. Schedule I is \n     reserved for the most dangerous drugs, such as heroin and \n     LSD, which have no recognized medical use and a high \n     potential for abuse. MDPV and mephedrone meet the statutory \n     requirements for placement into schedule I and belong in this \n     group; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress and the United States Drug Enforcement \n     Agency to make it illegal to possess, use, or sell the drugs \n     MDPV and mephedrone; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the administrator of \n     the United States Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4910-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4910-S4911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. KERRY for the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       *Derek J.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the minimum loss ratio required of Medigap policies; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Affordable Care Act helped to ensure \nthat insurance companies spend a substantial portion of premium dollars \non medical care and health care quality improvement, rather than on \nadministrative costs and profits. However, due to remaining \ndiscrepancies not all Medicare beneficiaries are afforded the same \nprotection under the law.\n  Medical loss ratios make the insurance marketplace more transparent \nand make it easier for consumers to purchase plans that provide better \nvalue for their money. Beginning this year, the medical loss ratio \nprovision in the Affordable Care Act requires insurance policies sold \nin the individual and small group markets to spend 80 percent of \npremium dollars on medical care. Policies sold in the large group \nmarket are required to spend 85 percent of premium dollars on medical \ncare. Insurance companies that fail to meet this standard are required \nto provide a rebate to their customers beginning in 2012.\n  The Affordable Care Act also required Medicare Advantage plans to \nspend 85 percent of premium dollars on medical care starting in 2014 or \nthey would be required to refund the difference to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Compared to most other insurance products, Medigap policies now have \nlower statutory minimums for the percentage of premium dollars that \nmust be spent on medical care. Under current law, Medigap policies must \nmeet a minimum medical loss ratio of 65 percent in the individual \nmarket and 75 percent in the group market.\n  In 1990, Congress first passed legislation standardizing Medigap \npolicies and instituting minimum MLR standards in reaction to evidence \nof widespread sale of duplicative policies with high overhead. Today, \nmore than 9 million Medicare beneficiaries purchase private \nsupplemental Medigap policies to help cover cost sharing and \ndeductibles in traditional Medicare.\n  The Medigap Medical Loss Ratio Improvement Act updates the MLR \nstandards for Medigap insurers, increasing the percentages to levels \nput forth in health reform for other products. Specifically, it will \nraise the MLR from 65 percent to 80 percent in the individual market \nand from 75 percent to 85 percent in the group marketplace. To give \ninsurers time to prepare for this change, it would not become effective \nuntil 2014.\n  This legislation is endorsed by organizations representing millions \nof senior citizens and consumers of all ages, including: AARP, AFSCME, \nAlliance of Retired Americans, Center for Medicare Advocacy, Community \nCatalyst, Families USA, Health Care for America Now, Medicare Rights \nCenter, National Council on Aging, and the National Senior Citizens Law \nCenter.\n  In endorsing the bill, AARP highlights that, ``AARP supports this \nchange because it will provide greater transparency and accountability \nfor expenditures made by health insurance issuers, and encourage them \nto become more efficient in their operations to help ensure that \nconsumers receive fair value for their premium dollars.''\n  The reforms in this bill would ensure that Medigap enrollees receive \nthe same value for their premium dollars that is afforded to every \nother American family. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe Senate to pass this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4912-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4912-S4913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 238--DESIGNATING THE THIRD WEEK IN JANUARY 2012 AS \n                     ``TEEN CANCER AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 239\n\n       Whereas in the mid-19th century, the Guano Islands Act (48 \n     U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) enabled companies from the United States \n     to mine guano from a number of islands in the Equatorial \n     Pacific;\n       Whereas after several decades, when the guano was depleted, \n     such companies abandoned mining activities, leaving the \n     islands open to British exploitation;\n       Whereas in the 1930s, military and commercial interest in \n     Central Pacific air routes between Australia and California \n     led to a desire by the United States to claim the islands of \n     Howland, Baker, and Jarvis, although the ownership of such \n     islands was unclear;\n       Whereas in 1935, a secret Department of Commerce \n     colonization plan was instituted, aimed at placing citizens \n     of the United States as colonists on the remote islands of \n     Howland, Baker, and Jarvis;\n       Whereas to avoid conflicts with international law, which \n     prevented colonization by active military personnel, the \n     United States sought the participation of furloughed military \n     personnel and Native Hawaiian civilians in the colonization \n     project;\n       Whereas William T. Miller, Superintendent of Airways at the \n     Department of Commerce, was appointed to lead the \n     colonization project, traveled to Hawaii in February 1935, \n     met with Albert F. Judd, Trustee of Kamehameha Schools and \n     the Bishop Museum, and agreed that recent graduates and \n     students of the Kamehameha School for Boys would make ideal \n     colonists for the project;\n       Whereas the ideal Hawaiian candidates were candidates who \n     could ``fish in the native manner, swim excellently, handle a \n     boat, be disciplined, friendly, and unattached'';\n       Whereas on March 30, 1935, the United States Coast Guard \n     Cutter Itasca departed from Honolulu Harbor in great secrecy \n     with 6 young Hawaiians aboard, all recent graduates of \n     Kamehameha Schools, and 12 furloughed army personnel, whose \n     purpose was to occupy the barren islands of Howland, Baker, \n     and Jarvis in teams of 5 for 3 months;\n       Whereas in June 1935, after a successful first tour, the \n     furloughed army personnel were ordered off the islands and \n     replaced with additional Kamehameha Schools alumni, thus \n     leaving the islands under the exclusive occupation of the 4 \n     Native Hawaiians on each island;\n       Whereas the duties of the colonists while on the island \n     were to record weather conditions, cultivate plants, maintain \n     a daily log, record the types of fish that were caught, \n     observe bird life, and collect specimens for the Bishop \n     Museum;\n       Whereas the successful year-long occupation by the \n     colonists directly enabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt to \n     issue Executive Order 7368 on May 13, 1936, which proclaimed \n     that the islands of Howland, Baker, and Jarvis were under the \n     jurisdiction of the United States;\n       Whereas multiple Federal agencies vied for the right to \n     administer the colonization project, including the Department \n     of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, and the Navy \n     Department, but jurisdiction was ultimately granted to the \n     Department of the Interior;\n       Whereas under the Department of the Interior, the \n     colonization project emphasized weather data and radio \n     communication, which brought about the recruitment of a \n     number of Asian radiomen and aerologists;\n       Whereas under the Department of the Interior, the \n     colonization project also expanded beyond the Kamehameha \n     Schools to include Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians from other \n     schools in Hawaii;\n       Whereas in 1937, in preparation for Amelia Earhart's \n     arrival on Howland island, the colonists constructed a \n     landing field, readied a shower and bedroom for her, and \n     prepared a performance for her, but she never arrived, having \n     disappearing en route to the island on July 2, 1937;\n       Whereas in March of 1938 the United States also claimed and \n     colonized the islands of Canton and Enderbury, maintaining \n     that such colonization was in furtherance of commercial \n     aviation and not for military purposes;\n       Whereas the risk of living on such remote islands meant \n     that emergency medical care was not less than 5 days away, \n     and such distance proved fatal for Carl Kahalewai, who died \n     on October 8, 1938 en route to Honolulu after his appendix \n     ruptured on Jarvis island;\n       Whereas other life-threatening injuries occurred, in 1939, \n     when Manuel Pires had appendicitis, and in 1941, when an \n     explosion severely burned Henry Knell and Dominic Zagara;\n       Whereas in 1940, when the issue of discontinuing the \n     colonization project was raised, the Navy acknowledged that \n     the islands were ``probably worthless to commercial \n     aviation'' but advocated for ``continued occupation'' because \n     the islands could serve as ``bases from a military \n     standpoint'';\n       Whereas although military interests justified continued \n     occupation of the islands, the colonists were never informed \n     of the true nature of the project, nor were the colonists \n     provided with weapons or any other means of self-defense;\n       Whereas in June of 1941, when much of Europe was engaged in \n     World War II and Imperial Japan was establishing itself in \n     the Pacific, the Commandant of the 14th Naval District \n     recognized the ``tension in the Western Pacific'' and \n     recommended the evacuation of the colonists, but his request \n     was denied;\n       Whereas on December 8, 1941, Howland Island was attacked by \n     a fleet of Japanese twin-engine bombers, and such attack \n     killed Hawaiian colonists Joseph Keliihananui and Richard \n     Whaley;\n       Whereas in the ensuing weeks, Japanese submarine and \n     military aircraft continued to target the islands of Howland, \n     Baker, and Jarvis, jeopardizing the lives of the remaining \n     colonists;\n       Whereas the United States Government was unaware of the \n     attacks on such islands, and was distracted by the entry of \n     the United States into World War II, which delayed the \n     retrieval of the colonists;\n       Whereas the 4 colonists from Baker and the 2 remaining \n     colonists from Howland were rescued on January 31, 1942, and \n     the 8 colonists from Jarvis and Enderbury were rescued on \n     February 9, 1942, 2 months after the initial attacks on \n     Howland Island;\n       Whereas on March 20, 1942, Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of \n     the Interior, sent letters of condolence to the Keliihananui \n     and Whaley families stating that ``[i]n your bereavement it \n     must be considerable satisfaction to know that your brother \n     died in the service of his country,'' and subsequently urged \n     the families to submit claims for compensation;\n       Whereas in April 1942, the claim of the Keliihananui family \n     was denied because there were no ``qualified dependents'' to \n     submit claims;\n       Whereas during the 7 years of colonization, more than 130 \n     young men participated in the project, the majority of whom \n     were Hawaiian, and all of whom made numerous sacrifices, \n     endured hardships, and risked their lives to secure and \n     maintain the islands of Howland, Baker, Jarvis, Canton, and \n     Enderbury on behalf of the United States, and 3 young \n     Hawaiian men made the ultimate sacrifice;\n       Whereas none of the islands, except for Canton, were ever \n     used for commercial aviation, but the islands were used for \n     military purposes;\n       Whereas in July 1943, a military base was established on \n     Baker Island, and its forces, which numbered over 2,000 \n     members, participated in the Tarawa-Makin operation;\n       Whereas in 1956, participants of the colonization project \n     established an organization called ``Hui Panala`au'', which \n     was established to preserve the group's fellowship, to \n     provide scholarship assistance, and ``to honor and esteem \n     those who died as colonists of the Equatorial Islands'';\n       Whereas in 1979, Canton and Enderbury became part of the \n     republic of Kiribati, but the islands of Jarvis, Howland, and \n     Baker still remain possessions of the United States, having \n     been designated as National Wildlife Refuges in 1974;\n       Whereas three quarters of a century later, the Equatorial \n     Islands colonization project has been nearly forgotten;\n       Whereas May 13, 2011, marks the 75th anniversary of \n     President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order proclaiming \n     United States jurisdiction over the islands of Howland, \n     Baker, and Jarvis, islands that remain possessions of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas the Federal Government has never fully recognized \n     the accomplishments, contributions, and sacrifices of the \n     colonists, less than 6 of whom are still alive today, and \n     most of whom are in their 90s: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the accomplishments and sacrifices of the \n     Hui Panala`au colonists and extends appreciation on behalf of \n     the people of the United States;\n       (2) acknowledges the local, national, and international \n     significance of the 7-year colonization project, which \n     resulted in the United States extending sovereignty into the \n     Equatorial Pacific;\n       (3) recognizes and commends the accomplishments, \n     sacrifices, and contributions of the more than 130 young men, \n     the majority\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\n     of whom were Native Hawaiian, who participated in the \n     Equatorial Pacific colonization project; and\n       (4) extends condolences on behalf of the United States to \n     the families of Carl Kahalewai, Joseph Keliihananui, and \n     Richard Whaley for the loss of their loved ones in the \n     service of the United States and apologizes for the lack of \n     compensation afforded to these families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4914-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n          Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

He served as the ranking member of \nthe Intelligence Committee and served admirably.\n  One thing he and I talked about on a number of occasions, when he was \nGovernor of the State of Missouri, he rescinded an order that had been \ngiven by his predecessor, a man by the name of Governor Boggs, as I \nrecall, which was an extermination order against all the Mormons who \nwere in Missouri--extermination meaning to kill them all--and some of \nthem were killed. But they worked their way out of Missouri. But that \nextermination order remained in effect until Kit Bond came along. Of \ncourse, they were not trying to exterminate the Mormons, but as a \nmatter of principle he thought that was the wrong thing to do.\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\n  So for that and other reasons, I have fond memories of our friend Kit \nBond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/26/senate-section/article/S4915-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MYRON DONOVAN CROCKER UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. REID.
