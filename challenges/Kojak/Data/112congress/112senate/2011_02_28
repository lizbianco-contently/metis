Pursuant to the order of the Senate \nof January 24, 1901, as amended by the order of February 17, 2011, the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, will now read Washington's Farewell \nAddress.\n  Mr. ISAKSON, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n  To the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow-Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that \nthis resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared \nto be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much \nearlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself, and every day the \nincreasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade \nof retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied \nthat if\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\nany circumstances have given peculiar value to my services, they were \ntemporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while choice and \nprudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not \nforbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the \ndeep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \ncountry for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still more for \nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the \nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \nattachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness \nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these \nservices, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an \ninstructive example in our annals that, under circumstances in which \nthe passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, amidst \nappearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South \nin the same intercourse, benefitting by the agency of the North, sees \nits agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its \nown channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular \nnavigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to \nnourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it \nlooks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself \nis unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, \nalready finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior \ncommunications by land and water will more and more find a valuable \nvent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at \nhome. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth \nand comfort--and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must \nof necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its \nown productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime \nstrength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble \ncommunity of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West \ncan hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own \nseparate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any \nforeign power, must be intrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary \nobject of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union \naffecting all parts of our\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\ncountry, while experience shall not have demonstrated its \nimpracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the \npatriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its \nbands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of government better \ncalculated than your former for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government. But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower and the right of the people to establish government presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character with the real design to \ndirect, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action \nof the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental \nprinciple and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to \ngive it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of \nthe delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but \nartful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to \nthe alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public \nadministration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects \nof faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans \ndigested by common councils and modified by mutual interests. However \ncombinations or associations of the above description may now and then \nanswer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, \nto become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled \nmen will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for \nthemselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very \nengines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition, to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be \nto effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some \nprevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, \nturns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the \nruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it \nthe interest and the duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain \nit.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to \nthe government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the \npolicy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will \nof another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be\n\n[[Page S932]]\n\nencouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public \nweal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments \nancient and modern, some of them in our country and under our own eyes. \nTo preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the \nopinion of the people the distribution or modification of the \nconstitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected \nby an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let \nthere be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may \nbe the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free \ngovernments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly \noverbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which \nthe use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less \nforce to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend \nto it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation \nof the fabric?\n  Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected \nthe permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it \nastray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against \nanother disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay \nhold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable \nwhen accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence frequent \ncollisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, \nprompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the \ngovernment, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government \nsometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through \npassion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated \nby pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace \noften, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification. \nIt leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\nbaneful foes of republican government. But that jealously to be useful \nmust be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence \nto be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality \nfor one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those \nwhom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and \neven second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may \nresist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become suspected \nand odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence \nof the people to surrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements (I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than private affairs, that honesty is always the best \npolicy)--I repeat it therefore, let those engagements be observed in \ntheir genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectably defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed--in \norder to give to trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them--conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another--that it must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character--that \nby such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given \nequivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take--and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance, and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption \nto that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give \nit, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\nGeo.

Mr. President, I wish to start by welcoming everyone \nback from the recess. It is good to be back. Time away from Washington \nis an opportunity to step back and measure the priorities of party \nagainst those of people who sent us here to make sure they are properly \naligned.\n  As the two parties reengage this week in a debate about our Nation's \nfinances, it is vital that we focus not on mere partisan advantage but \non what is right for the Nation. When it comes to the two choices \nbefore us of either maintaining an unsustainable status quo on spending \nor beginning to cut spending, the choice could not be more clear.\n  This morning's news brought word that a 47-member panel of some of \nthe Nation's top business economists view government overspending as \nthe top threat to our economy. In other words, a majority of those \nexperts think Washington's inability to live within its means is the \nsingle greatest threat to our Nation's economic future. This is not a \ngroundbreaking observation. After all, Americans have been telling \nlawmakers for more than 2 years that business as usual simply will not \ncut it anymore. They want us to get our fiscal house in order and to \nstart to create the right conditions for private sector job growth. But \ntoday's news is further confirmation of the stakes in the debate over \nspending and that Democrats in Congress need to rethink the approach \nthey have taken up to now.\n  The message from the November elections is quite clear: Stop spending \nmoney we don't have. Yet Democratic leaders persist in defending \nbudgets that do just that well into the future.\n  Earlier this month, the President unveiled a 10-year budget for the \ngovernment. At no point in this 10-year projection would the government \nspend less than it takes in. It does not even try. Just look at the \nestimates for this year alone. Unless we start to cut this year's \nprojected spending, Washington will spend more than $1.5 trillion more \nthan it takes in--$1.5 trillion more than it takes in this year--about \n$350 billion more in red ink than we had last year. That is $350 \nbillion more in red ink than we had last year. Think about that--a $350 \nbillion increase in deficit spending over last year after an election \nin which the voters unambiguously said they want us to cut spending and \nstop adding debt.\n  Next year, Democrats in Congress want us to do it again. Once again, \nthey plan to spend more than $1 trillion more than we take in, and the \nsame pattern the year after that. They want to spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars more than we take in. And on and on.\n  All of this overspending, of course, just adds to our overall debt. \nWhen you add it all up, the numbers are truly staggering. As a result \nof Democratic budgets, the Federal debt 5 years from now is expected to \nexceed $20 trillion--5 years from now, $20 trillion. Interest payments \nalone on that debt will exceed $\\1/2\\ trillion a year. That is just \ninterest payments on the $20 trillion debt--$\\1/2\\ trillion a year. \nTalk about a disconnect.\n  The American people have spent the last 2 years trying to get their \nown fiscal houses in order. Millions have lost their jobs. Millions \nmore have lost their homes. Meanwhile, what have the Democrats in \nWashington been up to? On the day the President was sworn into office, \nthe national debt was $10.6 trillion. In the 25 months since, it has \nincreased by about $3.5 trillion. And despite a national uprising over \nthis profligacy and an election that represented a wholesale \nrepudiation of it, here is the President's response: Spend more. He \ncalls it investments.\n  What about Democratic leaders in Congress? Are they reading the \nwriting on the wall? Until this past weekend, they insisted they could \nnot agree to cut a dime in spending--not a dime. Rather than look for \nways the two parties can work together to rein in spending, they looked \nfor ways to marginalize those who are working hard to come up with ways \nto do it. They called anybody who wanted to cut a dime in spending an \nextremist. I will tell you what is extreme, Mr. President. What is \nextreme is $20 trillion in debt. That is what is extreme. Or $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in interest payments a year is extreme. Refusing to agree to \neven try to live within your means is extreme.\n  Tomorrow, the House will have a vote on a 2-week spending bill. This \nbill represents an effort to change the culture in Washington. It says: \nLet's start to change the mentality around here. Let's find $4 billion \nthat all of us can agree to cut and cut it and continue from that good \nstart. Democratic leaders in Congress have resisted even this up until \na few days ago. Now they have started to suggest they might be willing \nto agree to it. This is progress.\n  This week, Democrats will have the opportunity to show they have \ngotten the message. They can show they agree the time has come to \nchange the status quo. Less spending, lower debt, reining in the size \nand scope of government, that is what is needed. That is how we will \ncreate the conditions for private sector job growth.\n  Democratic leaders in Congress have tried record spending and \ndeficits. What has it gotten us? More than $3 trillion more in debt and \n3 million more jobs lost--$3 trillion in new debt while we lost 3 \nmillion jobs. Democrats have an opportunity this week to show they get \nit. They have an opportunity to show that the status quo on spending \nand debt is no longer an option, to turn a corner. A lot depends on how \nthey respond to that opportunity. Will they continue to see what they \ncan get away with or will they finally concede that the old way of \ndoing business must come to an end?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our dilemma in \nthe Federal Government. The American people are watching as we try to \ndeal with our spending issues. I know there is a big debate over the 2-\nweek spending issue, an issue where we are trying\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\nto cut $4 billion. Hopefully, some resolve will come to that.\n  What the American people are seeing is that unless there is some type \nof gun to our heads or some type of urgent situation in front of us, we \ndo not have the ability in this body to deal with spending issues in a \ndisciplined or courageous way. Everybody understands that, and they \nunderstand that the only way we are looking at whatever spending cuts \nwill take place--I know right now there are discussions over what they \nmight be, but the only reason this issue is being addressed is that we \nhave this deadline of government funding ending in the next week.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is someone who served as a county \nexecutive and had to balance budgets each year and had to figure out a \nway to live within their means. I know that upon arriving here a few \nmonths ago, he had to be totally aghast at the fact that we are taking \nin $2.2 trillion this year and spending $3.7 trillion this year. If we \nput all the discretionary spending we have, if we took every bit of \nnonmandatory spending or discretionary spending off the table, we still \nwould not have a balanced budget. Everybody in this country knows that \nwhere we are is totally out of line. We are spending a little over 24 \npercent of our country's economic output today. Over the last 40 years, \nwe have spent about 20.6 percent of our country's GDP.\n  I, along with Claire McCaskill from Missouri, have put a bill in \nplace. We have a number of cosponsors. We put in something called the \nCAP Act. We hope that over the course of this next year--over the \ncourse of the next several months--this is a bill that will actually \npass. What it does, I think in a very logical way, is it says we are \nspending at levels relative to our economy today that are out of \nproportion, and let's go from where we are today to the 4-year average \nover a 10-year period. Mr. President, you have to agree that this is \njust a logical thing that gives us time to go from where we are today \nover the next 10 years to where the country has been, spending relative \nto our country's output for the last 40 years.\n  What this also does is it puts Congress in a straitjacket. Again, I \nthink everybody who is watching knows that if we didn't have this CR--\nthis continuing resolution bill--that is ending this week and if \ngovernment wasn't going to shut down if it wasn't funded, there would \nbe no negotiations taking place right now over spending. We all know \nthat. So this puts in place a straitjacket on Congress--one that is \nvery needed, unfortunately--to take us from here to there over a 10-\nyear period. What happens if we don't meet the requirements of this \ndeclining spending relative to our economy is that sequestration comes \ninto play. On a pro-rata basis--based on the relative weight of certain \naccounts to the overall spending levels, the OMB comes in and takes \nfrom every account of government on a pro-rata basis.\n  One of the problems we have had in this country is we want to deal \nwith those things that are easy, and that is discretionary spending, in \nmany cases. Nondefense discretionary spending ends up being about $600 \nbillion, roughly, of the $3.7 trillion we are spending. Everybody in \nthe world knows there is no way for us to solve our problem by only \ndealing with discretionary spending. So what this bill would do is put \nall items on the balance sheet. In other words, it would include all \nthe entitlements.\n  I don't think there is a person in this body who believes if we \ncontinue as we are, if we don't redesign the programs the seniors are \ncounting on--Medicare and Social Security--if we don't redesign these \nprograms so they will be sustained for the long haul, then seniors are \nnot going to have them. So this bill will force us in Congress to deal \nwith designing these programs in such a way they will be here for the \nlong haul. It puts everything on the table. Again, there is not a \nthinking person in Washington who doesn't know we have to address these \nissues.\n  There are a lot of people who say: Well, we cannot do these draconian \nthings right now because we are in the middle of a recession. \nHopefully, it looks like it is changing and hopefully changing very \nrapidly, but these changes would begin from where we are in the year \n2013. So we would have a year or so to redesign these programs. We \ncould act in an appropriate way to ensure they were here for the future \nbut also put them in place in a manner that doesn't kill the American \ntaxpayer, and we would cap spending. We have a multiyear averaging \nprocess in this bill to make sure, if there is a change in the economy \nin 1 year, we don't just have this volatile situation, but we would \nhave the ability, 1 year in advance, to know what the appropriate \nspending levels are. It gives Congress the ability to act upon that \nthroughout the year.\n  Again, if Congress doesn't act, then 45 days after a year ends, OMB \ncomes in and puts in place something called sequestration--\nautomatically takes money out of these accounts. I think that gives us \nthe impetus to want to make sure we actually act. I don't think there \nis anybody in Congress who wants OMB coming in and taking money out of \naccounts. So that would be, in essence, the thing that would give us \nthe sense of urgency we badly need in this body.\n  This is a problem that exists on both sides of the aisle and that is \nwhy I have sought bipartisan support for this bill. I have tried to put \nsomething in place that is very logical--I know that is not often the \ncase here--something Americans across the country can understand and \nalso those here in Washington will see as something that works toward a \nsolution and gets us to where we need to go.\n  I think all of us understand the demographic changes that are taking \nplace in our country. I think all of us know that over the next 10 \nyears, 20 million more Americans are going to be on Medicare and 20 \nmillion more Americans will be on Social Security. We are right on the \ncusp of that bubble. I am certainly getting ready to be a part of that. \nThe Presiding Officer may not necessarily be there yet, but the point \nis this is something that has to occur for the good of our country.\n  So this is called the CAP Act. Again, what it will do is ensure that \nlong after the point in time when the CR window opens and closes, long \nafter the time the debt ceiling vote happens a little later this year--\nlong after those occur and the American people have moved on to other \nissues and, obviously, Congress has moved on to other issues--we keep \nin place this fiscal discipline, this straitjacket, to take us where we \nneed to go.\n  The Presiding Officer and I were in Pakistan and Afghanistan last \nweek, and we witnessed some of the problems we are having there. We \nalso witnessed the brilliance of our men and women in uniform and also \nmany hard-working individuals at the State Department. While those \nthreats are threats we are dealing with that are very important to the \nAmerican people, I think most of us know the biggest threat today to \nour country is our inability to deal appropriately with our financial \ncircumstances. I think we all know if we don't deal with that pretty \nsoon, we are going to be putting our country's future in jeopardy. We \nwill be putting in jeopardy the future of these wonderful pages who sit \nin front of me.\n  The thing that is fascinating about this issue is, unlike what we saw \nin Pakistan and in Afghanistan, where we are relying on other people, \nthis is something we can do ourselves. We have 100 percent control over \nspending in Washington--100 percent control of this is held in the \nhands of 100 Senators and 435 House Members. This is not something \nwhere we are depending on other countries or we are concerned about \nwhat might happen elsewhere. This is something we ourselves can deal \nwith.\n  So what I have tried to put in place, along with Claire McCaskill and \nothers--and there are growing numbers of other people who are part of \nthis process--is something that causes us to be responsible to the \nAmerican people. So I hope others will join this. It is my hope we will \ndo three things: I hope we will vote and pass on cuts in Federal \nspending today. I hope that will happen over the next short period of \ntime. Whether it is some of the things we are looking at on the CR or \nmaybe it is recommendations that have been put in place by the \nPresident's deficit reduction commission, I hope what we will do as a \nbody is go ahead and vote to pass real cuts now.\n  Secondarily, what I hope will happen is that we will put in place \nsomething like the CAP Act to make sure we continue that fiscal \ndiscipline long after\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\npeople move on to other topics; that we keep that straitjacket in place \nso we do those things that are, again, responsible not only to this \ngeneration but future generations.\n  Thirdly, I hope we figure out a way, through some type of amendment, \nto ensure that, on into the future, we have put something in place at \nthe Federal level which causes us to be fiscally responsible in this \ncountry. All of us know what it means to have to make choices. All of \nus have households. Many of us have led cities and States. Many of us \nhave had businesses. We all understand what happens in the real world, \nand it is something that certainly needs to happen here. That has been \nsorely lacking for a long time.\n  So I thank the Chair for the time on the floor today, and I hope to \ntalk about this many more times. I have been doing it, I assure you, \nthroughout the State of Tennessee and in multiple forums in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to speak with you in \nthe last several moments, and you had a couple questions about the CAP \nAct that I was just discussing on the floor. The Presiding Officer had \nsome great questions about what it takes to overcome the CAP Act, in \nthe event we were able to pass it.\n  It is just a 10-page bill. It is very eloquent. It doesn't have a lot \nof ``whereases.'' It is just a business document that takes us from \nwhere we are to where we need to be. But, in essence, to override it, \nit would take a two-thirds vote. It would take two-thirds of the House \nand the Senate to actually override or get out of the straitjacket, if \nyou will. There were previous bills, such as Gramm-Rudman and other \ntypes of bills that tried to keep Washington fiscally focused, and \nthose bills required 60 votes. So this would be a higher threshold.\n  So, yes, if there was some type of national emergency and we needed \nto move beyond this straitjacket for 1 year or 6 months or something \nlike that, a two-thirds vote could do that. I mean, 67 votes is a \npretty tough threshold, and hopefully it is the kind of threshold \nnecessary to keep the kind of discipline in place that we need.\n  So it is a 10-page bill. Again, it is very eloquent. I think it lays \nout a solution for us that hopefully will be a part of anything we do \nover the next several months.\n  I understand, after talking with the Presiding Officer over the last \nseveral days, while traveling to these various countries, that he, \nalong with many of our other colleagues--I know I did myself--came here \nto solve problems, not to message. In a body such as this, it is tough \nto solve these kinds of problems, but the only way to do it is to offer \na pragmatic solution.\n  I know there are some people who are interested, sometimes, in \nmessaging. I have tried to offer something that I think will take us \nfrom a place that is very much out of line in spending to a place that \nis more appropriate.\n  I might also say I thought the President's deficit reduction \ncommission had some very good points as it relates to tax reform. I \nthink all of us are aware of the $1.2 trillion in tax expenditures that \nexist.\n  I was doing an event over the last several days, and a gentleman \nraised his hand and asked me: What do you mean by tax expenditures? \nIsn't the money ours until we give it to the Federal Government? Why \nwould you call it a tax expenditure?\n  I think people realize in our Tax Code there are all kinds of \nexclusions and subsidies and favored companies and favored this and \nfavored that. If we did away with all of those, there would be $1.2 \ntrillion we could use to lower everybody's rate, and we could make our \nTax Code much more simple. The deficit reduction commission says we \ncould take our corporate rates from where they are down to a level of \nabout 26 percent--somewhere between 23 and 29 percent--and lower \neverybody's rates individually. I think most Americans, instead of \nfilling out all these forms to see if they benefit from these various \nsubsidies and credits, would much rather know that everybody is on the \nsame playing field; that some favored company is not in a situation \nwhere they are more favored than another; that everybody is on the same \nbasis.\n  I think there has been some good work done there. I hope we are able \nto take votes on that over the next several months. But there is a very \nelegant, pragmatic solution that has been offered that would go hand in \nhand with these types of measures and would cause us, over the next 10 \nyears, to exercise the kind of fiscal discipline this country needs to \nconfront what I think threatens our national security, certainly our \neconomic security, even more than the things we saw on the ground in \nthe Middle East last week.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendments be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; further, that the amended version be considered original text \nfor the purposes of further amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee-reported amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate today is turning its attention \nto a measure that will help create jobs, energize the economy, and \npromote innovation. The Patent Reform Act, which has also come to be \ncalled the America Invents Act, is a key part of any jobs agenda.\n  We can help unleash innovation and promote American invention, all \nwithout adding a penny to the deficit. This is commonsense and \nbipartisan legislation. During the next few days, the Senate can come \ntogether to pass this needed legislation, and do so in a bipartisan \nmanner. It represents the finest traditions of the Senate.\n  I thank the majority leader for proceeding to this measure, and the \nRepublican leader for his cooperation.\n  This is a bill that was reported unanimously by the members of the \nJudiciary Committee. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that it \nis important to our country's continued economic recovery, and to our \nability to successfully compete in the global economy. America needs a \n21st century patent system in order to lead. The last reform of our \npatent system was nearly 60 years ago, and I think it is about time the \npatent system caught up with the needs of this country and what the \nrest of the world has already done.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Obama challenged the \nNation to out-innovate, out-build, and out-educate. Enacting the \nAmerica Invents Act is a key to meeting this challenge.\n  Reforming the Nation's antiquated patent system will promote American \ninnovation, it will create American jobs, and it will grow America's \neconomy. I thank the President and his administration for their help \nand support for the Leahy-Hatch-Grassley America Invents Act.\n  Commerce Secretary Locke has been a strong partner in our efforts, \nand Director Kappos of the Patent and Trademark Office has been an \nindispensable source of wise counsel.\n  Innovation drives the Nation's economy, and that entrepreneurial \nspirit can only be protected by a patent system that promotes invention \nand spurs new ideas. We need to reform our patent system so that these \ninnovations can more quickly get to market.\n  A modernized patent system--one that puts American entrepreneurs on \nthe same playing field as those throughout the world--is a key to that \nsuccess. This is an idea that cuts across the political spectrum.\n  Our bipartisan Senate cosponsors include Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, \nSenator Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Gillibrand of New York, the \ndistinguished Acting President pro tempore, Senator Coons of Delaware, \nas well as Senator Kyl, the assistant Republican leader, Senator \nSessions of Alabama, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Franken \nof Minnesota, Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Senator Harkin of \nIowa.\n  Republicans and Democrats from big States and small, and from all \nends of the political spectrum, are coming together to support American \ninnovation.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved this legislation \non February 3, 2011. But this effort extends back several years. Our \ncurrent congressional efforts to reform the Nation's patent system \nbegan in 2005. Indeed, our bill is the product of years of work and \ncompromise. The Senate Judiciary Committee has reported patent reform \nlegislation to the Senate in each of the last three Congresses. And the \nHouse has seen efforts over the same period led by Congressmen Lamar \nSmith of Texas and Howard Berman of California. The legislation we are \nconsidering today, in fact, is structured on the original House bill \nand contains many of the original provisions.\n  From the beginning, we each recognized the need for a more effective \nand efficient patent system, one that improves patent quality and \nprovides incentives for entrepreneurs to create jobs.\n  A balanced and efficient intellectual property system that rewards \ninvention and promotes innovation through high-quality patents is \ncrucial to our Nation's economic prosperity and job growth. It is how \nwe win the future--by unleashing the American inventive spirit. This \nbill, the America Invents Act, will allow our inventors and innovators \nto flourish, and it will do so without adding a penny to the deficit.\n  Not a dime in taxpayer money is spent on the Patent and Trademark \nOffice reforms. They are all funded by patent fees, not taxes.\n  The America Invents Act will accomplish three important goals, which \nhave been at the center of the patent reform debate from the beginning: \nIt will improve and harmonize operations at the Patent and Trademark \nOffice; it will improve the quality of patents that are issued; and it \nwill provide more certainty in litigation.\n  Particularly, this legislation will transition our Nation's patent \nsystem to a first-inventor-to-file system. It will also make changes to \nimprove the quality of patents that are issued, and it will provide the \nPTO with the resources it needs to work through its backlog.\n  The America Invents Act provides the tools the PTO needs to separate \nthe inventive wheat from the chaff, to help businesses bring new \nproducts to market and create jobs.\n  This is interesting because this is a piece of legislation that is \nsupported by both business and labor--something we all want to see in \nthis Chamber--including the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nUnited Steelworkers, the National Venture Capital Association, the AFL-\nCIO, the Association of American Universities, and companies \nrepresenting all sectors of the patent community that have been urging \naction on patent reform proposals for years.\n  Innovation has always been at the heart of America and American \nsuccess. From the founding of our Nation, we recognized the importance \nof promoting and protecting innovation. The Constitution explicitly \ngrants Congress the power to ``promote the progress and science and \nuseful arts, by securing for limited times to . . . inventors the \nexclusive right to their respective . . . discoveries.'' It is not a \ncreature of the legislature but an integral part of our Constitution.\n  The patent system plays a key role in encouraging innovation and \nbringing new products to market. The discoveries made by American \ninventors and research institutions, commercialized by our companies, \nand protected and promoted by our patent laws, have made our system the \nenvy of the world.\n  In spite of this, a Newsweek study last year found that only 41 \npercent of Americans believe the United States is staying ahead of \nChina in innovation.\n\n[[Page S949]]\n\nA Thompson Reuters analysis has already predicted that China will \noutpace the United States in patent filings this year.\n  China has a specific plan not just to overtake the United States in \npatent applications, but to more than quadruple its patent filings over \nthe next 5 years--all the more reason why we must act now. This is not \nsomething that should be delayed. We should act on it. Delaying it is \nsaying we want China to overtake the United States. Moving forward says \nwe want to be competitive.\n  It is astonishing to consider that China has been modernizing its \npatent laws and promoting innovation, but the United States has failed \nto keep pace. I said before, it has been 60 years since we last enacted \nreform of American patent law. We can no longer wait. We can no longer \nremain complacent and expect to stay on top.\n  In many areas that were highly contentious when the patent reform \ndebate began, the courts have acted. Their decisions reflect the \nconcerns heard in Congress that questionable patents were too easily \nobtained, too difficult to challenge. The courts have moved the law in \na generally positive direction, more closely aligned with the text of \nthe statutes.\n  More recently, the Federal circuit aggressively moved to constrain \nrunaway damage awards, which plagued the patent system by basing awards \non unreliable numbers, untethered to the reality of licensing \ndecisions.\n  The courts have addressed issues where they can, but in some areas \nonly Congress can take the necessary steps. Our act will both speed the \napplication process and, at the same time, improve patent quality. It \nwill provide the USPTO with the resources it needs to work through its \napplication backlog, while also providing for greater input from third \nparties to improve the quality of patents issued and that remain in \neffect.\n  High quality patents are the key to our economic growth. They benefit \nboth patent owners and users, who can be more confident in the validity \nof issued patents. Patents of low quality and dubious validity, by \ncontrast, enable patent trolls who extort unreasonable licensing fees \nfrom legitimate businesses, and constitute a drag on innovation. Too \nmany dubious patents also unjustly cast doubt on truly high quality \npatents.\n  The Department of Commerce issued a report indicating that these \nreforms will create jobs without adding to the deficit. The Obama \nadministration supports these efforts, as do industries and \nstakeholders from all sectors of the patent community. Congressional \naction can no longer be delayed.\n  Innovation and economic development are not uniquely Democratic or \nRepublican objectives, so we worked together to find the proper balance \nfor America, for our economy, for our inventors, for our consumers.\n  Thomas Friedman wrote not too long ago in the New York Times that the \ncountry which ``endows its people with more tools and basic research to \ninvent new goods and services . . . is the one that will not just \nsurvive but thrive down the road. . . . We might be able to stimulate \nour way back to stability, but we can only invent our way back to \nprosperity.''\n  I think of the country's first patent, which was issued to a \nVermonter. Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, examined the \napplication, and President George Washington signed it.\n  A recent Judiciary Committee meeting on this measure was on the \nanniversary of the day Thomas Edison received the historic patent for \nthe principles of his incandescent lamp that paved the way for the bulb \nthat has illuminated our homes, offices, and venues in our country and \naround the world.\n  This week is when the patent was issued for lifesaving improvements \nto the diver's suit. It was magician Harry Houdini who devised a \nmechanism that allowed divers in distress to safely escape a diving \nsuit.\n  So we can smooth the path for more interesting and great American \ninventions. That is what the bipartisan comprehensive patent reform \nbill would do.\n  I wish to recognize in particular the work of Senator Hatch, who is \nhere on the Senate floor--and he has been a longtime partner of mine on \nintellectual property issues--and Senator Grassley, the ranking \nRepublican on our committee. The bill has also received tremendous \ninput from Senator Kyl, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sessions and many \nothers. We are working together, along with those on both sides of the \naisle in the House, to reach the goal of improving patent quality and \nthe operations at the PTO, and to address the related unpredictability \nof litigation that has been harming innovation.\n  No one claims that ours is a perfect bill. It is a compromise that \nwill make key improvements in the patent system. Over the course of the \nnext couple of days, the Senate will have the opportunity to consider \namendments.\n  Senator Coburn intends to bring an amendment on the use of patent \nfees. Other Senators who disagree with the move to a first-to-file \nsystem may seek to reverse that progress. I urge those Senators that \nhave amendments to come forward, agree to time agreements and proceed \nwithout delay.\n  We should be able to complete action on this bill this week and I \nwould hope by Wednesday night. Then the Senate will need to move on to \nother important matters. So after a brief period for opening statements \nto outline the bill and frame the debate, I will call for Senators to \ncome forward with any amendments they may have to the bill. This bill \nis important and its scheduling comes as no surprise. It was more than \n10 days ago that the Senate unanimously agreed to its consideration.\n  So, let us do our job, and get to the task of considering and \ncompleting action on this important bill in order to help create jobs, \nencourage innovation and promote American invention.\n  Mr. President, some of the Nation's leading innovators and inventors \nhave expressed strong support for S. 23, the America Invents Act. The \nCoalition for Patent and Trademark Information Dissemination, whose \nmembers are patent and trademark holders, recently wrote to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in support of the bill, stating that its members \nhave ``an interest in a more efficient system that produces higher-\nquality patents and trademarks.'' The Intellectual Property Owners \nAssociation, one of the largest trade associations devoted to \nintellectual property rights also recently wrote to Senators endorsing \nimportant provisions in the bill, including the first-to-file system. I \nask that these letters, as well as a statement of support from the \nCoalition for 21st Century Patent Reform be printed in the Record at \nthis time. I also ask that a list of cross-sector manufacturers and \ninnovators that support S. 23 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Coalition for Patent and Trademark Information \n           Dissemination,\n                                                 February 1, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley\n     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: The \n     Coalition writes in support of S. 23, the Patent Reform Act \n     of 2011.\n       Coalition members are information services and workflow \n     solution provider companies that offer value-added patent and \n     trademark information services. Our services are aimed at \n     enabling patent and trademark applicants to find and make \n     available the most relevant information related to their \n     claimed inventions and marks through the data enhancements \n     and state of the art search tools provided. Members also are \n     patent and trademark holders with growing numbers of patent \n     and trademark applications who have an interest in a more \n     efficient system that produces higher-quality patents and \n     trademarks.\n       Patent quality is directly related to the adequacy of the \n     prior art presented to examiners. When applicants conduct a \n     patentability search and disclose all relevant prior art to \n     examiners, examiners will have a significantly increased \n     likelihood of making the right decision about patentability. \n     A major positive addition to patent law would be the \n     provisions in S. 23 allowing submission of patents or other \n     publications by third parties while applications are still \n     under consideration by the USPTO. This should further add to \n     the prior art made available to the examiner and has the \n     potential to greatly enhance patent quality.\n       Additionally, we applaud the inclusion of supplemental \n     examination provisions in the bill. This will allow patent \n     holders to request a review of patents where pertinent \n     history or information may have been intentionally omitted in \n     original requests. The inclusion\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\n     of this provision will further strengthen our laws to prevent \n     unlawful infringement.\n       We are delighted that a provision disallowing outsourcing \n     of USPTO searches no longer seems to be under consideration. \n     Coalition members believe that the USPTO should be able to \n     contract with private companies to perform searches, whether \n     as part of the PCT process, as is now currently permitted, or \n     possibly for national searches at some future time. USPTO \n     operational flexibility with PCT searches has proven to \n     drastically reduce pendency rates. Achieving quality, speed, \n     and cost-effectiveness in USPTO processes is a goal to \n     encourage. USPTO management should be empowered to use the \n     best source or sources for searches.\n       There is one addition to S. 23 that we would hope to see as \n     the legislation advances. Coalition members believe that full \n     disclosure of prior art information to examiners is \n     constrained by concerns about inequitable conduct liability. \n     We urge Congress to reform the inequitable conduct defense in \n     order to remove the disincentive for full disclosure of all \n     prior art.\n       We appreciate this opportunity to express our positions on \n     patent reform issues, and the members of the Coalition stand \n     ready to work with the Senate Judiciary Committee as it \n     considers patent reform legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Marla Grossman,\n\n                          Executive Director, Coalition for Patent\n     and Trademark Information Dissemination.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Intellectual Property\n\n\n                                           Owners Association,\n\n                                                February 25, 2011.\n     Re amendments to S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011''\n     The Hon. ____\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator ____: Intellectual Property Owners Association \n     (IPO) is pleased that the Senate is planning to proceed with \n     consideration of S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011.''\n       IPO is one of the largest and most diverse trade \n     associations devoted to intellectual property rights. Our 200 \n     corporate members cover a broad spectrum of U.S. companies in \n     industries ranging from information technology to consumer \n     products to pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.\n       We wish to give you our advice on amendments that we \n     understand might be offered during consideration of S. 23:\n       Vote AGAINST any amendment to delete the ``first-inventor-\n     to-file'' and related provisions in section 2 of the bill. \n     First-inventor-to-file, explained in a 1-page attachment to \n     this letter, is central to modernization and simplification \n     of patent law and is very widely supported by U.S. companies.\n       Vote FOR any amendment guaranteeing the U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office access to all user fees paid to the agency \n     by patent and trademark owners and applicants. Current delays \n     in processing patent applications are totally unacceptable \n     and the result of an underfunded Patent and Trademark Office.\n       Vote AGAINST any amendment that would interpose substantial \n     barriers to enforcement of validly-granted ``business \n     method'' patents. IPO supports business method patents that \n     were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the recent Bilski \n     decision.\n       For more information, please call IPO at 202-507-4500.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Douglas K. Norman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Intellectual Property\n\n\n                                           Owners Association,\n\n                                                February 25, 2011.\n\n   First-Inventor-To-File in S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011''\n\n       Section 2 of S. 23 simplifies and modernizes U.S. patent \n     law by awarding the patent to the first of two competing \n     inventors to file in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \n     (PTO), a change from the traditional system of awarding the \n     patent, in theory, to the first inventor to invent. First-\n     inventor-to-file in S. 23 has these advantages:\n       Eliminates costly and slow patent interferences proceedings \n     conducted in the PTO and the courts to determine which \n     inventor was the first to invent.\n       Creates legal certainty about rights in all patents, the \n     vast majority of which never become entangled in interference \n     proceedings in the first place, but which are still subject \n     to the possibility under current law that another inventor \n     might come forward and seek to invalidate the patent on the \n     ground that this other inventor, who never applied for a \n     patent, was the first to invent.\n       Encourages both large and small patent applicants to file \n     more quickly in order to establish an early filing date. \n     Early filing leads to early disclosure of technology to the \n     public, enabling other parties to build on and improve the \n     technology. (Applicants who plan to file afterward in other \n     countries already have the incentive to file quickly in the \n     U.S.)\n       Makes feasible the introduction of post-grant opposition \n     proceedings to improve the quality of patents, by reducing \n     the issues that could be raised in a post-grant proceeding, \n     thereby limiting costs and delay.\n       Follows up on changes already made by Congress that (1) \n     established inexpensive and easy-to-file provisional patent \n     applications and, (2) in order to comply with treaty \n     obligations, allowed foreign inventors to participate in U.S. \n     patent interference proceedings.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            The Coalition for 21st\n\n\n                                         Century Patent Reform\n\n Bipartisan Efforts Move Strong Patent Reform Bill Forward in Senate--\n    Coalition Supports Commitment to Improve Patent System for All \n                               Inventors\n\n       Washington, DC.--Gary Griswold of the Coalition for 21st \n     Century Patent Reform today released the following statement \n     after the Senate Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly approved \n     S. 23, The Patent Reform Act of 2011. The Coalition \n     appreciates the strong bipartisan support of the bill in the \n     committee and the recognition by the Senators that patent \n     reform will spur innovation and help create jobs across all \n     business sectors.\n       ``Our Coalition is grateful for the bipartisan vote in \n     support of the legislation and the Senators' hard work to \n     craft legislation that will improve the patent system for all \n     the nation's innovators. It is very encouraging to have the \n     committee's overwhelming support for the legislation as it \n     moves to the Senate floor. We recognize Senators will \n     continue to fine-tune the language of the bill and we look \n     forward to working actively with them to address outstanding \n     issues.\n       The members of our Coalition will be working with other \n     inventors and innovators in the coming weeks to communicate \n     with all Senators as well as members of the House about the \n     importance of this legislation for jobs, promoting \n     innovation, and solidifying our global competitiveness.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Cross-Sector Manufacturers & Innovators In Support of S. 23\n\n       3M, Air Liquide, Air Products, BP, Bridgestone American \n     Holdings, Inc., Cargill, Caterpillar, Coalition for Patent \n     and Trademark Information Dissemination, Coalition for 21st \n     Century Patent Reform, Cummins.\n       The Dow Chemical Company, DuPont, Eastman Chemical Company, \n     ExxonMobil, General Electric, General Mills, Henkel \n     Corporation, Honeywell, Intellectual Property Owners \n     Association.\n       Illinois Tool Works, Kodak, Milliken and Company, Monsanto, \n     Northrop Grumman, PepsiCo, Inc., Proctor & Gamble, United \n     Technologies, USG Corporation, Weyerhaeuser.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 114\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 114.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nUtah on the Senate floor, a man who has worked for years on this issue \nand has made every effort to keep it bipartisan.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. He has been one of the leaders the whole time I \nhave been on that committee with regard to intellectual property \nissues. It has always been a pleasure to work with him and his staff. \nThey are good people.\n  This is a particularly important bill. It is only the first step, \nonce we bring it up and hopefully pass it, and then the House will \nbring up their bill. There are likely to be differences between the \ntwo, and we will have to get together in conference to resolve those \ndifferences. So those who might have some angst about this particular \nbill, give it time. We will be working diligently--the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, myself, and others, including, of course, our \nranking member, Senator Grassley--we will be working diligently to try \nand resolve these\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\nproblems and hopefully we will end up with a bill that everybody in \nthis country should recognize as what needs to be done to keep us at \nthe forefront of all technological innovation in this world.\n  I rise today to express my support for the pending patent reform \nlegislation before us. As many know, several of my colleagues and I \nhave been working together on this bill for several Congresses. I \nespecially wish to recognize the ongoing efforts of our Judiciary \nCommittee chairman, Pat Leahy. Over the years he and I have worked \ntirelessly to bring about long overdue reform to our Nation's patent \nsystem. I also wish to recognize the efforts of the Judiciary Committee \nranking member, Chuck Grassley, as well as many of my Senate colleagues \nwho have been instrumental in forging the compromise before us today \nwhich, in my opinion, is the first step in trying to arrive at a final \nconsensus bill.\n  Similarly, no enumeration would be complete without recognizing the \nconsiderable work that has been done by our colleagues over in the \nHouse of Representatives. House Judiciary Committee chairman Lamar \nSmith has been a leader on patent reform legislation for many years. \nHis vision, his expertise, and his leadership are highly respected and \nappreciated by me, by my colleagues as well, and by many throughout the \npatent community.\n  I also wish to specifically acknowledge the invaluable contributions \nof Representatives John Conyers, Howard Berman, Bob Goodlatte, Howard \nCoble, Darrell Issa, and Zoe Lofgren. They have all been very effective \npeople with regard to these very important issues. They have been \nstalwarts in underscoring the vital need to reform our patent system. I \nlook forward to seeing the results of their process and working with \nthem to complete this important task.\n  Most of us are very familiar with the history of patent legislation, \nbut it bears repeating that we have not had meaningful reform to our \npatent system in well over a half century--not any meaningful reform \nwhatsoever, even though many things have changed during these \nintervening years--courts have instituted welcome changes to our patent \nsystem, a lot of technology has changed, and a lot of innovation has \noccurred.\n  I am not going to spend my time today on a history lesson. Instead, I \nurge everyone to consider not the past, but to look forward to the \nfuture, and that future begins with examining our present. The Nation's \ncurrent economic situation requires that we take advantage of our \ningenuity that has made America the economic envy of the world.\n  If enacted, the American Invents Act would move the United States to \na first-inventor-to-file system, which will create a system that is \nmore transparent, objective, and predictable for the patentee. In \naddition, transitioning to a first-to-inventor-to-file system will \nfacilitate harmonization with other patent offices across the world and \ncontribute to ongoing work-sharing processes.\n  The bill will also establish another means to administratively \nchallenge the validity of a patent at the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice, USPTO--creating a cost-effective alternative to formal \nlitigation, which will further enhance our patent system.\n  Patent owners will be able to improve the quality of their patents \nthrough a new supplemental examination process. The bill further \nprevents patents from being issued on claims for tax strategies and \nprovides fee-setting authority for the USPTO Director to ensure the \nOffice is properly funded.\n  This bipartisan bill also contains provisions on venue to curb forum \nshopping; changes to the best mode disclosure requirement; increased \nincentives for government laboratories to commercialize inventions; \nrestrictions on false marking claims, and removes restrictions on the \nresidency of Federal Circuit judges.\n  For me, it is pretty simple. Patent reform is more than words on \npaper. It is about jobs and the positive impact they have on our \neconomy. Chairman Leahy understands this connection and has wisely \nnamed the bill the America Invents Act of 2011.\n  While we debate this important legislation, it is crucial that we \nkeep the creation of jobs and economic prosperity at the forefront of \nour thoughts. After all, patents encourage technological advancement by \nproviding incentives to invent, to invest in, and to disclose new \ntechnology. Now more than ever we must ensure efficiency and increased \nquality in the issuance of patents. This, in turn, will create an \nenvironment that fosters entrepreneurship and the creation of new jobs, \nthereby contributing to growth within all sectors of our economy.\n  If we think about it, one single deployed patent has a ripple effect \nthat works like this: A properly examined patent, promptly issued by \nthe USPTO, creates jobs--jobs that are dedicated to developing and \nproducing new products and services. Unfortunately, the current USPTO \nbacklog now exceeds 700,000 applicants. The sheer volume of the patent \napplications not only reflects the vibrant, innovative spirit that has \nmade America a worldwide innovative leader in science, education, and \ntechnology, but the patent backlog also represents dynamic economic \ngrowth waiting to be unleashed. We cannot afford to go down this path \nany longer. We need to take advantage of this opportunity to expand our \neconomy.\n  During consideration of the America Invents Act, I encourage my \ncolleagues to be mindful that legislation is rarely without its \nimperfections, and we have a tremendous chance to take much needed \naction. To those who believe otherwise, rest assured my intent is to do \nno harm. But I want the legislative process to move forward. It is long \noverdue.\n  I urge my colleagues to participate in the debate and vote on the \namendments they think will strengthen the bill. There are some \nproposals that I believe merit serious consideration by all of us. At \nthe end of the day, the passage of this bill will update our patent \nsystem, help strengthen our economy, and provide a springboard for \nfurther improvements to our intellectual property laws.\n  I have every confidence that we can come together and act in a \nbipartisan manner. The stakes are simply too high for us not to seize \nthis moment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 23. We probably \nhave a lot of amendments, but right now we are talking about the bill. \nThe America Invents Act is what it is called. I should express my \ngratitude to those others who have helped so much on this and, quite \nfrankly, more involved on this bill than I have been, including \nChairman Leahy, Senator Hatch, Senator Sessions, and Senator Kyl.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. Over the past 5 years or so, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has been considering comprehensive patent reform. \nChairman Leahy has engaged Senators on both sides of the aisle as well \nas a wide range of groups on the outside. His efforts have been pivotal \nin bringing together diverse views and crafting a reasonable compromise \nbill. In fact, the bill is supported by a large number of industries \nand other stakeholders from the U.S. patent community.\n  I commend the leadership of Chairman Leahy as well as the leadership \nof Senator Hatch for getting us to where we are at this point. \nIntellectual property rights are extremely important to our Nation's \neconomy. An effective and efficient patent system will help promote \ninnovation and technological advancement in America and make life \nbetter for us all. An effective and efficient patent system also will \nhelp provide stimulus for businesses and obviously generate many new \njobs. Everyone agrees we need a well-functioning patent and trademark \noffice within our government so that it can complete its work in a \ntimely manner.\n  We should find ways to help the Patent and Trademark Office speed up \nthe patent application process and eliminate the current backlog it is \nexperiencing. We should reduce costs and decrease abusive litigation \nand improve certainty in the patent process and strengthen patent \nquality. The America Invents Act will help do all of these things.\n  The bipartisan bill before us will update and upgrade the U.S. patent \nsystem. It will enhance transparency and patent quality, and it will \nensure that the Patent and Trademark Office has\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\nthe tools and funding it needs to cut its backlog and process patent \napplications more quickly.\n  The improvements to the patent system contained in our bill will help \nspur economic prosperity and job creation. I am pleased to support it.\n  Specifically, the bill would improve patent quality by establishing \nthe opportunity for third parties to submit prior art and other \ninformation related to a pending application for consideration by a \npatent examiner. By allowing prior art to be submitted earlier in the \nprocess and explained to the office, patent examiners will be able to \nissue higher quality patents.\n  The bill would create a ``first window'' post-grant opposition \nproceeding open for 9 months after the grant of a patent. This would \nallow the Patent and Trademark Office to weed out patents that should \nnot have been issued in the first place.\n  This new post-grant review process--which was recommended in a 2004 \nreport issued by the National Academy of Sciences--would enable early \nchallenges to patents, but also protect the rights of inventors and \npatent owners against endless litigation. The reason we want to ensure \nthat the Patent and Trademark Office issues high quality patents is to \nincentivize investment in truly innovative technological advances and \nprovide more certainty for investors in these inventions.\n  In addition, the bill would improve the current inter partes \nadministrative process for challenging the validity of a patent. It \nwould establish an adversarial inter partes review, with a higher \nthreshold for initiating a proceeding and procedural safeguards to \nprevent a challenger from using the process to harass patent owners. It \nalso would include a strengthened estoppel standard to prevent \npetitioners from raising in a subsequent challenge the same patent \nissues that were raised or reasonably could have been raised in a prior \nchallenge. The bill would significantly reduce the ability to use post-\ngrant procedures for abusive serial challenges to patents. These new \nprocedures would also provide faster, less costly alternatives to civil \nlitigation to challenge patents.\n  The bill would institute a gatekeeping role for the court to assess \nthe legal basis for damages and jury instructions. This would provide \nmore certainty in damages calculation and promote uniformity and \nfairness. The bill also would transition the United States to a first-\ninventor to file system, simplifying the application process and \ncoordinating it with our trading partners. This change will reduce \ncosts and help improve the competitiveness of American inventors \nabroad.\n  Further, the bill would provide fee setting authority for the Patent \nTrademark Office Director to ensure that the Patent and Trademark \nOffice is properly funded and can reduce its current backlog of patent \napplications.\n  The bill also would mandate a reduction of fees by 50 percent for \nsmall entities and 75 percent for micro-entities.\n  I want to particularly thank Chairman Leahy for working with me and \nSenator Baucus on a provision that would curtail patents on tax \nstrategies. These patents encumber the ability of taxpayers and their \nadvisers to use the tax law freely, interfering with the voluntary tax \ncompliance system. Tax strategy patents undermine the fairness of the \nFederal tax system by removing from the public domain ways to satisfy a \ntaxpayer's legal obligations. If firms or individuals hold patents for \nthese strategies, some taxpayers could face fees simply for complying \nwith the Tax Code. Moreover, tax patents provide windfalls to lawyers \nand patent holders by granting them exclusive rights to use tax \nloopholes, which could provide some businesses with an unfair advantage \nin our competitive market system.\n  Our provision would ensure that all taxpayers will have equal access \nto strategies to comply with the Tax Code.\n  This provision was carefully drafted with the help of the Patent and \nTrademark Office not to cover software preparation and other software, \ntools or systems used to prepare tax or information returns or manage a \ntaxpayer's finances.\n  In conclusion, the America Invents Act will protect inventors' rights \nand encourage innovation and investment in our economy. The bill will \nimprove transparency and third party participation in the patent \napplication review process. This, in turn, will strengthen patent \nquality and result in more fairness for both patent holders and patent \nchallengers. The bill will institute beneficial changes to the patent \nprocess to curb litigation abuses and improve certainty for investors \nand innovators. It will help companies do business more efficiently on \nan international basis.\n  The bill also will enhance operations of the Patent and Trademark \nOffice with administrative reforms and will give the office fee setting \nauthority to reduce backlogs and better manage its business.\n  I am pleased to support this hard fought bipartisan legislation, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIowa. As I noted before he got on the floor, he has been extremely \nimportant in working on this issue.\n  Mr. President, just so I can have a moment to speak with the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 112\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, pursuant to a conversation with the \ndistinguished committee chairman, I ask unanimous consent to \ntemporarily set aside the pending amendment to call up the Toomey-\nVitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Mr. Toomey, proposes an amendment numbered 112.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that the Government prioritize all obligations on \n    the debt held by the public in the event that the debt limit is \n                                reached)\n\n         At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. FULL FAITH AND CREDIT ACT.\n\n         (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Full \n     Faith and Credit Act''.\n         (b) Prioritize Obligations on the Debt Held by the \n     Public.--In the event that the debt of the United States \n     Government, as defined in section 3101 of title 31, United \n     States Code, reaches the statutory limit, the authority of \n     the Department of the Treasury provided in section 3123 of \n     title 31, United States Code, to pay with legal tender the \n     principal and interest on debt held by the public shall take \n     priority over all other obligations incurred by the \n     Government of the United States.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this Toomey-Vitter amendment is the Full \nFaith and Credit Act--the concept that has been discussed for several \nweeks prior to this week. It is very timely, as we are all rightly \nfocused on the spending and debt issue with the Thursday deadline \ncoming up.\n  No one that I know of wants the government to be shut down in any \nway, shape, or form. No one that I know of wants any massive, \nsignificant disruption. But lots of people that I know of, including \nmany in Louisiana, want us to change business as usual in Washington, \nstarting with spending and debt. This full faith and credit amendment \nis an important step in that regard. Because of the time limitations in \nfront of us before we move to other pending business at 4:30, I have \nagreed to come back at a later time to fully lay out this Toomey-Vitter \namendment, as well as a second-degree Vitter amendment that I will \nadvance with regard to Social Security.\n  It is very important to discuss this spending, to put it on the floor \nand start this debate with vigor about spending and debt, changing the \nfiscal policy of this country so that we can get on a more sustainable \npath. There is only one thing certain about this debate; that is, if we \ndon't change the fiscal path we are on, it will lead to an economic \ndisaster.\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\n  I urge us to debate these important proposals immediately, well \nbefore the Thursday deadline, and come to a strong, positive \nresolution. I will be back on the floor soon with Senator Toomey to \nfully explain this amendment, as well as the Vitter second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand we have a unanimous consent \nagreement at 4:30 p.m. to go to two judicial nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the regular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S953-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S953-S956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF AMY TOTENBERG TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                      NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF STEVE C.

Steven \nC. Jones, of Georgia, to be . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . Steve C. \nJones, of Georgia, to be . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate, equally and divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. There is both good news and bad news represented by \ntoday's debate. The good news is that we begin another week by \nconsidering two of President Obama's judicial nominations. With \njudicial vacancies remaining over 100, nearly half of them judicial \nemergencies, the Senate's action today on 2 outstanding nominees to \nfill judicial emergency vacancies in Georgia is much needed.\n  The bad news is that we did not consider these nominations earlier, \nand that we are not considering any of the other 8 judicial nominees \nawaiting final Senate consideration and confirmation. Two of those \nnominees, Sue Myerscough and James Shadid, were each nominated to fill \nemergency vacancies on the Central District of Illinois. Their \nconfirmations would help relieve the chief judge of that district, who \nis the only active judge in the entire district. Chief Judge McCuskey \nwrote to Senator Durbin in November urging the Senate to take action to \nfill those vacancies, but we did not. Despite the desperate need in \nthat district, neither of these nominations received final Senate votes \nwhen they were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nyear. Both have now been reported unanimously again, and we should not \nfurther delay taking care of this overburdened court and the hard-\nworking Americans who depend on it.\n  I do thank, in particular, the majority leader for scheduling this \ntime, and also thank the Republican leader for his cooperation. I also \ncommend our ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Senator \nGrassley has worked with me on each of the judicial nominations that \nPresident Obama renominated this January.\n  All 13 of the judicial nominations that were unanimously reported \nlast year have now been unanimously reported, again, this year. To \ndate, five of those nominations have been confirmed and with the \nconfirmation of Amy Totenberg and Steve Jones, we will have \nreconsidered and confirmed 7 of those 13 unanimously reported judicial \nnominees.\n  The Judiciary Committee has also now considered the renomination of \nSusan Carney of Connecticut to the Second Circuit and Michael Simon to \nbe a district court judge in Oregon. More than half of the Republicans \non the Judiciary Committee voted in favor of those nominations. They \nshould be debated and confirmed without delay, as well.\n  Working with Senator Grassley, I also expect to be able to move \nforward with Judiciary Committee consideration of the renominations of \ntwo district court nominees, Edward Chen of California and Jack \nMcConnell of Rhode Island, in the next few weeks. The renomination of \nGoodwin Liu of California to the Ninth Circuit will be reexamined at a \nJudiciary Committee hearing this week, at the request of our Republican \nmembers, and then reconsidered by the committee, as well.\n  We will be holding our third confirmation hearing of the year this \nweek. It will include Professor Liu and four other judicial nominees \nfrom Tennessee, Florida, and New Jersey. At the earlier two hearings we \nconsidered eight additional judicial nominees who now await committee \napproval and Senate consideration. We are holding hearings every 2 \nweeks and hope finally to begin to bend the curve and start to lower \njudicial vacancies across the country.\n  I also commend the Senator from Iowa for his statement on February 14 \nduring which he urged the Senate to turn the page and not revisit the \nrecriminations from administrations past. I agree.\n  The nominees we consider today are both from Georgia. They were both \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee this year. Actually, \nthey were also reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nyear. They were among the 19 judicial nominees who were ready to be \nconfirmed by the Senate last year but were not. When there was \nobjection to proceeding last year, the vacancies persisted, the \nPresident had to renominate them and the Judiciary Committee had to \nreconsider their nominations. I expect the Senate will confirm them \nboth tonight. I hope we do so unanimously. Both have the support of \ntheir home State Senators. Senators Isakson and Senator Chambliss \nworked with me and with President Obama in connection with these \nnominations.\n  While I am encouraged that the Senate is proceeding today, I am \ndisappointed that we did not consider these nominees and other nominees \nfrom California, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia before \nthe Presidents Day recess. We used to be able to clear the calendar of \nnominations before a recess. All six of these judicial nominees were \napproved unanimously by every Republican and every Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee weeks before the recess. When they are considered, \nI fully expect they will be confirmed unanimously by the Senate. With \npersistently high judicial vacancies around the country, the Senate \nshould be considering judicial nominations without unnecessary delays. \nLitigants all over the country are having a hard time getting their \ncases heard in court because of the high number of vacancies. There are \nnominees pending on the calendar with unanimous support by both \nRepublicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We ought \nto at least vote on these nominations to fill the vacancies.\n  In fact, when these 2 nominations are confirmed, there will still be \nnearly 100 Federal judicial vacancies around the country. That is too \nmany and they have persisted for too long. That is why Chief Justice \nRoberts, Attorney General Holder, White House Counsel Bob Bauer, and \nmany others, including the President of the United States, have spoken \nout and urged the Senate to act.\n\n  Nearly one out of every eight Federal judgeships is vacant. That puts \nat serious risk the ability of Americans all over the country to have a \nfair hearing in court. The real price being paid for these unnecessary \ndelays is that the judges who remain are overburdened and the American \npeople who depend on them are being denied hearings and justice in a \ntimely fashion. These delays affect everyone; whether you are a \nplaintiff, a prosecutor, or a defendant.\n  Regrettably, the progress we made during the first 2 years of the \nBush administration has not been duplicated, and the progress we made \nover the 8 years from 2001 to 2009 to reduce judicial vacancies from \n110 to a low of 34 was reversed. The vacancy rate we reduced from 10 \npercent at the end of\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\nPresident Clinton's term to less than 4 percent in 2008 has now risen \nback to over 10 percent.\n  In contrast to the sharp reduction in vacancies we made during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years when the Democratically controlled \nSenate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominations, only 60 of President \nObama's judicial nominations were allowed to be considered and \nconfirmed during his first 2 years. We have not kept up with the rate \nof attrition, let alone brought the vacancies down. By now they should \nhave been cut in half. Instead, they continue to hover around 100.\n  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by \nthe Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. \nJudicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal \njudiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a \nbacklog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the \nFederal bench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with both \nDemocratic and Republican home State Senators to identify superbly \nqualified consensus nominations.\n  None of the nominations on the Executive Calendar are controversial. \nThey all have the support of their home State Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats. All have a strong commitment to the rule of law. All have \ndemonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution.\n  During President Bush's first term, his first 4 tumultuous years in \noffice, we proceeded to confirm 205 of his judicial nominations. This \nwas after 60 of President Clinton's nominations had been pocket-\nfilibustered by those on the other side of the aisle. I decided not to \ncontinue that trend and we showed good faith in moving 100 of President \nBush's nominees in the 17 months that I was chairman. During the \nremaining 31 months under Republican control, the Senate confirmed \nanother 105 judicial nominations. So far in President Obama's third \nyear in office, the Senate has only been allowed to consider 67 of his \nFederal circuit and district court nominees.\n  We remain well short of the benchmark we set during the Bush \nadministration. When we approach it, we can reduce vacancies from the \nhistorically high levels at which they have remained throughout the \nfirst 3 years of the Obama administration to the historically low level \nwe reached toward the end of the Bush administration.\n  I have often said that the 100 of us in the Senate stand in the shoes \nof over 300 million Americans. We owe it to them to do our \nconstitutional duty of voting on the President's nominations to be \nFederal judges. We owe it to them to make sure that hard-working \nAmericans are able to have their cases heard in our Federal courts.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa is going to want to speak \nand time has been reserved for him. I first yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nfrom Georgia, Senator Isakson, to commend to this body the confirmation \nof two judges who have been nominated by President Obama for the \nNorthern District of Georgia.\n  First of all, Amy Totenberg is an Atlanta lawyer who certainly has \nthe academic credentials that have prepared her well--a graduate of \nboth Radcliffe College and Harvard and also Harvard Law School. She \nbegan law practice in Atlanta in 1977 with the Law Project and then \nwent out on her own for 20 years. During her time as a solo \npractitioner, she specialized in constitutional rights litigation and \nalso became a well-known arbitrator and mediator, particularly in \nemployment and civil rights cases. She served as a court-appointed \nmonitor and mediator for the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia and has served as a special master for the U.S. District Court \nin Maryland on an institutional education reform case. Ms. Totenberg \nhas a wealth of experience on that issue, having served as general \ncounsel to the city of Atlanta's Board of Education from 1994 to 1998 \nand also having served as a part-time municipal court judge in Atlanta \nfor several years. She also has been an adjunct professor at Emory \nUniversity Law School.\n  She has been deeply involved in her community. In addition to her \nlegal activities, Ms. Totenberg has been a member of the State \nPersonnel Boards, served as a member of the Governor's Education Reform \nCommission, and given her time to Hands On Atlanta, the city's largest \nvolunteer service program.\n  I commend Ms. Totenberg for confirmation today as her name comes \nbefore this body.\n  Steve Jones has been a friend for a long time. He is a guy who, if \nyou had to pick a jurist, you would want to go before whether you are a \nlawyer, a defendant, or a plaintiff in a civil lawsuit.\n  Steve Jones is a native of Athens, GA, and attended the University of \nGeorgia both as an undergraduate and as a graduate of the law school. \nHe began his legal career as assistant district attorney before \nbecoming a municipal court judge. In 1995, he was appointed to the \nsuperior court bench for the Western Judicial Circuit, which covers \nboth Clarke and Oconee Counties, two of the fastest growing counties in \nour State. In his capacity as a superior court judge, Steve presided \nover both criminal and civil cases. He has also supervised the \ncircuit's felony drug court for 6 years.\n\n  His list of honors and awards is truly too numerous to mention here \nfor this body, but he has been awarded the State Bar of Georgia's \nDistinguished Judicial Service Award, Georgia Legal Services Program's \nGeorgia Justice Builder Award, the University of Georgia President's \nFulfilling the Dream Award, the Boy Scouts of America Distinguished \nCitizen Award, the Chief Justice Robert Benham Award for community \nservice beyond official work, and the Julian Bond Humanitarian Award.\n  He has been very active in the Athens and Clark County communities. \nSteve is a wonderful person, a great family man, a great community \ncitizen, and an outstanding jurist. He is going to make a truly \noutstanding district court judge on the northern district court in \nAtlanta.\n  I yield to my colleague, Senator Isakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to second the statements made by \nSenator Chambliss on these two nominees to the northern district of \nGeorgia court, Amy Totenberg and Steve Jones. Amy Totenberg is an \nattorney, in practice for many years, a judge, an arbitrator, a \nmediator, and an educator. She brings a wealth of experience to the \nbench in many areas, not the least of which is personnel law. In fact, \nduring her term of service to the Atlanta Board of Education in the \nmid-1990s, I was chairman of the State Board of Education and dealt \nwith the major litigation pieces that went through the system of \neducation in Georgia. I know of her competence, her ability, and the \ntrust her colleagues have in her, and I think she will be an excellent \nappointee to the northern district of Georgia bench.\n  Steve Jones is the real deal. He is a terrific individual, one of \nthose people who is so active in trying to make the community better. \nOne example is Clark County in Athens where Steve has been a superior \ncourt judge for many years, which is one of the leading and founding \ndrug courts in America, an intervention court that intervenes in those \nfirst drug cases when young people are caught for the first time, works \nwith them as an advocate and as a mentor to see to it they never return \nto drugs and therefore never return to crime. That is just one example \nof his intensity in trying to make his community better.\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\n  He is respected by lawyers throughout the circuit, he is respected by \nhis fellow judges, and he is deeply respected by me as an individual \nwho brings great credit to the State and great credit to the bench.\n  I urge all our colleagues tonight on the vote for Steve Jones and Amy \nTotenberg to unanimously support both of those nominees to the northern \ndistrict of Georgia bench.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are continuing in our cooperative \neffort to fill vacancies in the Federal judiciary that have been \ndesignated as judicial emergencies. Today, the Senate will confirm two \nmore of President Obama's judicial nominees. I am pleased we are moving \nforward on consensus nominees who will lessen the burden on our \noverworked courts.\n  My Republican colleagues and I continue to demonstrate our ability \nand desire to work with the President and the Democratic majority. We \nwill have confirmed 7 judicial nominees in just 17 short days the \nSenate has been in session this Congress. We have reported out of \ncommittee a total of 15 judicial nominees, or 29 percent of the total \nnominees submitted. We have already held two hearings in committee on \neight judicial nominees, with additional nominees scheduled for a \nhearing later this week. With this quick and productive pace, we have \ntaken positive action on 55 percent of the judicial nominations sent to \nthe committee this year.\n  I continue to work with the chairman to ensure all nominees are \nafforded a fair but thorough process, in a timely manner. I have \nappreciated the chairman's courtesy as we work together to set \nschedules and agendas. It is imperative that the administration work \nwith us, as well, to fill vacancies. I am particularly concerned about \nthose seats designated as judicial emergencies.\n  We continue to hear about the high judicial vacancy rate. I think the \nrecord is clear that the Senate is addressing that issue in vigorous \nmanner. However, I continue to note that the President has failed to \nsubmit a nomination for over half of the vacancies. For judicial \nemergencies, over 57 percent of those seats have no nominee.\n  The two vacancies we are filling today took some time for a \nnomination to be sent to the Senate. Both seats became vacant in \nDecember 2008, at the end of the Bush administration. It took President \nObama over a year to name a nominee for one seat, and nearly a year and \na half to nominate for the other seat. So those who are concerned about \na high vacancy rate in the Federal judiciary should pay attention to \nthe nomination process, not just Senate confirmations.\n  I will say a few words about the nominees who are scheduled to have \nvotes today. I thank our leadership for the reasonable arrangement that \nwas reached to consider these nominations.\n  First, Amy Totenberg is nominated to be a U.S. district court judge \nfor the Northern District of Georgia. She received her A.B., magna cum \nlaude, and her J.D. from Harvard University. Upon graduation, she \njoined the Law Project as a partner, where she focused on Federal \nconstitutional and employment law. She left the Law Project to become a \nsolo practitioner where she maintained a general civil practice. Ms. \nTotenberg also served as municipal court judge for Atlanta, and was \nappointed by the Atlanta Board of Education as the first in-house \ngeneral counsel for the Atlanta Public School District.\n\n  Over the past decade, while maintaining a solo practice, Ms. \nTotenberg has spent the majority of her time as a special master, \nmonitor, and arbitrator/monitor for the U.S. district courts in \nMaryland and Washington, DC. The American Bar Association Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated her ``Well-\nQualified.''\n  Our second nominee, Steve C. Jones, is also nominated to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Northern District of Georgia. Judge Jones \nreceived his B.B.A. and his J.D. from the University of Georgia.\n  An experienced jurist, he began his legal career as an assistant \ndistrict attorney for the Western judicial District of Georgia. In \n1993, Judge Jones began service as a municipal court judge for Athens-\nClarke County, GA. He was appointed by Governor Zell Miller, in 1995, \nto serve as a superior court judge for the Western Judicial Circuit. He \nwas subsequently re-elected four times and is the presiding judge for \nthe Felony Drug Court. Aside from his daily duties to the bench, Judge \nJones was appointed by the Georgia Supreme Court to serve on the \nJudicial Qualifications Commission. He also functioned as its chairman \nfrom 2002 to 2006. On and off the bench, Judge Jones has contributed to \nhis community. He has invested time to help Georgia Legal Services, as \nwell as a local anti-poverty initiative, Partners for a Prosperous \nAthens/OneAthens. The American Bar Association Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him ``Well-Qualified.''\n  I support these two nominees, and congratulate them for their \nachievement and public service. I will continue to work with the \nchairman to move forward on consensus nominees, as we have done with \nthese two nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the nomination of Amy Totenberg, of \nGeorgia, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Georgia is confirmed.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Steve C. Jones, of Georgia, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Northern District of Georgia?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand there has been a request for a \nrollcall vote on Judge Jones, although I would recommend if we have \nsuch it be unanimous. I see the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nIsakson, on the floor. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Colorado \nhas an amendment that could be disposed of quickly and which is \nagreeable to both sides.\n  I yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 116\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Leahy, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Hatch, and all of the members of the Judiciary Committee for \ntheir hard work on patent reform. Moving this bill forward has been a \ndifficult task. I look forward to supporting the bill as we are in the \nprocess of amending it and improving it.\n  This legislation is critical for our economic growth if we are going \nto rebuild our economy and win the future. We need to make sure our \npatent system promotes research and development, investment, job \ncreation, and global competitiveness.\n  This evening, I want to call up two amendments to this legislation \nthat I believe address the need for efficiency and quality at the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 116, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Bennet] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 116.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the fee amounts paid by small entities requesting \n         prioritized examination under Three-Track Examination)\n\n       On page 86, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       (i) Reduction in Fees for Small Entity Patents.--The \n     Director shall reduce fees for providing prioritized \n     examination of utility and plant patent applications by 50 \n     percent for small entities that qualify for reduced fees \n     under section 41(h)(1) of title 35, United States Code, so \n     long as the fees of the prioritized examination program are \n     set to recover the estimated cost of the program.\n       On page 86, line 9, strike ``(i)'' and insert ``(j)''.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. My first amendment, cosponsored by Senator Ayotte, can \nhelp small businesses utilize the Patent Office's Track I program by \nreducing their fees for participating. Track I allows applicants to get \ntheir patent processed more quickly, but the cost can be burdensome for \nsmall entities. This amendment would reduce small business costs by 50 \npercent.\n  This Track I program will give applicants the opportunity for \nprioritized examination of a patent within 12 months of its filing \ndate. On average, the pendency period for first action was 25.7 months \nin 2010 and 35.3 months for final disposition. By moving this process \nalong for small businesses, we will stimulate business activity and \ncreate jobs.\n  The 50-percent discount is in line with other small entity filing fee \ndiscounts offered by the Patent and Trademark Office and will ensure \nstartups and smaller inventors will be at a more level playing field in \norder to take advantage of Track I.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my small business amendment at \nthe appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Colorado. When it comes to a vote, I think it will probably be \nunanimous. I suspect there will not even be a requirement for a \nrollcall vote. It does have this mandatory reduction in fees for small \nbusinesses at the Patent Office. I know the Senator is a strong \nadvocate for small business in Colorado. The Patent Office has a \nbacklog of more than 700,000 applications that haven't yet had a first \nresponse. This hits small businesses and independent ventures \nparticularly hard because they can least afford a delay in receiving \ntheir rights. They have done a lot to reduce that backlog, but they \nneed this legislation to finish it. They have the fast track process, \nwhere applicants pay additional fees to cover the costs and the \nexaminers work overtime. Not all small businesses can afford the fast \ntrack application fee, and the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet, \nwisely recognized that not all can afford that.\n  His amendment will ensure that small businesses and independent \nvendors will receive a 50-percent reduction in the fee. When the time \ncomes for a vote, I will strongly support the amendment. I suspect both \nsides will strongly support it. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership and \nfor his kind words about the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 117\n\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up my second amendment, which is currently at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Bennet] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 117.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To establish additional USPTO satellite offices)\n\n       On page 104, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 18. SATELLITE OFFICES.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Subject to available resources, the \n     Director shall establish 3 or more satellite offices in the \n     United States to carry out the responsibilities of the Patent \n     and Trademark Office.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the satellite offices \n     established under subsection (a) are to--\n       (1) increase outreach activities to better connect patent \n     filers and innovators with the Patent and Trademark Office;\n       (2) enhance patent examiner retention;\n       (3) improve recruitment of patent examiners; and\n       (4) decrease the number of patent applications waiting for \n     examination and improve the quality of patent examination.\n       (c) Required Considerations.--In selecting the locale of \n     each satellite office to be established under subsection (a), \n     the Director shall--\n       (1) ensure geographic diversity among the offices, \n     including by ensuring that such offices are established in \n     different States and regions throughout the Nation; and\n       (2) rely upon any previous evaluations by the Patent and \n     Trademark Office of potential locales for satellite offices, \n     including any evaluations prepared as part of the Patent and \n     Trademark Office's Nationwide Workforce Program that resulted \n     in the 2010 selection of Detroit, Michigan as the first ever \n     satellite office of the Patent and Trademark Office.\n       (d) Phase-in.--The Director shall satisfy the requirements \n     of subsection (a) over the 3-year period beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Report to Congress.--Not later than the end of the \n     first fiscal year that occurs after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Director \n     shall submit a report to Congress on--\n       (1) the rationale of the Director in selecting the locale \n     of any satellite office required under subsection (a);\n       (2) the progress of the Director in establishing all such \n     satellite offices; and\n       (3) whether the operation of existing satellite offices is \n     achieving the purposes required under subsection (b).\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n       (2) Patent and trademark office.--The term ``Patent and \n     Trademark Office'' means the United States Patent and \n     Trademark Office.\n       On page 104, line 23, strike ``SEC. 18.'' and insert ``SEC. \n     19.''.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, my amendment provides for the \nestablishment of three regional satellite PTO\n\n[[Page S957]]\n\noffices in the next 3 years. The Patent and Trademark Office has \nstruggled to hire and retain over 6,000 examiners at a single location \nin Alexandria, VA. This has resulted in one-third of patent examiners \nhaving been with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for less than 3 \nyears. Ideally, the Patent and Trademark Office would recruit examiners \nfrom all across the country, leveraging regional expertise.\n  The PTO recently recognized this weakness in our patent \ninfrastructure by announcing an initial satellite pilot in Detroit, MI. \nMy amendment seeks to support this effort and further connect \ninnovators to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n  The establishment of satellite offices will help the USPTO to recruit \nand retain workers from across the country. Regional offices will draw \nlocal scientists, engineers, and patent attorneys into the USPTO, which \nadd real-world expertise to the patent review process.\n  Regional satellite offices will also increase outreach activities and \nconnection to patent filers, enhance the ability of the USPTO to \nrecruit and retain patent examiners, and improve the quality and \npendency for patent applications.\n  Europe currently uses four patent offices as a recruitment tool and \nis known for the ability to attract and retain highly qualified \nexaminers. In short, the limitations of our lone patent office are \nplacing our economy at a competitive disadvantage. It is essential, \ntherefore, that we establish satellite offices in locations that will \nconnect innovators and businesses across the country.\n  I ask Senators to support my amendment at the appropriate time.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his leadership, and I look forward to \nworking with him and the rest of this body to craft a good piece of \nlegislation that helps America take the lead in the world's \nincreasingly competitive innovation economy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the Senator has advocated for \nsatellite offices. His amendment speaks for geographic diversity. \nOtherwise, every one of us would be asking for one in our State. \nVermont, which receives more patents per capita than any other State in \nthe Union, would be asking for one, and so forth. He does not try to \ntilt the balance in favor of a particular State but he calls for \ngeographic diversity. That is very wise. When the amendment comes to a \nvote, I will be there to support it.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 117.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Was that set aside so he could introduce his second \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is his second amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is what is pending now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 115\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 115 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, once the Senator has introduced his \namendment and has spoken, will he be willing to set that aside so that \nother amendments on the patent bill can come up?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 115.\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate in support of a balanced \n                 budget amendment to the Constitution)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should pass and \n     the States should agree to an amendment to the Constitution \n     requiring a Federal balanced budget.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. This is a self-explanatory amendment. I am a supporter of \nthis legislation, the patent reform bill. I also point out that this \namendment does not bring about any substantive change to that \nlegislation, nor does it lock anyone into a particular variation of a \nbalanced budget amendment proposal.\n  I am happy to work out an agreement as to the timing for a possible \nvote, and I hope we can get to that sometime soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes, with the time to be shared \nbetween myself and Senator Risch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S957-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S957-S959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF FORMER SENATOR JAMES A. McCLURE\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, Senator Risch and I are here today--in \nfact, I note we are joined on the floor by our former colleague Senator \nLarry Craig--to honor one of Idaho's greatest statesmen who passed away \non Saturday. We rise to honor the distinguished life of Senator James \nA. McClure, a mentor and a dear friend of mine. As I indicated, Senator \nCraig is here. Senator Craig is the one who followed Senator McClure \ninto the seat in the Senate. We appreciate him making the effort to get \nhere to also share his concerns and condolences, and frankly, to help \nhonor Senator McClure.\n  I join Senator McClure's wife Louise and their family and friends and \nall of Idaho in mourning the passing of Senator McClure and honoring \nhis great legacy. His sound guidance, strong advocacy for Idaho, and \nhis personal encouragement will be missed by all of us, but definitely \nnot forgotten.\n  Throughout his decades of public service, Jim McClure set a standard \nfor public servants that will endure for generations. Senator McClure \ndedicated much of his life to honorable service to our Nation. At the \nage of 18, he joined the U.S. Navy and served honorably in World War \nII. He then returned to Idaho and attended law school at the University \nof Idaho, worked as a prosecuting attorney for Payette County, and \nserved in the Idaho State Senate. With 6 years in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and 18 years in the U.S. Senate, his exemplary service \nin the Congress spanned 24 years.\n  His unfailing good will, respect for others, and his essential \nWestern conservatism helped him to maintain throughout his life the \nkind of service that is still the best model for how to engage in \ntoday's public policy debates. He was recognized by all as a gentleman \nbut a powerful advocate.\n  Senator McClure's legacy as a Congressman and a Senator is broad, and \non many issues, such as energy and natural resource management, his \nservice to Idaho is historic. Jim utilized his service as chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to advocate for \nIdaho issues and their ideals. He also helped to guide the Senate \nthrough his chairmanship of the Senate Republican Conference from 1981 \nto 1985. Jim worked diligently to achieve solutions to Idaho and \nnational challenges. He also had a forward-thinking focus on fiscal \ndiscipline--one that we could well use in the Senate today--and on \nenergy independence, another critical issue which we continue to battle \nfor today. These are critical issues he helped set the foundation for \nand, frankly, which his wisdom would have helped to solve.\n  Jim was a friend and a role model for me and I am sure for many \nothers in Idaho and throughout the Nation. His dedication, kind \ntreatment of others, and skillful proactive and principled approach are \nlong going to endure. He will be sorely missed, but his lifetime of \naccomplishments will be with the people of Idaho forever.\n  I offer my sympathy and my love to Louise and to the entire McClure \nfamily and to Jim's many friends and associates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the time to Senator Risch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, we have come to the floor to mourn the loss \nof a great statesman in Idaho. Jim McClure was loved uniformly across\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\nthe State of Idaho and had dedicated his entire life to public service, \nfirst as a prosecuting attorney in Payette County, ID, and then, of \ncourse, the State senate and Congress--the House of Representatives and \nthen the Senate of the United States.\n  From a little historical background, Jim McClure, when he was elected \nto this body, was elected to the Shoup seat. The Shoup seat was first \nheld by Senator Shoup, who was the last territorial Governor of Idaho, \nthe first State Governor of Idaho, and the first Senator to hold that \nseat. Jim McClure was the ninth person to hold that seat. In the \ninterim, it was held by Borah. Both Shoup and Borah have statues in \nStatuary Hall.\n  Prior to my election as the 11th person to hold this seat, the seat \nwas held by our distinguished colleague, Senator Craig, who has joined \nSenator Crapo and I on the floor and I am sure joins us in our remarks \nand condolences to the McClure family.\n  Jim McClure was a family man. He was truly dedicated to his wife \nLouise and his children. Back when Jim served here, many of the Members \nactually moved here as opposed to going home on the weekends, as most \nof us do today. The McClure family spent a lot of time here. But they \ndid spend their summers--that is when the Senate was out most of the \nsummer--they did spend their summers in Idaho and other times in Idaho.\n  Jim McClure was very dedicated to a couple important issues, the \nfirst one being fiscal. Jim McClure would come back to Idaho and warn \nabout the spending habits this Congress had. In fact, I knew Jim \nMcClure since I was a young prosecutor in the 1960s. I think Jim \nMcClure was the first one I ever heard speak directly about the danger \nthis Congress was leading this country into with its spending habits. \nHad his advice been followed back then, we would not be, as a country, \nin the difficulties we are today.\n  Secondly, Jim's issue was energy. Jim spent time as chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Indeed, I sit on that \ncommittee today. Senator Craig sat on it before me, Senator McClure \nbefore him, and Senator Jordan before Jim McClure. Indeed, we cannot \nrecall when we did not have anyone from Idaho serving on that \ncommittee. Indeed, it was the Shoup seat that has sat on that committee \nfor as long as any of us can remember.\n  As a testament to the larger-than-life persona that Jim McClure had, \nthe following are named after Jim McClure in Idaho. In 1995, the \nCollege of Mines and Earth Resources at the University of Idaho was \ndedicated as the James A. McClure Hall. In December of 2001, the \nFederal building and U.S. courthouse in Boise, ID, was renamed for Jim \nMcClure. In 2007, in Moscow, ID, the University of Idaho named their \nbureau of public affairs research the James A. and Louise McClure \nCenter for Public Policy Research.\n  All of this recaps in certainly an inadequate way the many things Jim \nMcClure did for the people of Idaho, indeed for the people of America \nand the people of the world, as he led in the Senate.\n  I wish to close, briefly, with what I knew about Jim McClure and I \nthink what those of us here knew about Jim McClure and what he is \nremembered for in the Senate.\n  In the media today, we see a lot of rancor and we see a lot of \narguing and a lot of hostility involved in the political process. If I \ncan say one thing about Jim McClure, it is that what he brought to the \nentire process was civility. No matter how tough sledding got, no \nmatter how disagreements escalated, Jim McClure always kept it level. \nHe always kept it at a very civil tone, and Jim McClure approached \neverything with a gentle sense of humor, which many times diffused \nthings that could have gotten out of hand.\n  To his family, again, we express our deep condolences, and the people \nof the State of Idaho mourn today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, Senator Risch's comments prompted me to \nthink of a time when I was first elected to the House of \nRepresentatives. Senator McClure had long been counseling and working \nwith me and helping me to see the kind of civility about which Senator \nRisch talked and also that strong, powerful leadership he brought to \nissues.\n  When I was first elected to the House of Representatives--I began \nthinking as Senator Risch was talking--Jim McClure and Louise invited \nme to go to dinner. Jim and Louise sat with me for an evening right \nhere in Washington, DC, at a local restaurant. We just talked about \npolitics, about Idaho, about America, about the world, and about how \none should lead on issues as they dealt with them in Congress.\n  I have to tell you, it would take too long to repeat all the lessons \nI learned that night that were taught to me by Senator McClure as he \nmade that extra step to reach out. I said in my initial remarks he was \na mentor and a role model for me. I truly mean that.\n  I had to add those comments as I thought about that while Senator \nRisch was talking.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 78, relative to the death of Senator James A. \nMcClure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 78) relative to the death of James \n     Albertus McClure, former United States Senator for the State \n     of Idaho.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I note this resolution was submitted \nearlier today by Senator Risch and myself. In fact, our leadership \nhelped in preparing it and bringing it forward. All 100 Senators are \ncosponsors of this resolution. I think it a fitting tribute to the \nrespect and honor in which Senator James A. McClure is held by this \nSenate.\n  Before I ask unanimous consent to take action on the resolution, I \nask if Senator Risch has anything further he wishes to add.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, we have gone through the various attributes \nfor which Jim McClure was known. It is a true loss to Idaho and a true \nloss to the Nation. He was held in such high regard by all Idahoans. I \nam proud to be the person holding his seat.\n  He was a cofounder and a charter member of the steering committee on \nthe Republican side. The steering committee is a group that was brought \ntogether to talk about and develop policies from a conservative \nstandpoint for the Nation. It certainly is something that has been very \nhelpful to the Republican Conference over the many years. Senator \nMcClure will be remembered for that, and we certainly thank him for \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Before I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, I know \nLouise and a number of Senator McClure's family and friends are \nwatching. This is a short but meaningful resolution. I believe I should \nread it in its entirety:\n\n       Relative to the death of James Albertus McClure, former \n     United States Senator for the State of Idaho.\n       Whereas James A. McClure served in the United States Navy \n     during World War II;\n       Whereas James A. McClure served in the state of Idaho as a \n     prosecuting attorney, a city attorney, a member of the Idaho \n     state Senate, and as a member of the United States House of \n     Representatives;\n       Whereas James A.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a tribute to honor Robert \nW. Bogle and the Philadelphia Tribune newspaper. Bob Bogle's family and \nmany of his friends are with us in Washington, DC. They traveled from \nPhiladelphia and other parts of our State and beyond to be with us as \nwe pay tribute to his leadership and his commitment to the Philadelphia \nAfrican-American community and to all the people in the city of \nPhiladelphia and southeast Pennsylvania. I rise as well to honor the \nrole the Philadelphia Tribune, as a leader in the Black press, has \nplayed in communities throughout our State.\n  This is the fifth year I have come to the floor of the Senate to \nhonor a prominent African-American Pennsylvanian as part of the \ncelebration of Black History Month. Bob Bogle today joins the Reverend \nLeon Sullivan, Judge Leon Higginbotham, former U.S. Transportation \nSecretary Bill Coleman, and former Pennsylvania Secretary of the \nCommonwealth C. Delores Tucker in being recognized this month in this \nway.\n  Today, I will talk about Bob Bogle and the Philadelphia Tribune and, \nin a larger sense, the history and the future of the Black press in \nPennsylvania and across the country.\n  From the time Bob was a young child, his life has been inseparable \nfrom the Philadelphia Tribune. Bob's father John Bogle was the \nadvertising director at the Philadelphia Tribune. Bob still reminisces \nabout the playground he lived in, which was much different than the \nplaygrounds in which most children live. As early as age 7, Bob would \nroam the Tribune building while waiting for his father to finish work. \nBertha Godfrey, employed by the Tribune since 1946 and now senior vice \npresident, recalls a young Bob Bogle wandering around curiously, \nobserving the production department and other areas of the production \nof the Philadelphia Tribune newspaper.\n  In 1970, Bob Bogle started selling advertising for the Tribune and \nquickly worked his way up, impressing his colleagues and business \nassociates alike. In 1973, he became advertising director, in 1976 \ndirector of marketing, and, by 1983, executive vice president and \ntreasurer, before becoming president and chief executive officer of the \nTribune in 1989.\n  Despite his early exposure to the Tribune, Bob did not initially plan \non a career in journalism. He attended Cheyney State College--now \nCheyney University--to study sociology, earning a B.A. in urban \nstudies. After it became clear he was going to play a role in the \nmanagement of the Tribune, he also attended the University of \nPennsylvania's Wharton School to study marketing and economics. He has \ncompleted courses of study at Temple University and the Rochester \nInstitute of Technology and continues to this day to hone his newspaper \nexpertise by participating in annual workshops in many areas of \nmarketing and advertising and publishing.\n  Bob has become a role model for Philadelphia African Americans and \nfor the community at large. He served in leadership roles in a wide \nrange of professional, civic, and social organizations. He is chairman \nof both the Hospitals and Higher Education Facilities Authority of \nPhiladelphia and the Council of Trustees at Cheyney University, and \nserves as a commissioner of the Delaware River Port Authority. He also \nserves on the executive committee of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber \nof Commerce and on the boards of the Mann Music Center for the \nPerforming Arts, the Zoological Society of Philadelphia, the African-\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce, the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors \nBureau, and of course, The Philadelphia Tribune. In 1995 Bob became the \nfirst African American to serve on the board of U.S.-Airways Group, one \nof the Nation's largest airlines. He served two terms as president of \nthe National Newspaper Publishers Association, the nationwide trade \nassociation for Black newspapers.\n\n  Some of Bob's more recent board affiliations include the Philadelphia \nMuseum of Art Corporate Partners Board, the Pennsylvania Newspaper \nAssociation Foundation, the Academy of Vocal Arts, the Greater \nPhiladelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation and the Historical Society \nof Pennsylvania. He is also a founder and serves as a convener for the \nForum for a Better Pennsylvania, a statewide, private sector leadership \norganization committed to enhanced civic and economic inclusion for \nAfrican Americans.\n  Bob has also been honored for his service and leadership. In 2002, \nPresident George W. Bush appointed him to serve as a member of the \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture Commission. In \n2000, he received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Drexel \nUniversity in Philadelphia. In addition, Bob has been a member of so \nmany organizations too numerous to name.\n  While he is recognized as a community leader in various realms, it is \nBob's role at the Tribune and with the Black press movement that stands \nout as his life's work.\n  Today, few question that the right to a free press, as enshrined in \nthe Bill of Rights, applies to all. The right ensures that all \nAmericans can participate in a vigorous and healthy debate necessary \nfor a well-functioning democracy. But when our Constitution was first \nratified, as we recall, most African Americans were not recognized as \ncitizens and had few, if any, opportunities for participation in our \ndemocracy. It was not until a group of courageous men living in New \nYork gathered some 30 years after the ratification of the Constitution \nthat African Americans finally found an institution where they ``could \nplead their own case,'' as they said at the time.\n  In 1827, editors John Brown Russwurm and Samuel Eli Cornish published \nFreedom's Journal, the first Black newspaper in America. The newspaper \nprovided African Americans with a public square of their own, where \nthey could participate in discussions and advocate for African \nAmericans.\n  As these two distinguished leaders wrote in their first editorial, \n``Too long have others spoken for us. Too long has the public been \ndeceived by misrepresentations. . . . ''\n  While the Freedom's Journal was short-lived, it began what was no \nless than a revolution. Other Black newspapers arose and began to \nexplore subjects that were previously off-limits in the press of the \nday. New Black newspapers delved into previously unmentionable \nhardships in crafting a new identity for free and enslaved African \nAmericans. Topics such as slavery and\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\nmenial labor were examined by African Americans for African Americans. \nFor the first time in the history of our country, African Americans \nwere able to speak freely through a press of their own. In addition, \nAfrican Americans could start announcing to the world some of their \nmost precious moments in life, such as births, anniversaries, deaths, \nand other family news. The Black Press helped establish a new extended \ncommunity of African Americans all across the United States.\n\n  The Black Press expanded in the years prior to the Civil War, as over \n40 publications across the Nation provided African Americans with \nviewpoints on issues such as immigration to Africa, emancipation in the \nSouth of the United States, and, of course, abolition and freedom.\n  Frederick Douglass was one of the many who published a Black \nnewspaper in which he, like many others, urged African-American men in \nthe North to enlist in the Union Army.\n  The post-Civil War era saw a period of rapid growth for the Black \nPress. The first daily newspaper, the New Orleans Tribune, was \npublished in 1864, and newspapers continued to open across the country \nas African Americans migrated from the South.\n  By the 1880s, it became obvious that the growing African-American \npopulation in Philadelphia, PA, needed a newspaper. Christopher J. \nPerry filled the void. Following graduation from high school, Mr. Perry \nmoved to Philadelphia to start a newspaper because, he said:\n\n       For my people to make progress, they must have a newspaper \n     in which they can speak and speak out against injustice.\n\n  Mr. Perry's newspaper, the Philadelphia Tribune, often told a \ndifferent story from a perspective other than that of the city's \ntraditional newspapers. Mr. Perry and the Philadelphia Tribune quickly \nestablished themselves as leaders of the growing African-American \ncommunity in Philadelphia. The Tribune published stories highlighting \nBlack institutions across Philadelphia that were not reported by the \nmainstream papers. Mr. Perry championed the causes of the African-\nAmerican community, from covering important events to offering articles \nabout champions of social and racial equality. Additionally, he \nprovided a forum for African Americans to report on job openings, \nmusical performances, and other happenings within the African-American \nsociety.\n  After Mr. Perry passed away in May of 1921, his children continued \nthe traditions he began in the pages of the Philadelphia Tribune. The \nsecond generation of Perrys continued to fight for equality for African \nAmericans. Eugene Washington Rhodes, Mr. Perry's son-in-law, succeeded \nhim as editor. As Dorothy Anderson wrote in a tribute in 1958, ``In no \nyear since The Philadelphia Tribune first burst upon the Philadelphia \nscene was there a single edition which did not press for equal rights, \nequal opportunities and equal privileges'' for the African-American \ncommunity.\n  Eugene Rhodes continued to spotlight social issues around the city of \nPhiladelphia and around the country by focusing on the northern \nmigration during the 1920s and dangerous housing conditions for African \nAmericans in Philadelphia during the 1930s. In addition, he provided \nmuch needed support for some of the first African-American politicians \nin the city of Philadelphia, such as John Asbury and Andrew Stevens, \nthe first African Americans elected to the Pennsylvania House of \nRepresentatives. Perhaps most importantly, the Tribune led the fight \nagainst segregation in the Philadelphia School District by creating its \nown legal defense fund and publishing many editorials championing the \nequality of African Americans.\n  In 1940, the publisher of the Chicago Defender called a meeting of \nthe major publications which made up the Black Press. He proposed that \nnewspapers form an advocacy group to ensure the long-term survival of \nthe Black Press. The Philadelphia Tribune was one of the newspapers \ninvited to take part, and out of this first conference grew the \nNational Newspaper Publishers Association. Over 200 newspapers are \nmembers today, and the association provides vital services to the Black \nPress so that its members can continue to report on African-American \ncommunities and society.\n  As the current president and CEO of the Philadelphia Tribune, Bob \nBogle has continued the tradition of Christopher Perry, while leading \nthe African-American community of Philadelphia into and beyond the 21st \ncentury. The Philadelphia Tribune is now the longest operating African-\nAmerican newspaper in the Nation.\n  Recognizing Bob's leadership, the National Newspaper Publishers \nAssociation has honored the Tribune five times with the Russwurm Award, \nthe association's highest honor for ``Best Newspaper in America.'' The \naward is named for John B. Russwurm, cofounder, as I mentioned before, \nof Freedom's Journal in the 1800s.\n  Recognized as a leading member of the Black Press, Bob Bogle has \nserved two terms as president of the National Newspaper Publishers \nAssociation and is credited with increasing awareness of African-\nAmerican issues, values, and lifestyles. He is also a founding member \nand president of the African American News and Information Consortium, \na group of premier Black newspapers in some of the largest markets in \nthe United States of America.\n  Finally, Bob continues in his role as ambassador for the city of \nPhiladelphia. He sees race as a leading issue still plaguing our \nNation, but he remains relentlessly optimistic. I am quoting Bob here:\n\n       I am deeply engaged in the community. I believe that \n     Philadelphia, as the birthplace of America, is the best city \n     in America--it is diverse, it has great size; and our success \n     will come from our collective understanding of who we are. \n     The Philadelphia Tribune, though it is dedicated to covering \n     the black community, also honors diversity. We have non-\n     African Americans in every area of our business.\n\n  Of course, Bob has been not just a leader in the African-American \ncommunity but a leader in the Philadelphia community at large for many \nyears and especially active in the advancement of young African \nAmericans who live in Philadelphia and the region. He describes his \nessential philosophy this way:\n\n       To be responsible for what you do and be the best at it. We \n     need to account for what we do. Accountability means \n     responsibility and taking pride in your work and doing the \n     best you can.\n\n  So says Bob Bogle, and those are good words to live by. They are \nwords we can take to heart and strive every day in our own lives to \nlive by.\n  So I am honored to be able to offer this tribute today to Bob Bogle, \nto his team at the Philadelphia Tribune and in a larger sense the \nhistory and, most importantly, the future of the African-American \npress--so-called the Black Press--in the United States. So please join \nme today in honoring a man of strength, a man of character, \naccomplishment, and service--Robert W. Bogle of Philadelphia, PA.\n\n\n                         Christian A. Fleetwood\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a man of \nextraordinary strength, moral character, and courage, to end National \nBlack History Month on a high note. Every year, National Black History \nMonth is given a theme; this year's focus rests on the American Civil \nWar, the most divisive and destructive conflict ever witnessed in our \ngreat Nation. While many think of the Civil War as a conflict between \nWhites fought over the condition of African Americans, Blacks fought on \nboth sides of the conflict as well. After Emancipation, the Union \nArmies fielded dozens of corps of the U.S. Colored Troops, making up \napproximately 10 percent of the total fighting force fielded by the \nNorth, at roughly 180,000 troops. One of those men was named Christian \nAbraham Fleetwood. His picture rests beside me today.\n  In many aspects before the war, Fleetwood was already a rare man. \nChristian A. Fleetwood was born in Baltimore to two free persons of \ncolor, Charles and Anna Marie Fleetwood, on July 21, 1840. He was lucky \nenough to be educated by a wealthy sugar merchant, free of charge, and \ncontinued his education with the Maryland Colonization Society, before \ngraduating from the Ashmun Institute, which would later become Lincoln \nUniversity.\n  Broadening his education, he travelled to Sierra Leone and Liberia, \nbefore returning to the United States to join the Union Army to fight \nfor the freedom of the enslaved. Because of his education, Fleetwood \nwas promoted to\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\nsergeant upon enlisting, and sergeant major just a few days later. As \npart of the 4th Regiment United States Colored Infantry, he would see \naction in the Virginia and North Carolina campaigns in the 10th, 18th \nand 25th Army Corps, and would distinguish himself valorously at \nChaffin's Farm, on the outskirts of Richmond, VA, on September 29, \n1864.\n  At the age of 24, SGM Christian Fleetwood stood a mere 5 feet, 4.5 \ninches tall. Nonetheless, while marching on Confederate fortifications \nhe witnessed Alfred B. Hilton, a fellow soldier, fall wounded while \ncarrying the American flag and the Regimental Standard, which Hilton \nhimself had retrieved from a wounded comrade. Rushing forward under \nwithering fire, Fleetwood and another soldier named Charles Veale \ncaught both banners before they brushed the ground. Now bearing the \nAmerican flag, Fleetwood carried the attack forward, but retreated once \nit became clear that the unit did not have sufficient strength to \npenetrate the defenses. Returning through enemy fire to the reserve \nline, Fleetwood used his standard to rally a determined group of men \nand renewed the attack on the battlements.\n  In a fight where the 4th and 6th Regiments of U.S. Colored Troops \nsustained casualties reaching 50 percent, Fleetwood refused to give up. \nFor these actions and their contribution to victory at Chaffin's Farm, \nFleetwood, along with Veale and Hilton, were awarded the Medal of \nHonor. Fleetwood's official Medal of Honor citation reads simply: \n``Seized the colors, after 2 color bearers had been shot down, and bore \nthem nobly through the fight.'' Every officer in Fleetwood's regiment, \nall white men, submitted a petition to the War Department to have him \ncommissioned an officer, a sure sign of the respect felt by all who \nwitnessed his gallantry.\n  The medal is now part of the collection of the Smithsonian's National \nMuseum of American History, and appears in the exhibit entitled ``The \nPrice of Freedom.'' The medal's inclusion in the Smithsonian exhibit is \nalso unique. Fleetwood's daughter Edith Fleetwood donated his medal to \nthe Smithsonian Institute's National Museum in 1948. The Smithsonian \naccepted the medal, making Christian Fleetwood the first African-\nAmerican veteran to be so honored.\n  The Civil War did not call an end to Christian Fleetwood's service, \nthough he was discharged honorably on May 4, 1866. Fleetwood would go \non to organize a battalion of the D.C. National Guardsmen, and, in the \n1880s, formed Washington, DC's Colored High School Cadet Corps, which \ncounted among its graduates Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., the Nation's first \nAfrican-American general, and Wesley A. Brown, the first African-\nAmerican graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy.\n  Christian Fleetwood embodied everything Americans revere. His actions \nin the 4th Regiment from Baltimore, MD, earned him the military's \nhighest honor. He was selfless, brave, a fierce fighter for the \nabolition of slavery, and chose to dedicate his free life to service of \nhis country and his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S961-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TAHIS CASTRO\n\n  Mr. REID.

She has been instrumental in the \ngrowth of Local 86, which merged with Las Vegas' Culinary Workers Union \nLocal 226 to represent a total of 60,000 workers in Nevada today. In \naddition, she has served on the executive board of the Nevada State \nAFL-CIO.\n  Tahis has also been influential in representing Nevadans in the \npolitical sphere. In 2008, she was chosen as one of the State's five \ndelegates to the Electoral College, and she has been instrumental in \npromoting voter participation among Nevada's Latino citizens.\n  I am pleased to stand today to commend Tahis for all she has \naccomplished, and all she will continue to achieve. Along with the \nCulinary Workers Union, I congratulate Tahis for her concerted effort \nand her career of dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S961-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S961-S962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING EARLE B. COMBS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the remarkable \nlife and career of one of baseball's greatest legends, and a native of \nthe Commonwealth, the late Mr. Earle B. Combs. Known far and wide to \nfans as the Kentucky Greyhound, the Silver Fox and the Kentucky \nColonel, Earle was a prime example of a gentleman who knew the value of \nhard work and determination.\n  Earle began his journey to greatness as a child on his father's farm \nin Pebworth, Owsley County, KY, where he and his siblings would play \npickup games with homemade baseballs constructed out of leather and \nrubber trimmings from old, worn-out shoes and tightly wound string, and \nbats made with tree limbs found around the yard. Each spring, when \nwarmer weather came, the rolling hills of farmland and hollows provided \nEarle with the perfect setting to develop a love for America's pastime.\n  But, as he grew older, he decided his calling in life was to teach. \nIn 1917, Earle left his hometown of Pebworth to attend Eastern Kentucky \nState Normal School, now Eastern Kentucky University, and received his \nteaching certificate in 1919. To help pay for his education, Earle \nreturned to eastern Kentucky to teach in one-room schools in Kentucky \ntowns like Ida May and Levi. That was until destiny had other plans.\n  In 1918 after a faculty-student baseball game, Earle's abilities \ncaught the eye of Dr. Charles Keith, an Eastern Kentucky State Normal \nSchool dean and former pro player, who recommended he try out for \nEastern's team. After successfully landing a spot on the team, Earle's \ntalent on the field started to gain him some much-deserved attention. \nIn the summer of 1921, after his last season on Eastern's team, Earle \nplayed semiprofessional baseball in several Kentucky towns until he was \noffered a contract with the Louisville Colonels.\n  During his 2 years with the Colonels, Earle's miraculous talent \nearned him his career-long reputation as a line-drive hitter with \nreckless base-stealing ability. In 1924, this reputation traveled north \nall the way to New York, where the New York Yankees bought the young \nand talented Earle for $50,000.\n  In the years that followed, Earle became a leadoff hitter for the \nfamed Yankees ``Murderers Row,'' a lineup of the late 1920s and early \n1930s, and a member of the 1927 World Championship Yankees team where \nhe played alongside other greats by the names of Babe Ruth and Lou \nGehrig. He was errorless in the 16 World Series games in which he \nplayed throughout his career, and ended with a career batting average \nof .325.\n  Earle retired in 1935 after sustaining a brutal outfield injury the \nyear before, but remained a coach for the Yankees until 1944, during \nwhich he trained other baseball greats such as Joe DiMaggio. He was \nnamed to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY, in \n1970.\n  Earle coached for several other teams before returning to Madison \nCounty where he served as a banking commissioner during Governor A.B. \nChandler's second administration and on Eastern Kentucky University's \nboard of regents for 19 years, serving as chairman for 2 of those \nyears. Earle was a leader both on and off the diamond. He was known as \na loving family man, a successful businessman, and above all, a true \ngentleman. He was a devoted father and grandfather and a loyal husband \nto his childhood sweetheart, the late Ruth Combs.\n  He valued hard-work and knew the importance of higher education. \nThere is no question that Earle was someone who forever changed the \ngame of baseball, who left an impression on those he taught, and who \nleft a lasting legacy in both his community and throughout the \nCommonwealth.\n  The Booneville Sentinel recently published an article introducing a \nnew\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\nportrait of the late Earle B. Combs that was hung on the outside of the \ncourthouse in Owsley County, KY, on December 30, 2010. What an honor \nfor this athlete and legend from his hometown and home county. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Booneville Sentinel, Jan. 12, 2011]\n\n               Earle B. Combs Portrait Hung at Courthouse\n\n                          (By Rosalind Turner)\n\n       Boonesville and Owsley County officials honored one of the \n     community's most famous sons Thursday, December 30 when a \n     portrait of the late Earle B. Combs was hung on the outside \n     of the Owsley County Courthouse.\n       Earle B. Combs, a native of Pebworth and the son of James \n     Jesse and Nannie (Brandenburg) Combs, was a major league \n     baseball player, a member of the 1929 New York Yankees and \n     was named to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, In 1917, \n     Combs left Owsley at age 17 to pursue a degree in education \n     at Eastern Kentucky Normal School (Eastern Kentucky \n     University). Though he earned his degree in 1919 and taught \n     at one-room schools in Ida May and Levi, he eventually \n     changed his career path to play baseball.\n       In 1924, he earned a position as the centerfielder and \n     leadoff hitter for the famed New York Yankees ``Murderers \n     Row'' lineup of the late 1920s and early 1930s, according to \n     the Earle Bryan Combs official website. He was a member of \n     the 1927 World Champion Yankees team, which also featured \n     baseball greats Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, and is considered \n     by many to be the greatest team in baseball history.\n       As the portrait was installed on the side of the \n     courthouse, the outgoing Owsley County Judge-Executive Cale \n     Turner and Booneville Mayor Charles Long were joined by one \n     of Combs' grandsons and two great-grandsons.\n       ``We are so honored,'' said Craig Combs of Richmond, a \n     grandson with very fond memories of his grandfather. ``Thank \n     you so much.''\n       Craig Combs praised Turner, Long and others who were \n     instrumental in seeing the project to fruition. In March, \n     Craig Combs came to Owsley to speak to Holly Shouse's class \n     at Owsley County Elementary School about his grandfather. He \n     said that he was later contacted about the courthouse project \n     and gave his permission for the officials to proceed.\n       ``I was very honored,'' he said. ``I was thrilled that you \n     (the project planners) were going to include grandfather.''\n       Turner said that it has been a long time goal of Mayor \n     Long's to have a portrait in the city honoring the famed \n     baseball player.\n       ``We're tickled to be here and we're tickled that (the \n     community) thought enough of him to put his picture on the \n     side of the courthouse. (It shows) obviously, how proud they \n     are of grandfather,'' said Craig Combs, who was accompanied \n     by his sons, John. 17, who plans to study vocal music at the \n     University of Louisville, and Christopher, 22, who played \n     baseball at Madison Central, graduated from the University of \n     Evansville and is currently working on his Ph.D. at the \n     University of Texas in aerospace engineering.\n       Earle B. Combs has had many honors bestowed upon him, but \n     for his grandson, this one is especially meaningful. ``Coming \n     from his hometown and his home county, this is something very \n     special,'' said Craig Combs. ``I appreciate Judge Turner and \n     Mayor Long for being so kind to us when we came down.''\n       Long said he is very pleased to see the community finally \n     honor its famous son with the portrait at the courthouse.\n       ``This has been a dream of Mayor Long's,'' said Turner. \n     ``He has brought it up at numerous meetings.''\n       The portrait by Robert Johnson of Madison Avenue Designs in \n     Georgetown joins other murals at the courthouse depicting \n     important Owsley County scenes.\n       Turner acknowledged the assistance of Jo'e Short, Kacey \n     Smith and Cassie Hudson, members of the Action Team. These \n     ladies wrote the application to the Flex-E ARC grant program \n     after attending the Brushy Fork Institute at Berea College \n     that got the ball rolling. ``This would not have happened \n     without the grant,'' he said. Additional matching funds for \n     the project came from the Owsley County Fiscal Court, the \n     Owsley County Action Team and Farmer's State Bank.\n       As a legendary baseball player, businessman and member of \n     the Eastern Kentucky University board of regents, Craig Combs \n     said his grandfather was much respected. However, his \n     grandson remembers more than baseball and business.\n       ``He was just Pop to me,'' he explained, recalling nights \n     spent With his grandfather and grandmother (Mimi), Ruth \n     McCollum, also a native of Owsley County, on their farm in \n     rural Madison County.\n       ``It was a magical time to grow up and be around them \n     because they cared so much for us. He was just a regular, \n     loving grandfather.''\n       Craig Combs recalls the stories about his grandfather's \n     baseball career and said he became the family's baseball \n     historian.\n       ``It was a wonderful upbringing to be around them. To be \n     their grandson was so special.''\n       Craig Combs said he remembers his grandfather very well. He \n     was 18 when Earle B. Combs passed away. Earle and Ruth Combs \n     had three children. Earle Jr., Charles and Donald Combs. Mrs. \n     Combs died in 1989.\n       Still a student, Earle Combs started playing baseball at \n     Eastern. That led to playing semi-professional ball in such \n     Kentucky towns as Winchester, High Splint and Lexington. \n     While playing for the Lexington Reos of the Bluegrass League, \n     he drew the attention of the Louisville Cardinals (American \n     Association), where he honed his skill in 1922 and 1923. In \n     1924, he was a rookie for the New York Yankees, patrolling \n     center field between Babe Ruth and Rob Meusel. The following \n     season, he was installed as the leadoff hitter in the famed \n     ``Murderers Row'' Yankee lineup. He kept that position for \n     the remaining 11 years of his career. During his career, he \n     batted over .300 nine times, had 200 or more hits three \n     times, paced the American League in triples three times and \n     twice led all AL outfielders in putouts, He had a career \n     batting average of .325. In the outfield, he was known as \n     ``swift and sure-handed,'' according to the Earle B. Combs \n     official website.\n       A favorite of Yankee fans, nicknames bestowed upon him \n     included ``Kentucky Greyhound,'' ``Silver Fox'' and \n     ``Kentucky Colonel.'' After an injury, he retired in 1935 and \n     coached for the team until 1944. The first year he coached, \n     he trained his replacement, Joe DiMaggio. He coached for \n     several other teams before retiring in the mid-1950s and \n     returning to his Madison County farm. He served as Kentucky \n     banking commissioner during Gov. A.B. Chandler's second \n     administration (1955-59). He served on Eastern Kentucky \n     University's board of regents from 1956-1975 and was chairman \n     from 1972-74. A dormitory at EKU (Earle Combs Hall) bears his \n     name and the school gives an athletic scholarship in his \n     honor. He also is a charter member of EKU's Athletics Hall of \n     Fame.\n       Earle B. Combs was named to the National Baseball Ball of \n     Fame in Cooperstown, NY in 1970. His baseball career included \n     being part of nine World Championships as a player and coach \n     in New York.\n       Many from Owsley County, including Mayor Long and Judge \n     Turner who watched the portrait go on the courthouse wall, \n     are proud of the numerous honors and accolades bestowed upon \n     this Hall of Fame baseball player. They are also gratified \n     that he found fame for himself while practicing the values he \n     learned growing up in Pebworth in Owsley County, Ky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S962-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S962-S963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FEDERAL EMPLOYEE INCOME TAXES\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, on February 17, 2011, I introduced a bill \nthat will provide assurance to taxpayers that Federal employees are on \nequal footing with the American people and are held accountable to the \nsame rules they enforce.\n  In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, found nearly 100,000 \ncivilian Federal employees were delinquent on their Federal income \ntaxes, owing over $1 billion in unpaid Federal income taxes. When \nconsidering retirees and military, more than 282,000 Federal employees \nowed $3.3 billion in taxes.\n  This legislation will save taxpayers at least $1 billion by requiring \nthe Internal Revenue Service to collect unpaid Federal income taxes \nfrom civilian Federal employees.\n  Federal employees have a clear obligation to pay their Federal income \ntaxes. The very nature of Federal employment and the concept inherent \nto ``public service'' demands those being paid by taxpayers to also pay \ntheir fair share of taxes. Federal workers should not be exempt from \nthe laws they enforce. In fact, they should lead by example. Failure to \ndo so is an affront to taxpayers and to the rule of law.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has allowed this abuse of taxpayer dollars to \noccur throughout the Federal Government and failed to implement the \nproper safeguards to hold culprits accountable. Considering our \nnational debt recently surpassed $14 trillion, it is critical Congress \nquickly pass this legislation. Surely this milestone is a wake-up call \nfor Congress to find ways to get control of the Federal budget and help \nget our country back on the right track towards fiscal responsibility.\n  The bill I recently introduced requires all Federal employees to be \ncurrent on their Federal income taxes or be fired from their jobs. This \nis a commonsense bill that most Americans would believe is reasonable, \nnecessary, and likely surprised that it is not already the standard \nthroughout the Federal Government.\n  It is not the intention of this legislation to single out the \nmajority of Federal employees who work hard and pay their taxes. \nInstead, the bill would carefully reach only those who have willfully \nneglected to pay their income taxes and would direct the IRS to only \ncollect money already owed under the Federal Tax Code.\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\n  This legislation excludes Federal employees who make oversights in \ntheir personal taxes but willfully agree to pay them or are challenging \nthe delinquency in court or through the IRS.\n  Specifically, it excludes Federal employees from termination if (1) \nthe individual is currently paying the taxes, interest, and penalties \nowed to IRS under an installment plan; (2) the individual and the IRS \nhave worked out a compromise on the amount of taxes, interest and \npenalties owed, and the compromise amount agreed upon is being repaid \nto IRS; (3) the individual has not exhausted his or her right to due \nprocess under the law; or (4) the individual filed a joint return and \nsuccessfully contends he or she should not be fully liable for the \ntaxes, interest, and/or penalties owed because of something the other \nparty to the return did or did not do.\n  I recently introduced this bipartisan legislation, because Congress \nhas failed to responsibly manage taxpayer dollars and serve in the best \ninterests of the American people. This legislation will provide a \nsolution to level the playing field between Federal employees and the \nAmerican people when it comes to paying Federal income taxes.\n  It should be a priority of this Congress to pass this solution as a \nway to provide equal treatment under the law and to seek out \ncommonsense opportunities that will reduce our national debt. Now is \nthe time for Congress to get a grip on the federal budget and find \nresponsible ways to save in order to preserve the heritage of service \nand sacrifice that made our country great.\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to speak in support of this \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S963-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S963-S966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

The chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           RULE 7--SUBPOENAS\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the \n     committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the \n     request of any member of the committee, the committee shall \n     authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the \n     committee. When the committee authorizes a subpoena, it may \n     be issued upon the signature of the chairman or any other \n     member designated by the committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            RULE 8--REPORTS\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same \n     day that the committee has ordered a measure or matter \n     reported. Such views shall then be included in the committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each \n     such measure and amendment by each member of the \n     committee.\n\n\n                            RULE 9--TREATIES\n\n       (a) The committee is the only committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent to \n     ratification. Because the House of Representatives has no \n     role in the approval of treaties, the committee is therefore \n     the only congressional committee with responsibility for \n     treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          RULE 10--NOMINATIONS\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations shall not consider any nomination\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\n     until 6 calendar days after it has been formally submitted to \n     the Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees \n     otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f).\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a \n     financial disclosure report and a related ethics undertaking \n     with the committee; (3) the committee has been assured that \n     the nominee does not have any interests which could conflict \n     with the interests of the government in the exercise of the \n     nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons \n     nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or \n     minister, the committee has received a complete list of any \n     contributions made by the nominee or members of his immediate \n     family to any Federal election campaign during the year of \n     his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding years; and (5) \n     for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, the report \n     required by Section 304(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of \n     1980 on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated.\n\n\n                            RULE 11--TRAVEL\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. \n     Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the \n     purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial \n     report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This \n     report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and \n     shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of \n     the chairman or the ranking member. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the \n     reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior \n     trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel \n     funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same \n     approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. \n     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are \n     reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as \n     appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the \n     case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources.\n       Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee \n     purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and \n     ranking member prior to submission of the request to the \n     chairman and ranking member of the full committee.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     minority staff director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the chairman and \n     the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, the \n     personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee \n     of the committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of this rule regarding staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of this \n     section, each member of the committee may designate one \n     personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative of the \n     Member.''\n\n\n                          RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the committee, unless a majority of the committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the committee \n     shall be published unless the chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the ranking member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n       (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts, and shall ensure that such \n     transcripts are handled in a manner consistent with the \n     requirements of the United States Senate Security Manual.\n       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts as required by the Senate Security \n     Manual.\n       (3) Classified transcripts may not leave the committee \n     offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center, except \n     for the purpose of declassification.\n       (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only the \n     following persons are authorized to have access to classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee \n     offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center;\n       (B) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or \n     in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center;\n       (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission of \n     the chairman, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the \n     Capitol Visitors Center; and\n       (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the committee offices or SVC-217 of the Capitol \n     Visitors Center.\n       (6) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the chairman and \n     ranking member.\n       (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the \n     case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff \n     director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n       (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed by \n     Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. \n     474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts transferred \n     to the National Archives and Records Administration under \n     Rule XI may not be made available for public use unless they \n     have been subject to declassification review in accordance \n     with applicable laws or Executive orders.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with \n     applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time \n     period provided for under S. Res. 474 if:\n       (A) the chairman originates such action, with the \n     concurrence of the ranking member;\n       (B) the other current members of the committee who \n     participated in such meeting or report have been notified of \n     the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, \n     except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any \n     objections thereby raised to early declassification; and\n       (C) the executive departments that participated in the \n     meeting or originated the classified information have been \n     consulted and consented to the declassification.\n\n\n                    RULE 13--CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\n\n       (a) The handling of classified information in the Senate is \n     governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established \n     the Office of Senate Security. All handling of classified \n     information by the committee shall be consistent with the \n     procedures set forth in the United States Senate Security \n     Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security.\n       (b) The chief clerk is the security manager for the \n     committee. The chief clerk shall be responsible for \n     implementing the provisions of the Senate Security Manual and \n     for serving as the committee liaison to the Office of Senate \n     Security. The staff director, in consultation with the \n     minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security \n     manager as circumstances warrant.\n       (c) Classified material may only be transported between \n     Senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who \n     have been specifically authorized to do so by the security \n     manager.\n       (d) In general, Senators and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (e) The staff director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of this rule.\n\n\n                             RULE 14--STAFF\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the staff director, except that such \n     part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall be \n     under the general supervision of the ranking member and under \n     the immediate direction of the minority staff director.\n       (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations.\n       In addition to carrying out assignments from the committee \n     and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\n       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n       (B) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the staff \n     director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     minority staff director. In the case of the staff director \n     and the minority staff director, such advance permission \n     shall be obtained from the chairman or the ranking member, as \n     appropriate. In any event, such public statements should \n     avoid the expression of personal views and should not contain \n     predictions of future, or interpretations of past, committee \n     action; and\n       (C) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n       (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings \n     of the committee in closed session or reveal information \n     conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person \n     would have been permitted to attend the session itself, or \n     unless such communication is specifically authorized by the \n     staff director or minority staff director. Unauthorized \n     disclosure of information from a closed session or of \n     classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal \n     and may, in the case of some kinds of information, be grounds \n     for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, rules of the \n     committee which are based upon Senate rules may not be \n     superseded by committee vote alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S966-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S966-S967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Senate standing rules XXVI requires \neach committee to adopt rules to govern the procedure of the committee \nand to publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than \nMarch 1 of the first year of each Congress. On February 23, 2011, a \nmajority of the members of the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs' Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations adopted \nsubcommittee rules of procedure.\n  Consistent with standing rule XXVI, today I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a copy of the rules of procedure of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE SENATE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON \n INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n       1. No public hearing connected with an investigation may be \n     held without the approval of either the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member or the approval of a Majority of the \n     Members of the Subcommittee. In all cases, notification to \n     all Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at \n     least 7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The \n     Ranking Minority Member should be kept fully apprised of \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings. \n     Preliminary inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee \n     Majority staff upon the approval of the Chairman and notice \n     of such approval to the Ranking Minority Member or the \n     Minority counsel. Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by \n     the Minority staff upon the approval of the Ranking Minority \n     Member and notice of such approval to the Chairman or Chief \n     Counsel. Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval \n     of the Chairman of the Subcommittee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member with notice of such approval to all Members.\n       No public hearing shall be held if the Minority Members \n     unanimously object, unless the full Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs by a majority vote approves \n     of such public hearing.\n       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by \n     the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate).\n       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and \n     records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any \n     other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him or her, \n     with notice to the Ranking Minority Member. A written notice \n     of intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     Chairman or a staff officer designated by him or her, \n     immediately upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be \n     issued for at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and \n     Sundays, from delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member waive the 48 hour \n     waiting period or unless the Subcommittee Chairman certifies \n     in writing to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member that, \n     in his or her opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena \n     immediately.\n       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings \n     of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special \n     meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the \n     filing of such request, a majority of the Subcommittee \n     Members may file in the office of the Subcommittee their \n     written notice that a special Subcommittee meeting will be \n     held, specifying the date and hour thereof, and the \n     Subcommittee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately \n     upon the filing of such notice, the Subcommittee clerk shall \n     notify all Subcommittee Members that such special meeting \n     will be held and inform them of its date and hour. If the \n     Chairman is not present at any regular, additional or special \n     meeting, the Ranking Majority Member present shall preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       One-third of the Members of the Subcommittee shall \n     constitute a quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee \n     business other than the administering of oaths and the taking \n     of testimony, provided that one member of the minority is \n     present.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     or her counsel, or any spectator conducts himself or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing, \n     the Chairman or presiding Member of the Subcommittee present \n     during such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the \n     Senate, his or her representative or any law enforcement \n     official to eject said person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he or she is testifying, of his or \n     her legal rights; provided, however, that in the case of any \n     witness who is an officer or employee of the government, or \n     of a corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman \n     may rule that representation by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his or her counsel is ejected for \n     conducting himself or herself in such a manner so as to \n     prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the \n     orderly administration of the hearings; nor shall this rule \n     be construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1 Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\n     by the Chairman. The Chairman of the full Committee and the \n     Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee shall be kept \n     fully apprised of the authorization for the taking of \n     depositions. Such notices shall specify a time and place of \n     examination, and the name of the Subcommittee Member or \n     Members or staff officer or officers who will take the \n     deposition. The deposition shall be in private. The \n     Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness' \n     failure to appear unless the deposition notice was \n     accompanied by a Subcommittee subpoena.\n       9.2 Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition \n     by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to \n     the provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3 Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him or her. If the \n     Chairman or designated Member overrules the objection, he or \n     she may refer the matter to the Subcommittee or he or she may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he or she has been ordered and directed to answer by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee.\n       9.4 Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his or her presence, the \n     transcriber shall certify that the transcript is a true \n     record of the testimony, and the transcript shall then be \n     filed with the Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may \n     stipulate with the witness to changes in this procedure; \n     deviations from this procedure which do not substantially \n     impair the reliability of the record shall not relieve the \n     witness from his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights, shall not be directed at him or her. Such \n     requests shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members \n     present at the hearing.\n       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the \n     testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings. \n     The record of his or her own testimony, whether in public or \n     executive session, shall be made available for inspection by \n     witness or his or her counsel under Subcommittee supervision; \n     a copy of any testimony given in public session or that part \n     of the testimony given by the witness in executive session \n     and subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a \n     public session shall be made available to any witness at his \n     or her expense if he or she so requests.\n       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings \n     shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by Members \n     and authorized Subcommittee staff personnel only.\n       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in \n     public hearings may submit to the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee questions in writing for the cross-examination \n     of other witnesses called by the Subcommittee. With the \n     consent of a majority of the Members of the Subcommittee \n     present and voting, these questions, or paraphrased versions \n     of them, shall be put to the witness by the Chairman, by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee, or by counsel of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is \n     specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or \n     other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made \n     by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or \n     her or otherwise adversely affect his or her reputation, may \n     (a) request to appear personally before the Subcommittee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) \n     file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the testimony or \n     other evidence or comment complained of. Such request and \n     such statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its \n     consideration and action.\n       If a person requests to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein, \n     said request shall be considered untimely if it is not \n     received by the Chairman of the Subcommittee or its counsel \n     in writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the \n     day on which said person's name was mentioned or otherwise \n     specifically identified during a public hearing held before \n     the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member waive this requirement.\n       If a person requests the filing of his or her sworn \n     statement pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the \n     Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement \n     upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained \n     in his or her sworn statement, as well as any other matters \n     related to the subject of the investigation before the \n     Subcommittee.\n       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept \n     secret and will not be released for public information \n     without the approval of a majority of the Subcommittee.\n       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public \n     unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after \n     no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by \n     the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such \n     notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing \n     by a majority of the Minority Members.\n       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment \n     to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the Minority \n     and such other professional staff members and clerical \n     assistants as he or she deems advisable. The total \n     compensation allocated to such Minority staff members shall \n     be not less than one-third the total amount allocated for all \n     Subcommittee staff salaries during any given year. The \n     Minority staff members shall work under the direction and \n     supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. The Chief Counsel \n     for the Minority shall be kept fully informed as to \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings, and \n     shall have access to all material in the files of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law \n     may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized \n     to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or \n     Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the \n     basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is \n     not authority for release of documents or testimony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S967-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S967-S968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT OF GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT, THE FEDERAL \n       WORKFORCE, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing \nRules of the Senate requires each committee to adopt rules to govern \nthe procedure of the committee and to publish those rules in the \nCongressional Record not later than March 1 of the first year of each \nCongress. On February 15, 2011, the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs adopted committee rules of procedure.\n  Consistent with standing rule XXVI, I ask unanimous consent to have a \ncopy of the rules of procedure of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND \n                          GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n\n      RULE 1. MEETINGS AND MEETING PROCEDURES OTHER THAN HEARINGS\n\n       A. Meeting dates. The Committee shall hold its regular \n     meetings on the first Wednesday of each month, when the \n     Congress is in session, or at such other times as the \n     Chairman shall determine. Additional meetings may be called \n     by the Chairman as he/she deems necessary to expedite \n     Committee business. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       B. Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three \n     Members of the Committee desire the Chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the Chief Clerk of the \n     Committee shall notify the Chairman of such request. If, \n     within 3 calendar days after the filing of such request, the \n     Chairman fails to call the requested special meeting, which \n     is to be held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, a majority of the Committee Members may file in the \n     offices of the Committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     chief clerk shall notify all Committee Members that such \n     special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and \n     hour. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Meeting notices and agenda. Written notices of Committee \n     meetings, accompanied by an agenda, enumerating the items of \n     business to be considered, shall be sent to all Committee \n     Members at least 3 days in advance of such meetings, \n     excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in which the \n     Senate is not in session. The written notices required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. In the event \n     that unforeseen requirements or Committee business prevent a \n     3-day notice of either the meeting or agenda, the Committee \n     staff shall communicate such notice and agenda, or any \n     revisions to the agenda, as soon as practicable by telephone \n     or otherwise to Members or appropriate staff assistants in \n     their offices.\n       D. Open business meetings. Meetings for the transaction of \n     Committee or Subcommittee business shall be conducted in open \n     session, except that a meeting or series of meetings on the \n     same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee Members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting \n     or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.) \n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chairman to enforce \n     order on his or her own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee; provided, further, that when the Chairman finds \n     it necessary to maintain order, he/she shall have the power \n     to clear the room, and the Committee or Subcommittee may act \n     in closed session for so long as there is doubt of the \n     assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\n       E. Prior notice of first degree amendments. It shall not be \n     in order for the Committee, or a Subcommittee thereof, to \n     consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee \n     unless a written copy of such amendment has been delivered to \n     each Member of the Committee or Subcommittee, as the case may \n     be, and to the office of the Committee or Subcommittee, at \n     least 24 hours before the meeting of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee at which the amendment is to be proposed. The \n     written copy of amendments in the first degree required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. This subsection \n     may be waived by a majority of the Members present. This \n     subsection shall apply only when at least 72 hours written \n     notice of a session to mark up a measure is provided to the \n     Committee or Subcommittee.\n       F. Meeting transcript. The Committee or Subcommittee shall \n     prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic \n     recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each \n     meeting whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is \n     closed to the public, unless a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee Members vote to forgo such a record. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 5(e), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n                            RULE 2. QUORUMS\n\n       A. Reporting measures and matters.

One-third of the \n     membership of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the \n     transaction of routine business, provided that one Member of \n     the Minority is present. For the purpose of this paragraph, \n     the term ``routine business'' includes the convening of a \n     meeting and the consideration of any business of the \n     Committee other than reporting to the Senate any measures, \n     matters or recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Taking testimony. One Member of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for taking sworn or unsworn testimony. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(2) and 7(c)(2), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Subcommittee quorums. Subject to the provisions of \n     sections 7(a) (1) and (2) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate, the Subcommittees of this Committee are \n     authorized to establish their own quorums for the transaction \n     of business and the taking of sworn testimony.\n       E. Proxies prohibited in establishment of quorum. Proxies \n     shall not be considered for the establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                             RULE 3. VOTING\n\n       A. Quorum required. Subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless a \n     quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is actually \n     present.\n       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or \n     recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee Members are actually present, and \n     the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those Members who \n     are actually present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(a) (1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all \n     measures and matters before the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or \n     matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes \n     of recording a Member's position on the pending question. \n     Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or \n     Subcommittee Member has been informed of the matter on which \n     he or she is being recorded and has affirmatively requested \n     that he or she be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed \n     with the chief clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     thereof, as the case may be. All proxies shall be in writing \n     and shall contain sufficient reference to the pending matter \n     as is necessary to identify it and to inform the Committee or \n     Subcommittee as to how the Member establishes his or her vote \n     to be recorded thereon. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       D. Announcement of vote. (1) Whenever the Committee by roll \n     call vote reports any measure or matter, the report of the \n     Committee upon such a measure or matter shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to such measure or matter by each Member of the \n     Committee. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(c), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       (2) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote acts upon any \n     measure or amendment thereto, other than reporting a measure \n     or matter, the results thereof shall be announced in the \n     Committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the Committee, and such announcement shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to each such measure and amendment thereto by \n     each Member of the Committee who was present at the meeting. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (3) In any case in which a roll call vote is announced, the \n     tabulation of votes shall state separately the proxy vote \n     recorded in favor of and in opposition to that measure, \n     amendment thereto, or matter. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b) and (c), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E. Polling.

If any Member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the Members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee Member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n       F. Naming postal facilities. The Committee will not \n     consider any legislation that would name a postal facility \n     for a living person with the exception of bills naming \n     facilities after former Presidents and Vice Presidents of the \n     United States, former Members of Congress over 70 years of \n     age, former State or local elected officials over 70 years of \n     age, former judges over 70 years of age, or wounded veterans.\n\n\n             RULE 4.

If the Chairman \n     (or his or her designee) is absent 10 minutes after the \n     scheduled time set for a meeting or hearing, the Ranking \n     Majority Member present shall preside until the Chairman's \n     arrival. If there is no Member of the Majority present, the \n     Ranking Minority Member present, with the prior approval of \n     the Chairman, may open and conduct the meeting or hearing \n     until such time as a Member of the Majority arrives.\n\n\n                RULE 5. HEARINGS AND HEARING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least 1 week in advance of such \n     hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines \n     that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier \n     date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be \n     closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into \n     closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated \n     in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to \n     be closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open \n     session by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     Members when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing or \n     hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\n     duty of the Chairman to enforce order on his or her own \n     initiative and without any point of order being made by a \n     Member of the Committee or Subcommittee; provided, further, \n     that when the Chairman finds it necessary to maintain order, \n     he or she shall have the power to clear the room, and the \n     Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session for so \n     long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The Chairman, with the \n     approval of the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the \n     Chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     approval of the Ranking Minority Member where the Chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him/her has not received \n     notification from the Ranking Minority Member or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her of disapproval of the subpoena \n     within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being \n     notified of the subpoena. If a subpoena is disapproved by the \n     Ranking Minority Member as provided in this subsection, the \n     subpoena may be authorized by vote of the Members of the \n     Committee. When the Committee or Chairman authorizes \n     subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued upon the signature of the \n     Chairman or any other Member of the Committee designated by \n     the Chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights; \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the Government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the Government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the Government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his or her counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself or herself in such manner so as to prevent, impede, \n     disrupt, obstruct or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of the hearings; nor shall this subsection be \n     construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends to \n     impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide electronically a written statement of his or her \n     proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior to his or her \n     appearance. This requirement may be waived by the Chairman \n     and the Ranking Minority Member following their determination \n     that there is good cause for failure of compliance. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the Minority Members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the Chairman by a majority of the Minority \n     Members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions.

If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his or her presence, the transcriber shall certify \n     that the transcript is a true record of the testimony, and \n     the transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of \n     the Committee. The Chairman or a staff officer designated by \n     him/her may stipulate with the witness to changes in the \n     procedure; deviations from this procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his or her obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n\n\n                 RULE 6.

Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C.

(Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(a), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       Each such report shall also contain an evaluation, made by \n     the Committee, of the regulatory impact which would be \n     incurred in carrying out the bill or joint resolution. The \n     evaluation shall include (a) an estimate of the numbers of \n     individuals and businesses who would be regulated and a \n     determination of the groups and classes of such individuals \n     and businesses, (b) a determination of the economic impact of \n     such regulation on the individuals, consumers, and businesses \n     affected, (c) a determination of the impact on the personal \n     privacy of the individuals affected, and (d) a determination \n     of the amount of paperwork that will result from the \n     regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the bill or joint \n     resolution, which determination may include, but need not be \n     limited to, estimates of the amount of time and financial \n     costs required of affected parties, showing whether the \n     effects of the bill or joint resolution could be substantial, \n     as well as reasonable estimates of the recordkeeping \n     requirements that may be associated with the bill or joint \n     resolution. Or, in lieu of the foregoing evaluation, the \n     report shall include a statement of the reasons for failure \n     by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n           RULE 7.

Following consultation with the \n     Majority Members, and the Ranking Minority Member of the \n     Committee, the Chairman shall announce selections for \n     membership on the Subcommittees referred to in paragraphs A \n     and B, above.\n       D. Subcommittee meetings and hearings. Each Subcommittee of \n     this Committee is authorized to establish meeting dates and \n     adopt rules not inconsistent with the rules of the Committee \n     except as provided in Rules 2(D) and 7(E).\n       E. Subcommittee subpoenas. Each Subcommittee is authorized \n     to adopt rules concerning subpoenas which need not be \n     consistent with the rules of the Committee; provided, \n     however, that in the event the Subcommittee authorizes the \n     issuance of a subpoena pursuant to its own rules, a written \n     notice of intent to issue the subpoena shall be provided to \n     the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     Chairman or a staff officer designated by him/her immediately \n     upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be issued for \n     at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from \n     delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member waive the 48-hour waiting period or \n     unless the Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member that, in his or her \n     opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       F.

In considering a nomination, the Committee \n     shall inquire into the nominee's experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity to serve in the position to which \n     he or she has been nominated. The Committee shall recommend \n     confirmation, upon finding that the nominee has the necessary \n     integrity and is affirmatively qualified by reason of \n     training, education, or experience to carry out the functions \n     of the office to which he or she was nominated.\n       B. Information concerning the Nominee. Each nominee shall \n     submit the following information to the Committee:\n       (1) A detailed biographical resume which contains \n     information relating to education, employment, and \n     achievements;\n       (2) Financial information, in such specificity as the \n     Committee deems necessary, including a list of assets and \n     liabilities of the nominee and tax returns for the 3 years \n     preceding the time of his or her nomination, and copies of \n     other relevant documents requested by the Committee, such as \n     a proposed blind trust agreement, necessary for the \n     Committee's consideration; and,\n       (3) Copies of other relevant documents the Committee may \n     request, such as responses to questions concerning the \n     policies and programs the nominee intends to pursue upon \n     taking office. At the request of the Chairman or the Ranking \n     Minority Member, a nominee shall be required to submit a \n     certified financial statement compiled by an independent \n     auditor. Information received pursuant to this subsection \n     shall be made available for public inspection; provided, \n     however, that tax returns shall, after review by persons \n     designated in subsection (C) of this rule, be placed under \n     seal to ensure confidentiality.\n       C. Procedures for Committee inquiry. The Committee shall \n     conduct an inquiry into the experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity of nominees, and shall give \n     particular attention to the following matters:\n       (1) A review of the biographical information provided by \n     the nominee, including, but not limited to, any professional \n     activities related to the duties of the office to which he or \n     she is nominated;\n       (2) A review of the financial information provided by the \n     nominee, including tax returns for the 3 years preceding the \n     time of his or her nomination;\n       (3) A review of any actions, taken or proposed by the \n     nominee, to remedy conflicts of interest; and\n       (4) A review of any personal or legal matter which may bear \n     upon the nominee's qualifications for the office to which he \n     or she is nominated. For the purpose of assisting the \n     Committee in the conduct of this inquiry, a Majority \n     investigator or investigators shall be designated by the \n     Chairman and a Minority investigator or investigators shall \n     be designated by the Ranking Minority Member. The Chairman, \n     Ranking Minority Member, other Members of the Committee, and \n     designated investigators shall have access to all \n     investigative reports on nominees prepared by any Federal \n     agency, except that only the Chairman, the Ranking Minority \n     Member, or other Members of the Committee, upon request, \n     shall have access to the report of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation. The Committee may request the assistance of \n     the U.S. Government Accountability Office and any other such \n     expert opinion as may be necessary in conducting its review \n     of information provided by nominees.\n       D. Report on the Nominee. After a review of all information \n     pertinent to the nomination, a confidential report on the \n     nominee shall be made in the case of judicial nominees and \n     may be made in the case of non-judicial nominees by the \n     designated investigators to the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member and, upon request, to any other Member of the \n     Committee.

Hearings. The Committee shall conduct a public hearing \n     during which the nominee shall be called to testify under \n     oath on all matters relating to his or her suitability for \n     office, including the policies and programs which he or she \n     will pursue while in that position. No hearing shall be held \n     until at least 72 hours after the following events have \n     occurred: The nominee has responded to prehearing questions \n     submitted by the Committee; and, if applicable, the report \n     described in subsection (D) has been made to the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member, and is available to other Members of \n     the Committee, upon request.\n       F. Action on confirmation. A mark-up on a nomination shall \n     not occur on the same day that the hearing on the nominee is \n     held. In order to assist the Committee in reaching a \n     recommendation on confirmation, the staff may make an oral \n     presentation to the Committee at the mark-up, factually \n     summarizing the nominee's background and the steps taken \n     during the pre-hearing inquiry.\n       G. Application. The procedures contained in subsections \n     (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this rule shall apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to positions requiring their full-\n     time service.

Mr. President, today I recognize a remarkable \nHoosier, Mrs. Lilly Nutter of Warren, IN, who has worked diligently in \nher own way to provide a measure of comfort to more than 1,000 \nservicemembers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  After a career with the Department of Defense that included service \nin California and at Grissom Air Force Base in my State of Indiana, \nMrs. Nutter retired to her husband's hometown of Warren where she is \nactive with the Welcome Wagon, the Chamber of Commerce, the Cancer \nSociety, and the food pantry.\n  However, I especially admire Mrs. Nutter's work on behalf of our \nservicemembers. In 2003, Mrs. Nutter was contacted by her grandson Kent \nDolasky, who was serving with the U.S. Army in Iraq. Her grandson \nshared his concern that some of his fellow soldiers did not receive \npackages from their friends and family during their deployment. Always \nlooking for a new opportunity to help others, Mrs. Nutter got to work \ncollecting candy, toiletries, and other items that would bring a smile \nto the faces of servicemembers during time away from their loved ones \nand the comforts of home. Her efforts, however, did not conclude when \nher grandson and his unit returned home. Since 2003, Mrs. Nutter has \nworked with her family and friends both in her community and across the \ncountry to collect goods that have been assembled into more than 1,000 \ncare packages.\n  I am hopeful that my fellow Senators will join me in thanking Mrs. \nNutter for her remarkable work on behalf of our servicemembers and in \nrecognizing her spirit of care and compassion for those who risk their \nlives defending our Nation abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S973-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE THEODORE ROOSEVELT DAM\n\n   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on March 18, 2011, the State of \nArizona will celebrate the 100 year anniversary of the Theodore \nRoosevelt Dam. As that day approaches, I wish to recognize how vital \nthis structure has been in unlocking the tremendous economic potential \nof my State.\n  In the arid and often unforgiving desert, the Theodore Roosevelt Dam \nis the central component and crowning achievement of one of the \nNation's first water reclamation projects in the West. In 1903, a group \nof visionary territorial Arizonans banded together to mortgage their \nlands as debt collateral for a Federal loan to build the Roosevelt Dam. \nThe dam was completed 8 years later, in 1911, and stood as the world's \nlargest masonry dam of its day. Located on the Salt River, it serves as \nboth a water storage system and hydroelectric facility that supplies \nelectricity, drinking water and irrigation water to the downstream \ncommunities of metropolitan Phoenix.\n  Those original landowners, who in 1903 formed the Salt River Valley \nWater Users Association, had a vision of what could be. Indeed, \nRoosevelt Dam nurtured and ultimately transformed the Salt River Valley \ninto what is today. The dam made Phoenix a boom town, and turned the \nsurrounding area into one of fastest-growing regions in the Nation. \nPeople came, and with them a strong and vibrant economy grew to attract \nnew businesses fueled by a diverse labor force. Roosevelt Dam literally \nchanged people's ideas about living in the desert. It is a legacy that \ncontinues today with the Salt River Project, a power and water utility \nthat continues to provide the infrastructure that feeds the area's \neconomy.\n  Over the next several decades, the Phoenix area is projected to \nexpand by twice the national rate once again demonstrating the vitality \nof the community. No other reclamation project in the history of \nArizona has stimulated the economic and population boom in the way \nRoosevelt Dam did once it was completed. For that reason, I am proud to \nhonor its contributions in my State, for the past 100 years and into \nits next century of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S973-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING EVANGELISTO RAMIREZ GARCIA\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, last month, my home \nState of New Mexico lost a great man when Mr. Evangelisto ``Evans'' \nRamirez Garcia, a survivor of the Bataan Death March, passed away at \nthe age of 97. The loss of a hero such as Mr. Garcia is felt not only \nby New Mexicans but by our entire country--which is forever indebted to \nthose brave men captured in Bataan. I would like to take a few moments \nto honor him today.\n  Mr. Garcia's life tells a story of patriotism in its finest form. He \nserved in two wars, earning a Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and POW Medal \namong other commendations, and continued to support veterans' issues \nlong after he completed his military service.\n  Cutting his university studies short to enlist in the U.S. Army in \n1941, Mr. Garcia and his fellow soldiers stationed in the Philippines \nplayed a vital role in the eventual victory of the Allied forces. They \ngave little merit to their own safety or comfort and helped to slow the \nJapanese advance, giving Allied troops the time to reorganize and \nreverse Japan's progress.\n  Mr. Garcia credited his faith as giving him the spiritual strength to \nsurvive the three years of inhumane conditions and atrocities he faced \nat the hands of his captors--including the 55-mile Bataan Death March.\n  Mr. Garcia's dedication to his country did not waiver in the \nfollowing years and he reenlisted in the Army as the Korean war \nescalated. He served another year before settling down in Santa Fe.\n  As an active member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, a regular \nvolunteer at the VA Hospital, and a participant in marches \ncommemorating the Bataan Death March, Mr. Garcia touched many lives \nthrough his continued support of fellow veterans.\n  For those who knew him it was evident that he was no less devoted in \nhis personal life.

Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas the United States enjoys broadcasting and sound \n     recording industries that are the envy of the world, due to \n     the symbiotic relationship that has existed among these \n     industries for many decades;\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\n       Whereas for more than 80 years, Congress has rejected \n     repeated calls by the recording industry to impose a \n     performance fee on local radio stations for simply playing \n     music on the radio, as such fee would upset the mutually \n     beneficial relationship between local radio and the recording \n     industry;\n       Whereas local radio stations provide free publicity and \n     promotion to the recording industry and performers of music \n     in the form of radio air play, interviews with performers, \n     introduction of new performers, concert promotions, and \n     publicity that promotes the sale of music, concert tickets, \n     ring tones, music videos, and associated merchandise;\n       Whereas committees in the Senate and House of \n     Representatives have previously reported that ``the sale of \n     many sound recordings and the careers of many performers have \n     benefitted considerably from airplay and other promotional \n     activities provided by both noncommercial and advertiser-\n     supported, free over-the-air broadcasting'';\n       Whereas local radio broadcasters provide tens of thousands \n     of hours of essential local news and weather information \n     during times of national emergencies and natural disasters, \n     such as on September 11, 2001, and during Hurricanes Katrina \n     and Rita, as well as public affairs programming, sports, and \n     hundreds of millions of dollars of time for public service \n     announcements and local fund raising efforts for worthy \n     charitable causes, all of which are jeopardized if local \n     radio stations are forced to divert revenues to pay for a new \n     performance fee;\n       Whereas there are many thousands of local radio stations \n     that will suffer severe economic hardship if any new \n     performance fee is imposed, as will many other small \n     businesses that play music including bars, restaurants, \n     retail establishments, sports and other entertainment venues, \n     shopping centers, and transportation facilities; and\n       Whereas the hardship that would result from a new \n     performance fee would hurt businesses in the United States, \n     and ultimately the consumers in the United States who rely on \n     local radio for news, weather, and entertainment, and such a \n     performance fee is not justified when the current system has \n     produced the most prolific and innovative broadcasting, \n     music, and sound recording industries in the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress should not impose any new \n     performance fee, tax, royalty, or other charge relating to \n     the public performance of sound recordings on a local radio \n     station for broadcasting sound recordings over the air, or on \n     any business for such public performance of sound recordings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S979-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 8--RECOGNIZING WOMEN SERVING IN THE UNITED \n                          STATES ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Burr, Mrs. Hagan, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nSanders, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Bennet, and Mr. Lautenberg) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                             S.

DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM \n                   ADJUSTMENTS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of the airport \n     disadvantaged business enterprise program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) \n     and 47113) to ensure that minority- and women-owned \n     businesses do not face barriers because of their race or \n     gender and so that they have a fair opportunity to compete in \n     Federally assisted airport contracts and concessions.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the \n     enactment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise \n     program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination \n     continues to be a barrier for minority- and women-owned \n     businesses seeking to do business in airport-related markets. \n     This continuing barrier merits the continuation of the \n     airport disadvantaged business enterprise program.\n       (2) The Congress has received recent evidence of \n     discrimination from numerous sources, including congressional \n     hearings and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued \n     by public and private agencies, news stories, reports of \n     discrimination by organizations and individuals, and \n     discrimination lawsuits. This evidence also shows that race- \n     and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address \n     the problem.\n       (3) This evidence demonstrates that discrimination across \n     the nation poses a barrier to full and fair participation in \n     airport related businesses of women business owners and \n     minority business owners in the racial groups detailed in \n     parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, and \n     has impacted firm development and many aspects of airport \n     related business in the public and private markets.\n       (4) This evidence provides a strong basis for the \n     continuation of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise \n     program and the airport concessions disadvantaged business \n     enterprise program.\n       (c) In General.--Section 47107(e) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (8) as paragraph (9);

I ask unanimous consent the concurrent resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, before you rule on this, last week they had a very \ngood series on National Public Radio about women in the military. It \nwas really wonderful. It was so full of information. They talked about \na woman who had served in the military in World War II. They had a \ngeneral, a woman, the first four star general to be a woman. The show \nhad a woman who had been in the military in the 1980s and a daughter \nwho is a graduate from West Point now, going to medical school as a \nresult of her military service. It was really terrific.\n  Of course, the issue the Pentagon is working through, and it is quite \ndifficult, is combat for women. They had one woman there on this \nprogram who was awarded the Silver Star for her gallant actions, her \nheroic actions. She was part of a caravan. It was attacked and she was \nthe hero of the battle. The shooting went on for 45 minutes.\n  I am very happy to be reading this into the Record. I ask the Chair \nto rule that this is without objection because it certainly is the \nright thing to do, to recognize women serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 8) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 8\n\n       Whereas women have served with distinction in the United \n     States Armed Forces since the American Revolution and have \n     made significant and lasting contributions to the security of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas in 2011, women comprise nearly 16 percent of the \n     United States Armed Forces and serve in positions of \n     responsibility in the active and reserve components of the \n     Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, as \n     compared with less than 5 percent in 1976 when women were \n     first integrated into the service academies;\n       Whereas women serve at the highest levels in the Department \n     of Defense and other governmental organizations contributing \n     to the defense of the United States; and\n       Whereas the accomplishments of generations of women have \n     contributed to the history of the United States Armed Forces \n     and to the strength of the United States: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of women to national defense \n     throughout the history of the United States; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to honor \n     women who have served and who continue to serve the United \n     States in the United States Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/28/senate-section/article/S1022-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1\n\n  Mr. REID.
