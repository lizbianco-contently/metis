Madam President, it has become pretty clear over the \npast few months that President Obama now views his job as the \ndeflector-in-chief. No longer content to lay all the Nation's problems \nat the feet of his predecessor, he has taken to creating controversies \nout of whole cloth. Whether it is a manufactured fight over student \nloan rates or the so-called war on women, the goal is as clear as you \ncan imagine: get reporters to focus on these things, and maybe the rest \nof the country will as well; get them to focus on anything other than \nthe President's own failure to turn the economy around, and maybe he \ncan squeak by without folks noticing it. That is the plan at least and, \nfrankly, it could not reflect a more misguided view of the American \npeople. They know who has been in charge the past 3\\1/2\\ years, and the \nfact that the President has had a tough job to do does not mean he gets \na pass on how he has handled it or on the solutions he has proposed.\n  Most Americans do not like either one of the President's two \nsignature pieces of legislation--ObamaCare or the stimulus. They are \nnot particularly thrilled about seeing America's credit rating \ndowngraded for the first time ever. They are scared to death about a \n$16 trillion debt, trillion-dollar deficits, and chronic joblessness. \nAnd many, including myself, are deeply concerned about this \nadministration's thuggish attempts to shut its critics right out of the \npolitical process. These are the kinds of things Americans have been \ntelling us for 3 years that they are worried about, and we are not \nabout to be drawn into some rabbit hole so the President does not have \nto talk about them. We are going to stay focused on all of these \nthings--not because of some political advantage but because the \nAmerican people demand it. So the President can come up with the excuse \nde jour, but we are going to talk about jobs, we are going to talk \nabout the deficits and debt, and we will talk about the Constitution.\n  When it comes to jobs, let's be clear. This administration has been \nengaged in a war on the private sector, and in many cases it has used \nFederal agencies and a heavyhanded regulatory process to wage it \nlargely out of view. We got a vivid confirmation of this when an EPA \nofficial was caught comparing the EPA's enforcement approach to the \nRoman use of crucifixion. Brutalize a few offenders, he said, and the \nrest will be scared into submission.\n  Call me naive, but I think most Americans think the government should \nbe working for them, not against them. I think most Americans think the \nFederal Government should be working to create the conditions for \nAmericans to prosper, not looking for any opportunities to undercut \nfree enterprise. Yet that is what we see--an administration that always \nseems to assume the worst of the private sector and whose policies are \naimed at undermining it. And nowhere is it more clear than at EPA.\n  That is why I support Senator Inhofe's ongoing efforts, including a \nvote today, to push back on the EPA, which has become one of the lead \nculprits in this administration's war on American jobs. Senator Inhofe \nis focusing on just one regulation out of the many that are crushing \nbusinesses across the country--the so-called Utility MACT, which would \ncost American companies billions in upgrades, but for their competitors \noverseas, of course, it would cost them nothing. This regulation would \nexpand the already massive powers given to the EPA by increasing \nredtape and costing the taxpayer over $10 billion each year. In my \nState of Kentucky, it threatens the jobs of over 1,400 people working \nin aluminum smelter plants, as well as approximately 18,000 coal \nminers, not to mention those engaged in industries that support these \njobs.\n  Kentucky Power, operator of the only coal-burning powerplant in my \nState, recently conceded defeat in this fight after the EPA demanded \nupgrades to its plants at a cost of nearly $1 billion, raising the \ntypical residential customer's monthly electric bill by a whopping 30 \npercent. At that price, it is no wonder the plant found the new \nregulations completely unworkable. The EPA may have won this battle, \nbut the real losers are more than 170,000 homes and businesses spread \nout amongst 20 eastern Kentucky counties that depend on the Kentucky \nPower plant for their energy.\n  The proponents of the Utility MACT say it is needed to improve air \nquality. What they cannot tell you is what these benefits would be or \nthe effect of leaving the plants in their current condition. Look, we \nall support clean air, but if we waved through every regulation that \npromised to improve air quality without regard for its actual impact, \nwe would not be able to produce anything in this country.\n  What we do know is that a substantial amount of the electricity we \nproduce in this country comes from coal, and this new regulation would \ndevastate the jobs that depend on this cheap, abundant resource. This \nis just one battle in the administration's war on jobs, but it has a \ndevastating consequence for real people and real families in my State \nand in many others. The administration's nonchalant attitude about \nthese people is appalling, but this is precisely the danger of having \nunelected bureaucrats in Washington playing with the livelihoods of \nAmericans as if they are nothing more than just pieces on a chessboard.\n  The media may continue to chase whatever issue the President and his \ncampaign decide to fabricate from day to day, but these are the facts \nbehind this President's devastating economic policies, and that is why \nit is a story the President would rather the media ignored. Well, \nRepublicans are not going to ignore it. We are going to keep talking \nabout the President's policies. So I commend Senator Inhofe for keeping \nus focused on this particular policy that is devastating to so many \nAmericans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:30 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first \n15 minutes and the majority controlling the second 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, in our first round, we are going to \nyield to\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\nthe Senator from Alaska Ms. Murkowski for 10 minutes and then to \nSenator Manchin for 5 minutes. In the second round, we are going to be \nhaving Senators Barrasso, Boozman, Risch, Blunt, Kyl, and Toomey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I think most Americans would agree it \nis important that we strike a proper balance between abundant and \naffordable energy and responsible standards of environmental \nperformance. But too often in recent years, the energy-environmental \nbalance has been lost. Restoring a sense of equilibrium is important \nfor both the health of the American people and our Nation's economy. \nAlthough we see the need for this balance every day in Alaska, \nrestoring it has become what I think is a national challenge. That is \nwhy I support Senator Inhofe's resolution to disapprove the mercury and \nair toxics standards or the MATS rule.\n  Congress has tasked the EPA with implementing laws to protect public \nhealth. That statutory obligation absolutely requires respect. But \nalthough the executive branch gets to make reasonable policy calls in \nperforming that duty, its regulatory authority is strictly bounded by \nlaw.\n  Today's EPA too often seems to impose requirements that go beyond \nwhat is authorized or needed. This overreaching stifles the energy and \nnatural resource production the Nation needs to restore prosperity and \ntechnological leadership, and the sad thing is the resulting rules do \nnot credibly improve public health.\n  EPA is now proceeding with an unprecedented litany of new rules whose \nbenefits are murky at best but whose costs are very real and \ndetrimental to human welfare. The Nation can and must strike a better \nbalance. Even in today's divided times, a broad consensus remains. \nAchieving affordable and abundant energy coupled with strong \nenvironmental standards is the right combination.\n  Most would also agree that energy and environment-related public \npolicy decisions should be based on the facts and informed by rigorous \nscientific discourse. Applying this consensus shows that the devil is \nin the details. So let's look closely at the MATS rule. If this rule is \nallowed to stand, it will put electric reliability at unacceptable risk \nand raise electricity costs with very little, if any, appreciable \nbenefit to human health.\n  The North American Electric Reliability Corporation or NERC, which is \nthe independent federally certified ``Electric Reliability \nOrganization,'' recently reported that ``environmental regulations are \nshown to be the number one risk to reliability over the next . . . 5 \nyears.'' That is the statement from NERC.\n  The members of the relatively small and apolitical groups of \nengineers who keep the lights on and administer electricity markets \ntell me they are worried not only about the reliability of electric \nservice but about its affordability. I would like to speak to the \naffordability side in just a minute.\n  Reasonable regulation, clearly appropriate; and EPA has the \ndiscretion, indeed the obligation, to adopt balanced rules. But, \nunfortunately, EPA's approach has been aimed more at its statutory \nobligations. Through MATS and through other rules, EPA wants to \ninfluence how investments in energy production are made. So it has \nimposed a series of very stringent obligations that perhaps are not \neven achievable.\n  For example, the Institute of Clean Air Companies, which is an \nassociation representing emissions control technology vendors--these \nare the guys who sell all of this stuff--has asked EPA to reconsider \nMATS and has said:\n\n       Our member companies cannot ensure that the new final \n     source [mercury] standard can be achieved in practice.\n\n  These are those who would make a profit off of selling these. They \nare saying they do not think that it can be achieved.\n  Even though I believe the United Mine Workers of America, who say \ntheir comments ``and like-minded [ones] to EPA on the proposed MATS \nrule were ignored,'' it does not have to be this way. EPA received \nthousands of pages of very detailed, very thoughtful proposals, for \nimproving MATS.\n  About 150 electric generators filed their comments. Edison Electric \nInstitute, as just one example, filed more than 75 pages of very \nprecise observations for improving MATS. They suggested many very \nspecific changes. The States were active too. Twenty-seven States are \nseeking significant changes in the proposal. There were almost 20 \npetitions for reconsideration pending at EPA, and they are pending now. \nThirty petitions have been filed for judicial review. Twenty-four \nStates have asked the courts to force EPA to do better with MATS.\n  I always say we need to give credit where credit is due. On the \ntreatment of condensable particulate matter--not many of us are focused \non condensable particulate matter--EPA has made some good changes with \nregard to that, between the proposed and the final MATS rule. This \ndramatically reduced the need for construction of expensive pollution \ncontrol devices known as ``bag houses.''\n  By itself, this one change to the proposed rule reduced the overall \ncost of compliance by billions of dollars, and it relieved somewhat the \nchallenges of maintaining electric reliability while achieving \ncompliance with the rule. Adopting a more reasonable approach in this \none area did not sacrifice any appreciable benefit. So more must be \ndone. Congress must tell the EPA to revisit other suggestions for \nsimilar improvements.\n  Why the need to keep forcing the improvements? The vast majority of \nthe benefits to EPA claims from MATS are the result of its counting \ncoincidental reductions of particulate matter below standards that EPA \nhas determined are sufficient to protect public health. Emissions of \nmercury by American powerplants have declined over the past 20 years \nwithout the MATS rule. EPA itself estimates the annual benefits of \nmercury reduction attributable to the rule at only $500,000 to $6 \nmillion but annual costs at almost $10 billion.\n  Finally, EPA's actions are driving up the cost of electricity too. \nPJM, which is the independent regional transmission organization that \nis responsible for coordinating the movement of wholesale electricity \nin all or part of 13 States, as well as in the Nation's Capital, \nreported 2-year capacity price increases of 390 percent, most of which \nit attributed to the cost of environmental compliance with a nearly \n1,200-percent spike in northern Ohio.\n  PJM also plans for about $2 billion in additional transmission \ninvestment to maintain reliability in the face of EPA's rules. Clearly, \nthese are significant costs that will be passed on to our consumers. I \nthink MATS is a major rule that needs a major reset by Congress. EPA \ncould then devise a new rule that is truly aimed at protecting public \nhealth and carrying out the law rather than trying to push a particular \nfuel, coal, out of the market.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for her \nvery kind remarks. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I come to the floor to join my \ncolleagues from Alaska, from Oklahoma, and others to express my \ndisapproval. I intend to vote in favor of the resolution of disapproval \nof the Environmental Protection Agency's mercury and air toxins \nstandards rule, also known as Utility MACT.\n  Now, of course, sometimes the debate, when we talk about pollution, \nwhen we talk about the byproducts of coal-fired powerplants, is cast in \napocalyptic-like terms that have no real bearing on reality or in terms \nof the science and in terms of the economic impact of the rule or the \nhealth benefits supposedly to be derived. I want to talk about that \njust briefly.\n  While this rule claims to be about public safety, it is a job-\nkilling, ideologically driven attempt to cripple the coal industry in \nthe United States, an industry that employs an awful lot of people, \nfeeds a lot of families. This administration, unfortunately, is using \nthe EPA to destroy a major source of reliable, affordable, base-lode \nelectricity that we sorely need. The President talks about being for an \nall-of-the-above energy policy. Yet his administration, through this \nregulation we seek to disapprove today, is going to effectively take \none of those most\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nabundant, low-cost sources of energy off the table for the American \npeople.\n  Of course, Congress would never pass such a law in our own right, so \nthe administration is using a ruling from an unelected group of \nbureaucrats who are not subject to political accountability. This is \nanother example of executive overreach, and it is bad news for \nconsumers and job creators alike.\n  Power companies have confirmed that Utility MACT standards for new \npower sources are so stringent that no new coal-fired powerplant will \nbe built in the United States. No new coal-fired powerplant will be \nbuilt in the United States, no matter how modern and how clean the \ntechnology will allow that powerplant to operate. So the consequences \nwill be that Utility MACT will damage grid reliability. It will destroy \njobs, and it will raise electricity prices--not a small matter when \nmany of our seniors are on fixed incomes and are going to suffer as a \nresult of this rule that does not do what its advocates tout it for.\n  The costs of Utility MACT will exceed the benefits by roughly 1,600 \nto 1. Some claim that does not matter, that benefits are benefits no \nmatter what the cost, no matter how much, how many jobs it kills, no \nmatter how much it raises the price of electricity on seniors in my \nState who are living in very hot summers. If we have another year like \nwe had last year--I hope we do not. We had 100-degree temperatures more \nthan 70 days--and I think it was even more than that--it will threaten \nthe capacity of the power grid to even produce the electricity so \npeople can run their air conditioners. The detriment to our seniors in \nterms of public health and in terms of cost, being on a fixed income, \nis quite evident.\n  According to the EPA, more than 99 percent of the health benefits \nfrom Utility MACT will not even come from mercury reductions but, \nrather, from reductions in particulate matter that are already \nregulated to safe levels under the Clean Air Act. So either the EPA \nwill be double-counting existing benefits or else it will be setting \nnew levels for other byproducts that are not justified by public health \nconcerns.\n  In short, the benefits of this regulation are dubious, but the costs \nare real. They are already harming the U.S. economy with existing \npowerplants being shut down and others being scrapped. The United \nStates currently has more than 1,400 coal-fired electricity-generating \nunits operating at more than 600 plants.\n  Together, these powerplants generate almost half of the electricity \nproduced in our country. Again, we are not talking about taking wind \nenergy off the table. We are not talking about other ways to generate \nelectricity. But this is one of the cheapest, most abundant sources of \nenergy in our country, and we are simply killing it.\n  So sponsors of Utility MACT repeatedly tout its health benefits. But \nthose are overstated. However, they understate the impact this will \nhave on jobs. It will kill jobs. People will lose their jobs in a tough \neconomy. I urge my colleagues to pull back the curtain on the EPA and \nsee Utility MACT for what it is, an economic disaster shrouded in false \nclaims about public health.\n  Americans deserve smart regulation based on logic and sound science. \nUtility MACT is the exact opposite and deserves to be rejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, in the shadow of one seemingly \nnarrow Senate vote, that being the Inhofe resolution of disapproval of \nthe EPA's rule on mercury and air toxins, I rise to talk about West \nVirginia, about our people, our way of life, our health, our State's \neconomic opportunity, and about our future.\n  Coal has played an enormous part in our past and can play an enormous \npart in our future, but it will only happen if we face reality.\n  This is a critical and a very contentious time in the Mountain State. \nThe dialogue on coal, its impacts, and the Federal Government's role \nhas reached a stunningly fevered pitch. Carefully orchestrated messages \nthat strike fear into the hearts of West Virginians and feed \nuncertainty about coal's future are the subject of millions of dollars \nof paid television ads, billboards, breakroom bulletin boards, public \nmeetings, letters, and lobbying campaigns.\n  A daily onslaught declares that coal is under siege from harmful \noutside sources, and that the future of the State is bleak unless we \nsomehow turn back the clock, ignore the present, and block the future.\n  West Virginians understandably worry that a way of life and the \ndignity of a job is at stake. Change and uncertainty in the coal \nindustry is unsettling and nothing new. But it is unsettling. My fear \nis that concerns are also being fueled by the narrow view of others \nwith divergent views and motivations, one that denies the inevitability \nof change in the energy industry and unfairly--and I feel this \nstrongly--leaves coal miners in the dust.\n  The reality is those who run the coal industry today would rather \nattack false enemies and deny real problems than solve problems that \nwould help them and the people they employ and the States in which they \nwork.\n  Instead of facing the challenges of making tough decisions, similar \nto men of a different era, they are abrogating their responsibilities \nto lead. Back in the 1970s, I remember a fellow from Consolidation Coal \nnamed Bobby Brown. He got together with the United Mine Workers on his \nown. We were having a lot of temporary restraining orders and strikes \nat that time. They sat down, and because Bobby Brown was not a timid \nman--he was the head of a company, but he was a forceful leader--they \nworked out something which gave us peace in the coalfields of West \nVirginia--which is something--for a long time. It was a courageous act \nby a courageous nontimid man.\n  Scare tactics are a cynical waste of time, money, and worst of all, \ncoal miners' hopes. Coal miners buy into all the television they hear, \nare controlled by it, have large salaries. So in a sense they are stuck \nwhere they are, happily funded but without a place to look forward to. \nBut sadly these days, coal operators have closed themselves off from \nany other opposing voices and almost none has the courage to speak out \nfor change--any kind of change--even though it has been staring them in \nthe face for decades. They have known about it. They have ignored it.\n  This reminds me of the auto industry, which also resisted change for \ndecades. Coal operators should learn from both the mistakes and the \nrecent success of the automobile industry. I passionately believe coal \nminers deserve better than they are getting from coal operators, and \nWest Virginians certainly deserve better also.\n  Let's start with the truth. Coal, today, faces real challenges, even \nthreats, and we all know what they are\n  First, our coal reserves are finite and many coal-fired powerplants \nare aging. The cheap, easy coal seams are diminishing rapidly and \nproduction is falling, especially in the Central Appalachian Basin in \nsouthern West Virginia. Production is shifting to lower cost areas such \nas Illinois and the Powder River Basin in the Wyoming area. The average \nage of our Nation's 1,100-plus coal-fired plants is 42.5 years, with \nhundreds of plants even older. These plants run less often, are less \neconomic, and are obviously less efficient.\n  Second, natural gas use is on the rise. Power companies are switching \nto natural gas because of lower prices, cheaper construction costs, \nlower emissions, and vast, steady supplies. Even traditional coal \ncompanies such as CONSOL are increasingly investing in natural gas as \nopposed to coal.\n  Third, the shift to a lower carbon economy is not going away. It is a \ndisservice--a terrible disservice--to coal miners and their families to \npretend it is, to tell them everything can be as it was. It can't be. \nThat is over. Coal companies deny that we need to do anything to \naddress climate change, despite the established scientific consensus \nand mounting national desire--including in West Virginia--for a \ncleaner, healthier environment.\n  Despite the barrage of ads, the EPA alone is not going to make or \nbreak coal. Coal operators would love to think that is the case because \nit is a great target, and it is much easier to criticize than to do \nsomething. But there are many forces exerting pressure, and that agency \nis just one of them.\n  Two years ago, I offered a time-out on EPA carbon rules, a 2-year \nsuspension that could have broken the logjam\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\nin Congress and given us the opportunity to address carbon issues \naggressively and legislatively.\n  But instead of supporting this approach, coal operators went for \nbroke--they saw a fatter opportunity--when they demanded a complete \nrepeal of all EPA authority to address carbon emissions forever. They \ndemanded all or nothing. They turned aside a compromise and, in the \nend, they got nothing.\n  Last year, they ran exactly the same play, demanding all or nothing \non the cross-State air pollution rule, refusing to entertain any middle \nground and denying even a hint of legitimacy for the views of the other \nside and they lost again--badly.\n  Here we are with another all-or-nothing resolution, which is \nabsolutely destined to fail, and we are arguing as months, weeks, and \nyears go by. This foolish action wastes time and money that could have \nbeen invested in the future of coal. Instead, with each bad vote the \ncoal operators get, they give away more of their leverage and lock in \ntheir failure.\n  This time, the issue is whether to block an EPA rule, as has been \nsaid--the mercury and air toxics standards--that require coal-fired \npowerplants to reduce mercury and other toxic air pollution.\n  I oppose this resolution because I care so much about West \nVirginians.\n  Without good health--demeaned in this debate so far--it is hard to \nhold down a job or live the American dream. Chronic illness is \ndebilitating. I have made a career in the Senate of health care. It \nimpacts families' income, their prosperity, and ultimately families' \nhappiness. The annual health benefits of the rule are enormous. EPA has \nrelied on thousands of studies--thousands--that establish the serious \nand long-term impact of these pollutants on premature death, heart \nattacks, hospitalizations, pregnant women, babies, and children. Do \nWest Virginians care about these kinds of things? I think they do.\n  Moreover, it significantly reduces the largest remaining human-caused \nemission of mercury, which is a potent neurotoxin with fetal impact. \nMaybe some can shrug off the advice of the American Academy of \nPediatrics and many other professional medical and scientific groups, \nbut I do not.\n  The rule has been in the works through a public process for many \nyears. Some businesses--including some utilities in West Virginia--have \nalready invested in technology and are ready to comply.\n  Others have not prepared because they have chosen to focus on profit \nrather than upgrading or investing in these smaller, older, and less-\nefficient coal-fired plants that were paid for decades ago and that \nthey will tell us would be retired anyway.\n  That is right. Every single plant slated for closure in West Virginia \nwas already on the chopping block from their own corporate board's \ndecision.\n  It is important to be truthful with miners. It is sort of a forgotten \nart, and that is a travesty. We have to be truthful with miners that \ncoal plants will close because of decisions made by corporate boards \nlong ago, not just because of EPA regulations but because the plants \nare no longer economical as utilities build low-emission natural gas \nplants.\n  Natural gas has its challenges too, with serious questions about \nwater contamination and shortages and other environmental concerns. But \nwhile coal executives pine for the past, the natural gas folks look to \nthe future, investing in technology to reduce their environmental \nfootprint, and they are working with others on ways to support the safe \ndevelopment of gas. We are all going to be watching that very closely, \nare we not?\n  It is not too late for the coal industry to step up and lead--\nleadership--by embracing the realities of today and creating a \nsustainable future. It has not been too late for a long time. Discard \nthe scare tactics. Stop denying science. Listen to what markets are \nsaying about greenhouse gases and other environmental concerns. Listen \nto what West Virginians are saying about their water, air and health \nand the cost of caring for seniors and children who are most \nsusceptible to pollution.\n  Stop and listen to West Virginians--miners and families included--who \nsee the bitterness of the fight we are having now and which has been \ngoing on forever. The bitterness of the fight has taken on more \nimportance than any potential solutions. The point is put up block \nafter block, which loses time after time, but at least they have a \nfight and something to scream about, all with no progress.\n  Those same miners care deeply about their children's health. They \ncare about them. They are family people. I know that. I went there in \n1964 and lived among miners for 2 years, and I have now lived among \nthem ever since, closely and intimately. They care about what people \nall over the country care about. They care about the streams and \nmountains of West Virginia. They know down deep we can't keep to the \nsame path. They are not allowed to say so, but they know that.\n  Miners, their families, and their neighbors are why I went to West \nVirginia. They are why I made our State my home. I have been proud to \nstand shoulder to shoulder with coal miners, and we have done a lot of \ngood together over the years.\n  For more than 36 years, I have worked to protect the health and \nsafety of coal miners, everything from the historic Coal Act back in \n1992 to my safety laws, pensions and black lung benefits--always with \nminers' best interests in mind.\n  Despite what critics contend, I am standing with coal miners by \nvoting against this resolution.\n  I don't support this resolution of disapproval because it does \nnothing to look to the future of coal. It moves us backward, not \nforward. Unless this industry aggressively leans into the future, coal \nminers will be the big losers.\n  Beyond the frenzy over this one EPA rule, we need to focus squarely \non the real task of finding a long-term future for something called \nclean coal. That is possible. We have demonstrated that. That is being \ndone in various places in the country right now. This will address \nlegitimate environmental and health concerns and, of course, global \nwarming and all that counts.\n  Let me be clear. Yes, I am frustrated with much of the top levels of \nthe coal industry, at least in my State of West Virginia, but most of \nthe corporate headquarters are elsewhere. However, I am not giving up \nhope for a strong clean coal future. I am not giving up. To get there, \nwe will need a bold partner, innovation, and major public and private \ninvestments.\n  In the meantime, we should not forget that coal-fired powerplants \nwould provide good jobs for thousands of West Virginians. It remains \nthe underpinning for many of our small communities, and I will always \nbe focused on their future.\n  Instead of finger-pointing, we should commit ourselves to a smart \naction plan that will help with job transition opportunities, sparking \nnew manufacturing and exploring the next generation of technology--not \njust be dependent upon coal but a lot of things.\n  None of this is impossible. Solving big challenges is what we do in \nWest Virginia. I would much rather embrace the future boldly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before Senator Rockefeller leaves, I \nwish to take 30 seconds to say something. I believe that when the next \nhistorians write the book about leadership, courage, and integrity in \nthe Senate, this speech will be featured in that book. I am so proud of \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  How much time remains between the two sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority controls 36 minutes, \nthe Republicans control 39 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is our understanding we have approximately 42 minutes \napiece and that we will go back and forth.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Chair just said there is 39 minutes for the \nRepublicans and 36 for us.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I like that.\n  Madam President, I yield to the Senator from South Dakota for 7 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his leadership on \nthis issue, for yielding the time, and I appreciate everything he has \ndone to bring S.J. Res. 37 to the floor of the Senate.\n  As the father of two daughters, I want a cleaner, safer, healthier \nenvironment for their generation and for\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\nfuture generations. Thanks to the commonsense policies that balance \neconomic growth with a cleaner environment, our country has made \nsignificant progress toward improving the quality of our air and water. \nWe have made progress under Republican Presidents and we have made \nprogress under Democratic Presidents. We have also made progress during \nDemocratic control and Republican control of the Senate.\n  But what the Obama administration is doing with this regulation, and \nwith many of the other policies that pertain to energy, is pursuing an \nideologically driven agenda in which the costs far outweigh the \nbenefits. He promised his energy plan would necessarily make \nelectricity costs skyrocket, and his policies are clearly delivering on \nthat promise.\n  A prime example of that flawed agenda is Utility MACT, which is the \nmost expensive regulation in EPA's history, with an estimated cost of \n$10 billion. These are costs that will be passed on to families and \nsmall businesses across the country at a time when we are experiencing \nthe worst economic recovery in over 60 years.\n  We all know the statistics. Unemployment has been at 8 percent now \nfor 40 consecutive months. Real unemployment is above 14 percent. There \nare 23 million Americans who are not working today, and 5.4 million \nAmericans have remained out of work for over a year. Despite these \nfacts, President Obama continues to push regulations such as Utility \nMACT that are going to make energy more expensive and, at the same \ntime, destroy good-paying jobs.\n  According to the National Economic Research Associates, Utility MACT \nwill cost between 180,000 and 215,000 jobs by the year 2015. When \nincluding President Obama's other regulations on the electric power \nsector, the United States stands to lose approximately 1.65 million \njobs by the year 2020. We simply cannot afford these politically driven \nregulations at a time when 23 million Americans remain unemployed or \nunderemployed.\n  Low-income and middle-class families are the ones who will be hit the \nhardest by the administration's actions. Families who earn less than \n$50,000 already spend 21 percent of their income on energy costs \ncompared to 9 percent for those making more than $50,000. Now, thanks \nto the EPA's regulatory actions, those costs are going to go up an \naverage of 6\\1/2\\ percent and as much as 19 percent in some areas. \nMiddle-class incomes have already fallen by over $4,300 these past 3 \nyears, and now President Obama wants to further burden them with higher \nenergy costs.\n  These higher energy costs are not some far-off projection. In many \ncases, these costs are already being realized. As an example, PJM, \nwhich is a regional transmission organization which coordinates the \nmovement of wholesale electricity in 13 States and the District of \nColumbia, in its May 2012 capacity auction reported 2-year capacity \nprice increases of 390 percent. PJM is reporting a nearly tenfold \nincrease in wholesale energy costs in northern Ohio. According to one \nof their spokespersons,\n\n       Capacity prices were higher than last year's because of \n     retirements of existing coal-fired generation resulting \n     largely from environmental regulations which go into effect \n     in 2015.\n\n  The result could cause electricity bills across the PJM region to \nincrease by up to $130 and potentially much higher in places such as \nnorthern Ohio.\n  In addition to electricity rates, EPA's agenda will drive up the cost \nof food, transportation, fuels, and manufactured goods, as those costs \nget passed on across all the sectors of the economy. The end result is \nmore pain for the middle class, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs.\n  The President likes to talk a lot about fairness, so I will ask my \ncolleagues: Is it fair that unaccountable EPA bureaucrats are going to \ndrive up utility bills by up to 19 percent? Is it fair manufacturers \nare going to have to pay higher energy bills rather than hire new \nworkers? Is it fair that small towns across the Midwest are already \nbeing devastated by coal plant closings on account of regulations from \nthe Obama administration? Is it fair that thousands of workers are \ngoing to be laid off and lose not only their paychecks but their \nemployer-provided health care coverage as well?\n  For most South Dakotans and millions of hard-working taxpayers across \nthe country, I believe the answer is that the consequences of these \nregulations are inherently unfair. They penalize hard-working middle-\nclass Americans.\n  In the case of Utility MACT, consumers are going to pay a heavy price \nfor President Obama's political agenda to restrict access to the \nabundant and affordable sources of domestic energy we possess in this \ncountry.\n  Most Americans believe regulations should work for consumers and not \nagainst consumers. Unfortunately, EPA bureaucrats have drafted the \nUtility MACT regulation in an inefficient and unworkable manner. \nUtility MACT's new source standards are so strict they cannot possibly \nbe met.\n  According to the Institute of Clean Air Companies, the \nproenvironmental trade association comprising nearly 100 suppliers of \nair pollution equipment, Utility MACT makes it ``nearly impossible to \nconstruct new coal-fired units because financing of such units requires \nguarantees from equipment suppliers that all emission limits can be \nmet.''\n  There has to be a better approach. S.J. Res. 37, which would force a \nrewrite of Utility MACT, is the only solution to address the rule's \nproblems. It is time to rewrite Utility MACT in a manner that better \nbalances economic growth with environmental protection.\n  I hope today we will have a majority of our colleagues here in the \nSenate who will support S.J. Res. 37. Doing so will send a strong \nmessage to the Obama administration that the Senate will not stand by \nand watch his regulatory agenda further hurt small businesses and \nmiddle-class families, making it more expensive and more difficult for \nbusinesses in this country to create jobs. That is the end result of \nthis regulation. It is the end result of many of the energy policies \nand regulations coming out of this administration. That has to stop. We \nhave to get Americans back to work. We have to get our economy growing \nagain.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California, \nand the Senator from Maryland especially for his courtesy.\n  I would agree the EPA has become a happy hunting ground for goofy \nregulations. But as the late William F. Buckley once said, even a \nstopped clock is right twice a day. And on this rule--this clean air \nrule and the earlier interstate rule--I believe EPA is right.\n  The effect of upholding this rule will be to finally require that \nmost coal plants everywhere in America will have to install two kinds \nof pollution control equipment: scrubbers and SCRs. This will basically \nfinish the job of capturing sulfur and nitrogen oxides, fine particles, \nand the 187 toxic pollutants that were specifically identified by \nCongress in the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority has already committed to install this \nequipment by 2018. But TVA alone can't clean up Tennessee's air, \nbecause dirty air blows in from other States. So let me say what \nupholding this rule will do for the people of Tennessee.\n  First, it will hasten the day when Memphis, Chattanooga, and \nKnoxville are not three of the top five worst asthma cities--which they \nare today--and Nashville is not competing to be in the top 10.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks an article which appeared in the \nTennessean this week by Dr. William Lawson of Vanderbilt University, \nwho treats patients with respiratory diseases in Nashville.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. In the article Dr. Lawson says:\n\n       Pollution from these power plants means my patients suffer \n     more. Pollution increases their chances of being \n     hospitalized. Some of these toxic emissions even cause cancer \n     and can interfere with our children's neurological \n     development.\n\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\n\n  Secondly, upholding this rule means that visitors will soon not even \nthink of calling the Great Smoky Mountains the Great Smoggy Mountains \nbecause it is one of the most polluted national parks in America. We \nwant those 9 million visitors to keep coming every year with their \ndollars and their jobs.\n  Instead of seeing 24 miles on a bad air day from Clingman's Dome, our \nhighest peak, this rule should mean we will gradually move toward \nseeing 100 miles from Clingman's Dome as the air cleans up and we look \nthrough the natural blue haze.\n  Third, this rule should mean fewer health advisory warnings for our \nstreams that say ``don't eat the fish because of mercury \ncontamination.'' Half of the manmade mercury in the United States comes \nfrom coal plants, and as much as 70 percent of the mercury pollution in \nour local environment, such as streams and rivers, can come from nearby \ncoal plants.\n  Fourth, we have seen that had Nissan been unable to get an air \nquality permit in Nashville in 1980, it would have gone to Georgia. And \nif Senator Corker had not, as mayor of Chattanooga, improved the air \nquality in that city in the mid 2000s, the Volkswagen site there would \nbe a vacant lot today.\n  We know every Tennessee metropolitan area is struggling to stay \nwithin legal clean air standards and we don't want the Memphis megasite \nto stay a vacant lot because dirty air blowing in from Mississippi and \nArkansas makes the Memphis air too dirty for new industry to locate \nthere.\n  We know these rules will add a few dollars to our electric bills, but \nin our case, most of that is going to happen anyway because the \nTennessee Valley Authority has already agreed to put this pollution \ncontrol equipment on its coal-fired powerplants. We know we can reduce \nthe effect of these expenses on monthly electric bills because States \nmay give utilities a fourth year to comply with the rule, and the \nPresident may, under the law, give them a fifth and sixth year. And \nSenator Pryor and I intend to ask the President to give that fifth and \nsixth year to reduce costs on electric bills.\n  We know long term this rule will secure a place in America's clean \nenergy future for clean coal. For example, the largest public utility, \nTVA, the largest private utility, Southern Company, both plan to put \npollution control equipment on their coal plants and to make at least \none-third of their electricity from coal over the long term.\n  In 1990--22 years ago--Congress told the EPA to make this rule when \nit passed the Clean Air Act amendments. In 2008, the Court told the EPA \nto make this rule.\n  Over the years, I have learned that cleaner air not only means better \nhealth, but also means better jobs for Tennesseans, and I am proud to \nstand up on behalf of the people of Tennessee to uphold this clean air \nrule.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the Tennessean, June 18, 2012]\n\n                    Air Rule Will Literally Save Us\n\n                       (By William Lawson, M.D.)\n\n       Power plant pollution makes people sick and can cut lives \n     short. That is why cleaning up coal-fired power plants is a \n     long overdue, lifesaving necessity that thankfully Sen. Lamar \n     Alexander has embraced to secure both a healthy and sound \n     economic future for our state.\n       I treat patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary \n     disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other lung \n     diseases in those whose lungs are especially vulnerable to \n     the power-plant emissions. But they are not the only ones at \n     risk. My children and yours also are highly susceptible to \n     the long-term repercussions of having to breathe dirty air \n     growing up, which science tells us can prevent lungs from \n     maturing properly. We desperately need Sen. Alexander and \n     Sen. Bob Corker to ensure they receive protection from these \n     toxic pollutants now, not years from now.\n       Protecting them is the recently adopted Power Plant Mercury \n     and Air Toxics Standards, as required under the Clean Air \n     Act. Astonishingly, a campaign is under way to block these \n     public-health protections. Until these standards take effect, \n     coal-fired power plants have no national limits on the amount \n     of mercury or acid gases they may pump out of their \n     smokestacks and into the air we breathe. These standards will \n     prevent 370 premature deaths every year just in Tennessee and \n     will provide $3 billion in annual health benefits by 2016.\n       TVA is already well on its way to meeting these air \n     standards, but some in the Senate are working to make it \n     easier for corporate polluters to block the rule from ever \n     taking effect.\n       Allowing the new emissions standard to move forward will \n     prevent 130,000 asthma attacks and 11,000 premature deaths \n     nationally every year. This reduction in harmful plant \n     emissions will also eliminate 540,000 missed work days on an \n     annual basis, thereby reducing health-care costs and \n     enhancing our overall quality of life.\n       Pollution from these power plants means my patients suffer \n     more. Pollution increases their chances of being \n     hospitalized. Some of these toxic emissions even cause cancer \n     and can interfere with our children's neurological \n     development. The public health benefits are just too \n     significant to ignore. Healthy air and good health have a \n     crystal-clear relationship.\n       Every day, I see in my patients how avoiding even just one \n     asthma attack, acute respiratory infection or even the \n     briefest hospital stay would dramatically enhance their \n     quality of life. A healthier future is ours to have if we \n     stand behind our leaders who are committed to make that \n     tomorrow a reality.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nBarrasso, for 9 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, if the Chair would please give me a \nwarning when 1 minute remains, I would appreciate that.\n  Today I rise in support of the Inhofe Utility MACT resolution. This \nresolution protects communities and jobs in the West, the Midwest, and \nAppalachia, and specifically jobs that depend on coal. These \ncommunities depend on coal to heat and cool their homes at an \naffordable price, to power the factories where they work, and to \ngenerate revenue that creates additional jobs.\n  We are talking about affordable domestic coal that also pays for the \nmortgages on the family home, the clothes and food for children, and \nthe medical care for grandparents. If the Utility MACT rule is allowed \nto proceed, it would mandate that virtually no new coal-fired \npowerplants could be built anymore in the United States, and many still \nin existence would have to shut down. It is painful to think about all \nof the folks who will be out of work, their bills mounting, their \nfamilies losing their homes, and their future looking bleak.\n  Amazingly, the EPA does not dispute these outcomes. It does not \ndispute what I am saying. They know exactly what they are doing. Their \nideology is more important to them than the living and breathing people \nof our coal communities.\n  Just ask the EPA Region 1 Administrator Curtis Spaulding, who was \nvisiting with a group of students in Connecticut. What he went on to \ntalk about was the fact that basically gas plants are the performance \nstandards, which means if you want to build a coal plant, you have a \nbig problem. He said this was a huge decision, when he was talking \nabout these regulations that have come out from Lisa Jackson, the head \nof the EPA.\n  He went on to tell this group of students that in West Virginia, \nPennsylvania, and all those places, you have coal communities that \ndepend on coal. And to say we think those communities should go away? \nThat is what he said. He said we have to do what the law and policy \nsuggested. He said it was painful--it was painful every step of the \nway--but they did it anyway.\n  President Obama's heavy-handed EPA admits these communities in West \nVirginia, Pennsylvania, and many other States in the West, Midwest, and \nAppalachia ``will just go away.''\n  These are chilling words. The EPA is supposed to be about protecting \npeople, protecting their communities, protecting their environment, and \nprotecting their health. With the Utility MACT rule, the EPA is doing \nthe opposite. They are making communities go away. They are hurting \ncommunities--communities of families, children, seniors, gone as a \nresult of these regulations. How could one justify these actions?\n  Well, we are told there are enormous health benefits. They claim \nenormous health benefits to the public by the issuance of this rule. \nFirst of all, how do you protect something if the community is gone? So \nobviously these folks in West Virginia and Pennsylvania are not the \nbeneficiaries of EPA protection.\n  Second, the medical benefits of the rule come from reductions in \nparticulate matter in areas of the country\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\nthat are currently well within healthy thresholds set by the EPA. I \nwill tell you, the EPA is cooking the books.\n  No, this rule does very little to protect the public health. In fact, \nit creates a health crisis in this country because of the additional \nunemployment--the unemployment this rule is going to cause in the West, \nthe Midwest, and in Appalachia.\n  To highlight the point, on Monday of this week a number of us in the \nSenate who are physicians, who are doctors, sent a letter to President \nObama.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of this letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 2012.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President, United States of America,\n     The White House.\n       Dear President Obama: We are writing to express our concern \n     that the barrage of regulations coming out of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designed to end coal in \n     American electricity generation will have a devastating \n     effect on the health of American families. Just before you \n     made the decision to withdraw EPA's plan to revise its ozone \n     standard--a plan which would have destroyed hundreds of \n     thousands of jobs--your former White House Chief of Staff \n     Bill Daley asked the question ``What are the health impacts \n     of unemployment?'' Today, we are requesting that you consider \n     your former aide's question carefully: instead of putting \n     forth rules that create great economic pain which will have a \n     terrible effect on public health, we hope that going forward, \n     you will work with Republicans to craft polices that achieve \n     both environmental protection and economic growth.\n       As you know, proponents of your EPA's aggressive agenda \n     claim that regulations that kill jobs and cause electricity \n     prices to skyrocket will somehow be good for the American \n     people. We come to this issue as medical doctors and would \n     like to offer our ``second opinion'': EPA's regulatory regime \n     will devastate communities that rely on affordable energy, \n     children whose parents will lose their jobs, and the poor and \n     elderly on fixed incomes that do not have the funds to pay \n     for higher energy costs. The result for public health will be \n     disastrous in ways not seen since the Great Depression.\n       One of the centerpieces of your administration's efforts to \n     stop American coal development is the Utility MACT rule--a \n     rule that has such severe standards it will cause as much as \n     20 percent of the existing coal-fired power plant fleet to \n     retire. Combined with numerous other actions by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Interior Department, \n     and Army Corps of Engineers targeting surface coal mining \n     operations, these rules constitute an aggressive regulatory \n     assault on American coal producers, which will hit areas of \n     the heartland--the Midwest, Appalachia, and the Intermountain \n     West--the hardest. The end result will be joblessness across \n     regions of the country whose livelihoods depend on coal \n     development. Joblessness will lead to severe health impacts \n     for communities in these regions.\n       With regard to the health benefits that EPA claims for \n     Utility MACT, EPA's own analysis shows us that over 99 \n     percent of the benefits from the rule come from reducing fine \n     particulate matter (PM2.5), not air toxics. But \n     EPA also states that ``[over 90 percent] of the \n     PM2.5-related benefits associated with [Utility \n     MACT] occur below the level of the [NAAQS].''\n       Not only are PM emissions distinct from mercury and other \n     toxics, but they are also subject to other regulatory \n     regimes. For example, Section 108 of the Clean Air Act \n     directs the EPA to set PM emission levels that are \n     ``requisite to protect the public health''. Thus, EPA is \n     either double-counting the PM benefits already being \n     delivered by existing regulatory regimes, or setting \n     standards beyond those required to protect public health.\n       EPA estimates that the cost of the rule will be around $11 \n     billion annually, but that it will yield no more than $6 \n     million in benefits from reducing mercury and other air \n     toxics. So by the agency's own calculations, Utility MACT \n     completely fails the cost/benefit test.\n       When looking at this analysis, the only conclusion is that \n     Utility MACT, as well as the many other EPA rules that cost \n     billions but yield few benefits are not about public health. \n     They are about ending coal development and the good paying \n     jobs it provides.\n       We are not the only members in the medical field that are \n     concerned about the effects of a jobless economy on the \n     health and well being of Americans. Dr. Harvey Brenner of \n     Johns Hopkins University testified on June 15th, 2011 before \n     the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee explaining \n     that unemployment is a risk factor for elevated illness and \n     mortality rates. In addition, the National Center for Health \n     Statistics has found that children in poor families are four \n     times as likely to be in bad health as wealthier families.\n       Economists have also studied this issue. A May 13th, 2012 \n     Op-Ed in the New York Times by economists Dean Baker and \n     Kevin Hasset entitled ``The Human Disaster of Unemployment'' \n     found that children of unemployed parents make 9 percent less \n     than children of employed parents. The same article cites \n     research by economists Daniel Sullivan and Till von Wachter \n     who found that unemployed men face a 25 percent increase in \n     the risk of dying from cancer.\n       These are just a few examples of the numerous reports \n     warning of a looming public health crisis due to \n     unemployment. A more thorough evaluation of this problem can \n     be found in a recently released report entitled, ``Red Tape \n     Making Americans Sick--A New Report on the Health Impacts of \n     High Unemployment'' which we are including here for your \n     review.\n       The EPA should immediately stop pushing expensive \n     regulations that put Americans out of work and into the \n     doctor's office. We respectfully ask that your agencies \n     adequately examine the negative health implications of \n     unemployment into the cost/benefit analysis of the numerous \n     regulations that are stifling job growth, before making \n     health benefit claims to Congress and the public.\n       We ask that instead of exacerbating unemployment and \n     harming public health that you work with us in our efforts to \n     implement policies that achieve true health benefits without \n     destroying jobs, and indeed American coal development, in the \n     process.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Barrasso.\n     Rand Paul.\n     Tom Coburn.\n     John Boozman.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. In this letter, we expressed our concerns about the \nimpending health crisis the unemployment caused by the EPA's policies \nis having on families, children, pregnant mothers, and on the elderly. \nThe letter reads in part:\n\n       We are writing to express our concern that the barrage of \n     regulations coming out of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) designed to end coal in American electricity generation \n     will have a devastating effect on the health of American \n     families. Just before you made the decision to withdraw EPA's \n     plan to revise its ozone standard--a plan which would have \n     destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs--your former White \n     House Chief of Staff Bill Daley asked the question ``What are \n     the health impacts of unemployment?'' Today, we are \n     requesting that you consider your former aide's question \n     carefully: instead of putting forth rules that create great \n     economic pain which will have a terrible effect on public \n     health, we hope that going forward, you will work with \n     Republicans to craft policies that achieve both environmental \n     protection and economic growth.\n\n  And that is the key--``and economic growth''--not economic \ndestruction.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       As you know, proponents of your EPA's aggressive agenda \n     claim that regulations that kill jobs and cause electricity \n     prices to skyrocket will somehow be good for the American \n     people. We come to this issue as medical doctors and would \n     like to offer our ``second opinion'': EPA's regulatory regime \n     will devastate communities that rely on affordable energy, \n     children whose parents will lose their jobs, and the poor and \n     elderly on fixed incomes that do not have the funds to pay \n     for higher energy costs. The result for public health will be \n     disastrous in ways not seen since the Great Depression.\n\n  Later on in the letter we talk about the latest research on the \nhealth impacts of unemployment. A doctor from Johns Hopkins who \ntestified last year before the Senate Environment and Public Health \nCommittee explained that unemployment is a risk factor--a risk factor--\nfor elevated illness and mortality rates. In addition, the National \nCenter for Health Statistics has found that children in poor families \nare four times as likely to be in bad health as other families.\n  Economists have also studied this issue. On May 13, 2012, in the New \nYork Times, is ``The Human Disaster Of Unemployment.'' That is what \nthis EPA regulation is going to do today, cause additional human \ndisaster for people out of work.\n  We included for the President a copy of a report I have written \ncalled ``Red Tape Making Americans Sick--A New Report on the Health \nImpacts of High Unemployment.'' Studies show EPA rules cost Americans \ntheir jobs and their health. This report contains the latest research \nfrom medical professionals from Johns Hopkins, from Yale, and others \nthat show that unemployment causes serious health impacts.\n  Unemployment has been rampant in this country under this \nadministration, and it has been due in many ways to the mountains of \njob-crushing redtape from the EPA and other agencies. The EPA's Utility \nMACT rule will only make things worse for hard-hit areas in the West, \nMidwest, and Appalachia.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since 2008 Montana has \nlost 3,200 manufacturing jobs, Missouri 41,000, Ohio 100,000, Michigan \n67,000 jobs\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nlost, Pennsylvania 80,000, and West Virginia 7,000. Each one of these \npeople who lost their job will be subjected to greater risks of cancer, \nheart attack, stroke, depression. There is a higher incidence, as we \nknow, of spousal abuse, substance abuse in these families. As \ndemonstrated by the latest research, their children will suffer, too, \nas medical costs pile up, as electricity bills to heat and cool their \nhomes skyrocket, and the cost of everyday living continues to go up. \nThe Utility MACT will only expose thousands more to these risks.\n  The EPA should immediately stop pushing expensive regulations that \nput Americans out of work and into their doctor's office. Instead of \nexacerbating unemployment and harming public health, this \nadministration and this EPA need to work with Republicans--work \ntogether in our efforts to implement policies that achieve true health \nbenefits without destroying jobs and, indeed, American affordable \nenergy in the process.\n  We need to keep American energy and make American energy as clean as \nwe can, as fast as we can, while still keeping good-paying jobs and \nkeeping energy prices affordable. This is a recipe for a healthier, \neconomically stronger country.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote for the Inhofe Utility MACT amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield myself 1 minute, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following--an \neditorial written by the very type of companies my friend Senator \nBarrasso mentioned who have said they are just fine with the EPA's new \nair quality regulations. Do you know why? Half of the coal-fired \nutilities have already made these adjustments. They are clean. And if \nit is up to Senator Barrasso, the other dirty plants will keep on \nspewing forth the most toxic and dangerous pollutants.\n  The other is a new poll taken in March of this year which shows that \n78 percent of likely voters have asked us to get out of the way and let \nthe EPA do its job in controlling industrial and power-sector mercury \nand toxic air pollution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              (From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 8, 2010]\n\n          We're OK With the EPA's New Air-Quality Regulations\n\n       Your editorial ``The EPA Permitorium'' (Nov. 22) \n     mischaracterized the EPA's air-quality regulations. These are \n     required under the Clean Air Act, which a bipartisan Congress \n     and a Republican president amended in 1990, and many are in \n     response to court orders requiring the EPA to fix regulations \n     that courts ruled invalid.\n       The electric sector has known that these rules were coming. \n     Many companies, including ours, have already invested in \n     modern air-pollution control technologies and cleaner and \n     more efficient power plants. For over a decade, companies \n     have recognized that the industry would need to install \n     controls to comply with the act's air toxicity requirements, \n     and the technology exists to cost efficiently control such \n     emissions, including mercury and acid gases. The EPA is now \n     under a court deadline to finalize that rule before the end \n     of 2011 because of the previous delays.\n       To suggest that plants are retiring because of the EPA's \n     regulations fails to recognize that lower power prices and \n     depressed demand are the primary retirement drivers. The \n     units retiring are generally small, old nd inefficient. These \n     retirements are long overdue.\n       Contrary to the claims that the EPA's agenda will have \n     negative economic consequences, our companies' experience \n     complying with air quality regulations demonstrates that \n     regulations can yield important economic benefits, including \n     job creation, while maintaining reliability.\n       The time to make greater use of existing modern units and \n     to further modernize our nation's generating fleet is now. \n     Our companies are committed to ensuring the EPA develops and \n     implements the regulations consistent with the act's \n     requirements.\n         Peter Darbee, chairman, president and CEO, PG Corp.; \n           Jack Fusco, president and CEO, Calpine Corp.; Lewis \n           Hay, chairman and CEO, NextEra Energy, Inc.; Ralph \n           Izzo, chairman, president and CEO, Public Service \n           Enterprise Group Inc.; Thomas King, president, National \n           Grid USA; John Rowe, chairman and CEO, Exelon Corp.; \n           Mayo Shattuck, chairman, president and CEO, \n           Constellation Energy Group; Larry Weis, general \n           manager, Austin Energy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          (From the American Lung Association, Mar. 21, 2012]\n\n New Poll Shows the Public Wants EPA To Do More To Reduce Air Pollution\n\n\n Voters Support Setting Stronger Carbon Pollution Standards to Protect \n                             Public Health\n\n       Washington, DC.--As big polluters and their allies in \n     Congress continue attacks on the Clean Air Act, the American \n     Lung Association released a new bipartisan survey examining \n     public views of the Clean Air Act and the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA) efforts to update and enforce \n     lifesaving clean air standards, including carbon and mercury \n     emissions from power plants.\n       The bipartisan survey, conducted by Democratic Research \n     polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research and Republican \n     firm Perception Insight, finds that nearly three-quarters of \n     likely voters (73 percent) nationwide support the view that \n     it is possible to protect public health through stronger air \n     quality standards while achieving a healthy economy, over the \n     notion that we must choose between public health or a strong \n     economy. This overwhelming support includes 78 percent of \n     independents, 60 percent of Republicans and 62 percent of \n     conservatives, as well as significant support in Maine, \n     Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n       The Obama Administration will soon release updated clean \n     air standards for carbon pollution emitted by power plants, \n     and a substantial majority of voters support the EPA \n     implementing these standards, even after hearing opposing \n     arguments that stricter standards will damage the economic \n     recovery. Initially, 72 percent of voters nationwide support \n     the new protections on carbon emissions from power plants, \n     including overwhelming majorities of both Democrats and \n     Independents and a majority of Republicans.\n       After listening to a balanced debate with message both for \n     and against setting new carbon standards, support still \n     remained robust with a near 2-to-1 margin (63 percent in \n     favor and 33 percent opposed). Support remained especially \n     robust in Maine and Pennsylvania (64 percent in each state). \n     The majority of Ohio voters (52 percent) also favored new \n     carbon standards, which is notable since the poll was \n     conducted during a period of heavy media attention concerning \n     statewide electricity rate increases and potential power \n     plant shutdowns.\n       ``This bipartisan poll affirms that clean air protections \n     have broad support across the political spectrum,'' said \n     Peter Iwanowicz, Assistant Vice President, National Policy \n     and Advocacy with the American Lung Association. ``Big \n     polluters and their allies in Congress cannot ignore the \n     facts; more air pollution means more childhood asthma \n     attacks, more illness and more people dying prematurely. It's \n     time polluters and their Congressional allies drop their \n     attempts to weaken, block or delay clean air protections and \n     listen to the public who overwhelmingly wants the EPA to do \n     more to protect the air we breathe.''\n       Voters also voiced strong support for stricter standards to \n     control industrial and power sector mercury and toxic air \n     pollution. When asked about setting stricter limits on the \n     amount of mercury that power plants and other facilities \n     emit, 78 percent of likely voters were in favor of the EPA \n     updating these standards.\n       Strong support was also seen for stricter standards on \n     industrial boilers. Initially, 69 percent of voters supported \n     the EPA implementing stricter standards on boiler emissions. \n     After hearing messaging from both sides of the issue, voters \n     continued to support these standards by nearly a 20-point \n     margin (56 percent favor, 37 percent oppose).\n       Key poll findings include: nearly three quarters (73 \n     percent) of voters, say that we do not have to choose between \n     air quality and a strong economy--we can achieve both; a 2-\n     to-1 majority (60 to 31 percent) believe that strengthening \n     safeguards against pollution will create, rather than \n     destroy, jobs by encouraging innovation; about two-thirds of \n     voters (66 percent) favor EPA updating air pollution \n     standards by setting stricter limits; 72 percent of voters \n     support new standards for carbon pollution from power plants \n     and support is strong (63 percent) after hearing arguments \n     from both sides of the issue; 60 percent of voters support \n     stricter standards for gasoline and limits on the amount of \n     tailpipe emissions from cars and SUVs (particular strong \n     given all the recent attention to high gasoline prices).\n       Despite more than a year's worth of continued attacks on \n     clean air protections from big corporate polluters and their \n     allies in Congress, voters across the political spectrum view \n     the Clean Air Act very positively; with a 2-to-1 favorable to \n     unfavorable ratio. At the same time, feelings toward Congress \n     continue to drop, especially among Democrats and \n     independents. Just 18 percent of voters nationally give \n     Congress a favorable rating, while 56 percent rate Congress \n     unfavorable. The unfavorable rating of Congress is up 9 \n     percent since the American Lung Association's last survey \n     released in June 2011.\n       ``The survey clearly indicates that voters reject the \n     notion that we have to choose between strong safeguards \n     against air pollution and economic growth,'' said Andrew \n     Bauman, Vice President at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. \n     ``In fact, voters overwhelmingly believe that stronger \n     safeguards against air pollution will create jobs in \n     America.''\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\n       ``The poll does show there is broad support across partisan \n     lines for new carbon regulations on power plants,'' said Marc \n     DelSignore, President of Perception Insight. ``However, there \n     is a significant difference in the views regarding the impact \n     regulations may have on the economy, with Republicans \n     expressing higher concern for possible job loss and rising \n     energy prices than Democrats or independents.''\n\n  This resolution of disapproval goes against 78 percent of the \nAmerican people. They are no fools. I heard a second opinion? I have \ngot a third opinion, and my third opinion is that if you look at this \npoll, you understand that the American people get it. They know the \ntechnology exists, and they know these improvements can be made. They \nknow there are jobs created when best-available control technology is \nput in, and they are opposed to this kind of resolution that would roll \nback the clock and continue our people breathing in toxins.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I won't yield because Senator Cardin is waiting. I yield \nto Senator Cardin 6 minutes, and then I will yield to the Senator on \nhis time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first I want to thank Senator Boxer for \nher extraordinary leadership on these issues.\n  I invite my friend from Wyoming to come to Glen Burnie, MD, and see \nthe 12,000 megawatt Brandon Shores powerplant which it is not only \noperating, but it is in full compliance with Maryland's healthy air law \nthat is very similar to the proposed regulations we are debating today. \nThat powerplant didn't close. It made the investments so that we have a \nclean energy source and in the process created 2,000 jobs in \nmodernizing that powerplant.\n  That is why we have many companies that support the regulation, \nbecause they know it is going to mean more jobs--including Ceres and \nAmerican Boiler Manufacturers Association, as well as companies such as \nWL Gore.\n  I want to thank Senator Rockefeller for his extraordinary statement. \nI was on the floor listening to him speaking on behalf of the people of \nWest Virginia. They are interested in a clean economy, good health, and \njobs.\n  I want to thank Senator Alexander for speaking up for the people of \nTennessee, because he understands the importance of sensible air \nquality standards.\n  I want to speak on behalf of the people of Maryland, on behalf of the \nfamilies I have the honor of representing in the Senate.\n  This is the week that summer camps start. Some parents are going to \nhave to make a decision, when we have a day that is rated as a code \norange or a code red because of air quality issues concerning ground-\nlevel ozone, as to whether they are going to send their child to camp \nthat day if that child has a respiratory issue, an asthma issue, as to \nwhether that child should be outdoors during that day when we have \nthese air quality warnings. If the parent decides to keep the child at \nhome, they have lost that day of camp and the cost of that day of camp. \nThey have lost a day of work, because somebody is going to have to stay \nat home with the child. If they send the child to camp and they have an \nepisode, they may be one of the over 12,000 children who will end up in \nemergency rooms as a result of dirty air that could be cleaned up by \nthe passage and enactment of these regulations.\n  The chairman of the Environment and Public Works committee can tell \nus chapter and verse about the number of premature deaths and those \nwith chronic bronchitis. These toxins that are going into our air cause \ncancers and neurological developmental and reproductive problems. It is \nparticularly dangerous for children. And the source? Powerplants that \nhave not put in the investment for clean air.\n  This is doable. It has been done in Maryland and in many powerplants \naround the Nation. In fact, my State--concerned about our children, \nconcerned about our health--passed the Maryland Healthy Air Act, and \nthe mercury standards in that legislation are very similar to what \nthese regulations would require. Maryland has reduced its mercury and \nits SOX and NOX emissions from the 22-percent \nlevel, 90 percent mercury, 80 percent sulfur dioxide, and 70 percent \nNOX. And it helped our economy, as I have already pointed \nout, in the Brandon Shores work that was done.\n  But here is the challenge we have in Maryland. Maryland's experience \nshows that an aggressive timeline is not only achievable but it is also \ndesirable. Powerplants are capable of meeting aggressive timelines, and \nthe benefits are unparalleled. Air pollution control protects public \nhealth and saves billions of dollars associated with medical costs. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is required to do a study of cost \nbenefit: How much cost for how much benefit? For every $1 of compliance \ncost, we save $3 to $9 for our economy. That is a great investment. We \nlike those types of investments.\n  The Maryland experience also shows that we need a national standard \nto effectively address air pollution. Maryland has done what is right, \nbut our children are still at risk. Why? Because air pollution knows no \nState boundary. We are downwind. We have done what is right, but our \nchildren are still at risk. That is why we need these standards. We \nshowed that you can do it in a cost-effective way, creating jobs for \nour community. You can have a clean environment, you can have a growing \neconomy. In fact, you can't do it without it. And that is what these \nregulations are about.\n  As Senator Alexander said, we have been waiting 20 years for these \nregulations. In 1990, Congress passed the Clean Air Act. In 2008, our \ncourts said we can't delay it any longer.\n  It is our responsibility to protect the public health. It is our \nresponsibility to do what is right. I urge my colleagues to reject this \nresolution that would deny us the opportunity of protecting our public \nhealth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I heard the Senator from California talk \nabout 78 percent of the people in this country want to reduce mercury. \nI am part of that 78 percent. The problem is this bill does not address \nthat. By their own numbers, the EPA said the cost is around $10 \nbillion. Of that, less than $6 million would be addressing mercury. The \nrest of that is in particulate matter, something already recognized \nunder the Clean Air Act.\n  I yield to the junior Senator from West Virginia for 6 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \ncongressional resolution of disapproval that Senator Inhofe has filed \nunder the Congressional Review Act to stop the EPA from implementing \none of the most expensive rules in recent memory. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Inhofe, for introducing this important resolution to send a \nmessage to the EPA.\n  I would like to say a few words about the little State of West \nVirginia that does the heavy lifting that helps this entire Nation. We \nmine the coal, we make the steel, we have done just about everything we \npossibly can. We probably have more people serving in the military, \npercentage-wise, than any other State. We have given our all for this \ngreat country, and we will continue to do the heavy lifting. But what \nwe have to do is make sure the EPA, make sure this government is \nworking with us, not against us. The Government's role is to be a \npartner, not an adversary but an ally. We are asking the government to \nwork with businesses, not against them. Their actions will put \nthousands of hard-working Americans out of a job in the worst economy \nin generations.\n  Do not raise electricity rates on the consumers who can barely afford \ntheir monthly bills today as it is. It is mostly our seniors and people \nstruggling with their families trying to make a living. The economic \nreality is that the environment and economy have to work hand in hand. \nIt has to be in balance.\n  From the day I arrived at the Senate, I have been determined to stop \nthe EPA's job-killing agenda, and this resolution of disapproval takes \nan important step to rein in this out-of-control agency. In the State \nof West Virginia, like most States, we do our rules and regulations \nthrough a legislative process. People have to vote. We do not give \nbureaucratic agencies the right to set policy. The people have given us \nthat responsibility and right as elected\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\nleaders to set the policy. That is what we are asking. We have this \nagency stepping way beyond its boundaries, further than our Founding \nFathers ever intended, that is putting an absolute burden on the backs \nof every American.\n  Along with a handful of other rules on the verge of being implemented \nor already in place, the Utility MACT rule would cost the economy over \n$275 billion over the next 25 years, according to the Electric Power \nResearch Institute. The Utility MACT could cost 1.3 million jobs over \nthe next two decades, according to the National Economic Research \nAssociation.\n  On the issue of Utility MACT, I have heard from thousands of West \nVirginians in the past several weeks. In fact, just yesterday I had 45 \nof my constituents from Boone County, WV, get on a bus, 756 miles, \ndrive all day to get here to be able to speak to some of us, and drive \nlast night to go back home. That is how committed and dedicated most of \nthem are. They had either worked in the mines or were working in some \naspect of mining.\n  People think mining is just coal mining and coal mining only. It is \nnot. The energy business is basically--if people work in a battery \nfactory or a machine shop, if they work in any type of ancillary jobs, \nthe ripple effect to their economy is unbelievable. If they work in a \npowerplant--these people were scared to death because all they hear \nevery day is they are going to lose their jobs because the government \nis going to shut them down and work against them.\n  About three-fourths of the miners in that room had already been laid \noff. They are fighting for their jobs. They brought their families and \nchildren with them. They wanted to make sure we could put the faces of \nreal people on what is happening.\n  Our coal miners are the salt of the Earth. They work so hard to \nprovide energy for our country and provide for their families. They do \nnot want a handout. All they want is a work permit. That is all they \nhave asked for. Now is not the time to pull the rug out from under them \nand make them worry about how they will pay their bills and feed their \nfamily.\n  I believe this country needs to strike a balance, and I have said \nthat before. Our lives are about balance. Every day people get up in \nthe morning they look for a balance in their lives. They look for a \nbalance in how they can run their business, how they can make a living. \nThat is what we need to find in this body today. The EPA has truly gone \ntoo far.\n  We have heard so many different testimonies about that. That is why I \nwill be casting my vote in favor of this resolution by Senator Inhofe \nto disapprove of the new rules, and I urge all my colleagues to do the \nsame. I truly believe energy is an issue where we can bring thoughtful \nmembers of both parties together to work out solutions.\n  Let me point out an important example. In the time I served, I \nlearned that many of my colleagues know of West Virginia only as a coal \nState. They have no idea what we do and how we do it. This past weekend \nI wanted to make sure they understood that not only do we do coal, we \ndo wind, we do hydro, we do natural gas with the Marcellus shale--\na tremendous find--we do biomass, we do everything we can, and we think \nevery State should be held accountable and responsible to try to be \nenergy independent and do it in the most environmentally friendly way.\n\n  This weekend I invited leaders of the Energy Committee, Senators \nWyden and Murkowski, a Democrat and a Republican, to spend a weekend \nwith me to tour our State to see how West Virginia's all-in policy for \nenergy works. One of them will likely be the next chair of Energy and \nNatural Resources, but I assure you both of them will work as a team \ntrying to find policy that works for this country. You will hear both \nof them say one size doesn't fit all. We need everything. We need a \ncomprehensive energy plan for this country--which brings me to our \nrecent visit to West Virginia.\n  They saw how we are using an ``all-of-the-above'' approach. In the \neastern part of our State we stopped at Mount Storm. They saw a 265-\nmegawatt wind farm. They saw a 1,600-megawatt coal-fired plant with the \nmost modern technology that cleans the air up to 95 percent. They saw \nit all. When the wind is not blowing, basically they saw there was no \npower generated--especially in the hot summer or the cold winter.\n  Basically what we are saying is we are doing everything we possibly \ncan. We will continue. In short, we saw a little bit of everything that \ncan be done if we work together. I think it should be a bipartisan \neffort to find a solution. We cannot keep fighting each other, and \nagencies cannot keep controlling what we are not legislating. If it has \nnot been legislated, it should not be put into law until we are able to \nevaluate it.\n  I appreciate what is being done today, the bipartisan effort we are \ntalking about. We have our differences, but we can come together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think when the Senator talks about \nbalance, he ought to recognize that one-half of the coal-fired \nutilities have already made these adjustments, they have reported to \nus, with very little impact to electricity rates.\n  I yield 5 minutes to Senator Sanders.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me begin by saying I suspect that I \nhave the strongest lifetime proworker voting record in the Senate. I \nwant to create jobs, not cut jobs. What Senator Boxer and Senator \nCardin and others are talking about is creating meaningful, good-paying \njobs as we retrofit coal-burning plants so they do not poison the \nchildren of Vermont and other States around the country.\n  So to Senator Inhofe and others, I say respectfully: Stop poisoning \nour children. Let them grow up in a healthy way.\n  The Clean Air Act is set to cut mercury pollution by 90 percent using \ntechnology that is available right now. That would be good news since \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say mercury can cause \nchildren to have ``brain damage, mental retardation, blindness, \nseizures, and the inability to speak.''\n  We get exposed to mercury simply by eating fish contaminated with it, \nand we have seen fish advisories in 48 out of the 50 States in this \ncountry. Wouldn't it be nice if the men and women and the kids who go \nfishing could actually eat the fish they catch rather than worry about \nbeing made sick by those fish?\n  Powerplants are responsible for one-third of the mercury deposits in \nthe United States, but Senator Inhofe's resolution would let them keep \nright on polluting. His resolution would also eliminate protections \nagainst cancer-causing pollutants such as arsenic, as well as toxic \nsoot that causes asthma attacks. Leading medical organizations, \nincluding the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Lung \nAssociation, the American Heart Association, and the American Nurses \nAssociation have said ``Senator Inhofe's resolution would leave \nmillions of Americans permanently at risk from toxic air pollution from \npowerplants that directly threaten pulmonary, cardiovascular and \nneurological health and development.''\n  That is not Bernie Sanders saying that; it is the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the American Lung Association, the American Heart \nAssociation, and the American Nurses Association.\n  We are talking about preventing thousands and thousands of premature \ndeaths. We are talking about preventing heart attacks. We are talking \nabout what is a very serious problem in my State, and that is asthma. \nMaybe Senator Inhofe would like to join me in the State of Vermont--I \ngo to a lot of schools and I very often ask the kids and ask the school \nnurses how many kids are suffering with asthma, and many hands go up. \nThank you very much. We do not want to see more asthma in Vermont or in \nother States that are downwind.\n  We hear a lot from some of our Republican friends about jobs. The \ntruth is if we are aggressive in cleaning up these coal-powered plants, \nwe can create, and we have already seen created, many good, decent-\npaying jobs. In fact, if we invest--if the utility industries will \ninvest in pollution controls, we can create almost 300,000 jobs a year \nfor the next 5 years--meaningful, good-\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\npaying jobs making sure that our air is cleaner and that our people do \nnot get sick.\n  Let's talk about job creation and cleaning up our environment. This \nis not just theory. I am the chairman of the Clean Jobs Subcommittee. \nWe heard from Constellation Energy, which installed pollution controls \nat their 1280-megawatt coal plant in Maryland that cut mercury \nemissions by 90 percent. This $885 million investment created at its \npeak 1,385 jobs onsite at the plant for boilermakers, steamfitters, \npipefitters, operating engineers, ironworkers, electricians, \ncarpenters, teamsters, laborers--just the kind of jobs we want to \ncreate. The American people know we have to rebuild our infrastructure. \nWe can create jobs doing that. This is one of the areas where we can \ncreate decent-paying jobs and help keep our kids from getting sick.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I urge very strongly a ``no'' vote against the Inhofe \nresolution.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Risch.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I come to the floor this morning to urge \nan affirmative vote for Senator Inhofe's resolution. With all due \nrespect to my friend from Vermont, this is not a job-creating bill. \nVirtually everyone who has looked at that has said this will kill jobs; \nthis will move jobs overseas. Everyone who has looked at this has said \nit will increase the cost of energy for the American taxpayer.\n  It does two things: It kills jobs and it increases the cost of \nenergy. Why would anyone vote for this? This is absolute foolishness. \nToday, Americans are concerned about jobs--they are really concerned \nabout jobs. Everywhere I go, people ask me about jobs. They ask me \nabout the economy.\n  Today, we, as Senators, have the opportunity to do something about \nthat. The failure of this resolution and the implementation of the rule \nthe EPA has put in front of us is going to kill jobs and is going to \nincrease the cost of energy in America. It is going to do precisely \nwhat so many Senators come to the floor and whine about; that is, run \njobs overseas.\n  If you are a job creator, if you are someone thinking of investing, \nif you are someone who wants to move the American economy forward, you \nlook at every single aspect of it. When you see something like this--\nand it is not just this, it is this and a parade of never-ending rules \nand regulations that kill jobs and increase the costs for the job \ncreators--these are things that clearly urge job creators to create \njobs in a place other than America. That is just flat wrong.\n  That is not what I am here today to talk about primarily. What I am \nhere today to talk about is the way we are going about it. The Founding \nFathers did a good job when they set up our government. Indeed, out of \nthe thousands of governments that have been created over the years, \nmost of which have failed, only one has had the success our Founding \nFathers had. They created a government out of fear of government. They \ndidn't create a government that said: How can we do this? How can we do \nthat? They were interested in keeping government away from them, \nkeeping government away from their jobs, from their businesses, and \nfrom their investments. That is what they wanted to do, and it worked \nfor about 200 years. For about 200 years the Federal Government left \nthe American people and the job creators alone.\n\n  Today, over the last 3\\1/2\\ decades or so, the Federal Government has \nstuck its nose into every single aspect of our lives, and here we go \nagain. What we have here is the Federal Government using its power and \nits regulatory process to get its nose into places where it should not \nbe. This is the job of Congress. It is not the job of the bureaucracy \nto pass these kinds of laws. This isn't a rule or a regulation as the \nFounding Fathers anticipated these sorts of things. The Founding \nFathers set this up with three branches of government to fight with \neach other so they would leave the American people alone. They said the \njob of creating laws, the job of creating regulations, the job of \ncreating rules was the job of the Congress.\n  Somewhere along the line, we have lost our way. Last year the \nCongress passed about 2,000 pages of legislation, and that included the \nspending bills. Last year the bureaucracy passed about 70,000 pages of \nrules and regulations that have the same force and effect as law.\n  The Congress has lost the ability to pass the laws that govern \nconduct in the United States. People will argue, yes, but Congress \nwon't do it; Congress won't act. That is precisely the point. We were \nelected by the American people to act or not act as is appropriate. \nWhen we don't act, when we don't do something, it is just as important \nas when we do something. Indeed, I would argue many times more \nimportant. Well, what it has come to today is 2,000 pages versus 70,000 \npages.\n  In Idaho we had the same problem for a lot of years. In Idaho it was \nthe same way. The bureaucracy could pass a rule or regulation that had \nthe force and effect of law.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. RISCH. We have changed that and gotten it to where the \nlegislature has full control. This has to change. Congress has to take \nback its ability to handle the law as it is imposed and the burden that \nis imposed on the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Delaware, Senator \nCarper.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. While our friend from Idaho is trying to leave the Senate \nfloor, I want to say that the Congress did act. Harry Truman said the \nonly thing that is new in the world is the history we never learned or \nforgot. The Congress did act with a Republican President, a guy named \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush. It was passed overwhelmingly in the House \nand in the Senate and supported, as I recall, by those of us here on \nthe Senate floor today.\n  I will go over a little history here. In 1990, the Clean Air Act \nsaid: Look, there are problems with toxic air emissions. We are not \nsure where they are coming from, but let's spend a little bit of time \nand have the EPA figure it out. They spent 10 years trying to figure it \nout. In the last year of the Clinton administration, the conclusion was \nreached that a lot of the toxic air emissions such as mercury, arsenic, \nheavy metals, acid gases, come from utilities. A lot comes from \nutilities.\n  In 2001, the brandnew Bush administration said: Well, let's go to \nwork and figure out what to do about it. Five years later in 2005, the \nBush administration said: Here is a rule to deal not with the 70 toxic \nemissions but with one, mercury. Just one. Immediately lawsuits were \nfiled, and in 2008 the Federal courts said: What about the other 70 \ntoxins? They didn't do anything about the other 70 toxins. What they \ndid with mercury was a cap-and-trade system which doesn't work for \nmercury. The courts remanded it to the EPA and said: Let's try that \nagain.\n  Senator Alexander has been heroic on these issues. And while I have \nworked literally for years to try to make sure the Congress provided \nsome leadership--we do see toxic air emissions from sulfur dioxide and \nnitrous oxide as well--there is not an appetite with the utilities to \nactually support legislation.\n  We finally gave it a great try in 2010. My friend Senator Inhofe was \npart of the effort to get legislation enacted. Finally, I think the \nutilities said we would rather take our chances on an election and see \nwhat the election yields and see if we have to deal with the EPA. Well, \nwe had an election and now the courts are saying: EPA, you have to \nrule. You have to provide leadership, and the EPA has done that. It is \nnot as if they are jamming it down anybody's throat.\n  Senator Alexander and I offered legislation that said by 2015 there \nhas to be a 90-percent reduction in mercury. What the EPA has said is \nby 2015, there has to be a 90-percent reduction plus they need to \naddress a bunch of other toxic emissions. The EPA said the States can \ngive an automatic 1-year extension. If utilities have problems with \ngetting this done by 2016, they can apply for another 2-year extension. \nThis started in 1990. It is 2012. When we play out the string, it could \nbe as late as 2018 to comply.\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\n  In the meantime, States including Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nNew Jersey, and a bunch of us on the east coast, are downwind of all \nthe States that put up the pollution in the air. We have to breathe it.\n  Look, the technology exists to fix this problem. Fifty percent of the \nutilities have already applied the technology. It works. It is broadly \ndeployed. Most utilities have the money to pay for this. If they don't, \nthey have the ability to raise capital.\n  There are tens of thousands of workers who wish to do this work. The \nidea that we have to choose between a stronger economy and a cleaner \nenvironment is a false choice. It has always been a false choice, and \nit is a false choice here today.\n  I am a native of West Virginia. After my dad finished high school, he \nwas a coal miner for a short time, so I have relatives back in West \nVirginia. I care a lot about the State and the people who live there. I \nwant to make sure we do whatever is fair to them. I want to thank Jay \nRockefeller for stepping up for West Virginia and being a hero here \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Missouri, Mr. Blunt.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I thank the Senator for this time. I rise \nin support of this resolution. We have only been able to use the \nCongressional Review Act successfully one time, and I think that means \nat some point we need to look at the Congressional Review Act because \nthese regulations often don't meet the commonsense standard, and this \nis one of them. However, it appears to meet the standards that the \nPresident would want his regulators to meet.\n  In fact, in January of 2008, the President--while running for \nPresident--said that coal-fired plants would go bankrupt. He said later \nin the campaign that electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket \nunder his plan to tax greenhouse gas emissions through what was then \nthe cap-and-trade system. The House passed that system in 2009.\n  Missouri utilities all went together, including the rural electric \ncooperatives, the for-profit utilities, and the municipal utilities and \npaid for a study in our State, which is in the top six States of \ndependence on coal. That study indicated that the average utility bill \nwould go up 82 percent in the first 10 years and double shortly after \nthat. You don't have to be a genius to get your utility bill out and \nmultiply it by two. If it is your utility bill at home, it may be a \nutility bill you cannot pay. If it is your utility bill at work, it may \nmean that your job is no longer there because the utility bill went up. \nThat House-passed bill would have had that result in our State. There \nare five States that are more dependent on coal than we are for \nutilities.\n  The Senate then rejected the cap-and-trade bill, and thank goodness \nit did. But when it did, the President said there are other ways of \n``skinning the cat.'' He said there are other ways besides just an \n``all-of-the-above'' energy policy. His administration has bypassed the \nCongress, bypassed the will of the American people, and they are \nclearly trying to do by regulation what I believe the Congress would \nnow never do. Once the American people figured out that cap-and-trade \nand policies such as this would have this devastating impact on their \nutility bill--about 50 percent of all of the utilities from the middle \nof Pennsylvania to the western edge of Wyoming are coal-generated \nutilities. Once people figured that out and the impact it had on their \nability to have a job and their ability to do what they need to do at \ntheir house, they didn't want to do it.\n  With this rule the EPA has finalized a regulation that would require \npower companies to reduce emissions in a period that is unrealistically \nshort. A 3-year timeframe means that many power-generated facilities \ndon't reduce emissions, they close the plant. What this stands for is \nan assault on coal and coal-based utilities. The Administrator of the \nEPA, Lisa Jackson, said recently that the current challenges for the \ncoal industry are ``entirely economic.'' That is what she said, \n``entirely economic.'' I don't know how anyone who is paying attention \nto the EPA, to regulations, or to the price of coal, could say that the \nproblems are entirely economic. They are not economic at all. We have \nmore recoverable coal than anybody in the world. We now think we have \nmore recoverable natural gas than anybody in the world.\n  By 2016, under the current EPA rules that are out there, plus this \none, our utilities in our State would go up as much as 23 percent for \nthe average Missourian, and more than that for some people in parts of \nour State. That is a 23-percent increase on your utility bill by 2016.\n  The estimates are that by 2020, we will lose 76,000 jobs because of \nthat increase in utility rates. Where are those jobs going to go? They \nare not going to go to California or Massachusetts or somebody who has \nbills higher than ours today. They are going to go to places that care \na lot less about what comes out of the smokestack than we do.\n  Last year in States where coal generated at least 60 percent of the \nelectricity, consumers paid 30 percent less in energy prices than \nStates that used less coal for their electricity. And in our State, as \nI said, 82 percent of our electricity comes from coal.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I urge my colleagues to vote for the issue before us that \nsays we don't want to have this rule. We want to do the right thing, \nnot the wrong thing.\n  I thank the Senator for this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senate will vote today on whether to \nproceed to a congressional resolution of disapproval that I strongly \noppose. This resolution would repeal the Environmental Protection \nAgency's mercury and air toxics standards rule and undo the great \nstrides the Agency has taken to safeguard the public's health and \nwelfare and our quality of life in this great land.\n  The EPA's mercury and air toxics standards represent a true \nbreakthrough in environmental policy. This rule offers clear benefits \nto every American, and it is especially important to Vermonters, who \ndisproportionally suffer from the devastating effects of mercury and \nother toxic air pollutants. Although my home State has no major sources \nof mercury, Vermonters have been besieged by this insidious poison, \nwhich drifts across our borders from other States.\n  The EPA estimates that each year, toxic air pollutants cause up to \n11,000 premature deaths, 4,700 heart attacks, and 130,000 cases of \nchildhood asthma, among other illnesses. Mercury, a truly unwelcome \naddition to our daily lives, has had catastrophic effects on the health \nand well-being of all Americans, as well as a ruinous impact on our \nNation's pristine natural environment. There is no known safe level of \nexposure to mercury it is harmful to humans in even the smallest \namounts. Tragically, mercury's most devastating effect is on those \nvictims least able to protect themselves: unborn and newborn children. \nMercury has been shown to cause developmental disabilities and brain \ndamage, resulting in lowered IQ's and learning problems, such as \nattention deficit disorder. Sadly, these affects are permanent and \nirreversible. They lead to a lifetime of trips to the emergency room, \ncostly medical interventions, personal and family heartbreak, and lost \npotential.\n  The American people want their air and water to be cleaner and \nhealthier and most certainly free of toxic pollutants. Vermonters and \nAmericans want this for all of us. Safe water and safe air to breathe \nshould be a valued legacy of our lives in this blessed Nation. We also \nknow that protecting the weakest and most vulnerable members of our \nsociety is among Congress's most solemn duties. This resolution of \ndisapproval undermines that goal. Why should one more child struggle to \nbreathe and gasp for air when such suffering is preventable? Why should \none more parent die a premature death? Congress should not meddle in \nthis vitally important issue literally, for many, an issue of life or \ndeath or chronic illness. If the EPA's mercury and air toxics standards \nare repealed, the simple reality is that it will be somebody's loved \none who pays the price, and the price they pay may be irreversible.\n\n[[Page S4326]]\n\n  During the Bush administration, I offered my own Congressional Review \nAct joint resolution of disapproval, known as the Leahy-Collins \nresolution, to contest an EPA mercury rule that was far too weak and \nfailed to protect the American people. It is hard to believe that now, \nalmost 7 years later, this issue is still unresolved and we are \nfighting to save an EPA rule that is fair, just, science-based, and \nreasonable. A sound environmental policy that protects our citizens \nfrom the hazards of mercury and air toxics is long overdue.\n  In addition to the numerous health benefits that removing these \ntoxics would mean for our citizens, both young and old, the EPA's \nmercury and air toxics standards would protect America's precious \nwaterways, making them accessible to the sport fishermen of today and \nfor countless generations to come. Today, large game fish from every \nbody of water in Vermont, including our State's greatest lake, Lake \nChamplain, are so heavily contaminated with out-of-State mercury that \npeople must be warned against eating them. In fact, all 50 States have \nissued fish consumption advisories, warning citizens to limit how often \nthey eat certain types of fish because they are contaminated with \nmercury. Let me repeat that. Because of mercury contamination, every \nState of our great Nation today warns its citizens to limit how often \nthey should consume certain kinds of fish. We can change that. We \nshould change that. We must change that. Environmental standards can \nand have made tremendous differences in our lifetimes in virtually \neliminating such toxics as the fumes from the burning of leaded \ngasoline, which only recently was ubiquitous on our streets and around \nour homes. We must do the same to begin ridding poisonous mercury from \nour air and water.\n  Without these standards, powerplants will continue to spew tons of \nmercury and other toxic air pollutants into the air. Without these \nstandards, this preventable, slow-motion tragedy will continue to \nunfold despite the fact that the pollution control technology mandated \nby this rule is already widely available, affordable, and in use in \nmany coal-fired powerplants throughout the Nation. Thirty-three percent \nof older powerplants have already installed lifesaving technology which \nallows them to comply with the EPA's emission limits, and a full 60 \npercent already comply with the EPA's mercury limit. This resolution of \ndisapproval would be especially ill-advised because it would unjustly \npunish companies that have taken steps to do the right thing, while \nrewarding those that have shirked their responsibilities, endangered \ncountless lives, and imperiled the environment.\n  As another great benefit to the American people, industry-wide \nadoption of innovative pollution control technology would stimulate \ninvestment in the economy, job creation and greater productivity. The \nupdated standards will create thousands of long-term jobs for American \nworkers. These workers will be hired to build, install, and, \nultimately, operate the machinery that will reduce health-threatening \nemissions. The EPA estimates that implementing this rule will mean jobs \nfor tens of thousands of hard-working Americans, including 46,000 \nconstruction jobs and 8,000 long-term utility jobs. When added onto the \nhealth benefits, these standards will have an annual estimated benefit \nof $37 to $90 billion dollars. Green jobs are not just good for the \nenvironment in which we live, work, and breathe, they are good for the \neconomy and good for America.\n  I hope that when Senators consider this resolution of disapproval, \nthey remember that its passage would prevent the EPA from issuing any \nstandards in the future that were substantially similar to the current \nmercury and air toxics standards. As a result, Americans would continue \nto be put at risk from the debilitating and sometimes deadly effects of \nair pollution pumped into America's air by energy companies and other \nsources. Regrettably, this threat to human health and the environment \nwould continue indefinitely because the resolution of disapproval would \nstrip the EPA of essential tools to address these hazards.\n  The value of these tools is as incalculable as the value of human \nlife and the health of our families. Make no mistake about it: \nInvesting in the new technology mandated by the EPA's mercury and air \ntoxics standards will save countless lives and will improve the quality \nof the environment of our communities for years to come. We owe it to \nourselves and we owe it to future generations of Americans to make this \ninvestment now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, our country's economy and competitiveness \nin global markets depends on access to affordable energy resources, \nincluding electricity that powers our manufacturing plants and keeps \nbusinesses operating throughout the Nation. Additionally, affordable \nelectricity is vital to the health, safety, productivity, and quality \nof life of American families, as well as keeping their budgets in \ncheck.\n  Generating this vital power, however, has come at a cost to our \npublic health and to the environment. Coal- and oil-fired powerplants \naccount for about half of the Nation's mercury emissions and more than \nhalf of the country's acid gases. Powerplants also contribute about \none-quarter of our Nation's particle pollution. These emissions from \npowerplants can cause damage to brain development, premature death, \nasthma, heart attacks, and other health complications with the heart \nand lungs.\n  Under the authority of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, on \nDecember 21, 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, announced \nits final rule to establish technology-based emission limits for \nmercury and other hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired \npowerplants, which are estimated to number about 1,400 units \nnationwide. About half of the electric generating units affected by \nthis rule have already installed equipment to meet these emission \nlimits, and many have expended large sums to get there. The other units \nthat need to install pollution control equipment within the next 3 to 4 \nyears could potentially have a competitive market advantage over the \ncompanies that have installed the technology if we simply override the \nEPA.\n  The emission reductions expected as a result of the rule are \nprojected to improve our Nation's air quality, resulting in a reduction \nannually of approximately 11,000 premature deaths, 4,700 nonfatal heart \nattacks, 130,000 asthma attacks, 5,700 hospital and emergency room \nvisits, 2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis, and 3.2 million restricted \nactivity days. The EPA estimates the value of these health benefits is \nbetween $37 billion and $90 billion annually.\n  Additionally, the rule will also prevent mercury from contaminating \nvital water resources. All of the Great Lakes and all of Michigan's \ninland lakes have fish consumption health advisories due to mercury. \nThis rule should help clean up these lakes and make fish from any lake \nsafer to eat.\n  In contrast to the benefits that will be provided by this rule, the \nannual cost of installing and operating the pollution control equipment \nis estimated at about $10 billion annually. These costs are expected to \ntranslate into higher electricity costs of about $3 to $4 per month, \nalthough those costs would vary regionally.\n  Senator Inhofe's joint resolution of disapproval would completely \noverturn this EPA rule that limits harmful pollutants from powerplants. \nAdditionally, under the Congressional Review Act, which is the statute \nthat provides the authority for Senator Inhofe to move this measure \nunder expedited procedures, this disapproval resolution would also \nprevent the EPA from issuing any regulations that are ``substantially \nthe same'' as the disapproved standards. Thus, this prohibition would \neffectively require Congress to pass a law creating a new authorization \nbefore EPA would be able to do anything about this pollution.\n  I support congressional oversight and, in fact, believe Congress \nshould exercise more oversight. But this rule protects the health of \nMichigan residents by requiring commercially available technology to be \ninstalled at powerplants that currently do not have these controls in \nplace. The rule will result in significant air quality improvements, \nprotecting public health and our lakes from harmful pollution. Its \npayback is significant in health and in economics.\n  For these reasons, I will oppose this measure.\n\n[[Page S4327]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I talked about this phenomenon yesterday \non the Senate floor, and today we have even more evidence of what I was \ntalking about: a reckless assault on our environment given new life by \nthe resolution before the Senate today. We are being asked to sacrifice \nthe health of men, women, and children, all for the sake of the coal \nindustry, a move that makes people sicker, denying Americans their \nright to a healthy environment to live in and raise their children.\n  No one who cares about the health of our citizens, the health of our \neconomy, and the health of our planet should support this resolution. \nThey should be outraged that we are even having this kind of debate. \nThe Congressional Review Act resolution before us would eliminate the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's mercury and air toxics standards, or \nMATS, for powerplants. Let's be clear what that means. It means the EPA \nwould be prevented from adopting meaningful replacement standards to \nprotect Americans from mercury and some 80 other toxic air pollutants \nthat cause cancer and other health hazards. Let me repeat. These \npollutants are known to cause cancer and other health hazards.\n  The science is unequivocal and has been for years mercury is a known \nneurotoxin that can have a devastating effect on the brain and nervous \nsystem of a developing child, reducing IQ and impairing the ability to \nlearn.\n  We know the effects of mercury, and we know its source. Coal and oil-\nbased powerplants constitute the largest manmade source of mercury \nemissions in the United States--they are responsible for half of the \nmercury emissions in America. They also emit more than 75 percent of \nthe acid gas emissions and 25 percent of toxic metals lead, arsenic, \nchromium, nickel. We are talking about some really toxic pollution that \nis known or suspected to cause cancer and cardiovascular disease, \ndamage to the eyes, skin, and lungs. It can even kill.\n  Under EPA's MATS, utilities will be regulated for mercury and these \nother toxics for the first time in our Nation's history. These \nstandards are more than a decade overdue, so it is way past time to end \nthe free ride the polluters have been enjoying. Now, I understand my \ncolleagues are peddling the message that the EPA is waging a ``war on \ncoal.'' But they are just trying to distract us from the facts, and the \nfact is the EPA is simply doing its job and following the law. It is no \nmore complicated than that. There is no conspiracy and no secret \nagenda. Their job is to protect Americans, and that is exactly what \nthey are doing.\n  The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate emissions of mercury \nand other hazardous air pollutants. The EPA employs a process that \nrequires the use of ``maximum achievable control technology.'' In other \nwords, the standards are feasible, they are based on what industry \nleaders are already doing. EPA estimates more than half of coal-fired \nunits have equipment installed that can help meet the standards. \nRoughly 55 percent of our electricity is from nuclear, natural gas, and \nrenewable energy sources, and they are not subject to the rule's \nprovisions. And for those that need more time to comply, EPA allows \nthem up to 4 years. It is beyond reasonable.\n  And this is hardly a ``war on coal.''\n  MATS will reduce mercury emissions from powerplants by more than 90 \npercent, acid gases by 88 percent, and reduce emissions of more than 80 \nair toxics. It will also significantly reduce particulate matter, or \nPM, emissions that can trigger asthma attacks and damage the lungs. In \nfact, the combined health benefits are staggering. Beginning in 2016, \nEPA estimates that the standard would prevent each year 11,000 \npremature deaths, 4,700 heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks, 5,700 \nhospital and ER visits, and 540,000 missed work and school days.\n  Let me bring these numbers a little closer to home. EPA estimates \nMATS would prevent 130 premature deaths each year and up to $1.1 \nbillion in health benefits in 2016.\n  In total, annual estimated benefits are $37 to $90 billion compared \nto compliance costs of $9.6 billion. That is an amazing return on \ninvestment--for every dollar spent, we will realize $3 to $6 in health \nbenefits.\n  As a member of the Senate, it is my responsibility to make sure that \nthe children of Massachusetts begin life with a fair shot, and it is my \nduty to protect the most susceptible, including the 128,000 kids and \n531,000 adults with asthma in my home State. To put this issue in \nfocus, one of my constituents, the mother of an asthmatic girl, has \nsaid: ``Any person who would say that EPA should be eliminated or its \nability to regulate reduced should have to sit in the emergency room \nholding the hand of a child who can't breathe.''\n  Some Senators argue that the EPA standard is a job killer. Not true. \nThe fact is it will create 46,000 short-term construction jobs and \n8,000 long-term jobs in the utility sector to help build, install, and \nthen operate emissions control equipment.\n  Some Senators say the rule requires too much, too fast. Not true. \nLook, the rule has been more than a decade in the making. Any shrewd \nbusinessperson would see the writing on the wall and develop their \nbusiness plan accordingly. And many utility companies already have \nacted accordingly.\n  Some Senators say it costs too much to comply and will shut down \npowerplants, that these rules combined with others will threaten the \nreliability of the energy grid and dramatically increasing energy costs \nfor consumers. Not true. Numerous reports from EPA, DOE, and CRS state \notherwise. According to CRS, ``almost all of the capacity reductions \n(from the rule) will occur in areas that have substantial reserve \nmargins. . . The final rule includes provisions aimed at providing \nadditional time for compliance if it is needed to install pollution \ncontrols or add new capacity to ensure reliability in specific areas. \nAs a result, it is unlikely that electric reliability will be harmed by \nthe rule.''\n  And in terms of the rule's actual impact on the economy, it is likely \nto be extremely limited. The retail price of electricity is on average \nestimated to increase about 3 percent, mainly due to the increase in \ndemand for natural gas. This seems a small price to pay for the massive \nhealth and economic benefits I have already highlighted.\n  We should understand that if we pass this CRA today, we are not \nguaranteed a do-over. The CRA explicitly prevents EPA from developing a \nrule to regulate mercury and air toxics from powerplants that is \n``substantially the same'' as the invalidated rule. Translation: It \nwould be nearly impossible for EPA to develop another rule to regulate \nthese pollutants. Industry would have you believe otherwise so that you \ncan vote to pass the CRA with a clear conscience. It is a disingenuous \neffort, and I sincerely hope that my colleagues will see through it.\n  Mr. President, it is tragic that polluters want to deny a right as \nbasic as clean, healthy air. And it is tragic that anyone, especially a \nmember of the Senate, would refuse to protect even children and the \nunborn from poisons. I urge the Senate to turn back this political \nassault on our environment and support standards that will do so much \ngood for so many Americans. Anything else would be turning our backs on \nthe people we are here to serve.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nSenator Inhofe's resolution of disapproval concerning the Environmental \nProtection Agency's mercury and air toxics rule. If passed, this \nresolution would have a devastating impact on our decades-long effort \nto clean up the air Americans breathe, and it would betray the \nresponsible utility managers who have already taken steps to reduce the \nmercury and air toxics entering our atmosphere.\n  As I approach the end of my Senate career, I have spent some time \nreflecting on my past votes and the legacy I hope to leave behind. The \ndebate before us today brings me back to my very first years in the \nSenate and an effort that has continued throughout my entire time here.\n  In 1990, I was part of the group of members of the Senate EPW \nCommittee and the administration of President George H.W. Bush who \nnegotiated and passed the Clean Air Act Amendments. At the time, the \nneed for this legislation was painfully clear--acid rain was eating \npaint off of cars, and thick, visible smog blanketed too many of our \ncities. Some wanted Congress to turn a blind eye, but we did not. We \nacted, and we acted together.\n  During those many weeks, we met daily to reach a bipartisan agreement\n\n[[Page S4328]]\n\nthat would put our country on the path to cleaner air. It was the \nleadership of majority leader George Mitchell and President Bush's \nrepresentatives, including Boyden Gray, that led us to a grand bargain. \nBecause all of the parties negotiated in good faith toward a common \ngoal, the Clean Air Act Amendments were adopted in an October 1990 vote \nby an 89-to-10 margin. Think about that: 89 votes in favor of one of \nthe most significant environmental law changes in our history. I regret \nthat such a broad bipartisan agreement in support of our environment \nwill not be repeated this week.\n  Now, in the final year of my Senate career, we are debating a \nresolution that seeks to undo one of the provisions that we worked so \nhard to pass as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments in my first term \nin office--a requirement that EPA issue standards to reduce emissions \nof air toxics from stationary sources. That was 22 years ago, but it \nwas only February of this year that EPA finally published the rule that \nwould implement these standards. Administrator Lisa Jackson and \nAssistant Administrator Gina McCarthy, who served so ably as \nConnecticut's commissioner of the Department of Environmental \nProtection, have brought us a rule that will finally put in place the \nmercury and air toxics restrictions we have been waiting for.\n  This resolution would roll back that rule, the first-ever national \nlimits on powerplant emissions of air toxics, including mercury. \nWithout this rule, powerplant operators can continue pumping dozens of \ntons of mercury and hundreds of thousands of tons of other toxic air \npollutants into our air each year.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken to the extensive health and \nenvironmental rationale behind the mercury and air toxics rule, so I \nwill just highlight a few of the most startling statistics. One in \ntwelve American women of childbearing age has mercury blood levels that \nwould put their fetuses at risk for impaired development. These \ndevelopmental impairments are a human tragedy, denying children their \nfull intellectual and psychological potential.\n  With respect to the environment, just look at Connecticut. We are \nblessed by natural beauty--rolling hills, beautiful beaches, vast \nforests, and flowing streams and rivers. Unfortunately, every single \nbody of water--every lake, stream, river, and pond--in the State of \nConnecticut has a mercury advisory in place. Where do we think this \ncame from? It was not here before the advent of polluting powerplants \nspewing mercury into the air. We are blessed by plentiful fresh water, \nbut that gift has been tainted by the mercury that has been spewed into \nthe air over generations. Even in Long Island Sound, one of America's \ngreatest estuaries, we are faced with a restriction on which seafood we \ncan eat. One of the best fish in the sound--the bluefish--is off limits \nto us because of mercury. Is this the legacy we want to leave our \nchildren?\n  Of course, this debate should not be about which fish we can or \ncannot eat, it should be about following through on a promise we made \nto the American people in 1990, by a margin of 89 to 10, that we would \nmove forward on efforts to reduce air toxics being emitted by \npowerplants. If we pass this resolution, we would break that promise.\n  Some of my colleagues may claim that the mercury rule is an attack on \ncoal. To them I would say: This is nothing of the sort. This rule would \nactually save money and save lives. It would save between $37 billion \nand $90 billion a year in health benefits while creating 54,000 jobs. \nIt would prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths and 130,000 cases of \nchildhood asthma attacks each year. This is a case of government \nprotecting its citizens with a commonsense rule to require widely \navailable pollution control systems be installed at our powerplants.\n  I want to close by once again urging my colleagues not to break our \npromise we made to the American people in 1990 that the U.S. Government \nwould do everything in its power to ensure the American people had \nclean air to breathe and to reduce dangerous pollutants in order to \ngive our children the chance to grow up healthy. I urge my colleagues \nto vote no on this resolution.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to ask the Senate to protect \npublic health, not polluters, and to protect clean air over corporate \nprofits.\n  Upholding the mercury and air toxics standard means keeping toxic \nmercury, arsenic, lead, and other pollutants out of our lakes and \nstreams and out of children's lungs. It will prevent 11,000 premature \ndeaths, 5,000 heart attacks, and 130,000 asthma attacks in this country \neach year after its implementation.\n  For over 20 years polluters have fought these rules and used their \ninfluence to create delay after delay in administration after \nadministration. It is time these rules were finally implemented so we \ncan preserve the health of the American people and our Nation's air \nquality.\n  New Jersey has many residents who are vulnerable to poor air quality. \nAccording to the American Lung Association, there are over 184,000 \nchildren and 587,000 adults with asthma in New Jersey. It is estimated \nthat these new air toxics standards will prevent up to 320 premature \ndeaths and create up to $2.6 billion in health benefits in New Jersey \nin 2016 alone. These residents deserve better than to have their health \nsubordinated to the financial interests of corporate executives.\n  Reducing toxic emissions is welcomed by New Jersey's power providers. \nThe Public Service Enterprise Group, PSEG, New Jersey's oldest and \nlargest electric utility, operates several of the powerplants that \nwould be affected by the mercury and air toxic standards. Because these \nregulations have been in the works for over 20 years, PSEG and other \npower providers have already made investments in anticipation of their \nimplementation. To assert that these standards are somehow a surprise \nor could not have been anticipated by electric utilities would be \ngrossly inaccurate.\n  Mercury is perhaps the most dangerous pollutant targeted by this rule \nand coal-fired powerplants are responsible for half of the mercury \nemissions in the United States.\n  Mercury, a dangerous neurotoxin, has been associated with damage to \nthe kidneys, liver, brain, and nervous system. It has also been shown \nto cause neurological and developmental problems in children. The \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, in detailing the impact of mercury \nexposure on human health, noted,\n\n     mercury in all of its forms is toxic to the fetus and \n     children, and efforts should be made to reduce exposure to \n     the extent possible to pregnant women and children, as well \n     as the general population.\n\n  Elevated levels of mercury exposure have also been shown to put \nadults at increased risk of heart attacks, increased blood pressure, \nand blocked arteries. Rather than cater to polluters, we must heed the \nwarnings of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists--medical \nprofessionals that have dedicated their lives to preventing and \ntreating illness caused by mercury.\n  Mercury emissions also act as a pervasive contaminant throughout our \nNation's watersheds, where the pollutant accumulates in fish, other \nwildlife, and ultimately, in humans. In 2003, Jeff Holmstead, the EPA \nAssistant Administrator for Air and Radiation under George W. Bush, \nstated:\n\n       Mercury, a potent toxin, can cause permanent damage to the \n     brain and nervous system, particularly in developing fetuses \n     when ingested in sufficient quantities. People are exposed to \n     mercury mainly through eating fish contaminated with \n     methylmercury.\n\n  In New Jersey, mercury has been a widespread and consistent \ncontaminant in freshwater fish collected throughout the State, with \nunsafe concentrations of mercury being found in both urban and rural \nareas. The statistics send a clear message: if we don't act now, we \nrisk mass contamination of our Nation's waters and food supply.\n  The mercury and air toxics standard will work to curb toxic emissions \nproduced from coal powerplants, and to ensure that future emissions \ncomply with set national limits. These new standards are expected to \nreduce mercury emissions from coal and powerplants by 90 percent, acid \ngas pollution by 88 percent, and particulate matter emissions by 30 \npercent.\n  Senator Inhofe's proposal, if enacted, would not only void all of the \nhealth benefits produced by the air toxics standard, but also prevent \nthe government from issuing similar standards in the future. In effect, \nthis would\n\n[[Page S4329]]\n\nseverely curtail the government's ability to address the serious \nhazards posed by pollutant emissions. I believe this would be deeply \nirresponsible.\n  These national standards are long overdue. In 1990, Congress amended \nthe Clean Air Act to require performance-based regulations of air \npollutants, in an effort to reduce toxic emissions produced from \nindustrial sources. That amendment was passed with broad bipartisan \nsupport, approved by 89 Senators, 401 House members, and signed by a \nRepublican president. After two decades, national standards regulating \npowerplant emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants are finally \nin place. How many more children will be poisoned by mercury in their \nbodies, if Congress continues to delay or eliminate safeguards ensuring \nhealth safety?\n  In 1990, Congress recognized the harm posed by these pollutants and \ntook appropriate action. Now it is time for us to finally implement \nthem and protect the health of all Americans.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today as a signer of the discharge \npetition for S.J. Res. 37, the Congressional Review Act resolution of \ndisapproval for the Environmental Protection Agency's Utility MACT \nrule. I support this measure with all my heart.\n  I urge my colleagues and my fellow citizens who are listening to this \ndebate today to recognize that the EPA's Utility MACT rule is not just \nabout curtailing mercury emissions from powerplants. At the heart of \nthe Utility MACT rule is an effort to shut down our Nation's coal-mines \nand coal-fired powerplants. When President Obama was a United States \nSenator, he was the deciding vote on the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to kill the Clear Skies bill which would have reduced \nmercury emissions in the United States by 70 percent.\n  Let's be clear about why the liberals on that committee voted against \nthis mercury reduction measure. They did so because they wanted to hold \nthat issue aside and use it to help pass a nationwide climate bill, the \nbiggest anticoal legislation ever considered by Congress. In other \nwords, killing coal mining jobs and shutting down coal-fired \npowerplants took priority over real and significant reductions in \nmercury emissions and any health benefits that would have come with \nthose reductions.\n  The EPA's Utility MACT rule was carefully written to ensure that most \nof its mercury reductions will come from the forced shutdown of coal \nmines and coal-fired powerplants. It is evident that the rule is not \nwritten to allow noncompliant powerplants to remain open.\n  The fact is that today's vote does not stop the EPA from regulating \nmercury from coal-fired powerplants. But it would strip out the obvious \nanticoal agenda that is the heart and soul of the current Utility MACT \nrule. The costs of this rule outweigh the benefits by 1,600 to 1. If \never there were an EPA rule that needed to be sent back to the drawing \nboard, this one is it.\n  Americans know what is at stake with today's resolution. If the EPA's \nrule is allowed to go forward, it jeopardizes our Nation's most \naffordable, abundant, and dependable domestic source of electricity. We \nhear a lot from the President and his allies about the scourge of \ninequality and the need for a more progressive economic system.\n  It is hard to take them seriously when you look at their support for \nthis EPA regulation. Regulations such as these are incredibly \nregressive. This regulation will increase the cost of energy. That \nmight not mean a great deal to the folks who are financing President \nObama's reelection, but to low-and middle-income citizens, increased \nenergy costs hit family budgets hard.\n  And it will undermine jobs. Anyone who claims to care about job \ncreation, while at the same time supporting this regulation, has to \nanswer a few questions. Americans are tired of lipservice when it comes \nto job creation. They are tired of having a job creation agenda taking \na back seat to the agenda of lifestyle liberals.\n  They want Congress and the President to be serious about creating \njobs and keeping our Nation competitive in a global economy. This \nregulation not only threatens jobs at coal mines and powerplants.\n  Much more is at stake. We are talking about a threat to the millions \nof jobs that are created when we as a nation enjoy the abundant \naffordable energy that allows us, America, to compete against our \naggressive international rivals.\n  Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of this issue about the \nsuccess of my own State of Utah. For 2 years running, Forbes magazine \nhas listed Utah as the best State for business and jobs. Utah is a \ngrand success story, and national policymakers should look to it for \nanswers. Why is Utah creating jobs, while many areas of the United \nStates are losing them? Well, there are a number of factors, but a very \nbig one is that we are a very competitive State. After comparing the \ncost of doing business in other States, more and more companies are \nmoving to Utah. A key factor in that decision is Utah's very low cost \nof energy. The State ranks fourth in the Nation for low cost industrial \nenergy rates. I am aware of a number of instances where this has been a \ndeciding factor when a major business decides to relocate to Utah. In \nalmost every case, the States these companies are moving away from have \nhigh industrial energy rates. And, yes, about 70 percent of Utah's \npower comes from clean, efficient, coal-fired powerplants.\n  It is obvious that many of my colleagues on the other side of this \nissue just cannot grasp this truth; but the fact of the matter is that \ncompetiveness is critical to economic growth and job creation. It \nshould come as no surprise that President Obama's hundreds of anti-\nenergy efforts have failed to grow jobs in this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to look to my State of Utah as a model for \nsuccess. We need to get off the road toward the nanny State. How bad \ndoes the European model have to get before we wake up and recognize \nthat we want nothing to do with that type of big government failure. \nAmerica is great because we have relied on the fundamentals of a free \npeople living in a free market. And underlying our vibrant and free \neconomy is consistently affordable energy. Affordable energy is the \nlifeblood of a healthy economy and always has been. I urge my \ncolleagues to protect these fundamentals and send this Utility MACT \nrule back to the EPA for a major rewrite.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to oppose S.J. Res. 37, a resolution of disapproval of the \nMercury and Air Toxics Standards, offered by Senator Inhofe. The \nSenator from Oklahoma is a powerful advocate for his point of view, but \nI respectfully disagree that we do not need to control the emission of \nmercury and other toxics into our air.\n  This vote is one in a continuous drumbeat of attacks on environmental \nrules we have seen of late. It is unfortunate that some of my \ncolleagues are attacking clean air and water rules with such fervor, \nespecially in the name of economic recovery. When it comes to putting \nAmerica back on firm economic footing, we should be working towards a \ncomprehensive budget solution that shows the American people and the \nworld that Congress can still function in the face of major challenges \nrather than with attacks on the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Yet so often we hear vague, catch-all criticisms that upcoming EPA \nrules--real or imagined--will create uncertainty in the regulated \ncommunity, impeding economic recovery. The irony is that attacks that \nseek to delay or remand EPA rules only exacerbate and prolong \nregulatory uncertainty.\n  Also, recall that Congress directed EPA in the Clean Air Act more \nthan 20 years ago to develop many of the rules the agency is currently \nworking on. That is the case with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. \nMany other rules are coming about as a result of court orders. So, put \nsimply, EPA is doing its job.\n  To be sure, Congress also has a job to do when it comes to oversight \nof administration rules. For instance, I have been and will continue to \nwork with EPA to make sure EPA actions respect the realities of life in \nrural and arid communities. This is especially important when it comes \nto regulations impacting Colorado water users and our farmers and \nranchers.\n  However, wholesale assault on an agency whose mission is to protect\n\n[[Page S4330]]\n\nhuman health and the environment is neither a recipe for economic \nrecovery nor a path to fostering healthier communities within which our \nfamilies and neighbors live.\n  Let me turn specifically to the resolution of disapproval offered by \nSenator Inhofe.\n  Many of my colleagues have described on the Senate floor the various \nhealth benefits of the rule. I would like to associate myself with \ntheir remarks, because the health benefits of controlling mercury \nemissions are remarkable: as many as 11,000 fewer premature deaths each \nyear; 130,000 fewer cases of childhood asthma each year; and 4,700 \nfewer heart attacks each year just to name a few.\n  But I want to add two other aspects to the debate. One, clean air and \nwater are good for our economy.\n  In Colorado, for example, outdoor recreation and tourism make up the \nsecond largest sector of our economy. Coloradans enjoy skiing, hiking, \nhunting, angling, camping, boating and many other outdoor activities, \nand many Americans come to Colorado for these experiences. Our outdoor \nrecreation economy contributes $10 billion a year to the State's \neconomy and supports over 100,000 Colorado jobs.\n  This isn't limited to Colorado. Nationally, the outdoor recreation \neconomy is worth $646 billion, supporting 6.1 million jobs.\n  Clean air and water are an integral part of the national outdoor \nrecreation system. It can not function if our children are too sick to \ncome outside to play or our waters are too polluted to fish.\n  Two, investing in our infrastructure through modern pollution \ncontrols is how we ensure long-term economic recovery.\n  ADA-Environmental Solutions is a company in Highlands Ranch, CO. ADA-\nEnvironmental Solutions is the leading producer of mercury control \nequipment for utilities across the country. Part of their mission is to \n``sustain the viability of coal'' through the development of \ntechnologies that ``reduce emissions, increase efficiency and improve \nthe competitive position'' of their customers.\n  As the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards go into effect, many \nutilities will upgrade their facilities with modern pollution controls. \nIt may surprise some of my constituents in Colorado to learn that some \nof these plants have been operating without pollution controls for 40 \nyears or more.\n  Those upgrades will be installed by Americans and provided by \ncompanies like ADA-Environmental Solutions. Those upgrades represent an \ninvestment in American jobs and a modern utility infrastructure.\n  In summary, clean air and water do not come at the expense of our \neconomy. Rather, a healthy environment and a healthy economy go hand-\nin-hand.\n  Putting safeguards in place on the largest source of mercury \nemissions in the United States is long overdue. That is why I will be \nopposing S.J. Res. 37 today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in 1970, smoke stacks towered above \ncities and towns spewing black clouds of toxic pollution into the air.\n  Sights like these outraged Americans--however, at that time there was \nno legal way to force these companies to stop polluting the \nenvironment.\n  In response to these atrocities, Congress did two things in 1970:\n  First, Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency to defend \nour natural resources and force polluters to clean up their factories \nand plants.\n  And second, Congress passed the Clean Air Act with overwhelming \nbipartisan support to help ensure that all Americans could breathe \nclean air, free from toxic chemicals.\n  In the 40 years since, Republicans and Democrats have worked together \nin Congress to protect the health of America's families from the \ncountry's biggest polluters.\n  But this week in the Senate, we will vote on a provision that \nthreatens to destroy all that progress by rolling back a critical \nenvironmental and health regulation.\n  Senator Inhofe has introduced a resolution that would prevent the EPA \nfrom enforcing the first national standard to regulate the emission of \nmercury and air toxins from power plants.\n  Until now, there had been no Federal standards that required power \nplants to limit their emission of mercury, arsenic, chromium, and acid \ngases. And so their pollution went unchecked.\n  This led to power plants becoming the single largest source of \nmercury in the United States. Power plants are currently responsible \nfor 50% of the mercury, 62% of the arsenic, and over 75% of the acid \ngases emitted in this country every year.\n  These are deadly chemicals. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can \nhinder brain development and the central nervous systems of children, \neven while in their mother's womb.\n  And the heavy metals and acids emitted by power plants can cause \nvarious cancers and respiratory, neurological, developmental, and \nreproductive problems.\n  So the idea that we should allow power plants to continue to pump \nhundreds of thousands of tons of dangerous pollution into the \nenvironment instead of adding any of the readily available pollution \ncontrols is completely outrageous.\n  The harmful, toxic chemical emissions from these plants must be \nstopped and that is what the EPA's new Mercury and Air Toxics \nStandards, or MATS as they are called, does.\n  When implemented, the new standards will reduce mercury and acid gas \nemissions from power plants by almost 90%.\n  These reductions will save billions of dollars in public health \nspending each year by avoiding thousands of cases of premature deaths, \naggravated asthma, and heart attacks.\n  In fact, every dollar spent to reduce pollution emission under the \nMATS rule will result in $3 $9 of health benefits.\n  In my state of Illinois alone, the MATS rule will save $4.7 billion \nand prevent an estimated 570 premature adult deaths in the next four \nyears.\n  That might be why recent polling shows that 77% of Americans support \nthe MATS rule and the reductions in air pollution that it will achieve.\n  However, Senator Inhofe wants to prevent these critical standards \nfrom being enforced--claiming that they are too strict and that \ncompanies have not had enough time to prepare.\n  But, Mr. President, this new rule didn't come out of nowhere.\n  Energy companies have known for more than 20 years, since the last \nmajor changes to the Clean Air Act in 1990, that new air pollution-\ncontrol rules were coming and that the new rules would require them to \nreduce their toxic emissions.\n  That is why many power plants have already made the changes necessary \nto comply with the new rules by installing scrubbers and other air \npollution-control technologies.\n  However, instead of investing in these available control \ntechnologies, some companies did little or nothing over the past \ndecades to improve their old, inefficient plants.\n  And now these same companies state that it would be impossible for \nthem to comply with the MAT standards without massive job losses and \nblackouts across the electricity grid. The facts suggest otherwise.\n  According to the Environmental Policy Institute, the EPA's new \nstandards are expected to create approximately 8,000 jobs in the \nutility industry and an additional 80,500 jobs from investments in \npollution control equipment by 2015. And the majority of these jobs \nwill be in the construction and labor industries.\n  Mike Morris is chief executive of American Electric Power, a utility \nwith multiple coal-fired plants. He said, ``We have to hire plumbers, \nelectricians, [and] painters when you retrofit a plant. Jobs are \ncreated in the process--no question about that.''\n  In fact, the MATS rule is expected to add a net 117,000 jobs to the \neconomy overall. So to say that we can't create jobs without allowing \ndangerous levels of toxic chemicals into the air we breathe is simply \nwrong. And multiple Federal agencies and third parties--including the \nnon-partisan Congressional Research Service, the Department of Energy, \nand the Bipartisan Policy Center--have stated that full implementation \nof the MAT Standards will not cause any reliability concerns for the \npower grid.\n  EPA is working closely with the Department of Energy, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, State\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\nutility regulators, and the North American Electric Reliability \nCorporation, to ensure there will be no issues with the electrical \ngrid.\n  So it seems that we can have clean air and keep the lights on, while \nsimultaneously creating thousands of new jobs.\n  We don't have to make the false choice between ensuring clean air and \njob creation--we can do both.\n  The bottom line is that acid gases and heavy metals are causing \nserious health problems, especially in our most vulnerable \npopulations--children and pregnant mothers.\n  The EPA Mercury and Air Toxics Standards will require power plants to \ncut their emissions of these harmful chemicals by using readily \navailable technology.\n  Many plants across the country have already proved that the standards \ncan be met while creating jobs and keeping the lights on and businesses \nrunning.\n  So it's time for Republicans and Democrats to once again come \ntogether to protect the health of Americans families and ensure that \neveryone has access to clean air.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on the motion to proceed \nto Senator Inhofe's resolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans have 3 minutes 47 \nseconds, and the majority has 12 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would take 6 minutes and retain the balance.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we are faced with a resolution today to \nessentially repeal something that has been 20 years in the making and \nis about to go into effect. It would stop the EPA, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, from implementing the first-ever national mercury \nand air toxics standards for powerplants.\n  A little bit later I will talk about what mercury does to people. Let \nme assure you, it is not good. I will also talk about the other toxics \nthat are emitted from these dirty plants. They are not good either. \nWhen I mention them, just the names will scare us because they are \nnames such as arsenic and formaldehyde--not good. They are going into \nour lungs. The mercury is getting into fish. People are getting sick. \nThat is why this is such a dangerous moment if we were to pass this and \nstop the EPA from doing this.\n\n  We know that for every $3 we invest--every $1 to $3--we are going to \nget back $9 in health benefits. If we do the math and we follow the \nmath, it is clear this is cost-effective and critically important.\n  Ask a parent who has a child who is rushed to the emergency room with \nasthma whether they want this done. Ask a coal-fired utility that has \nmade these improvements already--half of them have--and they will tell \nus there has been hardly any impact on electricity prices, and they are \nhappy with them.\n  If this resolution were to pass and the policy behind it were to \npass, it means that instead of rewarding those coal-fired utilities \nthat are doing the right thing, we are rewarding those that haven't \ndone the right thing and continue to spew forth these toxins.\n  What is at stake? I ask rhetorically of people who may be listening \nto this: Whom do we trust more, Senators and politicians or physicians \nand nurses? I think we should trust these numbers from the \nprofessionals who have looked at this issue. If this resolution were to \npass and EPA is blocked from implementing this new clean air standard, \nwe will see up to 11,000 additional premature deaths, 4,700 heart \nattacks, 130,000 cases of childhood asthma, 6,300 cases of acute \nbronchitis among children, 5,700 emergency room visits, and 540,000 \ndays of missed work. Again, the rule provides $3 to $9 in benefits for \nevery $1 that is invested.\n  We are going to hear other arguments from the opponents of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, but the people of America are smart. \nThey were asked just 2 months ago if they want us to interfere with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency as they clean up the air, clean up the \nmercury, clean up the toxic soot, and 78 percent said: Stay out of it, \npoliticians, and let the Environmental Protection Agency do its job.\n  We should thank the coal companies that have already cleaned up their \nact and not reward those that have delayed cleaning up their act.\n  Again, we will hear all kinds of horror stories. Ask the utilities \nthat have made these improvements. We have a list of them somewhere.\n  We will also hear there will be lost jobs from this rule. We know \nthere will be 46,000 short-term construction jobs as these plants \nbecome clean and 8,000 long-term jobs.\n  Now look at the utilities that oppose the Inhofe CRA. They include \nAustin Energy, Avista Corporation, Calpine Corporation, Constellation \nEnergy, Exelon, National Grid, NextEra Energy, NYPA, Public Service \nEnterprise Group, and Seattle City Light. Some of these have coal-fired \npowerplants. They say: What are we doing? Let's keep moving toward \nclean energy.\n  I asked if we trust politicians or do we trust those who, I believe, \nare unquestionably character witnesses in this debate. Let's look at \nsome of them that oppose what Senator Inhofe is trying to do today. The \nCatholic Health Association of the United States, Evangelical \nEnvironmental Network, Franciscan Action Network, General Baptist \nConvention, General Conference of American Rabbis, National Council of \nChurches, United Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries, \nUnited Methodist Church, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. They \noppose what my friends on the other side are leading us to today, a \nrepeal of clean air rules.\n  Whom do we trust, the politicians or some of these groups that \nstrongly oppose this resolution--the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nthe American Association of Respiratory Care, the American Heart \nAssociation, the Lung Association, the Nurses Association, the Public \nHealth Association, the March of Dimes, the Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, and Trust for America's Health.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 6 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes, and \nthen I will yield and retain the balance.\n  Here is the chart I wished to show on utility prices. We have heard \ndoom and gloom. Here are the facts. There was hardly any fluctuation in \nutility rates when half the coal-fired plants made these improvements.\n  Do not fall for scare tactics because we know upgrading a utility is \nsomething that has to be done. It is built into the long-term plans of \nthese utilities.\n  What poisonous emissions does this clean air rule address? I talked \nabout it before. In the balance of my time I will go through it again, \nbut I am going to just name these toxins: mercury and lead, arsenic, \nselenium, cadmium, chromium, benzene, formaldehyde, acid gases, and \ntoxic soot. All we need do is listen to what I said and we know we \ndon't want to breathe them in and we don't want to have fish that \ncontain too much mercury because it damages the nervous system in \nchildren and harms the brains of infants. We know how dangerous it is \nfor pregnant women and children to eat this type of fish.\n  Last night, we had Senator Whitehouse here from Rhode Island, and he \nwas eloquent on the point. He had a picture, which was actually a \nNorman Rockwell painting--it wasn't a real painting, it was a wonderful \nposter. He said: Here is a perfect American scene of a grandpa taking a \ngrandson fishing. He said that today, in his State, they can't eat the \nfish. Maybe they can once a month eat one fish, and in some of their \nlakes, they can't even eat any.\n  This is wrong. This is pollution blowing from other places into the \nNortheast. Let's defeat this resolution. It is bad for the people of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor and retain the balance of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The question was asked by the Senator from California: \nWhom do we trust most, elected Senators or unelected bureaucrats?\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. The question is, Is pollution getting better or worse? With \nall\n\n[[Page S4332]]\n\nthe hysteria, one would think: My goodness. Pollution is getting so \nmuch worse. All measurements of pollution show we are doing a good job \nand much better than we have ever done. Most of the emissions--the big \nemissions, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide--have been going down for \ndecades. We are doing a good job with pollution.\n  This rule is about mercury. Powerplants emit this much of the \nmercury, as shown on this chart. Do my colleagues know that over half \nthe mercury comes from natural sources? Forest fires emit more mercury \nthan powerplants do. We already have eight regulations at the Federal \nlevel on mercury. We have a plethora of regulations at the State level.\n  The question is, Is mercury getting worse or is mercury lessening? \nFor the last 5 years, the amount of mercury that is being emitted has \nbeen cut in half. If we measure mercury in the blood of women and \nchildren, it is getting less. If we say: What is a safe level of \nmercury in the blood, we are below that. If we look at populations who \neat nothing but fish, the Seychelles Islands, they have found zero \nevidence that mercury is hurting any of them. When we look at mercury \nemissions, they are going down.\n\n  So the question is, Are we going to have a balance in our country? \nDoes the other side care whether people work? We can do everything \npossible to try to eliminate this last 1 percent, but the question is, \nAt what cost? Many are estimating 50,000 people are going to lose their \njobs. Do we care if people have a job? Yes. We want to be safe, but \nthere has to be a balancing act.\n  The question we have to ask is: Is the environment cleaner or worse \noff? The environment is so much cleaner than it used to be. The rules \nin place are somewhat balanced and are keeping pollution under control. \nWhat we don't want to do is go so far over the top that we lose jobs. \nThis new rule is estimated to lose 50,000 jobs.\n  I think the American people need to have a say in this. We don't need \nto give up that power to unelected bureaucrats we can't remove from \noffice. Let's let our representatives get involved to have more of a \nbalance in the regulations.\n  I suggest we vote in favor of this resolution.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand our time has expired. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Kyl have 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, S.J. Res. 37 is very important.\n  If passed, this resolution would overturn one of the most costly and \nunnecessary regulations ever adopted by the EPA. Unless we in Congress \nact, that regulation, Utility MACT, would establish the first ever \n``maximum achievable control technology''--or MACT--standards for \n``hazardous air pollutant''--or HAP--emissions from powerplants.\n  The Clean Air Act only allows the EPA to set MACT standards for HAP \nemissions if it can establish a hazard to public health that would make \nsuch regulatory action ``appropriate and necessary.''\n  In December 2000, just as a new administration was set to take \noffice, the Clinton EPA, under great pressure from special interests, \npromulgated a Utility MACT rule based on public health concerns about \nmercury. The data simply do not support that regulation.\n  First of all, mercury does not pose health risks via inhalation, but \nrather only after entering water bodies and accumulating as \nmethylmercury in the aquatic food chain. For humans, the primary route \nof mercury exposure is through eating fish. Accordingly, the EPA itself \nhas acknowledged uncertainties about the extent of public health risks \nthat can be attributed to electric utility mercury emissions, and it \nadmits that ``there is no quantification of how much of the \nmethylmercury in fish consumed by the U.S. population is due to \nelectricity emissions.\n  We now know too that the EPA's projections for major increases in \nmercury emissions from powerplants at the time were grossly inaccurate. \nThe agency estimated that emissions would increase from 46 tons in 1990 \nto 60 tons in 2010. But, in fact, they actually declined to just 29 \ntons in 2011--more than 50 percent below the projections--and all \nwithout the MACT rule.\n  Moreover, the studies EPA relied upon about methylmercury exposure in \nchildren and women of childbearing age have also been found to have \ninflated health risks. More recent research undertaken by the CDC \nindicates that Americans are not being exposed to levels of mercury \nconsidered harmful to fetuses, children, or adults. Additionally, both \nthe FDA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have \nrecommended regulatory levels for mercury that are significantly less \nstringent than the EPA's reference dose.\n  With respect to nonmercury hazardous air pollutants--or HAPs--the EPA \ndoes not set actual limits for those emissions. Instead, it uses limits \nfor fine particulate matter emissions in the standard as a surrogate \nfor a variety of HAPs under the rule. While EPA calls the benefits \nassociated with reducing particulate matter ``co-benefits'' of \nestablishing the Utility MACT regulation, it has also stated that such \nreductions are not the primary objective or justification for the rule. \nIf that is the case, then why are more than 99 percent of the rule's \nclaimed health benefits due to projected reductions in particulate \nmatter? I am all for incidental health benefits--it is always nice to \nget more bang for the buck--but that's simply not what is going on \nhere.\n  Double-counting the benefits from reducing particulate matter as a \nUtility MACT benefit is, at best, misleading. Indeed, if 99 percent of \nthe quantified health benefits cited in the rule are not due to \nreductions in HAPs, can we really call the Utility MACT rule \n``appropriate and necessary?''\n  The EPA is trying to pull a fast one by regulating particulate \nmatter--a non-HAP--under the guise of concern about mercury. The agency \nalready regulates particulate matter emissions under the Clean Air Act, \nand it has been doing so for 15 years. If it believes there are \nbenefits to further reducing particulate matter emissions, it already \nhas the power to do so; adopting S.J. Res. 37 would not prevent such \nEPA action.\n  Once the coincidental co-benefits from reducing particulate matter--\nestimated to be $33 billion to $89 billion, or $3 to $9 in health \nbenefits for every dollar of cost--are excluded from Utility MACT, the \nEPA's own cost benefit analysis demonstrates that the health benefits \nof the rule are far outweighed by its costs. The EPA estimates that \nimplementing the Utility MACT rule would cost $9.6 billion in 2016, and \nthat reductions in mercury emissions would provide just $0.5 to 6 \nmillion in health benefits in the same year. This means that, even in \nthe best case scenario, the cost of Utility MACT will exceed its \nestimated benefits by a factor of 1,600 to 1.\n  Sixteen hundred to one.\n  The cumulative costs and consequences of this and other EPA \nregulations are both real and substantial. Final and pending EPA \nregulations will reduce the diversity of America's energy portfolio, \nincrease energy prices, eliminate jobs, and threaten electric \nreliability.\n  With regard to our energy portfolio, we are already seeing negative \neffects. Coal's share of electric power generation recently dropped to \njust 34 percent, the lowest level we have seen since the 1970s. As a \nresult, utility companies have already announced plans to shut down \nmore than 25,000 megawatts of electricity rather than upgrade plants \nwith costly new emissions control technology. These changes in our \nenergy portfolio are just the tip of the iceberg. The North American \nElectric Reliability Corporation--or NERC--estimates that EPA \nregulations will lead to an additional retirement of 36,000 to 59,000 \nmegawatts of electricity generation. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission's Office of Electric Reliability has stated that EPA \nregulations would likely shutter 81,000 megawatts.\n  These plant closure predictions from nonpartisan reliability \norganizations are 8 times higher than EPA's estimates of just 10,000 \nmegawatts. The closures caused by EPA regulations will not just affect \nour energy mix--they will also affect grid reliability.\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\nNERC has said that EPA regulations pose the No. 1 threat to grid \nreliability.\n  But these reliability organizations are not the only ones concerned \nabout the EPA's effect on coal and coal power generation. Earlier this \nmonth, Moody's changed its outlook on the coal industry to \n``negative,'' largely blaming the EPA for the downgrade. As Moody's put \nit in a statement:\n\n       A regulatory environment that puts coal at a disadvantage \n     along with low natural gas prices, have led many utilities to \n     increase or accelerate their scheduled coal plant \n     retirements.\n\n  It continued:\n\n       In addition, newly proposed carbon dioxide regulations \n     would effectively prohibit new coal plants by requiring new \n     projects to adopt technology that is not yet economically \n     feasible.\n\n  I have witnessed the EPA's attempts to reshape the energy industry \nthrough regulation in my home State.\n  Arizona relies on coal-fired power for its base-load electricity. \nCoal mining and plant operations are an important employer and economic \nengine for Arizonans and, specifically, for our Indian Tribes. As just \none example, take the Navajo Generating Station--or NGS--a 2,250-\nmegawatt facility located on the Navajo Nation's reservation.\n  The NGS was constructed as part of a negotiated settlement with \nenvironmental interests that, at the time, preferred a coal-fired \npowerplant to a hydropower dam project in the Grand Canyon. It provides \nmore than 90 percent of the pumping power for the Central Arizona \nProject, Arizona's primary water delivery system. The plant and the \ncoal mined to operate it play a vital role in the economies of the \nNavajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe, not to mention the State as a whole. \nA study prepared by Arizona State University's Seidman Institute \nconcluded that the NGS and its associated mine will account for over \n$20 billion in gross State product--GSP--almost $680 million in \nadjusted State tax revenues, and more than 3,000 jobs.\n  Yet, the station's future viability is now directly threatened by \nUtility MACT and other pending EPA regulations. Right now, the EPA is \nundertaking an NGS-specific rulemaking to determine whether additional \nemissions control technologies should be installed at the station for \npurely aesthetic visibility reasons, rather than actual health \nconcerns. That rulemaking could require the installation of emissions \ncontrols at a cost of more than $1.1 billion.\n  That is just one power station--just one--$1.1 billion. And we don't \neven know yet what the estimated cost of compliance with Utility MACT \nmight be.\n  Steve Etsitty, executive director of the Navajo Nation EPA, said this \nabout EPA's regulatory approach:\n\n       EPA's one size fits all' approach to rulemaking fails to \n     acknowledge or address the specific concerns and impacts to \n     the Navajo Nation, as well as regional impacts. Making \n     matters worse, EPA's uncoordinated approach to rulemakings \n     impacting the same industries creates regulatory uncertainty, \n     increases compliance costs, and puts at substantial risk the \n     national and regional economies, critical jobs of Navajo \n     people, and the very viability of the Navajo government.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  The consequences of a shutdown of the Navajo Generating Station would \nbe felt throughout the State, and even by the Federal Government. \nHowever, a shutdown would most acutely impact Indian tribes, whose \neconomies and access to affordable water are highly dependent on the \nNGS.\n  Thus, the consequences of the EPA's regulatory war on coal go far \nbeyond the coal industry itself. Real people in my State and across the \ncountry will pay the price.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to support the resolution before us \ntoday. I am all for clean air. I don't know a single colleague who \nwould take the opposite view. And I can assure my friends on the other \nside of the aisle that we are firmly antimercury contamination as well. \nBut that is not really the question here.\n  It is not a matter of clean air versus dirty air, or mercury \ncontamination versus no mercury contamination. These are false \nchoicest. We can have clean air and a healthy economy. We can reduce \nmercury levels and reduce unemployment. But we have to be smart about \nhow we regulate.\n  Utility MACT is simply a bad regulation. It is refuted by the very \nscience used to justify its promulgation. Moreover, its economic \neffects would be negative and far-reaching, while its estimated \nbenefits would be minimal and hardly worth the significant costs. And \nit would make domestic energy generation more difficult at a time of \nrising energy demand.\n  With growing unemployment, huge deficits, and anemic growth, this is \nalso the wrong time to be whacking our economy with one of the most \nexpensive and far-reaching regulations ever to come from the EPA.\n  We have to be smart about this, and Utility MACT is just not a smart \nregulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 37 and help overturn this \nmisguided, job-killing rule.\n  Again, I will simply say at this point that adopting this resolution \nis very important to prevent the implementation of a regulation which I \nthink has very clearly been established. It does not meet the test that \nwould be required for the promulgation of a public health regulation \nand fails any test of cost-benefit analysis.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to think about the effect on the \nindustry, on the people of America, on the economy at this time, and \nadopt the resolution offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I understand there is 1 minute \nremaining, so let me just clarify a couple things.\n  First of all, several have made comments about the Clean Air Act. I \nwas supportive of the Clean Air Act. It has done a great job, and I \nthink that should be clarified.\n  We have had three medical doctors testify as to the health \nimplications on this.\n  I would only say this: If we are truly concerned about what is \nhappening, keep in mind what the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, \nsaid. The maximum achievable control technology is not there. So if we \nvote against this amendment and they allow this rule to continue, we \nare effectively killing coal in America that has accounted for almost \n50 percent of our industry.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Am I correct that there is 4 minutes remaining on my \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 1 of those minutes to Senator Pryor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Right now, when we open the paper and when we turn on the evening \nnews, we see these ads for clean coal. We need clean coal. We are akin \nto the Saudi Arabia of coal. They say we have 400 years' worth of coal \nsupply in this country. We have the technology now to take 90 percent \nof the mercury out and a lot of the particulates and we should do it. \nThis is our chance to do it.\n  This is a rule that has been 20 years in the making. This is not \nsomething people dreamed up over the last couple years. This has been \n20 years in the making, and Congress has mandated we do this.\n  I would say this in my part of the closing: We should not have to \nmake a false choice. We don't have to be anticoal and prohealth. We can \nbe both. We can do what is good for the health of the country and good \nfor coal; that is, have clean coal, uphold this rule, and vote against \nthe Inhofe resolution.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma said I asked: \nWhom do we trust more, politicians or bureaucrats? No; that is not what \nI said. I said: Whom do we trust more, politicians or groups such as \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of \nRespiratory Care, the American Heart Association, the Lung Association, \nthe nurses, the March of Dimes, et cetera. I believe that when it comes \nto the trust of the public, these groups have one concern and that \nconcern is the health of our people. That is why we have to defeat this \nresolution and allow the Environmental Protection Agency, after 20 \nyears, to finally promulgate a rule that\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\nwill go after the worst toxins that are coming out of coal-fired \nplants.\n  I will go through a few of these. Mercury is a heavy metal that can \ndamage the nervous system in children and harm the brain of infants, \ncausing slower mental development and lower intelligence. Why do we \nwant to take a stand against the children and their brain development? \nMercury can accumulate in the food chain. We know this. What happens is \npeople--especially pregnant women and children--can't eat fish because \nof the high content of mercury.\n  Then there is lead. These are the things we are talking about getting \nout of the air. Lead can damage the nervous system of children and harm \nthe brains of infants, causing slower mental development and lower \nintelligence.\n  There is no known safe level of lead in the blood of children. This \nis indisputable fact. It can harm the kidneys and cause high blood \npressure, damage reproduction, cause muscle and joint pain, nerve \ndisorders. Why would anyone--why would anyone stand on this floor and \nsay it is OK to allow these toxins to be polluting our environment? \nArsenic is a heavy metal that causes cancer, damages the nervous \nsystem, kidneys, and liver. Powerplants account for 62 percent of all \nthe arsenic pollution we are fighting against. Why would anyone who \ncares about the people they represent vote for this resolution and stop \nthe EPA from cleaning up our air?\n  Vote no. There is no reason to risk the health of the American people \nby voting for the utility CRA resolution. If the resolution passes and \nif that resolution were to become the policy of this country, \nthousands--hundreds of thousands of Americans every year would be \nharmed. This is not rhetoric, this is fact. Scientists have told us \nthis. The health groups have told us this.\n  I urge a strong ``no'' vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There will now be 2 minutes of \ndebate equal divided on the amendment.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, this bill is about holding USDA \naccountable. Organic farmers, when they get crop insurance, pay a 5-\npercent premium upfront. The whole concept was that on the back end \nthey would be compensated at the value of their organic crop should \nthey need to utilize their insurance. However, to establish the price \nof the organic crop, USDA has to do a study. We instructed them to do \nthis study 4 years ago, and they have been dragging their feet. They \nhave done four crops out of the many dozens.\n  Our organic farmers are left in the most untenable position of paying \nthe premiums upfront but not getting the fair organic prices on the \nback end. This amendment says to get the studies done, which you were \ntold to do 4 years ago, so the equation is fair to our farmers.\n  I am pleased that Senator Olympia Snowe is a cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, just for the information of the \nSenate, Senator DeMint's amendment was next, but we have not seen him \non the floor yet. So we moved to this amendment. As soon as he arrives, \nwe will return to the DeMint amendment.\n  It is my understanding that we can proceed to a voice vote in the \nmeantime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the farm bill adds a new grant component \nto the existing rural utility service broadband loans and loan \nguarantee program. My amendment would eliminate the authority of the \nSecretary of the Department of Agriculture to increase the taxpayer \nshare of these broadband grants beyond 50 percent.\n  Please keep in mind that these are not direct loans, these are grants \nthat require no payback. It is important that recipients have some skin \nin the game so that they make good decisions. My amendment allows the \n50-percent threshold cost sharing but does not allow the Secretary to \nwaive that and make that a 75-percent share by the taxpayer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this moment of fiscal sanity \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose this amendment. \nIt has a similar impact to one yesterday we defeated by this Senator. \nIt basically goes to the question of whether we are going to allow \ninvestment in rural communities--the hardest hit communities, the \nfarthest apart communities--and whether they will have access to \nbroadband. It really goes to small businesses, in small towns and \nvillages, and whether they are going to have access to sell their \nproducts to consumers around the globe. We are in a global economy.\n  In the 1930s and 1940s, we did rural electrification to make sure the \nfarmer\n\n[[Page S4336]]\n\nat the end of the road was connected with electricity. This is the same \nkind of thing, but it is the Internet. It is broadband. We want to make \nsure everybody is connected, even those in the remote, rural areas.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2289.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To reduce funding for the market access program and to \nprohibit the use of funds for reality television shows, wine tastings, \n               animal spa products, and cat or dog food)\n\n       On page 293, strike lines 16 through 19, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3102. FUNDING FOR MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 211(c) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 \n     U.S.C. 5641(c)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A)--\n       (A) by striking ``and'' after ``2005,''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``, and $160,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2013 through 2017'' after ``2012,''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Prohibition on use of funds for certain activities.--\n     None of the funds made available to carry out this subsection \n     shall be used for--\n       ``(A) wine tastings;\n       ``(B) animal spa products;\n       ``(C) reality television shows; or\n       ``(D) cat or dog food.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is an amendment that falls in line with the \nrecommendation of the administration as well as every outside group \nthat has ever looked at this program.\n  The Department of Agriculture has five access to marketing programs. \nThis is just one of them. The administration recommended a 20-percent \nreduction. We have put forward an amendment to reduce it by 20 percent. \nWe spend $2 billion over the next 10 years on market access. American \ncontribution of total world agricultural products is on the decline in \nspite of these programs, and the waste in these programs--if we look at \nwhere the money is spent--is unbelievable.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to oppose my colleague's \namendment.\n  The reality for us is that American agricultural exports is one of \nthe few places where we have a trade surplus right now, and we want to \ncontinue that. The current program the Senator is speaking about is all \nabout exports. It is all about jobs. For every $1 invested in this \nparticular market access program, $35 is generated back into economic \nactivity. I think that is a pretty good investment.\n  We know it is a very important part of the future not only for our \ntraditional production agricultural parts of the country but for \nsmaller value-added food products which really is in exports, and this \nsupports that.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I assume by the chairman's response that \nshe supports the $20 million that went into a reality TV show in India \nto purchase cotton other than ``made in the United States.'' That is \nwhere $20 million of it went. That is what is wrong with this program.\n  I am not objecting to the fact that we ought to have market access \nprograms.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2293.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To limit subsidies for millionaires)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME LIMITATION FOR CONSERVATION \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 1001D(b)(2)(A) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1308 3a(b)(2)(A)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Limits.--'' and all that follows through \n     ``clause (ii),'' and inserting ``Limits.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law,''; and\n       (2) by striking clause (ii).\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reducing our national debt--which now \nexceeds $15.8 trillion--is the most critical issue facing our nation. \nOur country simply cannot survive if we continue down this \nunsustainable course. Every area of the Federal budget should be \nexamined to determine, which programs should be priorities.\n  Federal conservation programs are a good place to start. These \nprograms pay farmers and ranchers to either implement conservation \nmeasures on their farms, ``working lands'', or to idle their land for \nconservation purposes, and ``land retirement''.\n  Oftentimes, the financial assistance offered by these programs \nincentivizes what is already in the best financial interests of \nfarmers. Natural, market-based incentives already exist to achieve the \nefficiency and conservation purposes of these programs without taxpayer \ndollars. Not only that, but these programs also pay farmers and \ncompanies that have adjusted gross incomes, AGI, of $1 million or more.\n  Special rules allow the USDA to waive income limitations for certain \nprograms, which it does on a regular basis. The result is millions paid \nto otherwise ineligible millionaires each year.\n  In fact, over the past 2 years, USDA waived the $1 million AGI cap \nfor the programs discussed below and paid a total of $89,032,263 to \nindividuals or entities with an AGI of $1 million or more. Allowing \nfederal conservation programs to make payments to those with an \nadjusted gross income, AGI, of $1 million or more is simply not a \npriority for taxpayers.\n  This amendment would prevent USDA from paying millionaires by \neliminating the ability to issue waivers that exempt program \nparticipants who have an AGI of $1 million or more from adhering to the \nprogram's payment limit rules.\n  In total, over a 2-year period, USDA waived program requirements and \nawarded over $84 million to individuals and entities with an AGI of $1 \nmillion or more.\n  In 2009, the USDA waived program requirements and paid two \nmillionaires a total of $10,234,520, which consisted mainly of a $10 \nmillion payment to an investment company in California for restoring \nwetlands to protect the Riparian Brush Rabbit.\n  In 2010, the Wetland Reserve Program, WRP, program paid eight \nindividuals with an AGI of $1 million over $74 million. These included \nalmost $22 million to a ranch in Florida. The company that owns the \nranch describes itself as a ``privately held, family-owned company with \nagricultural, commercial real estate, and asset management \noperations.'' That company also states that it owns a number of \ncommercial real estate properties in New Jersey and Florida. The \ncompany also claims holdings that include multi-tenant office \nbuildings, parking lots, a for-profit educational institution, \nrestaurants, and retail property.\n  In 2010, USDA also paid over $31 million to another ranch in Florida. \nThe payment was part of an $89 million purchase by USDA of an easement \nthat places deed restrictions on the use of the land along 26,000 acres \nof the Fisheating Creek Watershed, partially located on the ranch. USDA \nclaimed that the easement purchase would provide support for the \ncrested caracara, Florida panther, and the red-cockaded woodpecker.\n  Recently, the owners of the ranch listed 2,600 acres for sale for \n$18.2 million. The property is described as a working ranch with \n``tremendous recreation and hunting attributes.'' The local newspaper \nhas also reported that same ranch was slated for a new 12,000 unit \nplanned community.\n  Other entities and individuals with an AGI of $1 million or more that \nreceived WRP payments in 2010 include:\n  $7.92 million to a company in Texas for ``restoration and protection \nof critical and unique wetlands'' on a property known as East Nest Lake \nand Osceola Plantation; $5.8 million to a farm in North Carolina to \npromote a ``habitat for migratory birds and wetland dependent \nwildlife;'' $5.4 million to a ranch in Florida for land with ``high \npotential to significantly improve waterfowl and wading bird habitat'' \n$900,853 to an individual in Kansas to ``protect and [for] restoring . \n. . valuable wetland resources . . . for migratory birds and other \nwildlife;'' $227,203 to a company in New Hampshire for ``wetland \nrestoration;'' and $80,000 to two individuals in Mississippi to \n``restore, protect and enhance wetlands.''\n  In 2010, USDA waived the $1 million AGI requirement and paid a ranch \nholding company over $2.7 million through Grassland Reserve Program, \nGRP, for ``protection of critical and unique grasslands.''\n  Last year, USDA paid four millionaires a total of $592,097 through \nthe Environmental Quality Incentive Program, EQIP, $299,847 of which \nwas aimed at protecting the Sage Grouse by a ranch in California; \n$50,000 went to a farm. That farm is owned by the W.C. Bradley Company, \nwhich is best known for producing Char-Broil outdoor grills and Zebco \nfishing supplies; remaining amounts of $35,250 and $210,000 went to two \nfamily trusts.\n  The Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program paid $737,000 to three \nmillionaire recipients, with the majority of the funds $449,662 going \nto protect the Sage Grouse by a family trust in California. A farm in \nGeorgia also received $100,000 through WHIP for ``promotion of at-risk \nspecies habitat conservation.'' The remaining $187,540 went to a \ncompany in New Jersey.\n  Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, FRPP paid $630,000 to a \ncompany in 2009 to protect Raspberry Farms in Hampton Falls, New \nHampshire. Raspberry Farms formerly operated as a ``popular pick-your-\nown berries and retail farm stand'' in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n  The former farm was scheduled to be developed for housing, but \ninstead, NRCS, in partnership with local entities, paid a total of $1.6 \nmillion to ensure the land will never be developed.\n  In 2010 USDA paid four individuals and entities with an AGI of $1 \nmillion or more a total of $75,540.\n  Again, this is a very straightforward amendment. Last year the \nDepartment of Agriculture paid $10 million to two different \nindividuals, who had an adjusted gross income of over $1 million, \nthrough a waiver granted by the Department of Agriculture. Both of \nthese were ineligible, but we give the Department of Agriculture the \nright to waive that. This amendment would restrict that right for a \nwaiver for people making more than $1 million a year in terms of \nconservation payments.\n  There is nothing wrong with conservation programs, but most often \nthese payments are paid in addition to what people are going to do \nanyway. So what the Department of Agriculture has done is given well \nover $180 million to millionaires through our conservation payment on \nprograms they would have otherwise done themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would indicate that the conservation \nprogram is a very strong, effective program, but I am not objecting, \nnor is the ranking member, to moving forward with the vote.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To provide assistance for certain losses)\n\n       On page 1006, between lines 21 and 22, insert the \n     following:\n       ``(4) Additional availability.--\n       ``(A) In general.--As soon as practicable after October 1, \n     2013, the Secretary shall make assistance available to \n     producers of an otherwise eligible crop described in \n     subsection (a)(2) that suffered losses--\n       ``(i) to a 2012 annual fruit crop grown on a bush or tree; \n     and\n       ``(ii) in a county covered by a declaration by the \n     Secretary of a natural disaster for production losses due to \n     a freeze or frost.\n       ``(B) Assistance.--The Secretary shall make assistance \n     available under subparagraph (A) in an amount equivalent to \n     assistance available under paragraph (1), less any fees not \n     previously paid under paragraph (2).''.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. This amendment simply addresses what has happened with \nsevere and devastating freezes across the country for those who have \nfood crops and don't have access to crop insurance. This Farm Bill \nmakes great strides in expanding crop insurance for fruit and vegetable \ngrowers in the United States. However, these new programs will not be \navailable to producers who suffered substantial--and in some cases \ncomplete--losses this year. This amendment would simply allow those in \nthe States that are affected to buy into a program we have, called the \nNon-Insured Disaster Program, that allows them to get some kind of help \nfor the freezes.\n  This provides them the same coverage they will have in the years \ngoing forward--this is the same kind of extension for 2012 losses that \nis available for livestock producers. 29 States in every part of the \ncountry have reported major crop losses for 2012 due to frost or \nfreeze. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so these farmers \naren't losing their business because of bad weather.\n  I believe we can move forward with a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit assistance to North Korea under title II of the \n  Food for Peace Act unless the President issues a national interest \n                                waiver)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3015. PROHIBITION ON ASSISTANCE FOR NORTH KOREA.\n\n       (a) In General.--No amounts may be obligated or expended to \n     provide assistance under title II of the Food for Peace Act \n     (7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.) to the Democratic People's Republic \n     of Korea.\n       (b) National Interest Waiver.--The President may waive \n     subsection (a) if the President determines and certifies to \n     the Committees on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committees on \n     Agriculture and Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives that the waiver is in the national interest \n     of the United States.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Kerry-Lugar amendment is a side-by-side \namendment, frankly, which will counter the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  We all join in abhorring the conduct of the Government of North \nKorea. Nobody contests that. The question here is whether we want to \nhave a complete prohibition on any humanitarian assistance, without the \npossibility of a Presidential waiver in the event that the President, \nas a matter of national policy, as a matter of our humanitarian policy, \ndecides that something has changed in North Korea or there is behavior \nthat has been altered by North Korea, as in Burma. If we don't have a \nPresidential waiver, the Kyl amendment permanently locks in--until \nthere is other congressional action--a complete prohibition on any \nhumanitarian assistance to the people--not the government but the \npeople, the children and families of North Korea.\n  Ronald Reagan said very clearly that ``a hungry child knows no \npolitics.'' I believe we ought to uphold that principle and have the \nPresidential waiver in this particular case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I oppose the Kerry amendment and hope it will be defeated \nand that my amendment will be adopted.\n  Senator Kerry has appropriately characterized the amendment as being \nfood aid to North Korea. However, it is not just about abhorring North \nKorea's bad behavior but also the administration's bad behavior. On \nfour separate occasions, the State Department assured Members of this \nSenate that food aid would not be used as a condition to negotiations \nwith the North Koreans; that under no circumstances would the United \nStates provide any incentives or rewards, is the way they put it, to \nNorth Korea. In each case, we inquired, and we specifically talked \nabout the food aid. Four times they said no, it wouldn't be done. Two \nweeks before the negotiations were to begin this spring, all of a \nsudden, $240 million in food aid was put on the table, and only because \nthe North Koreans launched their so-called satellite long-range missile \nwere those negotiations canceled.\n  So a national security interest that can simply be provided by the \nPresident based on his views----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Does not solve the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, what I said before was, on four separate \noccasions over just a couple of months, the administration had assured \nMembers of the Senate that it would not use food aid as an enticement \nto the North Koreans to come to the negotiating table.\n  Here are direct quotations from the State Department, comments such \nas ``had no intention of rewarding them for their actions that their \ngovernment has already agreed to take.'' Reaffirmed, ``There are no \nfinancial incentives for North Korea to meet the precepts or engage in \ntalks.''\n  Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns, ``To be clear, the \nAdministration will not provide any financial incentives to Pyongyang. \n. . .'' et cetera, on the negotiations. And further that ``any \nengagement with North Korea will not be used as a mechanism to funnel \nfinancial or other rewards to Pyongyang.''\n  We also heard media reports and asked them about them. They said no:\n\n       These media reports are not accurate. U.S. policy toward \n     North Korea has not changed. We have no intention of \n     rewarding North Korea--\n\n  And so on. And a mere 3 weeks later, we do exactly the opposite. That \nis why a waiver for the President to say otherwise does not do any good \nand why I urge support----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. For my resolution which simply prevents the administration \nfrom providing food aid to North Korea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is an important distinction here. If \nyou are going to provide humanitarian assistance in some circumstance, \nand the administration made good on its promise to do that, it is hard \nto separate it from the events as they are going forward that you do \nnot control. No matter who is President, the Senate should not tie the \nhands of any President with respect to this policy.\n  Ronald Reagan said it best when he said very clearly that ``a hungry \nchild knows no politics.'' That was Ronald Reagan's policy. That is the \npolicy of churches all across our country. The fact is that if the Kyl \namendment were to pass, you will have tied the hands of any President \non a sensitive national security issue where the President deserves \nthat kind of flexibility.\n  Without a national interest waiver, you lock into place a prohibition \nin North Korea. What happens if suddenly you had a change, as in Burma? \nYou would be locked in and unable to respond to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. You would take away the option of the President. In the \ncase of Burma or other places, the President has shown the flexibility. \nThe President ought to have the flexibility here. I hope we will not \nhave a total prohibition on humanitarian assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have offered this amendment \nwith my colleague Senator Thune from South Dakota.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that would increase resources to land \nmanagers to address insect and disease epidemics spreading across our \nforests, while maintaining the farm bill's more than $23 billion in \nmandatory savings, and that is important.\n  This bark beetle epidemic, which is in many States, has left \ndangerous dead and dying stands of trees that worsen the threat from \nforest fires. This is particularly evident to Coloradans because, \ntoday, we have an 86-\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\nsquare-mile fire, and more than 1,600 brave firefighters are \nchallenging this blaze, which is already the most destructive fire in \nColorado's history. We don't expect to fully defeat this fire or bring \nit to ground for several weeks.\n  The Forest Service has set a goal of doubling the number of acres \ntreated to address beetle kill and prevent forest fires. This amendment \nwould help them reach that goal. If we don't pass the amendment, they \nwill not have the wherewithal and resources to do so.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, with \nthe Senator from Utah recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to repeal the Forest \nLegacy Program. This is a program designed to protect lands in the \nUnited States. It is important to remember that the Federal Government \nis already a massive landowner. It has abundant programs already in \nplace to conserve that land, to protect it. The Federal Government owns \nabout two-thirds of the land in my own State. It owns nearly 30 percent \nof the land mass within the territorial boundaries of the United \nStates. We do a lot to conserve that land. But when we use this money--\nmoney estimated to amount to about $200 million a year in \nauthorization, about $1 billion over a 5-year period--we are using that \nmoney to take land out of use. We are using that money to pay people \nnot to use their land for anything. Whenever we look for areas in which \nwe can save money, one area is to not pay people not to use their land.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Lee amendment to \nrepeal the Forest Legacy Program, and urge all Senators to do the same. \nFor more than two decades, this program has led to the conservation of \nover 2.2 million acres of working forest lands in 49 states. The \nNational Association of Forest Owners estimates that U.S. forests \nsupport more than 2.9 million jobs and contribute $115 billion towards \nthe gross domestic product.\n  Better still, the Forest Legacy Program does not use taxpayer dollars \nfor Federal funds, but instead relies on a very small percentage of oil \ndrilling receipts. The benefits of this program far outweigh any cost \nto the taxpayer, a claim that cannot be made by many other Federal \nprograms.\n  Repealing this program would be a tragic mistake, especially at a \ntime when the Nation's forests are under attack from real estate \ndevelopment and urban sprawl, among other enemies. The U.S. is \nprojected to lose up to 75 million acres of forest over the next half \ncentury. As forest areas are fragmented and disappear, so too do the \nbenefits they provide. This program is essential to protect these \nbenefits and ensure that we have a healthy environment and strong rural \neconomies in the future. I strongly oppose this amendment and urge all \nSenators to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2313.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CARDIN.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, right now we have 34 amendments left plus \nfinal passage. That is 11 hours. I was hoping we could dispose of quite \na few of these on voice, but that has not worked out very well. We have \nhad a number of people who offered to have their votes by voice, but \nthose were objected to.\n  We have to finish this bill. We have to do flood insurance this week. \nI know people have schedules. We have all kinds of things going on, but \nwe have to show a little bit of understanding about the ordeal we have \nahead of us.\n  I am confident we are not going to stay here until 2 o'clock this \nmorning, but we are going to stay here a while because until we have a \nway of finishing this bill that is set in stone, we are going to have \nto proceed forward. This is an important piece of legislation but also \nflood insurance is an extremely important piece of legislation. If we \ndo not complete that by the end of this month, there will be thousands \nand thousands of people who cannot close their loans every day--not a \nmonth, every day.\n  With the economy in the state it is in now, we need to close every \nloan, every home that is purchased, every commercial piece of property \nthat is bought. We have to close those now. We cannot tell the American \npeople we tried to get it done, but we could not because we were--\nwhatever.\n  People have indicated they want to get out of here early tonight. \nThere may be somebody who wants to get out of here earlier tonight than \nI, but I would be happy to debate that subject with them. But we need \nto show some cooperation. We have two of the finest Senators we could \nhave managing this bill. Let's work together and get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 2 minutes of debate. The Senator \nfrom Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a broad, bipartisan amendment--\nWarner-Crapo-Kirk-Shaheen-Bennet-Webb. It basically does three things \nin the broadband area. It accelerates access to those areas that are \nunderserved. As a matter of fact, we have a 2009 USDA IG report which \nshowed that less than 3 percent of loans provided by RUS went toward \nunserved communities. This will move forward in that area.\n  Second, it creates greater access and transparency and accountability \nstandards for RUS and applicants. These are items that were brought \nforward from the GAO and the IG of the USDA and CRS. It also allows \ngreater levels of accountability in ensuring that those States that \ncollect data by address--that that information is related to RUS, so we \ndon't have counties where certain parts are served and other parts are \nleft unserved, never able to get access. It has the broad support of \nthe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Taxpayers Union, the \nLeague of Rural Voters.\n  I ask bipartisan support of this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY, Mr. President, I have long believed that Congress must \nwork to enact policies that promote the deployment of broadband in \nrural America. There is no doubt that rural areas lag behind the rest \nof the country when it comes to access to affordable, quality, high-\nspeed Internet. As the Internet rapidly evolves beyond what the slow \nspeeds offered by dial up service can handle, broadband service is no \nlonger a luxury, it is a necessity. Today, I voted against an amendment \nthat, while well intentioned, may have the unintended consequence of \nmaking it harder for the Rural Utilities Service to incentivize \nbroadband expansion and competition in rural areas like Vermont.\n  I support the provisions in the underlying farm bill that seek to \nprovide additional forms of assistance to broadband projects in rural \nareas, and I had hoped that the Senate would not significantly alter \nthese provisions. It is important to ensure that the Rural Utilities \nService has the flexibility it needs to provide assistance to rural \nareas--both those that have no service at all and those that have \ninadequate service.\n  Senator Warner's amendment does contain elements that I support, \nincluding provisions that will help to improve transparency and \naccountability within the Rural Utilities Service Program. \nUnfortunately, it may go too far in refocusing the scope of the program \nat the expense of rural communities in Vermont.\n  I look forward to continuing my work in the Senate to expand \nbroadband service and competition in rural America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am not yielding time in opposition. I commend Senator \nWarner and everyone on this amendment for their tremendous amount of \nwork. It makes a tremendous amount of sense. It is real reform. I \nbelieve we have an understanding to proceed with a voice vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2457, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2457), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I would like to have the Record reflect if \nthere had been a rollcall vote, I would have voted no on this item.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I wish to be recorded also as I would have \nvoted no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2314\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2314 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2314.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To repeal the conservation stewardship program and the \n                     conservation reserve program)\n\n       Strike subtitles A and B of title II and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 2001.

REPEAL OF CONSERVATION STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM.\n\n       Subchapter B of chapter 2 of subtitle D of title XII of the \n     Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3838d et seq.) is \n     repealed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate, equally divided. \nThe Senator from Utah is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I propose amendment No. 2314 to repeal the \nConservation Reserve Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program. \nHere we have another instance of the Federal Government paying people \nnot to use their land. In this circumstance, they are being paid not to \ngrow crops on their land, not to use agricultural land.\n  We have an almost $16 trillion debt. CBO says this amendment would \nsave over $15 billion in mandatory spending over 10 years. Not doing \nsomething is something that should be free. Only the Federal Government \nwould try to defend the practice of spending billions and billions of \ndollars--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend for a moment. \nSenators will please take their conversations out of the well.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Only the Federal Government would try to defend the \nbarbaric, outmoded practice of paying people billions of dollars not to \nuse their land. That is what these programs do. We need to get rid of \nthem. That is why I propose this amendment. I invite my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. We \nhave over 643 conservation and environmental groups from every State in \nthe Union supporting our conservation reforms in this bill. This is \nabout protecting land and water and air habitat, wetlands. Ducks \nUnlimited is a huge supporter of what we have been doing.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program, which has been in place for 25 \nyears, was shown last year, with the drought, to have had a tremendous \neffect. We saw some of the worst droughts on record since the Dust Bowl \nin the last number of months, but we did not have a Dust Bowl and that \nis because the CRP prevented erosion and the soil stayed where it \nshould stay. This is about our country, protecting our land, resources \nfor our children and grandchildren.\n  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.\n\n[[Page S4344]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nAll those in favor, signify by saying aye.\n  (Chorus of ayes.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No?\n  (Chorus of nays.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The noes appear to have it.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

OBJECTIVE AND SCHOLARLY AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD LAW \n                   RESEARCH AND INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the farms, ranches, and forests of the United States \n     are impacted by a complex and rapidly evolving web of \n     international, Federal, State, and local laws (including \n     regulations);\n       (2) objective, scholarly, and authoritative agricultural \n     and food law research and information helps the farm, ranch, \n     and forestry community contribute to the strength of the \n     United States through improved conservation, environmental \n     protection, job creation, economic development, renewable \n     energy production, outdoor recreational opportunities, and \n     increased local and regional supplies of food, fiber, and \n     fuel; and\n       (3) the vast agricultural community of the United States, \n     including farmers, ranchers, foresters, attorneys, \n     policymakers, and extension personnel, need access to \n     agricultural and food law research and information provided \n     by an objective, scholarly, and neutral source.\n       (b) Partnerships.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     National Agricultural Library, shall support the \n     dissemination of objective, scholarly, and authoritative \n     agricultural and food law research and information by \n     entering into partnerships with institutions of higher \n     education that have expertise in agricultural and food law \n     research and information.\n       (c) Restriction.--For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall \n     use not more than $1,000,000 of the amounts made available to \n     the National Agricultural Library to carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the farms, ranches, and forests of the \nUnited States are impacted by a complex and rapidly evolving web of \ninternational, Federal, State, and local laws.\n  The vast agricultural community of the United States--including \nfarmers, ranchers, foresters, attorneys, policymakers and extension \npersonnel--needs access to agricultural and food law research and \ninformation provided by an objective, scholarly, and neutral source. \nThis amendment encourages the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through \nthe National Agricultural Library, to get the information out by \nentering into partnerships with institutions of higher education that \nhave expertise in this area.\n  The amendment does not authorize a new program or increase the \nauthorization for the National Agricultural Library. Again, CBO says it \nhas no cost.\n  I urge a voice vote in the affirmative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, as \ndoes my ranking member. I wish to congratulate Senator Boozman on great \nwork on this amendment. I believe we can proceed with a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2355.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2442\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I call up amendment No. 2442.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2442.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a pilot loan program to support healthy foods \n                            for the hungry)\n\n       At the end of section 3201 of the Consolidated Farm and \n     Rural Development Act (as added by section 5001), add the \n     following:\n       ``(e) Pilot Loan Program to Support Healthy Foods for the \n     Hungry.--\n       ``(1) Definition of gleaner.--In this subsection, the term \n     `gleaner' means an entity that--\n       ``(A) collects edible, surplus food that would be thrown \n     away and distributes the food to agencies or nonprofit \n     organizations that feed the hungry; or\n       ``(B) harvests for free distribution to the needy, or for \n     donation to agencies or nonprofit organizations for ultimate \n     distribution to the needy, an agricultural crop that has been \n     donated by the owner of the crop.\n       ``(2) Program.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall establish, \n     within the operating loan program established under this \n     chapter, a pilot program under which the Secretary makes \n     loans available to eligible entities to assist the entities \n     in providing food to the hungry.\n       ``(3) Eligibility.--In addition to any other person \n     eligible under the terms and conditions of the operating loan \n     program established under this chapter, gleaners shall be \n     eligible to receive loans under this subsection.\n       ``(4) Loan amount.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Each loan issued under the program shall \n     be in an amount of not less than $500 and not more than \n     $5,000.\n       ``(B) Redistribution.--If the eligible recipients in a \n     State do not use the full allocation of loans that are \n     available to eligible recipients in the State under this \n     subsection, the Secretary may use any unused amounts to make \n     loans available to eligible entities in other States in \n     accordance with this subsection.\n       ``(5) Loan processing.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall process any loan \n     application submitted under the program not later than 30 \n     days after the date on which the application was submitted.\n       ``(B) Expediting applications.--The Secretary shall take \n     any measure the Secretary determines necessary to expedite \n     any application submitted under the program.\n       ``(6) Paperwork reduction.--The Secretary shall take \n     measures to reduce any paperwork requirements for loans under \n     the program.\n       ``(7) Program integrity.--The Secretary shall take such \n     actions as are necessary to ensure the integrity of the \n     program established under this subsection.\n       ``(8) Maximum amount.--Of funds that are made available to \n     carry out this chapter, the Secretary shall use to carry out \n     this subsection a total amount of not more than $500,000.\n       ``(9) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the maximum \n     amount of funds are used to carry out this subsection under \n     paragraph (8), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on \n     Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a \n     report that describes the results of the pilot program and \n     the feasibility of expanding the program.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, again, I hope we can handle this amendment \non a voice vote. This is an amendment that would help the gleaners all \nacross the country, who, of course, are the volunteers across America \nwho help get surplus food that would otherwise be wasted out to the \nhungry at senior centers and at various kinds of food kitchens and \nother critical hunger programs. Thirty-four million tons of food waste \nis generated each year. That could feed a lot of people.\n  The gleaners are trying to make sure this perfectly good food goes on \nthe plates of struggling Americans as opposed to millions of pounds of \nit going into landfills and incinerators.\n  This amendment, again, costs no money. It simply makes----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN.--it possible to collect and preserve edible food. I hope \nwe accept it on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join with me \nto oppose the amendment.\n  The amendment would provide government loans for brick-and-mortar \nprojects, including food refrigeration capacity. We are talking about \nrefrigerators--big refrigerators. At a time when we are working to \nstreamline current programs and reduce the size of government, I am \nconcerned we would be expanding the size to serve a new pool of \napplicants competing for very limited resources at the Department of\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\nAgriculture. In this regard, the gleaners would be taken to the \ncleaners.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time in opposition remains.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will only state this costs no additional money. Senator \nStabenow supports it, and I yield to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would just simply say that I strongly \nsupport the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Is there further debate in opposition? If there is no further debate, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  All those in favor say aye.\n  (Chorus of ayes.)\n  All those opposed, no.\n  (Chorus of nays.)\n  The nays appear to have it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask for a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second at this time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask for a division vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All those in favor of the amendment will stand \nand be counted.\n  Now would all those opposed stand and be counted.\n  On a division, two-thirds of the Senators present having voted in the \naffirmative, the amendment No. 2442 was agreed to.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk to my \namendment No. 2360.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am sorry, Mr. President. We were in discussions. At \nthis moment if we might just pause, we will just object for a moment. I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We are now told that this has been reviewed, and so we \nhave no objection to proceeding to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2360, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2360, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment, as modified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Boozman] proposes an \n     amendment No. 2360, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for emergency food assistance, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4____. QUALITY CONTROL BONUSES.\n\n       Section 16 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. \n     2025) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in the first sentence of paragraph (4), by striking \n     ``payment error rate'' and all that follows through \n     ``subsection (d)'' and inserting ``liability amount or new \n     investment amount under paragraph (1) or payment error \n     rate''; and\n       (B) in the first sentence of paragraph (5), by striking \n     ``payment error rate'' and all that follows through \n     ``subsection (d)'' and inserting ``liability amount or new \n     investment amount under paragraph (1) or payment error \n     rate'';\n       (2) by striking subsection (d); and\n       (3) in subsection (i)(1), by striking ``subsection (d)(1)'' \n     and inserting ``subsection (c)(2)''.\n       On page 337, line 8, strike ``$28,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$71,000,000''.\n       On page 337, line 10, strike ``$24,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$67,000,000''.\n       On page 337, line 12, strike ``$20,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$63,000,000''.\n       On page 337, line 14, strike ``$18,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$61,000,000''.\n       On page 337, line 16, strike ``$10,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$53,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. My amendment redirects funding currently going to the \nStates for the administration of SNAP. It puts that money in TEFAP, \nwhich provides funding to the Secretary of Agriculture to make \ncommodity purchases given to food banks.\n  I am sure my colleagues are aware of the difficult situation in our \nfood banks right now. They are under immense pressure in these very \ndifficult economic times.\n  The importance of TEFAP is it provides food banks with commodities. \nThis amendment takes money currently used to encourage the States to do \nsomething that they ought to be doing anyway and reinvests in a program \nthat actually provides food to Americans who need it the most.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to reluctantly oppose the \namendment of my colleague. I appreciate what he is trying to do. I \ncouldn't agree more about the needs of food banks. That is why in this \nlegislation we increase food bank funding by $174 million.\n  The problem is the way the Senator wants to do this, which is by \nreducing the funding available to stop food stamp fraud efforts. It \nwould reduce the SNAP error rates efforts. Right now, what has been \ndone to tackle waste, fraud, and abuse has actually reduced error rates \ndramatically--by 43 percent. We want to keep that going.\n  So I certainly support what he is trying to do but not by taking \nmoney away from waste, fraud, and abuse efforts within the food \nassistance program. So I have to ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I ask for a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Reauthorization of these effective \nand efficient councils will allow them to continue their important work \nof strengthening rural communities in Vermont and across the country.\n  This reauthorization would recognize the State councils' on-the-\nground leadership in rural communities, and allow them to continue \ntheir vital work. I would note that this amendment does not cost a \nsingle farm bill dollar; it would merely maintain the States' statutory \nauthority to establish these State-run rural development councils.\n  I urge all Senators to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I commend Senator Leahy, who, as \na former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, is a tremendous \nchampion not only for Vermont but for the entire country on these \nissues.\n  I yield back the time.

If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 2204) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Toomey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2226.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To eliminate biorefinery, renewable chemical, and biobased \n                   product manufacturing assistance)\n\n       Beginning on page 888, strike line 5, and all that follows \n     through page 890, line 21.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, this is an amendment that repeals the \nBiorefinery Assistance Program. This is a program that primarily \nprovides loan guarantees to cellulosic ethanol plants.\n  The fact is the taxpayers are already subsidizing ethanol plants in \nmany ways. The Federal Government already provides a tax credit of $1 a \ngallon to ethanol. The Federal Government creates a mandate that forces \nconsumers to buy this product whether they want to or not, thereby \ncreating a market for ethanol.\n  We provide grants for ethanol. Do taxpayers also have to risk their \nmoney by guaranteeing loans to subsidize this activity? I do not think \nthat is a good idea. This is the same idea that got us into trouble in \nso many ways. A similar loan program was the source of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of losses to Solyndra. And just this year, this \nvery program cost $40 million with the bankruptcy of Range Fuels.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for a modest reform here. Repeal this \none narrow program, the Biorefinery Assistance Program. I urge a \n``yes'' vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. In \nfact, we are not talking about ethanol. We are talking about, first of \nall, advanced biofuels using food waste or animal waste or biomass \nmaterials. We are talking about biobased manufacturing, which is an \nexciting new opportunity in making things and growing things together \nin our country, whether it is corn or wheat byproducts, whether it is \nsoybeans. In fact, if you drive a Ford vehicle today, a new vehicle, a \nnew Chevy Volt, you sit on seats with soy-based foam that is \nbiodegradable, more lightweight, and you get better fuel economy, grown \nby American soybean growers.\n  So this is the opportunity for new growth in jobs that is in this \nbill. It is a part I am very excited about for the future for every \npart of this country. It involves more than 3,000 innovative companies \nright now engaging in new cutting-edge manufacturing to use \nagricultural products----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW.--to get us off of foreign oil.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Those in favor say aye.\n  (Chorus of ayes.)\n  Those opposed say nay.\n  (Chorus of nays.)\n  The nays appear to have it.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate on the \namendment.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I will claim the first minute and yield \nthe first 30 seconds to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nPennsylvania in supporting his amendment. This is the last opportunity \nfor a bipartisan amendment to reform sugar subsidies that are costing \nconsumers $3.5 million a year and losing 20,000 jobs a year in this \ncountry.\n  This amendment maintains the current sugar program but rolls back the \nadditional subsidies that were provided for sugar in the 2008 farm \nbill.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. Let me point out \nthat this amendment is such a modest reform. It lowers the price \nsupport on raw sugar, for instance, from 18.75 cents per pound all the \nway down to 18 cents per pound.\n  This is an amendment that will save consumers money, save taxpayers \nmoney and, most importantly, it will save jobs. As the Department of \nCommerce pointed out, for every job saved by the sugar program, three \njobs are lost. It is a modest amendment that simply restores us to the \npolicy prior to 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I strongly oppose this argument. If we \nwant to jeopardize 142,000 American jobs, this is the vote to do it. We \nwill see these jobs shipped overseas.\n  The bottom line is that this program operates at zero cost to the \ntaxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office says it will continue \noperating at zero cost for the next 10 years. This is about American \njobs in American communities all across this country. We are talking \nabout 142,000 jobs. If we are importing cheap sugar at a point where we \nundermine American jobs, what have we gained? We want to export our \nproducts, not our jobs. That is what this amendment would do.\n  I urge strongly a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S4350]]\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of \n   Transportation to conduct a study on rural transportation issues)\n\n       On page 782, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 6203. STUDY OF RURAL TRANSPORTATION ISSUES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary and the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall jointly conduct a study of \n     transportation issues regarding the movement of agricultural \n     products, domestically produced renewable fuels, and \n     domestically produced resources for the production of \n     electricity for rural areas of the United States, and \n     economic development in those areas.\n       (b) Inclusions.--The study shall include an examination \n     of--\n       (1) the importance of freight transportation, including \n     rail, truck, and barge, to--\n       (A) the delivery of equipment, seed, fertilizer, and other \n     products important to the development of agricultural \n     commodities and products;\n       (B) the movement of agricultural commodities and products \n     to market;\n       (C) the delivery of ethanol and other renewable fuels;\n       (D) the delivery of domestically produced resources for use \n     in the generation of electricity for rural areas;\n       (E) the location of grain elevators, ethanol plants, and \n     other facilities;\n       (F) the development of manufacturing facilities in rural \n     areas; and\n       (G) the vitality and economic development of rural \n     communities;\n       (2) the sufficiency in rural areas of transportation \n     capacity, the sufficiency of competition in the \n     transportation system, the reliability of transportation \n     services, and the reasonableness of transportation rates;\n       (3) the sufficiency of facility investment in rural areas \n     necessary for efficient and cost-effective transportation; \n     and\n       (4) the accessibility to shippers in rural areas of Federal \n     processes for the resolution of grievances arising within \n     various transportation modes.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the \n     Secretary of Transportation shall submit a report to Congress \n     that contains the results of the study required under \n     subsection (a).\n       (d) Periodic Updates.--The Secretary and the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall publish triennially an updated version \n     of the study described in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 6204. AGRICULTURAL TRANSPORTATION POLICY.\n\n       Section 203 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1622) is amended by striking subsection (j) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(j) Policy Development Proceedings.--The Secretary shall \n     participate on behalf of the interests of agriculture and \n     rural America in all policy development proceedings or other \n     proceedings of the Surface Transportation Board that may \n     establish freight rail transportation policy affecting \n     agriculture and rural America.''.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan amendment. Senator Hoeven of North Dakota is a \ncosponsor, and this helps address the transportation needs of rural \nAmerica.\n  This amendment simply calls for a study on rural transportation and \ntakes a close look at the issue of captive shippers. Farmers, energy \nproducers, and manufacturers who depend on freight rail service find \nthemselves trapped today in a back-to-the-future world, struggling with \na problem that has resurfaced from a century ago. Many of these end \nusers--these captive customers--have only one railroad to serve them. \nThree decades ago there were 63 class I railroads and today only 7 \nremain. This amendment simply looks at the effect this situation has on \ntransportation in rural areas. It is supported by nearly 40 national \nand regional agricultural and energy organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I ask for a voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Klobuchar's \namendment and appreciate her great work.\n  I yield back the remaining time, and it is my understanding we can \nproceed to a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2299) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] moves to recommit the bill, \n     S. 3240, to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n     Forestry with instructions to report the same back to the \n     Senate with a reduction in spending to 2008 levels so that \n     overall spending shall not exceed $714,247,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I introduce this motion to recommit to move \nus back to 2008 levels. We cannot continue to kick this can down the \nroad in perpetuity. Our spending levels threaten to impair our ability \nto fund everything from defense to entitlements and everything that \nfalls in between. This is a good start, and this is something that \nwould cut the 10-year cost of this bill by $254 billion. We need to do \nit. We need to send it back to the committee, where the committee will \nhave discretion on exactly how to accomplish that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I strongly oppose this motion to \nrecommit. I want to read the cost estimate of the bill prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office. This bill spends $23.6 billion less than \nwe project would be spent if those programs were continued as under \ncurrent law. This bill is $23 billion in deficit reduction, according \nto the nonpartisan, independent Congressional Budget Office.\n  Frankly, we believe, in agriculture, on a bipartisan basis, that we \nhave done our job. We have scoured every page, reduced the deficit by \n$23 billion-plus, and eliminated 100 different programs and \nauthorizations within our jurisdiction. Frankly, I think we are \noffering, within what we can do, reform and deficit reduction of which \nwe should all feel very proud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S4351]]\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, in my approximately 20 seconds remaining, \nlet me say that if we want to continue the same budgeting process that \nhas put us nearly $16 trillion in debt, then we should proceed to vote \nagainst this. If, on the other hand, we want to turn this around and \nmaintain our ability to fund essential government programs, we need to \npass this.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, let me take just 1 second to say that \nthis bill turns us in a different direction--$23 billion-plus in \ndeficit reduction. It may be the only bipartisan deficit reduction \nproposal we will pass in the Senate before the election.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2287\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I call up amendment No. 2287 and ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper], for himself and Mr. \n     Boozman, proposes an amendment numbered 2287.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify a provision relating to high-priority research and \n                         extension initiatives)\n\n       On page 805, strike lines 18 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n     (43), (47), (48), (51), and (52);\n       (B) by redesignating paragraphs (6), (9), (10), (40), (44), \n     (45), (46), (49), and (50) as paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), \n     (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9), respectively; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(10) Corn, soybean meal, cereal grains, and grain \n     byproducts research and extension.--Research and extension \n     grants may be made under this section for the purpose of \n     carrying out or enhancing research to improve the \n     digestibility, nutritional value, and efficiency of use of \n     corn, soybean meal, cereal grains, and grain byproducts for \n     the poultry and food animal production industries.'';\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, roughly two-thirds of the cost of \nraising a chicken is the cost of feed. In recent years, the cost of \nfeed, including the cost of corn, has, as we know, risen dramatically, \nraising with it the cost of chicken and other meats in our \nsupermarkets. These rising costs have placed a strain on the poultry \nindustry, among others, and on consumers too. That is why I joined with \nSenator Boozman in offering an amendment to this bill that makes \nimproving the efficiency, digestibility, and nutritional value of feed \nfor poultry and livestock--including corn, soybean meal, grains and \ngrain byproducts--a top research priority at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  By improving the food used to raise our chickens and livestock we can \nprovide the poultry and livestock industry with a greater variety of \nfeed choices for use in their operations. But this research will not \nonly benefit our country's food producers, it also benefits our \nNation's families by continuing to provide consumers with affordable \nhigh-quality food.\n  Senator Boozman and I urge its adoption.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I commend Senator Carper. I have to say he has \nmentioned to me many times there are 300 chickens for every person in \nDelaware. I think I have that in my memory now. I commend him for his \nwork.\n  We are yielding back time, and we have agreed to a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2287) was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Motion To Recommit With Instructions\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I have a motion at the \ndesk.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       Mr. Johnson the Senator from Wisconsin, moves to recommit \n     the bill S. 3240 to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry of the Senate with instructions to report the \n     same back to the Senate after removing the title relating to \n     nutrition and to report to the Senate as a separate bill the \n     title related to nutrition.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. This is a pretty straightforward motion. It \nrecommits the bill in the Senate back to the committee to have that \ncommittee report back to the full Senate two separate bills. It \nrecognizes the reality that what we have in front of us is not really a \nfarm bill but a food stamp bill.\n  The history is that in 1964 we made food stamps permanent. In 1973 we \ncombined the food stamp portion with the farm bill to ease passage of \nboth votes--to make it easier to spend money. That has worked pretty \nwell because when the food stamp bill was first passed, it cost $375 \nmillion--million--per year. Really, 500,000 people were eligible. Since \nthat point in time it is now going to cost $772 billion over 10 years. \nIt is now 78 percent the size of this entire package.\n  Again, I think it is more than appropriate to split these bills in \ntwo so both bills, the food stamp bill and the farm bill, would get \nmore scrutiny and there would be more debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to oppose the motion to \nrecommit. After all the hard work we have been doing, I am not sure we \nwant to do it twice this year on a farm bill. But on a more serious \nnote, let me just indicate, again, these are major reforms, $23 \nbillion-plus in deficit reduction. It addresses the diversity of \nagriculture--16 million jobs are connected to agriculture in every \ncorner of our country. All of us have a stake in food security. We have \nthe safest, most affordable food supply in the world thanks to a lot of \nhard-working folks all across this country.\n  We believe what we have put forward is something worthy of support. \nWe appreciate all the hard work everyone is doing, the changes that are \nbeing made. But I urge we not recommit this bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Manchin). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 40, nays 59, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 153 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kyl\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--59\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hoeven\n     Inouye\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kirk\n       \n  The motion was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a noncontroversial amendment \nwhich, according to the CBO, has zero costs. It is supported by the \nNational Wildlife Federation, the American Forest Foundation, the \nBiomass Thermal Energy Council, and the Trust for Public Land.\n  This amendment would simply allow, under the Community Wood Energy \nProgram, a new category of small grants to be created which would \nprovide seed capital for biomass cooperatives through grants of up to \n$50,000. These cooperatives would have the opportunity to work with \nlocal wood pellet or wood chip manufacturers to supply bulk purchases \nthat provide consumers with modest discounts.\n  This amendment can help our Nation move forward to more locally \nproduced renewable biomass heating. Again, according to the CBO, it has \nzero costs, and I would ask for the support of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Vermont and yield back time. It is my understanding that we will \nproceed to a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2254) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2363, as Modified\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nadoption of Vitter amendment No. 2363, as modified, be vitiated; and \nfurther, that the Vitter amendment, as modified, be subject to a 60-\naffirmative-vote threshold.\n  I turn now to Senator Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I expect this amendment to pass, but I \nknow some Members expected a vote, and I certainly wanted to provide \nthem that vote with a 60-vote threshold.\n  I urge support of this bipartisan amendment. It does two things. \nFirst of all, it clears up a situation in the context of the film \nindustry where there are certain unintended regulations of extras and \nactors bringing their pets on the set. All of a sudden that is being \ncaptured by regulation which is intended for zoo animals and circus \nanimals, and things such as that. There is no opposition to this part \nof the amendment at all.\n  Secondly, because of the modification, which adds a provision \nsupported by myself and Senators Blumenthal, Kirk, and others, that \nwould make it illegal under Federal law to attend an animal fight. It \nis already outlawed to help organize an animal fight under Federal law. \nIt is also illegal to attend one under State law in 49 States. This \nwill make Federal law similar to State law and will help Federal \nauthorities work with local government in sting operations, and that is \nwhat they normally do.\n  I ask support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been in contact with Senator \nMcConnell. We are making good progress here. The goal is to get down to \n10 votes. Once we get down to 10 votes, we will stop for the night. We \nshould be able to do that in the next hour or hour and half, give or \ntake a few minutes. I think the goal is reachable.\n  We will come in tomorrow. We have some important votes tomorrow. \nDon't forget that we have flood insurance. I hope we can move up the \nvote on cloture on flood insurance tomorrow. If not, we are going to \nhave to vote on it on Friday. We have done that in the past. We should \nbe able to do that. The goal is 10 votes left by the time we leave here \nthis evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Vitter \namendment?\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might, I am not sure if we have \nanyone in opposition. I rise in strong support of this amendment. We \nknow that there are Members who wanted the opportunity to vote and \nrecord a ``no'' vote. I hope that since we passed this by a voice vote \na bit ago, we will have an overwhelming affirmative vote for this \namendment. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment would require those who \nreceive crop insurance protection from the Federal Government to now \nfollow conservation compliance laws. Conservation compliance was \nenacted as part of the 1985 farm bill and has contributed almost \nsinglehandedly to almost three decades of progress in limiting erosion, \ncleaning up waterways, and protecting wetlands. For those of us who \nlove to fish and hunt, that has been of critical importance. No other \nprogram has done more for protecting our farmland and topsoil than \nconservation compliance.\n  In 1996 Congress exempted crop insurance from the conservation \nrequirement. Back then, the reason for doing so was to increase \nparticipation in the Crop Insurance Program. And that is exactly what \nwe have seen. We have seen premium subsidies increase by 500 percent.\n  The farm bill we are debating now will incentivize farmers to move \nfrom title I programs to crop insurance, and as a result soil and \nwetland conservation will not be a policy priority. And it should be. \nThis shift will likely adversely impact soil and conservation without \nthis amendment.\n  If crop insurance is going to be the preferred safety net for \nfarmers, then we also need to make sure the program does not \nincentivize farmers to eliminate the gains we have made in the last 25 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment of my friend and colleague.\n  The battle cry for conservation compliance requirements to be \nattached to crop insurance seems, strangely, to assume that \nconservation compliance is somehow eliminated in commodity programs in \nthis new bill. This is not true. Conservation compliance is attached to \nthe new farm revenue program in title I of the bill. Conservation \ncompliance is also attached to the marketing loan program.\n  To duplicate the same requirements in crop insurance is wasteful of \ngovernment resources, taxpayer dollars, and will cause a lot more \npaperwork. When your farmers find out you are wasting taxpayer dollars \nand are in charge of a duplicative effort and making them fill out more \npaperwork, you will have to hide in your office for 4 weeks. Do not \nhide in your office for 4 weeks. Vote no.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Amen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, in the years 1994 to 2003, the Congress \nappropriated over $36 billion in ad hoc or emergency assistance for \nfarmers and ranchers across this country above and beyond the normal \nfarm program payments. Let me say that again--$36 billion in a 10-year \nperiod between 1994 and 2003 above and beyond normal farm program \npayments.\n  Since the emergence of the Crop Insurance Program, we have seen those \ndisaster ad hoc emergency bills go away. The Crop Insurance Program is \nthe centerpiece of this farm policy. That is what this entire farm bill \nis built around. That is what farmers and producers in this country \nsaid they wanted.\n  There is going to be an amendment offered by our colleagues Senators \nDurbin and Coburn that would limit the availability of that to people \nwho have adjusted gross incomes under $750,000. What I would say to \nthat is that this amendment--the amendment I am offering--is not about \nthose who are making more than $750,000; it is about those who make \nless whose premiums would go up as a result of that change.\n  We need a good, strong Crop Insurance Program for the farmers in this \ncountry. That is what this farm bill is built upon. We should not take \nany chances with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a good farm bill. It eliminates \ndirect payments and a lot of subsidies. But there is one aspect of \nFederal subsidy in this bill that goes untouched; it is the Federal \nsubsidy from our Treasury to pay for the crop insurance premiums. \nSixty-two percent, the GAO tells us, of crop insurance premiums are \npaid for by taxpayers, which means those who are using crop insurance \nare relying on the Treasury.\n  So Senator Coburn and I, a political odd couple I will admit, said, \nfor at least those making over $750,000 a year, we are going to trim \nthe Federal subsidy by 15 percentage points. How many farmers would be \naffected by this nationwide--15,000 farmers out of 1.5 million.\n  The Thune amendment says: We cannot reduce this subsidy, even though \nit saves us $1 billion. We cannot reduce this subsidy--in his \nlanguage--if it adds any administrative expense. So if it costs $1 to \neven figure out who the 15,000 farmers are, no way we are going to save \n$1 billion.\n  Vote against the Thune amendment and then vote for Durbin-Coburn. \nVoting for both does not get the job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nrespond to the comments of the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

LIMITATION ON PREMIUM SUBSIDY BASED ON AVERAGE \n                   ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME.\n\n       Section 508(e) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1508(e)) (as amended by section 11023(b)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) Limitation on premium subsidy based on average \n     adjusted gross income.--\n       ``(A) Definition of average adjusted gross income.--In this \n     paragraph, the term `average adjusted gross income' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 1001D(a) of the Food \n     Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1308 3a(a)).\n       ``(B) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this subtitle and beginning with the 2014 reinsurance year, \n     in the case of any producer that is a person or legal entity \n     that has an average adjusted gross income in excess of \n     $750,000 based on the most recent data available from the \n     Farm Service Agency as of the beginning of the reinsurance \n     year, the total amount of premium subsidy provided with \n     respect to additional coverage under subsection (c), section \n     508B, or section 508C issued on behalf of the producer for a \n     reinsurance year shall be 15 percentage points less than the \n     premium subsidy provided in accordance with this subsection \n     that would otherwise be available for the applicable policy, \n     plan of insurance, and coverage level selected by the \n     producer.\n       ``(C) Application.--\n       ``(i) Study.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with \n     the Government Accountability Office, shall carry out a study \n     to determine the effects of the limitation described in \n     subparagraph (B) on--\n\n       ``(I) the overall operations of the Federal crop insurance \n     program;\n       ``(II) the number of producers participating in the Federal \n     crop insurance program;\n       ``(III) the level of coverage purchased by participating \n     producers;\n       ``(IV) the amount of premiums paid by participating \n     producers and the Federal Government;\n       ``(V) any potential liability for participating producers, \n     approved insurance providers, and the Federal Government;\n       ``(VI) different crops or growing regions;\n       ``(VII) program rating structures;\n       ``(VIII) creation of schemes or devices to evade the impact \n     of the limitation; and\n       ``(IX) administrative and operating expenses paid to \n     approved insurance providers and underwriting gains and loss \n     for the Federal government and approved insurance providers.\n\n       ``(ii) Effectiveness.--The limitation described in \n     subparagraph (B) shall not take effect unless the Secretary \n     determines, through the study described in clause (i), that \n     the limitation would not--\n\n       ``(I) significantly increase the premium amount paid by \n     producers with an average adjusted gross income of less than \n     $750,000;\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\n       ``(II) result in a decline in the crop insurance coverage \n     available to producers; and\n       ``(III) increase the total cost of the Federal crop \n     insurance program.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that both Senator \nDurbin and I have offered. It is not nearly as severe as the GAO's \nrecommendation for this program.\n  The very wealthiest of farmers, in terms of income in this country, \nare the people most likely to buy less crop insurance, not more. Yet we \nsubsidize them at the same rate as we do the middle-income and lower \nincome farmers.\n  This is straightforward. If you want to save $1 billion, if you want \nto tackle the debt, here is a way that will allow us to save $1 billion \nand not put anybody at risk. Highly capitalized farmers don't insure at \nthe same rate as lower capitalized farmers.\n  This will be the only program, if this amendment doesn't pass, that \ndoesn't have a payment limitation on it in terms of adjusted gross \nincome. So there should be no question we should do this just in terms \nof fairness of all the sacrifices we are going to ask everybody else in \nthis country to make in the coming years. This ought to be part of this \nfarm program.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, on behalf of Chairwoman Stabenow, myself, \nSenator Thune, and every farm organization and commodity group in \nAmerica, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It will impact every \nsingle producer in the program, not those that exceed this arbitrary \nlimit or ``rich producers.'' The rest will pay higher premiums when \nthey are out of the program because that is what happens with an \ninsurance pool.\n  I have no doubt, just as sure as I am standing here and the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is sitting there and contemplating this, that under this \namendment we will soon return to the days of low crop insurance \nparticipation, multibillion-dollar ad hoc disaster programs, just as in \nthe 1990s--$36 billion over 10 years, $11 billion in 1 year. These are \na disaster to plan, to legislate, and to implement.\n  If you are for these ad hoc disaster programs, you better hide for at \nleast 6 weeks in your office. We just passed two where you are hiding \nfor 2 and 4. Now you are going to have to hide in your office for 6 \nweeks. Don't hide in your office for 6 weeks. Vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 66, nays 33, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 157 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--66\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     DeMint\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Inouye\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Rubio\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--33\n\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sanders\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kirk\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2439) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have made a lot of progress on this \nlegislation. We are down to 10 or 11 amendments. We are going to come \nin tomorrow and finish this bill. We are going to try to get \npermission--I understand we can--to have a cloture vote tomorrow.\n  We have to figure out where we are going on flood insurance. It is \nobvious, with all the problems we are having with flood insurance, we \nare not going to finish that tomorrow or the next day; but we have to \nwork toward completing that as quickly as we can next week. Remember, \nthe program expires at the end of the month--and the end of the month \nis coming very quickly. We have two voice votes, but this will be the \nlast recorded vote. We will come in tomorrow and work through these. We \nwill have the staff work with the requests people have for time on the \nfloor and other things that need to be done.\n  We don't know exactly what time we are coming in tomorrow or what \ntime the votes will start, but as soon as we can. There will be votes \nall through the lunch hour. Everybody should understand that. We hope \nto be able to finish by 3 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2340\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I call up Chambliss amendment No. 2340.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for himself and \n     Mr. Isakson, propose an amendment numbered 2340.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To move the sugar import quota adjustment date forward in the \n                               crop year)\n\n       On page 69, strike line 15 and insert the following:\n       (2) Sugar import quota adjustment date.--Section 359k(b) of \n     the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1359kk(b)) \n     is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``April 1'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``February 1''; and\n       (B) by striking ``April 1'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``February 1''.\n       (3) Effective period.--Section 359l(a) of\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering has a very \nfocused and modest reform objective--specifically, to accelerate by 60 \ndays the date on which USDA may increase the import quota, if in the \nagency's judgment such action is needed to adequately supply the \nNation's demand for sugar.\n  The current farm bill prohibits the USDA from adjusting the minimum \nsugar quota imports until April 1 of the crop year unless there is an \nemergency shortage of sugar that is caused by war, flood, hurricane, or \nother natural disaster, or other similar event as determined by the \nSecretary.\n  Experience with the April 1 date has been very unsatisfactory to \nindependent domestic sugar refiners and their refined sugar customers \nwho have annually experienced shortfalls in the supply of sugar and \nendured the elevated prices that ensue from inadequacy of timely \nsupply. The April 1 date leaves precious little time in the balance of \nthe sugar crop year for USDA's complex bureaucratic process.\n  I ask support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask that we take this as a voice vote. \nWe have an agreement to proceed to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2340) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2432\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask that my amendment No. 2432 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2432.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To repeal mandatory funding for the farmers market and local \n food promotion program) In section 10003(7), strike subparagraph (A).\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this amendment simply strikes $20 \nmillion annually in mandatory funds from the Farmers Market Promotion \nProgram. The program will still retain its authorization for annual \nappropriations at $20 million per year.\n  I understand the important role that farmers markets play in \nconnecting consumers with the farmers who grow their food. However, \nthis is a grant program that should be funded with discretionary \nappropriations. We can't give every program in the farm bill mandatory \nmoney at a time of fiscal crisis.\n  The number of farmers markets in the United States has grown \nexponentially over the last 5 years. The Agriculture Marketing Service \nreports that in mid-2011, there were 7,175 farmers markets in the \nUnited States. This was a 17-percent increase over 2010.\n  This amendment will save the government $200 million over the next 10 \nyears while still allowing the program to retain its integrity. I ask \nfor consideration and for an affirmative vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. This \nrelates to a very important growth area in agriculture regarding \nfarmers markets. We now have farmers markets all across the country in \nevery community, providing the chance for local growers to come \ntogether, for families to receive healthy food and have access to local \nfood in their communities.\n  I know in Michigan for every $10 families spend at a farmers market \nwe have $40 million in economic activity--just in Michigan alone, for \n$10.\n  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2432) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first want to say thank you to all of \nour colleagues for their wonderful work today--and apologize. I think \nwhen I was speaking a moment ago I was not exactly clear, after \nnumerous hours on the floor. It is true that if a family spends $10 at \na farmers market, it generates economic activity in Michigan of $40 \nmillion--that is if every family in Michigan spent $10. I don't know if \nthat is any clearer, but I apologize. I think at the end of the day I \nwas not clear.\n  Before going to a unanimous consent request, I thank the leader--both \nour leaders for their patience and diligence and for supporting our \nefforts. We have had a long day. People have worked very hard. We are \nnear the end. We are going to have a farm bill. We are going to have \nmajor reform, $23 billion in deficit reduction. We are doing it \naltogether through a process where we propose amendments and vote on \namendments, and the Senate is operating in regular order. We appreciate \neverybody's hard work, hanging in there with us as we get this done, \nwhich we are on the path to do tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2202\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Bennet-Crapo amendment No. 2202 be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2202) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To improve agricultural land easements)\n\n       On page 205, line 4, insert ``by eligible entities'' after \n     ``purchase''.\n       On page 207, lines 10 and 11, strike ``contiguous acres'' \n     and insert ``areas''.\n       On page 208, line 24, insert ``if terms of the easement are \n     not enforced by the holder of the easement'' before the \n     semicolon at the end.\n\n                    Easement and Insect Infestation\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nthe farm bill we have on the floor, and to recognize chairwoman \nStabenow and ranking member Roberts for constructing a bill that passed \nthe Committee with strong, bipartisan support.\n  I would like to express my strong support for the bill's work on \nconservation including a reformed and stronger conservation title, and \na provision known as ``sodsaver'' that was authored by Senator Thune of \nSouth Dakota. I was a proud cosponsor of the provision when we marked \nup the bill in committee, and I am glad to see it in the package on the \nfloor.\n  I would also thank the Chair for including the Bennet-Crapo amendment \nregarding conservation easements in the consent agreement, and I look \nforward to the amendment's expected passage later today.\n  Finally, I hope to continue to work with the chair and ranking member \non two topics.\n  The first is easement policy. In my State of Colorado, easements are \nan important tool for protecting environmentally vital and valuable \ngrasslands. We did a lot of great work in committee to simplify this \nprogram and make it easier for the administration, partner entities, \nand landowners to use. One great thing S. 3240 does is provide a waiver \nfor grasslands of significance, making it easier for the Secretary to \nenter into agreements to conserve these areas. The west is experiencing \ngrassland loss, which impacts soil and water quality. Anything we can \ndo to make it easier to protect this land is needed.\n  The second issue centers on treating insect infestations in our \nnational forests. My State and others are experiencing epidemic levels \nof insect infestations causing unbelievable levels of tree mortality. I \nhave been working with Senator Bingaman, Senator Baucus, Senator Wyden, \nSenator Mark Udall and others to make sure we have the right policies \nin place to react to the situation.\n  It is my understanding that the chairwoman would be willing to work \nwith me on these important issues; is that correct?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator for his leadership as chairman of \nour conservation subcommittee. I have been glad to work with the \nSenator on this legislation and I am committed to continuing to work \nwith him on easement and forestry issues.\n\n\n                     Conservation Easement Program\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask permission to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senators from Michigan and Vermont, Senators Stabenow and \nLeahy. I wish to address a problem that affects many farmers and \nagricultural producers in States, including New Hampshire, with \nsignificant forest cover. Agricultural producers face tremendous \ndevelopment pressures as the value of land increases. As chairwoman of \nthe Agriculture Committee, I know Senator Stabenow has a great \nfamiliarity with this issue.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my friend, the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, for bringing attention to this important matter and for her \nincredible leadership on forestry issues. Since she was first sworn \ninto the Senate, we have worked together on forest conservation \nefforts, which are so important for the Granite State and the Great \nLakes State. As my friend knows, development and sprawl are certainly \npressuring our productive agricultural lands. One critical component of \nthe Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, the Agricultural \nConservation Easement Program, provides continued funding to allow \nfarmers and ranchers to voluntarily purchase easements on their land to \nkeep it in agricultural use.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I agree that easement programs are an essential part of \nthe effort to keep land available for agriculture. In New Hampshire, \nthe Farmland Protection Program has provided a crucial backstop against \ndevelopment pressures, but the program has not been as effective as it \ncan be. I know Senator Leahy helped to create the Farmland Protection \nProgram when he was chairman of the Agriculture Committee and his State \nhas used this program very effectively.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Like New Hampshire, Vermont is one of the most forested \nStates in the country. Even farms with a significant amount of open \nspace tend to have significant forested acreage and both are feeling \ntremendous development pressures. While many agricultural producers in \nmy state would like to purchase easements to keep\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\ntheir lands working, a 2008 Natural Resource Conservation Service rule \nprohibited the agency from protecting tracts with more than two-thirds \nof their acres under forest cover. This rule has hampered conservation \nefforts in Vermont. Has it had a similar effect in Michigan?\n  Ms. STABENOW. It has. Like New Hampshire and Vermont, Michigan is \nheavily forested and this NRCS rule has impacted the ability of \nagricultural producers to purchase on their working lands. I would like \nto clarify that it is not the intent of Congress to limit eligibility \nfor critical easement programs based on the forested acreage of \notherwise eligible land.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank my friend for making that critical \nclarification. Agricultural producers in New Hampshire and many other \nStates work primarily on small farms. They may actively use only a \nsmall number of their acres at any given time, and the rest of their \nparcels tend to be forested. We need to ensure that Federal programs \nare tailored to fit local conditions and doing away with restrictions \non forested land is an important part of making NRCS easement programs \nas effective as they can be.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I completely agree. We need to ensure that Federal \nprograms are carried out in a manner that ensures we keep as much \nagricultural land in working production as we possibly can. In Vermont, \nour forests are an important part of that agricultural landscape, \nespecially with our maple syrup producers who depend on these \nproductive and working forestlands. According to USDA, the Northeast \nand many other heavily forested regions of the country have experienced \nlong-term declines in cropland and forestland use as a result of urban \npressures.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is exactly right. Once rural land is developed it \nrarely reverts back to agricultural uses, which is why Federal programs \nare such a critical part of giving farmers alternatives to converting \ntheir land to nonagricultural uses. Our agricultural producers should \nbe able to access these tools regardless of the percentage of their \nland they keep forested.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I couldn't agree more. I thank the Senator from \nMichigan and the Senator from Vermont for engaging in this colloquy to \naddress the importance of allowing agricultural producers who own \nheavily forested tracts to access NRCS easement programs. This issue is \nof critical importance to farmers in New Hampshire, Michigan, and many \nother States.\n\n\n                       Multi-year Price Declines\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my \ngood friends and colleagues the Senator from Michigan and Chair of the \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow, and the Chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus from Montana.\n  The Senate has been working the past few weeks to get an agreement to \nmove forward and complete our work on the Farm Bill. The Senate \nAgriculture Committee passed a strong bipartisan bill out of the \ncommittee under the strong leadership of Senator Stabenow.\n  The Farm Bill is a reform bill which cuts federal spending by $23 \nbillion. This is a rare example, this Congress, of Senators working \nacross the aisle to pass a bill which helps to expand our markets \nabroad, keep food on the table for working families, and ensure our \nconservation dollars are funding projects to protect the land for years \nto come.\n  With all of the changes in the farm bill the largest changes have \nbeen made to the Commodity Title of the Farm Bill.\n  Congress has eliminated direct payments for a market-based safety net \nwhich will pay producers when they actually experience a loss, known as \nthe Agricultural Risk Coverage program. As direct payments are \neliminated in this farm bill, how does the bill protect producers \nagainst multi-year price declines?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with my good friend, the majority leader, that \nthis farm bill is a reform bill. And I would like to answer your \nquestions about how it addresses--or struggles to address--multi-year \nprice declines.\n  I worked very closely with Chairwoman Stabenow, through the Senate \nAgriculture Committee markup this spring, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Conrad and Hoeven, to ensure the Agricultural Risk Coverage \nprogram worked for farmers in the Northern Great Plaines--not just the \nMidwest.\n  I commend the Chairwoman for working with me through that markup, and \nsupporting my amendment which improved the farm level coverage option \nand her commitment for continued work to improve the bill for grain \nfarmers in my home State of Montana.\n  One of the lingering questions is what happens to the Agricultural \nRisk Coverage program should we have a few years of consecutive price \ncollapses in the market. I agree that the Agricultural Risk Program \nshould follow market signals, and I commend this bill for doing just \nthat. But when the market fails, there has to be a failsafe to prevent \nour farm policy from driving off a cliff--taking jobs and food security \nwith it.\n  So although the bill is a step forward in creating a market-oriented \nsafety net, it does not provide optimal protection for multi-year price \ndeclines. I filed an amendment which would have added price protection \nshould we have multi-year price declines while ensuring it does not \ndistort the marketplace.\n  This is a remaining concern I have with the Agricultural Risk \nCoverage program and I ask the majority leader and Chairwoman Stabenow \nfor the continued commitment to ensure any agreement which comes out of \na conference report with the House addresses this weakness in the \nAgricultural Risk Coverage program.\n  Mr. REID. I thank Senator Baucus. I look forward to working with the \nSenator to ensure any final measure on the farm bill will address the \nSenators remaining concerns on multi-year price declines. It is vital \nto our farmers across the country that their safety net is not actually \na rug that can be pulled out from underneath them.\n  Ms. STABENOW: I thank the majority leader and Senator Baucus for \ntheir continued work and advocacy for ensuring the farm bill works for \nparts of the country and all commodities.\n  Through the committee process, Senator Baucus has been true a leader \nto improve the Agricultural Risk Coverage program so it offers an \nadequate safety net to all farmers.\n  I think we have made great strides through the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee markup in April but I understand that is the beginning of the \nprocess and not the end.\n  I believe the amendment Senator Baucus filed is thoughtful and would \nprovide the Agricultural Risk Coverage program with an additional layer \nof protection from several years of steep price declines. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleague from Montana to ensure as the \nprocess moves forward Senator Baucus has my full support to address \nthis issue in conference and include a market-based solution to multi-\nyear price declines.\n  The farm bill supports over 16 million jobs nationwide. The farm bill \nis the truest jobs bill Congress has considered in the 112th Congress. \nAs Senator Baucus said, we need to guarantee that our farmer's safety-\nnetworks for every farmer and rancher in America.\n\n\n                           vote explanations\n\n  Ms. McCASKILL. Mr. President, Senator Nelson of Nebraska's amendment \nNo. 2242 to S. 3240 passed the Senate today by voice vote. I was not in \nthe Senate chamber at the time the voice vote on the amendment was \ntaken. Had I been present or had the amendment been subject to a roll \ncall vote, I would have voted ``present.''\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote on \namendment No. 2457 I would have opposed it. This amendment creates new \nand unnecessary reporting requirements that will burden rural broadband \ncompanies and could slow down the growth of broadband expansion in \nstates like Montana.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I believe we are waiting on another \npossibility of an agreement on amendments that may come tomorrow. But \nat this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, if I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n5 minutes to introduce a bill, not anything related to the farm bill, \nis that appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, first let me say thank you to the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Kansas for conducting \nanother very long session today on agriculture. They did an \nextraordinary job helping us move through this important bill. I thank \nthem very much, and I know we are going to take that up tomorrow.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3321 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I stood in this Chamber \nand joined with Senator McCain calling for the appointment of a Special \nCounsel to investigate the recent series of leaks of classified \ninformation that are so damaging to our national security. Despite the \nbipartisan support for a Special Counsel, the Attorney General chose \ninstead to appoint 2 United States Attorneys who will act under his \nsupervision and conduct separate investigations of just two of these \nleaks.\n  I believe the American people, our Intelligence Community, and our \nallies deserve a better response from the Attorney General and from \nthis Administration. These leaks have violated the public trust and \npotentially damaged vital liaison relationships we can ill afford to \nlose in our fight against ongoing threats from terrorism and hostile \nnations.\n  As I understand it, one prosecutor will investigate the leak on the \nAQAP bomb plot; the other, the leak on STUXNET. That's a real problem. \nThis means other leaks, including the ``kill list'' story, will not be \ninvestigated. Yesterday, the Washington Post published a story that \nattributed information about apparent joint U.S.-Israeli cyber efforts \nto a former high-ranking U.S. intelligence official. It would sure be \nhelpful if a Special Counsel had jurisdiction to look at all of these \ncases.\n  The timing, substance, and sourcing of these stories have also raised \nquestions about whether they came from the White House and whether \nthere is a pattern of leaks. It's hard to imagine how two U.S. \nAttorneys who work for this administration will be able to investigate \nthis aspect of the case without being perceived as biased by those who \nare unhappy with what they ultimately find. We need a Special Counsel \nwho will be trusted, no matter what he finds.\n  I am not questioning in any way the qualifications of these U.S. \nAttorneys to do the jobs for which they were confirmed by this Senate. \nI know questions have been raised about the prior political activities \nof the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and whether he might \nbe too deferential to the White House. I have no specific reason to \nquestion the capabilities or integrity of either of these men. But the \nvery serious nature of these leaks demands an investigation that is \nconducted in a manner totally above reproach and without any possible \ninference of bias.\n  Unfortunately, because these U.S. Attorneys must answer to the \nAttorney General, they cannot conduct independent investigations. With \neach key decision they make--whether to subpoena a journalist, what \ninvestigative techniques should be used, what charges can be brought--\nthey will be subject to the Attorney General and his direction. That is \nhardly independent.\n  Last week, the Attorney General testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that appointing a U.S. Attorney was the same thing that was \ndone in the Valerie Plame case. I submit that was an entirely different \nscenario because in that case, Mr. Fitzgerald, who was a special \ncounsel appointed, insisted on getting written confirmation that he \nwould be truly independent from the then-acting Attorney General. He \ngot that confirmation in writing from then-Acting Attorney General \nComey.\n\n  Significantly, the Plame case involved a single leak of classified \ninformation, and was deemed serious enough to warrant an independent \ninvestigation. The former President also ordered his staff to come \nforward with any information they had about the source of the leak.\n  In this case, there have been a series of incredibly damaging leaks \nin articles citing ``senior Administration officials'' and White House \n``aides.'' We have seen no clear instructions from this Administration \nfor officials to come forward. This situation seems to create a greater \nappearance of a conflict of interest for the Attorney General than was \npresented in the Plame investigation and calls out for the appointment \nof Special Counsel.\n  The Attorney General also testified that he could always appoint \nthese U.S. Attorneys as Special Counsel if they needed to investigate \nacts outside their jurisdictions. Others have made the argument that we \nhave to wait to see if these U.S. Attorneys do their jobs well before \nappointing a Special Counsel. Neither argument makes sense to me. Why \non earth would we wait?\n  All of these leaks should be investigated together--not separately--\nand they must be investigated now. The leaks are relatively recent and \nthe trail is still somewhat fresh. But if we have to wait to see how \nthese men measure up, or if the trail takes us to a district outside \ntheir specific jurisdiction, we run the risk of losing evidence or \nmemories fading. Those aren't risks anyone should be willing to take.\n  This is not, and must not become, political. It's about finding these \ncriminals who have jeopardized our national security and ensuring that \nthey are brought to justice in an independent, objective, apolitical \ninvestigation.\n  Again, I call on the Attorney General to do now what should have been \ndone 2 weeks ago. This series of leaks should not be treated as \nbusiness as usual. As Congress considers legislative solutions to put a \nstop to these leaks, the administration needs to step up its response. \nAppointing a special counsel who can independently and comprehensively \ninvestigate all of these leaks and find who is responsible for any and \nall of them is the best way to restore the public trust in our \ngovernment and our government officials.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4359-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4359-S4360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHILD NUTRITION\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, for many Ohio children, schools \nhave let out for the year, and summer vacation is just beginning. \nDuring the school year, in my State--a State of about 11 million \npeople--840,000 Ohio children receive some nutrition assistance through \nfree or reduced-price school lunches or breakfasts during the school \nyear. It is a statistic that tells the story of families struggling to \nget by. In many of these children's cases their parents have jobs but \nsimply are not making enough money. It is a statistic that tells a \nstory of how children are often helpless victims in a challenging \neconomy. Many of these children come from the 18 percent of Ohio \nfamilies--about 1 out of 6--who are food insecure. Essentially it means \nthey are unsure where their next meal may actually come from. When the \nschool year comes to a close, many of these children go hungry.\n  Where can these 840,000 students go? Where do they turn for \nnutritious meals when their school cafeterias are closed for the \nsummer? The answer is the Summer Food Service Program run through the \nU.S. Department of Education and administered in my State by the Ohio \nDepartment of Education. For Ohio parents and guardians and school \nadministrators, the Summer Food Service Program is available for them \nto find healthy meals for children during the summer. But too many Ohio \nfamilies don't know about this critical program, and that is why it is \nso important to raise awareness and increase access to the program for \nall Ohio children regardless of where they live. Summer break shouldn't \nmean a break from good nutrition.\n  At the beginning of this talk, I mentioned that 840,000 Ohio children \nbenefit from free and reduced school breakfast and lunch programs--\n840,000. But, unfortunately, last year in the\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\nsummer only 66,000 Ohio children utilized the Summer Food Service \nProgram. Only 66,000 when there are 800,000 eligible. I believe last \nyear Ohio was slightly above the national average. So in State after \nState, of those students who were benefiting from the free and reduced-\nprice breakfasts and lunches at the school, less than 10 percent of \nthose children benefit in the summer.\n  In Ohio, only 66,000 children utilize this program. Obviously \nhundreds of thousands need to receive nutrition assistance during the \nschool year. Ensuring that our children have access to healthy food \nduring the summer is so important, especially as more families slip \ninto poverty. The Summer Food Program is a vital program that helps \nstem the crippling cycle of food insecurity by providing school-aged \nchildren breakfast, lunch, or a snack during the summer.\n  In some sites children can receive these meals while participating in \neducational activities or organized games. The Presiding Officer was a \nsuperintendent of one of the great school districts in the country. We \nknow particularly how low-income students during summer months slide \nback in their educational attainment. In the beginning of the school \nyear, the teachers have to sort of reteach what was taught perhaps in \nApril and May. We also know that in families with a little higher \nincome, the children often have activities in the summer which include \nexposure to books, magazines, vacations, and cultural events to help \nthose children continue to advance in the summer.\n  Many of these students who are not getting proper nutrition in the \nsummer also are not getting the educational challenges they need. That \nis why at these sites children--while they receive these meals--\nparticipate in educational activities or organized games. The good news \nis there are more sites this year for Ohio families to turn to. There \nare more than 1,700 sites across 77 counties.\n  Nonetheless, 11 counties out of the 88 in Ohio still lack feeding \nsites. It is not too late for program sites to be established. The \nofficial deadline was May 31. Interested sponsors and volunteers can \nstill work with the Ohio Department of Education to establish new \ncenters for children to get meals.\n  Understand the difficulty here. Somebody needs to step forward, such \nas a teacher, an administrator, someone in the school district, someone \nin a church, someone in a recreation center of some type has to step \nforward every May or June and set up one of these programs and take it \ndown again in August or September. So it is unlike the school district \nwhich has this built into its process.\n  At existing sites, such as schools, summer camps, churches, community \ncenters, and recreation centers, volunteers spend their time ensuring \nour children have the food they need to succeed.\n  The Federal Government will reimburse local groups small amounts of \nmoney for the breakfast, snack, or lunch for these children, but \nvolunteers need to come forward.\n  Two years ago I co-hosted a first-of-its-kind hunger summit at the \nMid-Ohio Foodbank in Columbus with leading antihunger advocates across \nOhio. This past year the USDA Under Secretary Kevin Concannon came to \nOhio to hold the second summit.\n  We continue to reach out to organizations such as the AmeriCorps and \nVISTA Summer Association Partnership that can help with volunteers \nthrough AmeriCorps and can set up the programs and provide meals to the \nchildren in need.\n  This summer will be an important few months to learn how far we have \ncome and how far we have to go in serving our State's children. \nOutreach and public awareness are critical components to ensure that \nthe end of the school year doesn't mean the end of children getting the \nnutrition they need for the summer.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before going into wrap-up and the \nunanimous consent requests this evening, I wish to say one more time \nhow appreciative I am of everybody's hard work and patience with us. We \nmade tremendous progress on a very important bill that helps 16 million \npeople in this country have a job and keeps the safest, most affordable \nfood system in the world going. So thanks to everyone.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a group of \nKentucky's brightest students who, by winning a number of prestigious \nawards for studying history, have proven themselves to be the leaders \nof the future. I am referring to the Kentucky winners of the National \nHistory Day 2012 contest, which was recently held at nearby College \nPark, MD, June 10 to 14.\n  The contingent of students from Kentucky that made the trip was \nselected by the Kentucky Junior Historical Society, which held a \nstatewide history contest in Frankfort, the State capital, last April. \nAt that event, 68 Kentucky students qualified for the national finals.\n  In all, 62 Kentucky students from the 6th through 12th grades made \nthe trip to our Nation's capital region, accompanied by about 40 family \nmembers and teachers. I was very pleased to have a chance to visit with \nthem during their trip.\n  The group faced stiff competition. At National History Day 2012, \nthere were 2,800 students competing, representing all 50 States and \nfour international schools. Six Kentucky students stood out from their \npeers and garnered nationwide recognition for their history projects. \nThose students are:\n  Joanna Slusarewicz, of Winburn Middle School and Fayette County, \nwinner of the Salute to Freedom Award and third place, individual \ndocumentary, junior division. Her entry was titled ``Respectfully \nSubmitted, Dorothea Dix.''\n  Neha Kadambi and Jamie Smith, of Winburn Middle School and Fayette \nCounty, winners of the Leadership in History Award for group exhibit, \njunior division. Their entry was titled ``The Fight Without a War: \nIndia's Revolutionary Road to Independence.''\n  Meenakshi Singhal and Daryn Smith, of Winburn Middle School and \nFayette County, winners of Best of State: Junior Division. Their entry \nwas titled ``Charles Darwin: What Do You Mean Survival of the \nFittest?''\n  Emma Roach-Barrette, of Menifee County High School and Menifee \nCounty, winner of Best of State: Senior Division and individual \ndocumentary, senior division finalist. Her entry was titled ``Dead Men \nDo Tell Tales.''\n  Every student from Kentucky who made this trip can be immensely proud \nof his or her accomplishments, and I hope they will continue to engage \nin the study of history for the remainder of their time in school and \nbeyond. History plays such a large role in the events of today. We \ncontinue to be influenced by historic decisions made in this very \nChamber.\n  I also appreciate these students' teachers for helping to foster \ntheir love of history, specifically, Theresa Buczek and Michelle Cason \nof Winburn Middle School and Debra Craver of Menifee County High \nSchool. And I want to thank the Kentucky Junior Historical Society and \nits parent body, the Kentucky Historical Society, for sponsoring this \ncompetition and making the trip possible for these students. \nEstablished in 1836, the Kentucky Historical Society is committed to \nhelping Kentuckians understand, cherish, and share history.\n  I know my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in recognizing the \naccomplishments of Kentucky's winners of the National History Day 2012 \ncontest and of every Kentucky student who competed.\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\nWe wish them well in their future studies and are proud they represent \nthe Bluegrass State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4361-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Frances \nWilliams Preston, a trailblazing businesswoman, a dedicated \nhumanitarian, a mother, a grandmother, a great-grandmother, and a \nfriend. I was saddened when she passed away on June 13.\n  Frances began her career as a receptionist at a radio station in \nNashville, TN. She quickly moved up within the music community, and in \n1958 she was hired to open a regional office for Broadcast Music Inc., \nBMI, in Nashville, representing songwriters and composers. Glass \nceilings had no chance at constraining Frances. In 1964, she became \nVice President of BMI, reportedly making her the first woman corporate \nexecutive in Tennessee. In 1986, she became CEO and remained CEO of BMI \nuntil 2004.\n  Her work at BMI transformed not only the company, but also the \nhundreds of thousands of songwriters and composers BMI represents. She \ntripled the revenues at BMI and advocated for strong copyright \nprotections to benefit artists. BMI under her tenure also helped the \ncity of Nashville to blossom into the leading center for songwriters \nand the arts that it is today.\n  Frances's dedication to the songwriters and her industry, and her \npassion for ensuring they could make a living in their chosen \nprofession, was unrivaled. Kris Kristofferson famously dubbed her the \n``songwriter's guardian angel.''\n  I worked closely with Frances and the songwriting community to ensure \nthat the rights of composers are protected, but I will remember her \nmost for her humanitarian efforts. She was president of the T.J. \nMartell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS research, and her name \nprecedes the research laboratories at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer \nCenter.\n  I could go on at length about the various music and humanitarian \nawards and honors Frances has received, from being inducted into the \nCountry Music Hall of Fame in 1992 to twice receiving the Humanitarian \nAward from the International Achievement in Arts.\n  The current president of BMI probably best captured her essence by \nsimply describing Frances as ``a force of nature.'' She will be missed \nby those who knew her, and remembered always by those whom she nurtured \nas songwriters and composers.\n  The music industry has lost a legend and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Wall Street Journal article ``From Receptionist to Music-Royalty \nGuarantor'' by Stephen Miller be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 14, 2012]\n\n              From Receptionist to Music-Royalty Guarantor\n\n                          (By Stephen Miller)\n\n       Frances Preston rose from radio-station receptionist to \n     chief executive of Broadcast Music Inc., a performing-rights \n     group that helps guarantee that songwriters and music \n     publishers get paid when their songs are played on the radio \n     or in places like restaurants.\n       Ms. Preston, who died Wednesday at the age of 83, founded \n     BMI's Nashville, Tenn., office and signed up thousands of \n     artists, many of whose careers she shepherded personally.\n       The deals she struck helped nurture country, rock 'n' roll \n     and jazz, emerging genres that the American Society of \n     Composers, Authors and Publishers, BMI's older rival, had \n     neglected in favor of traditional pop music.\n       By the time Ms. Preston retired in 2004, BMI represented \n     300,000 music composers and copyright owners and disbursed \n     more than a half-billion dollars to them annually.\n       ``They never paid royalties to the songwriters for \n     performances until Frances Preston came along,'' country star \n     Eddy Arnold told The Wall Street Journal in 2004. ``She put \n     the hammer on!''\n       ``A lot of them didn't realize that they could get paid for \n     having their music played,'' Ms. Preston told Amusement \n     Business magazine in 1991. She built a fanatical following \n     among Nashville's performing elite.\n       Singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson, whom Ms. Preston \n     signed to a $1 million songwriting deal in the 1970s, once \n     called her ``our guardian angel.''\n       Raised in Nashville, Ms. Preston studied at George Peabody \n     College for Teachers. But shortly before taking a classroom \n     job, she went to work at WSM, the radio home of the Grand Ole \n     Opry, where her duties included answering Hank Williams's \n     mail. She moved on to running the station's promotions \n     department and got to know the country stars of the era.\n       In 1958, she founded BMI's Nashville office--at first in \n     her parents' garage. A few years later she opened a new \n     office on fledgling Music Row. Thanks in part to BMI's \n     presence, it soon became the home to recording studios and \n     music publishers and the hub of the Nashville country scene.\n       Ms. Preston moved to BMI's home office in New York City, \n     where she became chief executive in 1986. She oversaw the \n     transition to the digital age as complex new media like the \n     Internet and ringtones joined radio and television as major \n     sources of revenue. She also lobbied Congress as copyright \n     laws were changed.\n       ``It's a constant fight to educate those people [that] \n     music is not just out there in the air for you to pick out \n     for free, because if the creator isn't compensated, there's \n     not going to be that music,'' she told Billboard in 2004.\n       Ms. Preston was lionized in Nashville, where she was a \n     glamorous personification of the business side of the music \n     industry. When she was inducted into the Country Music Hall \n     of Fame in 1992, it dubbed her ``the most influential \n     country-music executive of her generation.''\n       Always one to keep things in sensible perspective, Ms. \n     Preston was proud to be remembered as the author of a \n     Nashville motto: ``It all begins with a song.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4361-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4361-S4362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING HOUSE OF HEROES\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize the \nimportant work of House of Heroes--a growing organization that honors \nveterans with dignity, gratitude, and an improved quality of life.\n  Over Memorial Day weekend, I had the great opportunity to witness the \nConnecticut chapter of House of Heroes' first projects as it fixed, \nrenovated, and remodeled the homes of three of our country's most \ndeserving veterans.

Frequently, our courageous veterans are \nunable to maintain their homes due to physical disability or financial \nlimitations.\n  During their inaugural build, the founders and volunteers of \nConnecticut's House of Heroes chose to honor three Americans, who have \ncontinued to dedicate their lives to serving our country and preparing \nfor our future even after their war service. Frederick Joseph Miller \nserved as a Sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II--\nand in 1945, searched the legendary crash of Flight 19 in the \nEverglades. Upon leaving the service, he dedicated his talent and \nskills to Pratt & Whitney as an equipment and facilities engineer. On \nMemorial Day in 1991, Miller's wife passed away from cancer, and \nmaintaining his Hamden house has been a challenge.\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\n  Private First Class Maura Rettman of Meriden served in Germany \nbetween 1977 and 1979 where she suffered a life-altering car accident. \nNow, she takes care of her grandson with the hope that he can have a \nbedroom of his own. Sergeant Rudolph Pistey of Stratford served in the \nArmy National Guard during World War II. Now, at 93, he is well-known \nin his community, always ready to lend a hand or shoot a smile to his \nneighbors.\n  Since 2000, House of Heroes has spread influence and awareness from \nits founding chapter in Columbus, GA, across the country. In \nConnecticut, cofounders are Steve Cavanaugh of Biltmore Construction \nand Billy May, a U.S. Army Veteran, Black Hawk test pilot, and business \ndevelopment and strategy leader at Signature Brand Factory. They seek \nto complete 10 projects in 2012 and to double this number each \nsubsequent year. Both Mr. Cavanaugh and Lieutenant Colonel May bring \nexperience, skill, and dedication to House of Heroes. Their hope is \nthat general contractors and subcontractors across the state and \ncountry will donate several hours a week to helping our Nation's \nveterans.\n  Amidst the sound of repairs, there were tears in all our eyes when \nthe veterans were serenaded by Nashville singer and songwriter, Tim \nMaggart. The song--both solemn and celebratory with spiritual music and \ngrounded lyrics--conveyed eloquently the emotion of everyone gathered:\n\n       You were young, scared Willing to go anywhere/ When your \n     country called, you stood tall\n       You came home, scarred/Didn't think it would be so hard, \n     You don't like to talk about what you saw/ Beyond what I can \n     comprehend/ The sacrifice of the women and men who gave so \n     much without applause/ I don't know you and you don't know \n     me, but thanks to you, I wake up safe and free/I hope you \n     never feel forgotten, because\n       Chorus: You've got a home, in the house of heroes/ Your \n     name will live on in the house of heroes/I want to honor you/ \n     it's been long overdue/You're right where you belong in the \n     house of heroes\n       In a world, where Life's not always fair/ And sometimes we \n     have to fight for what we believe\n       There's a price, paid I can't help be amazed /By the brave \n     who gave their all for you and me.\n\n  At each House of Heroes project, the spirit of volunteerism, \npatriotism, and human connection was unwavering. As the tremendous \nenergy of the House of Heroes' Connecticut chapter spreads across the \ncountry, this theme song will be an anthem for a national movement that \ntouches the lives of one veteran at a time.\n  The volunteers and donors of House of Heroes convey a tremendous \nspirit--America's boundless appreciation and spirit. Through this great \nwork, and its anthem, we show our veterans-- who fought for our \nsecurity--that America will join together to pay back our debt of \ngratitude by helping our veterans feel secure and safe.\n  Appreciative but slightly uncomfortable receiving rather than giving, \nthese men and women were shown by House of Heroes how much we treasure \nand owe them as a Nation. Donning House of Heroes t-shirts and bobbing \nalong to the music, fellow veterans and citizens showed their thanks--a \nfitting spirit now and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4362-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE HARTFORD FOUNDATION FOR PUBLIC GIVING\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate the \nHartford Foundation for Public Giving, which was awarded the 2012 \nBronze Award by the Council on Foundations this past Spring as part of \ntheir Wilmer Shields Rich Awards Program. Every year, the Council on \nFoundations recognizes foundations around the country that have engaged \nin strategic communications strategies and innovative projects that \ninspire and inform other grantmakers.\n  Since 1925, the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving has been a \nthriving philanthropic institution where Connecticut nonprofit \norganizations can seek financial support and connect with givers \nthroughout the State. This highly professional, industrious, and \ndynamic institution singularly impacts the Capitol Region of \nConnecticut, having granted $532 million since its beginning to address \ncommunity needs. It fosters partnerships, assists nonprofits in \ndeveloping their long-term plans and funding strategies, and hosts \ninformational forums for the sharing of fresh perspectives. The \nFoundation is unique in its broad and diverse support for the Greater \nHartford area, showcasing families on their website, who invite others \nto join them, advising ``We're not the Rockefellers. We're just a \nnormal family . . . willing to take this step.''\n  The Council on Foundations recognized the Hartford Foundation for \nPublic Giving specifically for its 2010 Annual Report, Creating \nBrighter Futures, which focused on the Foundation's efforts towards \neffective childhood development and education through its Brighter \nFutures Initiative. The great success of the Brighter Future Initiative \nhas strengthened existing early education programs as well as inspired \nthe development of innovative strategies around the country. In the \nreport's introductory letter, President and Chief Executive Officer \nLindy Kelly eloquently shares the groundbreaking changes she has \nwitnessed in our Hartford-area schools. She tells the story of \nLavarey--then a second-grader at Rawson School at risk for illiteracy. \nThrough the Hartford Haskins Literary Initiative, he learned to read \nwith joy. Ms. Kelly writes of her memory of Lavarey on stage during \ntheir annual Celebration of Giving ceremony, waving confidently at the \n400-member audience, who in turn, mirrored Lavarey's happiness, proud \nto be part of the journey of a young boy who will soon become a \ncontributing member of their community.\n  The Hartford Foundation's 2010 Annual Report--a large, comprehensive \ndocument that expertly weaves stories, accomplishments, and \nstatistics--reflects the rich tapestry of the Hartford Foundation for \nPublic Giving. By seamlessly inviting families, all levels of \ngovernment, schools, nonprofit organizations, professional advisors, \nvolunteers, and donors to join their mission for change, they evoke and \nprovoke humanitarianism and patriotism.\n  I invite my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nHartford Foundation for Public Giving for bringing hope and help to \nConnecticut's institutions, programs, and citizens that need it the \nmost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4362-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4362-S4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR.

Dr. Bell \nwill be retiring as president of Tennessee Technological University at \nthe end of this month and has served the university for 36 years.\n  He has served as president of Tennessee Tech since 2000, and before \nbecoming the university's president, he served as both a professor and \ndean of the College of Business.\n  During his time at Tennessee Tech, Dr. Bell has fostered both an \nincrease in student enrollment and university recognition, while \nensuring that student education remained affordable.\n  His contributions to Tennessee extend beyond the university level. He \nhas served as a member of the board of directors for the Tennessee \nCenter for Performance Excellence since 1993 and chairs the Cookeville \nIndustrial Development Board. He is also a proud member of the \nexecutive committee of the Middle Tennessee Boy Scouts of America, an \norganization dedicated to helping young men achieve their potential.\n  I want to add my appreciation for his years of service to Tennessee \nTech and wish him well in his retirement.\n  I ask to have the following resolution printed in the Record.\n  The resolution follows.\n\n A Resolution of Appreciation for the Service of Dr. Robert R. Bell to \n                     the Tennessee Board of Regents\n\n       Whereas, Dr. Robert R. Bell has thirty-six years of service \n     with the Tennessee Board of Regents system and Tennessee Tech \n     University, serving as a professor in TTU's College of \n     Business, then as dean, then as President of the University \n     since 2000,\n       Whereas, as President of TTU, he oversaw 12 straight years \n     of enrollment growth, with TTU's enrollment approaching \n     12,000,\n       Whereas, he chaired a TBR Vision of Teaching Excellence \n     committee in 2004 to establish future teaching standards and \n     led his University to develop and expand extended education, \n     distance learning and virtual classrooms,\n       Whereas, he supported the Regents Online Degree Program and \n     championed degree innovations at TTU to increase access to \n     education and to respond to industry needs in order to \n     improve the education and economic progress in the state,\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\n       Whereas, as President he set his sights on a program to \n     prepare the state's teachers, from Pre-K to college levels, \n     to teach science, technology, engineering and mathematics by \n     establishing The Millard Oakley STEM Center and providing it \n     a state-of-the-art home in the new 26,000-square-foot Ray \n     Morris Hall in 2010,\n       Whereas, he recognized the need for a nursing school in \n     rural Tennessee and garnered support from the state \n     legislature, U.S. Congress and private and corporate donors \n     to fund the construction of a multi-million dollar Nursing \n     and Health Services Building,\n       Whereas, he kept his promise as President to upgrade \n     facilities to increase recruitment and retention and oversaw \n     the construction and completion of two residence halls--New \n     Hall South and New Hall North,\n       Whereas, under his guidance TTU established Learning \n     Villages, which aim to bring students and faculty together \n     around a common interest and bridge the gap between the \n     living and learning segments of campus and to encourage \n     college completion,\n       Whereas, the University's endowment has doubled during \n     Bell's presidency to nearly $60 million,\n       Whereas, under his leadership in a difficult economic \n     environment, TTU has remained affordable. Students graduate \n     with the lightest debt load in the region, according to U.S. \n     News & World Report, and sixty percent of 2010 TTU graduates \n     left school debt free,\n       Whereas, the Tennessee Board of Regents grants President \n     Emeritus status to Dr. Robert R. Bell for his continued \n     support of the system, now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved That the Tennessee Board of Regents expresses its \n     sincere appreciation to Dr. Robert R.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \ndedicated public servant and true leader in Nebraska politics, Gov. \nNorbert Tiemann, whose recent death saddened all who knew him. Gov. \nNorbert Tiemann, or ``Nobby,'' as he was affectionately known, served \nas Governor of Nebraska from 1967 to 1971. It is a privilege to take \nthis opportunity to remember the life of Governor Tiemann and his many \ncontributions to our State and Nation.\n  Prior to being elected Governor, Tiemann served three terms as mayor \nof Wausa in northeast Nebraska. He would later serve as Federal Highway \nAdministrator for the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Nixon \nand Ford administrations. Ever service-oriented, Tiemann's public \nservice extended well beyond elected office. He bravely fought in World \nWar II and was later stationed in Korea.\n  Tiemann had an incredible passion for governing and played an active \nrole in the lawmaking process. His leadership as Governor left a \nlasting impact on our great State. Scholars consider him to be among \nthe most influential Nebraska Governors for transforming the \ngovernorship in our State from its traditional caretaker role to one \nthat led public policy discussions.\n  As we look back on Tiemann's legacy, we will remember a dedicated \npublic servant who cared deeply about Nebraska. I could not be more \ngrateful for his lifetime of service and, on behalf of all Nebraskans, \noffer my sincerest condolences to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4363-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4363-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4363-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 10:16 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 404.

Mr. President, our daughters' futures will be as bright \nas our sons'. That is the American promise. It is the American ideal--\nthat one's opportunity to prosper--one's economic security--depends not \non one's gender but instead on one's work ethic--one's character--one's \nGod-given talents.\n  That men and women will be treated equally in America is a promise \nthat was a made by Susan B. Anthony, who dedicated her life to women's \nsuffrage and who famously said, shortly before her passing, that \n``failure is impossible.'' History proved her right: 15\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\nyears later, women finally were given access to the ballot.\n  That men and women will be treated equally in America is a promise \nthat was made a generation later, by thousands of women who--under the \nbanner of Rosie the Riveter--took to the factories and carried our \nnational economy through a period of world war.\n  That men and women will be treated equally in America is a promise \nthat was made by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who, in 1960, was passed over for \na Supreme Court clerkship because she was a woman. Undeterred, she went \non to start the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU, a platform from \nwhich she argued several landmark cases. In 1993, she was selected to \nserve as a justice on the very court that, years before, turned her \naway.\n  That men and women will be treated equally in America is a promise \nthat is made today--by women like Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator \nPatty Murray and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro--women who have settled not \nfor a mere presence in the halls of Congress but who instead have \nbecome among its most influential leaders.\n  Generations of women have rejected inferiority. Because of these \npioneers, the promise of gender equality in America has become more \nthan just a promise. It has become our law. It is enshrined in the \ndocuments by which we are governed.\n  This week, we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Title 9, a statute \nthat guarantees equal educational opportunities for boys and girls--for \nmen and women. In just a couple of years, we will mark the 50th \nanniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a landmark legislative \nachievement that codified our national commitment to ending \ndiscrimination in the workplace.\n  So, yes, in America we have made a promise that one's gender will not \nbe the deciding factor between having opportunities and being denied \nopportunities--between getting a job and being denied one--between \ngetting a promotion and being denied one. We have made that promise. \nAnd we've come a long way toward fulfilling it.\n  But we are not there yet. Even though women have been working outside \nthe home for generations, they continue to face barriers in the \nworkplace: Even though about half of all workers are women, only 12 \nFortune 500 companies have female CEOs. The Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission reports that, in 2011, it received nearly \n100,000 complaints of discrimination. Statistics show that women still \nreceive unequal pay for equal work.\n  Although this week marks the 40th anniversary of Title 9, it also \nmarks the one year anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Wal-\nMart v. Dukes, a decision that has had an enormous impact on workplace \nrights across the country. On its face, that case was about civil \nprocedure--it was about litigation rules and legal technicalities. But, \nin a larger sense, the Dukes case was about the current state of our \nequal employment laws.\n  In that case, a group of women tried to band together to enforce \ntheir rights to be free from discrimination--rights afforded them by \nTitle 7 of the Civil Rights Act. The women alleged that their \nemployer's policies allowed bias--rather than performance and merit--to \ndetermine who would be promoted or given raises.\n  The evidence in the case indicated that women comprised 70 percent of \nthe employer's hourly workforce but only 33 percent of its management \nteam. The evidence indicated that women were paid less than men in each \nof the employer's 41 regions. It indicated that managers around the \ncountry relied on outdated stereotypes when making employment \ndecisions. Both the trial court and the appellate court agreed that the \nwomen should be permitted to try their case as a group.\n  The trial court's and the appellate court's decisions were consistent \nwith precedent. Governing rules said that a group of workers could band \ntogether if they first showed, among other things, that their cases \nshared a common issue of law or fact. This is known as the \n``commonality'' requirement. The idea here is that if lots of workers \nraise a common issue, it's easier for the court to resolve that issue \nin one case than to resolve it over and over and over again in \nthousands of different cases.\n  In Dukes, the common, central issue was whether the employer's policy \nof giving managers unfettered discretion to make pay and promotion \ndecisions resulted in a disparate impact on women. In other words, all \nof the workers alleged that the employer's policy allowed bias to \ndetermine conditions of employment. Because the workers had presented \nthat common question, ``Is the employer's policy discriminatory''; the \nlower courts concluded that the group could proceed together.\n  But the Supreme Court concluded otherwise. Its rationale was \nunprecedented. In a 5 to 4 decision, the Court said that, to proceed as \na group, the women had to show not only that they were united by a \ncommon issue, but also that they ultimately would prevail on that issue \nat trial. That is, to present their case, the women first had to prove \ntheir case. As Justice Ginsburg explained in her dissenting opinion, \nthe Court's decision ``disqualifies the class from the starting gate.''\n  Since Dukes was decided, dozens of employment discrimination cases \neffectively have been stopped before they even started. This is a \nproblem. When Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the \nCommittee responsible for the bill issued a report in which it said \nthat ``[t]he Committee agrees with the courts that Title 7 actions are \nby their very nature class complaints, and that any restriction on such \nactions would greatly undermine the effectiveness of Title 7.''\n  But it doesn't take a Congressional Committee report to understand \nthe effect of the Dukes decision. Betty Dukes, the lead plaintiff in \nthe case, put it well when she testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. She said that, quote, ``[o]ur civil rights are only as \nvaluable as the means that exist to enforce them.'' It is one thing to \npass a law saying that men and women should be treated equally. It is \nanother thing to give that law some teeth--to say that we really mean \nit.\n  The Dukes decision makes it harder for women--for any group of \nworkers, for that matter--to band together to enforce the Civil Rights \nAct. Unable to band together, many workers may not have access to legal \nrepresentation. Unable to band together, many workers will choose not \nto challenge workplace discrimination at all, concluding that the \npersonal costs of doing so--the potential for retaliatory actions--\noutweigh any possible benefits. Unable to band together, workers will \nbe less able to use the courts to address employers' discriminatory \npolicies on a company-wide basis.\n  So, today, on the one year anniversary of the Court's decision in \nDukes, I rise to introduce the Equal Employment Opportunity Restoration \nAct. This bill will restore workers' ability to enforce effectively our \nNation's antidiscrimination laws. Perhaps as importantly, this bill \nreaffirms the American promise of workplace equality.\n  The bill creates a new judicial procedure--called a ``group \naction''--which mirrors the class action procedures that were available \nto workers before Dukes was decided. Instead of disqualifying workers' \ncases at the starting gate, this bill says that workers can proceed \ntogether if they create a reasonable inference that they were subjected \nto a discriminatory employment policy or practice. It will be--as it \nalways has been--left to a trial to determine the merits of the \nworkers' allegations and the viability of the employers' defenses.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill with Congresswoman DeLauro and with \nmy Senate colleagues, including Senators Leahy, Mikulski, Murray, and \nHarkin.\n  I am grateful to the many wonderful organizations in Minnesota and \nWashington that have worked with me on this bill. They include the \nNational Partnership on Women and Families, the ACLU, the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Women's Law Center, \nthe American Association of University Women, and the Lawyers' \nCommittee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n  Our daughters' futures will be as bright as our sons'. For more than \na century, we have followed a path toward gender equality. The trail \nhas been blazed by generations of women--women whose names are found in \nthe history books, yes, but also by those whose names are not--the \nworking mother who rises before dawn and punches a clock every day so \nshe can\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\nsupport her family--the young woman, fresh out of college, who defies \nstereotypes and pursues an engineering career--the small business-owner \nwho hires dozens of people in her community.\n  We should continue along the path toward equality in the workplace. \nWe should not stop now. We should not turn back now. The bill that we \nintroduce today says that we won't.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today, I am pleased to join Senator Franken to introduce \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Restoration Act of 2012. This \nimportant legislation will respond to the Supreme Court's decision in \nWal-Mart v. Dukes, and restore women's ability to challenge \ndiscrimination in the workplace.\n  Today marks the 1 year anniversary of that case--where just five \nJustices disqualified the claims of 1.5 million women who had spent \nnearly a decade seeking justice for sex discrimination by their \nemployer, Wal-Mart. By a 5 4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the \nwomen did not share enough in common to support bringing a class \naction. Perhaps more troubling, just five Justices said that Wal-Mart \ncould not have had a discriminatory policy against all of them, because \nit left its payment decisions to the local branches of its stores. In \nreaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court provided a clear path for \ncorporations to avoid company-wide sex discrimination suits, and made \nit harder to hold corporations accountable under our historic civil \nrights laws.\n  Betty Dukes has worked for Wal-Mart, where she started as a part-time \ncashier in Pittsburg, California, for almost 20 years. Throughout her \nyears at Wal-Mart, Betty expressed an interest in advancement and in \nthe management track. Unfortunately, she was continually overlooked for \npromotions, receiving only one in her lengthy career there. Betty Dukes \nthen learned of the pay disparities between the male and female \nemployees at a Pittsburg Wal-Mart store. She decided to take a stand, \nand filed a class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart in 2001. Betty Dukes \nand the other women were appalled to learn that the pay disparities did \nnot stop at the Pittsburg store. In fact, there was widespread gender \ndiscrimination occurring at Wal-Mart stores across the country.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing on how Supreme Court rulings affect \nAmericans' access to their courts. Betty Dukes came and shared her \nstory at that hearing. She made it clear that she did not plan on \ngiving up. In these tough economic times, American consumers and \nemployees rely on the law to protect them from fraud and \ndiscrimination. They rely on the courts to enforce laws intended to \nprotect them. Unfortunately, these protections are being eroded by what \nappears to be the most business-friendly Supreme Court in the last 75 \nyears.\n  The Supreme Court's recent decisions make some wonder whether it has \nnow decided that some corporations are too big to be held accountable. \nWhether it is Lilly Ledbetter suing her employer for gender \ndiscrimination, or a group of consumers suing their phone company for \ndeceptive practices, an activist majority of the Supreme Court is \nmaking it more and more difficult for Americans to have their day in \ncourt.\n  We cannot ignore the fact that gender discrimination in the workplace \npersists. Earlier this month, I urged the Senate to pass the Paycheck \nFairness Act, a bill that would have set a clear path to address the \nsystemic problems that result from pay disparities. Unfortunately, the \nSenate could not overcome a partisan filibuster, and was not able to \neven debate the measure.\n  I believe that the ability of Americans to band together to hold \ncorporations accountable, especially when it comes to workplace \ndiscrimination, has been seriously undermined by the Supreme Court. All \npeople should be evaluated on the basis of their contribution to the \nworkplace, not irrelevant factors like sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or \ndisability. These decisions have been praised on Wall Street, but will \nno doubt hurt hardworking Americans on Main Street. I thank Senator \nFranken for introducing this important bill, and urge all Senators to \ncome together and support this effort to restore hardworking Americans' \naccess to their courts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 3321. A bill to promote permanent families for children, privacy \nand safety for unwed mothers, responsible fatherhood, and security for \nadoptive parents by establishing a National Responsible Father Registry \nand encouraging States to enter into agreements to contribute the \ninformation contained in the State's Responsible Father Registry to the \nNational Responsible Father Registry, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the body a \nbill called the Protecting Adoption and Promoting Responsible \nFatherhood Act of 2012. I introduced this bill on behalf of myself and \nSenator Inhofe, with whom I have worked with so closely on many issues \ninvolving adoption and the protection of children who are outside of \nfamily care, both here in the United States and abroad. I thank Senator \nInhofe, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, for being an original \ncosponsor of this legislation. I also thank Congresswoman Laura \nRichardson for introducing a companion piece of this legislation in the \nHouse today.\n  We just celebrated Father's Day this past weekend. I know my father \nand my husband and men all over the country celebrated with their \nchildren and their families. We honor the extraordinary fathers in the \nworld.\n  Parenthood is the ultimate gift. It is also an incredible \nresponsibility. Many of us have benefited from really wonderful fathers \nwho care for and support families and support children through their \nyoung years, their adult years, and even into their older years. When \nfathers are absent, when they abandon their responsibility to their \nchildren, they can make the mothers of their children and their \nchildren more vulnerable. Sometimes women will make a decision to place \na child for adoption if they are unmarried, unwilling, unable--just at \na vulnerable time in their life and not able to raise a child. Adoption \ncan be a very positive option. There are some Members of our Congress \nwho have adopted children and have adopted grandchildren, so we know \nthe blessings of adoption.\n  This bill will help to facilitate and clear up some legal quagmires \nthat occur until many States clear the way for women of any age to make \na decision for adoption. There are many of us, across party lines, who \nhave supported more domestic infant adoption, more domestic adoptions \nfor children of all ages, and particularly adoption of special-needs \nchildren.\n  This bill really affects infant adoption. It sets up a voluntary \nregistry that tracks what 38 States have already done. Any person, any \nmale who has the intention of supporting and raising a child can \nregister on this registry, and their will and wishes will be taken into \nconsideration. But in the situation that often happens where this man \nis not interested in being the kind of responsible father he should be, \nthen this registry helps to expedite, without a lot of legal quagmire \nbut with protection to both the father and the mother, to expedite \nadoption.\n  It has gone through a vetting process with any number of outside \norganizations. I thank the American Bar Association. I want to \nparticularly thank the Association of Adoption Attorneys, which helped \nto draft this important piece of legislation.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to introduce it. We will, of course, \nbring it up when the leadership allows us that opportunity. It may have \nto go through a committee process. We may be able to clear it with the \nsupport of both Republicans and Democrats, as is shown by the support \nof Senator Inhofe and myself. Hopefully we can get it done in a short \nperiod of time and provide a clear path to promote adoption in the \nUnited States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 3323. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nimprove the protections for servicemembers against mortgage \nforeclosures, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Military Family \nHome Protection Act, a bill to strengthen the legal protections our \nmilitary personnel are guaranteed under the Servicemembers Civil Relief \nAct, SCRA.\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\n  Entering military service can sometimes make it difficult or \nimpossible for our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines to meet their \ncivilian legal and financial obligations. In laws dating back to the \nCivil War, Congress has given active-duty military personnel special \nprotections against legal actions that might be taken against them \nwhile they are away from home because of military service. The purpose \nof these laws, according to a 1943 Supreme Court decision, is ``to \nprotect those who have been obliged to drop their own affairs to take \nup the burden of the nation.'' Congress re-wrote the World War II-era \n``Soldiers and Sailor Relief Act'' in 2003, as full-time military, \nReservists, and National Guard personnel were deploying in large \nnumbers to Iraq and Afghanistan. This comprehensively updated statute \nwas re-named the ``Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.''\n  Since the September 11 attacks, we have asked our military \npersonnel--both our active-duty and reserve components--for \nunprecedented service and sacrifice. We have asked them to deploy \nmultiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan, and we have asked their \nfamilies to live without their loved ones for long periods of time. We \nhave asked our National Guard and Reserve personnel--not just once, but \nsometimes two or three times--to leave their jobs, put their civilian \nlives on hold, and answer their country's call to service. The promise \nthe SCRA makes to these Americans is that while they are engaged in the \ndefense of our country, we will protect them and their families from \nadverse financial actions on the home front. One important way the SCRA \nprotects these servicemembers is by lowering their mortgage interest \nrates while they are on active duty, and by prohibiting banks from \nforeclosing on their homes without first getting court approval.\n  Unfortunately, as I learned during a joint House-Senate forum I held \nin the Senate Commerce Committee hearing room in July 2011, not all \nbanks have been following the law. In May 2011, for example, the \nDepartment of Justice settled lawsuits with the former Countrywide Home \nLoans, now a subsidiary of Bank of America, and Saxon Mortgage, a \nsubsidiary of Morgan Stanley, for $22 million. In these lawsuits, DOJ \nalleged that the companies violated the SCRA by foreclosing on more \nthan 170 servicemembers without court orders. At the House-Senate \nforum, which I organized with Representative Elijah Cummings, the \nRanking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, \nwe heard from two members of the military and other experts about how \nthese SCRA violations can devastate military families. Mrs. Holly \nPetraeus, who is the Director of Servicemember Affairs at the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, as well as the wife of General David \nPetraeus, told us that:\n\n       . . . [W]hile a foreclosure is devastating for any American \n     family, it can be especially painful for military families. \n     Both the family back home and the deployed servicemember, who \n     feels helpless to take action to prevent the foreclosure, are \n     put in a terrible situation. It is vital that servicemembers \n     receive all the protections afforded to them by the SCRA.\n\n  At the time we held this forum, legislators in both houses were \nalready hard at work on legislation to strengthen the SCRA and improve \nbanks' compliance with the SCRA. In late 2010, Congress passed a new \nlaw, P.L. 111 275, that allowed deploying soldiers to terminate their \ncell phone contracts without penalties, and that gave the United States \nAttorney General new powers to enforce the SCRA against creditors. In \nJune 2011, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, on which I serve, \napproved a bill sponsored by Senator Begich, S. 941, which included a \nprovision to extend the period of SCRA mortgage protections from nine \nmonths to twelve months after a servicemember leaves military duty. The \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee is also actively considering other \nproposals to improve the SCRA.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Cardin was \nintroduced in the House of Representatives as H.R. 5747 on May 15, \n2012, by Ranking Member Cummings, along with the Ranking Member of the \nHouse Armed Services Committee, Representative Adam Smith, and the \nRanking Member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Representative \nBob Filner. Two days later, it was adopted as an amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act by an overwhelming vote of 394 27.\n  Now that the House has expressed its bipartisan support for this \nlegislation, I am introducing it in the Senate for consideration. The \nrecent House vote shows that this is an issue that should rise above \npartisan politics. I hope that the House's recent action will give the \nSenate new momentum to look at what we can do to strengthen the SCRA \nand protect our military personnel and their families. A short summary \nof the bill is provided below.\n  The Military Family Home Protection Act expands the class of covered \nindividuals under the SCRA's mortgage provisions to include: All \nservicemembers serving on the battlefield, regardless of when they \nbought their home. Servicemembers retiring 100 percent disabled due to \nservice-connected injuries and surviving spouses of servicemembers who \ndied in military service.\n  The act stays mortgage foreclosure proceedings against SCRA-covered \npersons for 1 year following their service; it also eliminates a \ncurrent sunset provision that will reduce this protection to 90 days \nbeginning January 1, 2013.\n  The Act doubles the civil penalty for SCRA mortgage violations to \n$110,000 for the first offense and $220,000 for subsequent violations.\n  The act protects servicemembers and their families against \ndiscrimination by banks and lenders on account of servicemembers' \neligibility for SCRA protections. It also requires banks and lenders to \ntake further steps to ensure SCRA compliance. These steps include: \nDesignating an SCRA compliance officer. Requiring SCRA compliance \nofficers to distribute information to servicemembers about their SCRA \nprotections, and providing a toll-free telephone number and website to \nhelp servicemembers better understand their SCRA protections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4373-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4373-S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 500--CELEBRATING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF TITLE IX OF \nTHE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, ALSO KNOWN AS THE PATSY TAKEMOTO MINK \n    EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION ACT, AND RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO \n CONTINUE PURSUING THE GOAL OF EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL \n                            WOMEN AND GIRLS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBennet, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of \nMassachusetts, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Casey, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Coons, \nMr. Enzi, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. \nHarkin, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Landrieu, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \nShaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Wyden, \nMr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Murkowski, \nMs. Ayotte, Mrs. McCaskill, and Ms. Klobuchar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 500\n\n       Whereas 40 years ago, on June 23, 1972, title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972 (in this preamble referred to as \n     ``title IX'') (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) was signed into law by \n     the President of the United States;\n       Whereas Representatives Patsy T. Mink and Edith Green led \n     the successful fight in Congress to pass this legislation;\n       Whereas, on October 29, 2002, title IX was named the \n     ``Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act'' in \n     recognition of Representative Mink's heroic, visionary, and \n     tireless leadership in developing and passing title IX;\n       Whereas title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     sex in the administration of any education program receiving \n     Federal financial assistance, including sports, and bars \n     sexual and sex-based harassment, discrimination against \n     pregnant and parenting students, and the use of stereotypes \n     and other barriers to limit a person's access to a particular \n     educational field;\n       Whereas remarkable gains have been made to ensure equal \n     opportunity for women and girls under the inspiration and \n     mandate of title IX;\n       Whereas title IX has increased educational opportunities \n     for women and girls, including their access to professional \n     schools and nontraditional fields of study, and has improved \n     their employment opportunities;\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\n       Whereas title IX has increased opportunities for women and \n     girls in sports, leading to greater access to competitive \n     sports and building strong values such as teamwork, \n     leadership, discipline, work ethic, self-sacrifice, pride in \n     accomplishment, and strength of character;\n       Whereas, while title IX has been instrumental in fostering \n     40 years of progress toward equality between men and women in \n     educational institutions and the workplace, there remains \n     progress to be made;\n       Whereas, in the 2010-2011 school year, girls were provided \n     1,300,000 fewer opportunities to play high school sports than \n     boys;\n       Whereas, in 2010, at the typical Division I Football Bowl \n     Subdivision school, 51 percent of the students were women, \n     but female athletes received only 28 percent of the total \n     money spent on athletics, 31 percent of the money spent to \n     recruit new athletes, and 42 percent of the total athletic \n     scholarship funds;\n       Whereas research shows that more than 8 out of 10 \n     successful businesswomen played organized sports as children;\n       Whereas, for girls who engage in sports, 80 percent are \n     less likely to have a drug problem and 92 percent are less \n     likely to have an unwanted pregnancy;\n       Whereas title IX seeks to protect students from sexual \n     harassment and defend pregnant and parenting students from \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas stereotypes and discriminatory barriers in the \n     fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n     persist and contribute to the low numbers of women and girls \n     in those fields;\n       Whereas, in 2009, women comprised only 19 percent of \n     students receiving baccalaureate degrees in physics, 18 \n     percent of students receiving baccalaureate degrees in \n     computer science, 16 percent of students receiving \n     baccalaureate degrees in engineering and engineering \n     technologies, and 22 percent of students receiving master's \n     or doctorate degrees in engineering and engineering \n     technologies; and\n       Whereas, while title IX has resulted in significant gains \n     for women and girls in education, the law's full promise of \n     equal educational opportunities for all women and girls has \n     not yet been fulfilled: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the accomplishments resulting from the \n     passage of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also \n     known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in \n     Education Act, in increasing opportunities for women and \n     girls in many facets of education, including the magnificent \n     accomplishments of women and girls in sports;\n       (2) reaffirms the commitment of title IX to ending all \n     discrimination against women and girls in elementary, \n     secondary, and higher education, and to equal opportunities \n     for women and girls in athletics; and\n       (3) recognizes the continued importance of title IX in \n     providing needed protections for women and girls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4374-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 501--SUPPORTING NATIONAL MEN'S HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAPO submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 502\n\n       Whereas July 2, 2012, marks the sesquicentennial of the \n     signing of the Act of July 2, 1862 (commonly known as the \n     ``First Morrill Act''; 7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), which granted \n     public lands to States and territories to support colleges in \n     promoting education as a means of economic advancement and \n     intellectual pursuit;\n       Whereas the genesis of the national focus on public higher \n     education in the United States is attributed to the \n     establishment of the land-grant institutions under the First \n     Morrill Act;\n       Whereas United States Representative Justin Morrill of \n     Strafford, Vermont, inspired by his own lack of a formal \n     education, authored the legislation that would become the \n     First Morrill Act to provide an ``opportunity in every State \n     for a liberal and larger education to larger numbers, not \n     merely to those destined to sedentary professions, but to \n     those needing higher instruction for the world's business, \n     for the industrial pursuits and professions of life'';\n       Whereas the 37th Congress sought to energize the vital \n     intellectual resources of the United States by enacting \n     legislation to make higher education accessible to the public \n     and thereby apply those intellectual resources to stimulate \n     the national economy, which at the time was based in \n     agriculture and the mechanical arts;\n       Whereas, in the midst of the Civil War and domestic strife, \n     President Abraham Lincoln supported, encouraged, and signed \n     into law the First Morrill Act, which encompassed ideals that \n     united the North and the South;\n       Whereas the First Morrill Act opened the doors of colleges \n     and universities to all people with the ability and will to \n     learn, irrespective of heredity, occupation, or economic \n     status;\n       Whereas the United States leads the world in the quality of \n     its public universities and has provided extraordinary \n     opportunities for higher education to the people of the \n     United States, thus enriching each State and the country as a \n     whole;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\n     United States remain committed to providing accessible higher \n     education and supporting learning, discovery, and engagement \n     in the interest of the country;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States conduct research \n     and education in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and \n     6 territories of the United States, and disseminate the \n     results of those efforts throughout the country and the \n     world, seeking solutions to economic, social, and physical \n     challenges and enriching the cultural life of the people of \n     the world;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States educate more than \n     5,000,000 students and award nearly 1,000,000 degrees \n     annually, serving as the single largest source of trained and \n     educated workers in the United States;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States award 200,000 \n     degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``STEM'') annually, \n     including more than half of the advanced degrees in STEM \n     awarded annually in the United States;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States perform more than \n     $37,000,000,000 worth of research annually and impart the \n     discoveries from that research locally, regionally, \n     nationally, and globally for the betterment of their \n     communities, the country, and the world;\n       Whereas the Smithsonian Institute is marking the \n     sesquicentennial of the signing of the First Morrill Act at \n     the annual Folklife Festival on the National Mall during the \n     summer of 2012, with displays and presentations by many land-\n     grant institutions;

Mink and Edith Green led \n     the successful fight in Congress to pass this legislation;\n       Whereas, on October 29, 2002, title IX was named the \n     ``Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act'' in \n     recognition of Representative Mink's heroic, visionary, and \n     tireless leadership in developing and passing title IX;\n       Whereas title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     sex in the administration of any education program receiving \n     Federal financial assistance, including sports, and bars \n     sexual and sex-based harassment, discrimination against \n     pregnant and parenting students, and the use of stereotypes \n     and other barriers to limit a person's access to a particular \n     educational field;\n       Whereas remarkable gains have been made to ensure equal \n     opportunity for women and girls under the inspiration and \n     mandate of title IX;\n       Whereas title IX has increased educational opportunities \n     for women and girls, including their access to professional \n     schools and nontraditional fields of study, and has improved \n     their employment opportunities;\n       Whereas title IX has increased opportunities for women and \n     girls in sports, leading to greater access to competitive \n     sports and building strong values such as teamwork, \n     leadership, discipline, work ethic, self-sacrifice, pride in \n     accomplishment, and strength of character;\n       Whereas, while title IX has been instrumental in fostering \n     40 years of progress toward equality between men and women in \n     educational institutions and the workplace, there remains \n     progress to be made;\n       Whereas, in the 2010-2011 school year, girls were provided \n     1,300,000 fewer opportunities to play high school sports than \n     boys;\n       Whereas, in 2010, at the typical Division I Football Bowl \n     Subdivision school, 51 percent of the students were women, \n     but female athletes received only 28 percent of the total \n     money spent on athletics, 31 percent of the money spent to \n     recruit new athletes, and 42 percent of the total athletic \n     scholarship funds;\n       Whereas research shows that more than 8 out of 10 \n     successful businesswomen played organized sports as children;\n       Whereas, for girls who engage in sports, 80 percent are \n     less likely to have a drug problem and 92 percent are less \n     likely to have an unwanted pregnancy;\n       Whereas title IX seeks to protect students from sexual \n     harassment and defend pregnant and parenting students from \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas stereotypes and discriminatory barriers in the \n     fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n     persist and contribute to the low numbers of women and girls \n     in those fields;\n       Whereas, in 2009, women comprised only 19 percent of \n     students receiving baccalaureate degrees in physics, 18 \n     percent of students receiving baccalaureate degrees in \n     computer science, 16 percent of students receiving \n     baccalaureate degrees in engineering and engineering \n     technologies, and 22 percent of students receiving master's \n     or doctorate degrees\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\n     in engineering and engineering technologies; and\n       Whereas, while title IX has resulted in significant gains \n     for women and girls in education, the law's full promise of \n     equal educational opportunities for all women and girls has \n     not yet been fulfilled: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the accomplishments resulting from the \n     passage of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also \n     known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in \n     Education Act, in increasing opportunities for women and \n     girls in many facets of education, including the magnificent \n     accomplishments of women and girls in sports;\n       (2) reaffirms the commitment of title IX to ending all \n     discrimination against women and girls in elementary, \n     secondary, and higher education, and to equal opportunities \n     for women and girls in athletics; and\n       (3) recognizes the continued importance of title IX in \n     providing needed protections for women and girls.\n\n                              S. Res. 501\n\n                 Supporting National Men's Health Week\n\n       Whereas, despite advances in medical technology and \n     research, men continue to live an average of more than 5 \n     years less than women, and African-American men have the \n     lowest life expectancy;\n       Whereas 9 of the 10 leading causes of death, as defined by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, affect men at \n     a higher percentage than women;\n       Whereas, between ages 45 and 54, men are more than 1\\1/2\\ \n     times more likely than women to die of heart attacks;\n       Whereas men die of heart disease at 1\\1/2\\ times the rate \n     of women;\n       Whereas men die of cancer at almost 1\\1/2\\ times the rate \n     of women;\n       Whereas testicular cancer is 1 of the most common cancers \n     in men aged 15 to 34, and, when detected early, has a 96 \n     percent survival rate;\n       Whereas the number of cases of colon cancer among men will \n     reach almost 50,000 in 2012, and more than half of those men \n     will die from the disease;\n       Whereas the likelihood that a man will develop prostate \n     cancer is 1 in 6;\n       Whereas the number of men who develop prostate cancer in \n     2012 is expected to reach more than 241,740, and an estimated \n     28,170 of those men will die from the disease;\n       Whereas African-American men in the United States have the \n     highest incidence of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas significant numbers of health problems that affect \n     men, such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, colon \n     cancer, and infertility, could be detected and treated if \n     awareness among men of those problems was more pervasive;\n       Whereas more than \\1/2\\ of the elderly widows now living in \n     poverty were not poor before the death of their husbands, and \n     by age 100, women outnumber men by a ratio of 4 to 1;\n       Whereas educating both the public and health care providers \n     about the importance of early detection of male health \n     problems will result in reducing rates of mortality for those \n     diseases;\n       Whereas appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific \n     antigen exams, blood pressure screens, and cholesterol \n     screens, in conjunction with clinical examination and self-\n     testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result in \n     the detection of many of those problems in their early stages \n     and increase the survival rates to nearly 100 percent;\n       Whereas women are 2 times more likely than men to visit \n     their doctors for annual examinations and preventive \n     services;\n       Whereas men are less likely than women to visit their \n     health centers or physicians for regular screening \n     examinations of male-related problems for a variety of \n     reasons;\n       Whereas Congress established National Men's Health Week in \n     1994 and urged men and their families to engage in \n     appropriate health behaviors, and the resulting increased \n     awareness has improved health-related education and helped \n     prevent illness;\n       Whereas the Governors of all 50 States issue proclamations \n     annually declaring Men's Health Week in their respective \n     States;\n       Whereas, since 1994, National Men's Health Week has been \n     celebrated each June by dozens of States, cities, localities, \n     public health departments, health care entities, churches, \n     and community organizations throughout the United States that \n     promote health awareness events focused on men and family;\n       Whereas the National Men's Health Week Internet website has \n     been established at www.menshealthweek.org and features \n     Governors' proclamations and National Men's Health Week \n     events;\n       Whereas men who are educated about the value that \n     preventive health can play in prolonging their lifespans and \n     their roles as productive family members will be more likely \n     to participate in health screenings;\n       Whereas men and their families are encouraged to increase \n     their awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, \n     regular exercise, and medical checkups;\n       Whereas June 11 through 17, 2012, is National Men's Health \n     Week; and\n       Whereas the purpose of National Men's Health Week is to \n     heighten the awareness of preventable health problems and \n     encourage early detection and treatment of disease among men \n     and boys: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the annual National Men's Health Week; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe National Men's Health Week with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 502\n\n Celebrating the 150th anniversary of the signing of the First Morrill \n                                  Act\n\n       Whereas July 2, 2012, marks the sesquicentennial of the \n     signing of the Act of July 2, 1862 (commonly known as the \n     ``First Morrill Act''; 7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), which granted \n     public lands to States and territories to support colleges in \n     promoting education as a means of economic advancement and \n     intellectual pursuit;\n       Whereas the genesis of the national focus on public higher \n     education in the United States is attributed to the \n     establishment of the land-grant institutions under the First \n     Morrill Act;\n       Whereas United States Representative Justin Morrill of \n     Strafford, Vermont, inspired by his own lack of a formal \n     education, authored the legislation that would become the \n     First Morrill Act to provide an ``opportunity in every State \n     for a liberal and larger education to larger numbers, not \n     merely to those destined to sedentary professions, but to \n     those needing higher instruction for the world's business, \n     for the industrial pursuits and professions of life'';\n       Whereas the 37th Congress sought to energize the vital \n     intellectual resources of the United States by enacting \n     legislation to make higher education accessible to the public \n     and thereby apply those intellectual resources to stimulate \n     the national economy, which at the time was based in \n     agriculture and the mechanical arts;\n       Whereas, in the midst of the Civil War and domestic strife, \n     President Abraham Lincoln supported, encouraged, and signed \n     into law the First Morrill Act, which encompassed ideals that \n     united the North and the South;\n       Whereas the First Morrill Act opened the doors of colleges \n     and universities to all people with the ability and will to \n     learn, irrespective of heredity, occupation, or economic \n     status;\n       Whereas the United States leads the world in the quality of \n     its public universities and has provided extraordinary \n     opportunities for higher education to the people of the \n     United States, thus enriching each State and the country as a \n     whole;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States remain committed \n     to providing accessible higher education and supporting \n     learning, discovery, and engagement in the interest of the \n     country;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States conduct research \n     and education in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and \n     6 territories of the United States, and disseminate the \n     results of those efforts throughout the country and the \n     world, seeking solutions to economic, social, and physical \n     challenges and enriching the cultural life of the people of \n     the world;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States educate more than \n     5,000,000 students and award nearly 1,000,000 degrees \n     annually, serving as the single largest source of trained and \n     educated workers in the United States;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States award 200,000 \n     degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``STEM'') annually, \n     including more than half of the advanced degrees in STEM \n     awarded annually in the United States;\n       Whereas the land-grant institutions and other public \n     research universities of the United States perform more than \n     $37,000,000,000 worth of research annually and impart the \n     discoveries from that research locally, regionally, \n     nationally, and globally for the betterment of their \n     communities, the country, and the world;\n       Whereas the Smithsonian Institute is marking the \n     sesquicentennial of the signing of the First Morrill Act at \n     the annual Folklife Festival on the National Mall during the \n     summer of 2012, with displays and presentations by many land-\n     grant institutions; and\n       Whereas many States are celebrating the sesquicentennial of \n     the signing of the First Morrill Act with resolutions and \n     proclamations, and many land-grant institutions are also \n     commemorating the signing of the historic legislation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 150th anniversary of the signing of the \n     First Morrill Act by President Abraham Lincoln;\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     and celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the \n     First Morrill Act;\n       (3) affirms the continuing importance and vitality of the \n     land-grant institutions, which are the fruitful product of \n     the extraordinary commitment to higher education in the \n     United States that the First Morrill Act represents; and\n       (4) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit to the Association of Public and Land-grant \n     Universities an enrolled copy of this resolution for \n     appropriate display.\n\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senate for agreeing to this \nresolution celebrating the 150th anniversary of the signing of the \nFirst Morrill Act. The Morrill Act, named for its author, Justin \nMorrill of Strafford, VT, granted public lands to States and \nterritories to support colleges in promoting education as a means of \neconomic advancement and intellectual pursuit. This landmark \nlegislation brought national attention to public higher education in \nthe United States and made higher education accessible to the public by \ngranting Federal land to each State to be used toward funding public \nagriculture colleges. It is difficult to overstate the profound impact \nand ways in which the core democratic vision behind the Morrill Act has \nimproved the lives of Americans. Land grant institutions have opened \nthe doors to affordable and accessible higher education for millions of \nstudents. These public institutions are the lifeblood of many \ncommunities, serving as hubs of research and innovation, as drivers of \neconomic growth, and as laboratories for critical thinking and public \ndebate.\n  The University of Vermont is the State of Vermont's land-grant \nuniversity. It is fitting that representatives from the University of \nVermont's Proctor Maple Research Center will be in town next weekend \nfor the Smithsonian's 2012 Folklife Festival. This year, the annual \nevent celebrates the spirit of the Morrill Act and the cultural impact \nof land-grant institutions. Timothy Perkins, Timothy Wilmont, Emily \nDrew, George Cook, and Brian Stowe will host a booth at the Festival on \nthe maple industry and how maple research at the University of Vermont \nhas provided new and improved techniques for efficient sap collection \nand evaporation systems which yield higher quality maple syrup, as well \nas research to improve understanding of the physiology and continued \nhealth of sugar maple trees. Just one example is a revolutionary maple \ntap developed by students and professors at UVM and now being \nmanufactured in Vermont which nearly doubles the yield from each tree.\n  Justin Morrill's vision for a modern higher education infrastructure \nwas centered in creating an opportunity for farmers, mechanics, \nartisans and laborers who too often lacked access to higher education. \nWhile time does not allow a comprehensive look at the contributions of \nUVM to the State of Vermont, I will note that given the focus of land \ngrant institutions on agriculture, it is very appropriate that the UVM \nCollege of Agriculture and Life Sciences, known as CALS, is quartered \nin the original Morrill Hall at the center of campus. In addition to \nwork on maple, CALS provides a number of world-class research and \noutreach efforts that are educating a generation of leaders in \nsustainable agriculture and food systems. And the acorn often falls \nclose to the tree--with UVM graduates applying their skills to start \nbusinesses and nonprofits in Vermont. CALS graduates are owners and \nherd managers at dairy farms across Vermont and others are operating a \ngrowing number of diversified farms and CSA's across the region. Two \nexamples are Shelburne Farms, a wonderful center for sustainability \neducation and Vermont Natural Coatings--a private company manufacturing \nenvironmentally friendly paints--both being run by UVM alumni. \nNutrition research at the school is informing cutting edge farm-to-\nschool programs.\n  Students and researchers at the UVM School of Natural resources have \nbeen at the lead for many years in understanding and addressing water \nquality problems in Lake Champlain. Preparing students with a great \nbasic education in environmental science and policy, these young people \nare then deployed to the UVM research vessel the Melosira, to the \nRubenstein Lake Research Lab, and to watershed groups to put their \nskills to the test. It is not unusual to see UVM undergraduates coming \noff the lake, cold and wet on a cold fall day and burdened with nets, \nbuckets, and boots--and smiling from ear to ear.\n  Vermont is a small State and could never have built such a fine and \nworld-renowned research University but for the Morrill Land Grant Act. \nUVM is now an engine that helps to drive our state, and to benefit the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/20/senate-section/article/S4377-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 21, 2012\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.
