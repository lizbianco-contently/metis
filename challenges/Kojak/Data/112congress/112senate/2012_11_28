Madam President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 419, \nthe DOD authorization bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 3254) to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \n     for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to \n     prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the first hour will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half and the Republicans controlling the \nfinal half. We expect to begin consideration of the DOD authorization \nbill today.\n\n\n                        Disabilities Convention\n\n  On April 14, 1945, a very young Robert Dole lay gravely wounded in \nthe mud of a war-torn Italian hillside. He had been hit with shrapnel \nwhich tore through his shoulder and his spine. But 24 years later, \nafter years spent rebuilding his body and building a political career, \nthe future Senate majority leader gave his maiden speech on the Senate \nfloor. His first floor speech here in the Senate was about the \nchallenges faced each day--even in this the richest of nations--by \npeople just like Robert Dole, people with disabilities. That is what he \nspoke about. He described the discrimination disabled Americans faced \nas ``maybe not exclusion from the front of the bus, but perhaps from \neven climbing aboard it.''\n  Over the next 27 years of his Senate career, including 11 years as \nmajority leader, and throughout his years in the private sector, Bob \nDole would remain a vocal advocate for Americans with disabilities. \nSince Senator Dole fought for passage of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act in 1990, barriers have been lifted, helping people \nwith disabilities in this country live the full and productive life \nthey want and deserve.\n  There is no finer example of the extraordinary goals Americans can \nachieve in spite of their disabilities than Bob Dole's inspiring \ncareer. In my mind's eye, I can see Senator Dole on the Senate floor \nstanding straight and tall, slim, and articulate--as I indicated \nyesterday, always with something funny to say. But what people did not \nnotice was that one of his arms was inoperative. He always kept a pen \nin that hand so people would not grab his hand or something like that. \nBut it was distinctive. That was the distinctive Robert Dole. He was \nsuch a force here in the Senate, and to think that he did it all after \nhaving been really blown up in a war.\n  The United States has been a leader in expanding disability rights \nacross the globe. U.S. law has been the gold standard for the rest of \nthe world. But the United States must continue to lead by example and \nmust do more to protect American citizens traveling and working abroad.\n  The disabilities convention before the Senate today--a treaty \nratified by 125 nations--would advance those goals. This convention \nwould give us\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nan opportunity to strengthen our leadership on disability rights around \nthe world. It is another step toward ensuring that all people with \ndisabilities in any country are treated with dignity and given the \nright to achieve to their full potential.\n  Ratification of this treaty will not cost the U.S. taxpayers a single \ndime. It will not require any changes in our existing law. It has the \nsupport of veterans groups and disability groups around the country. It \nhas the strong backing of a bipartisan group of Senators and leading \nRepublicans such as George H.W. Bush as well as Senator Dole. He called \nme a few days ago to tell me how much he wanted this passed.\n  Like passing the Americans With Disabilities Act, ratifying the \ntreaty is the right thing to do. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ``If you \nwould lift me up you must be on higher ground.'' If the United States \nwishes to be a global example for the huge strides people with \ndisabilities can make when barriers to succeed are removed, we must \ntake the high ground.\n  I thank Senator Kerry, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senators McCain, Lugar, Durbin, Barrasso, Coons, Tom Udall, \nMoran, and others, and especially Senator Harkin, who is the father of \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act, leading the way on this issue. \nWith their help, I hope we can quickly ratify this treaty.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, over the past few weeks Americans \nhave started to really focus on the debate we are having here in \nWashington about how the two parties can work together to prevent a \nshort-term economic crisis in January and an even bigger budgetary \ncrisis later on. So it may come as a surprise to many to see that with \njust a few weeks to go before a hard deadline on solving the short-term \nissue, President Obama has decided to hit the road--hit the road--this \nweek to drum up support for his favored approach. It is hard to \nbelieve, really. I mean, every week he spends campaigning for his ideas \nis a week we are not solving the problem. It is completely \ncounterproductive. The election is over. He won. Congratulations. We \nhave a hard deadline here, however. He is still out on the campaign \ntrail kind of celebrating. This is a problem.\n  If the President really wants to reach an agreement, he needs to be \ntalking with the members of his own party right here in Washington, \ntrying to broker an agreement, not out there firing up crowds and \ngiving speeches. He is the only one who can do it, the only one who can \nbring folks together to broker a consensus solution that can pass a \nDemocratic-controlled Senate as well as a Republican-controlled House. \nThis has been my message for weeks. I reiterated it on Monday. I repeat \nit today.\n  There are some important points to keep in mind as well. Yesterday I \ncame to the floor to remind folks that we did not get here by accident. \nThe only reason we are even facing these twin crises right now is \nbecause Democrats have spent taxpayer money with total abandon over the \npast 4 years and done nothing to address the main drivers of the debt.\n  Our Democratic friends like to say we cannot simply cut our way to \nprosperity. Well, leaving aside for a moment the fact that no one is \nactually proposing we do that, we cannot spend our way to prosperity \neither. That is exactly what Democrats have been trying to do for 4 \nyears. We have been trying to spend our way to prosperity. It has not \nworked yet and is not likely to work in the future.\n  This is not complicated. We are not in this mess because Washington \ntaxes too little, we are in this mess because Washington spends too \nmuch. The American people know that. And we are not going to get out of \nit until Democrats get serious about real spending cuts and meaningful \nentitlement changes. So this morning I would like to speak in a little \nmore detail about why it is that we need to strengthen and protect \nthese entitlement programs through reforms that match them up with the \nNation's changing demographics.\n  Democrats like to pretend they are the great protectors of Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. They make solemn pledges all the time \nabout how they will not even entertain a discussion about reform. What \nthey do not say is that ignoring those programs is the surest way to \nguarantee their collapse.\n  All we are calling for is an honest conversation. We all know these \nprograms are in trouble. Let's figure out a solution. When it comes to \nentitlements, Republicans are guided by a simple principle: We do not \nwant Americans to age into a system that no longer exists. We do not \nwant Americans to age into a system that no longer exists. We want to \nprotect them and to protect people's investment in them. But we can't \ndo it alone. Reform is something that can only be done by both parties \ntogether. That is the reality. And there has been a scandalous lack of \nleadership on this issue for years among Democratic leaders in \nWashington because they think it is a winner politically.\n  What I am saying is that the Democrats just won the election. \nCongratulations. Turn off the campaign and recognize the opportunity \nthat divided government presents to actually do something to strengthen \nthese programs and protect them for future generations. That is all \nRepublicans are asking for. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are \ncritical to the economic and health care security of millions of older, \nlower income, and disabled Americans. We want to make sure they remain \nviable not only for today's seniors but for their children and their \ngrandchildren and that they do not consume so large a share of Federal \nspending that we do not have the money to pay for other necessities.\n  Here are the facts, just the facts. Longer lifespans and Federal \nspending patterns threaten the viability of all of these programs as \nwell as the economic well-being of our country and our children. Think \nabout it. The number of Americans over the age of 65 will increase from \n40 million in 2010 to 54 million at the end of this decade and then 72 \nmillion a decade after that. Americans are living longer, more \nproductive lives. That is great and a testament to modern health care \nhere in the United States, but it creates obvious challenges for which \nwe need to prepare. We cannot just let seniors age into promises that \ncan no longer pay promised benefits. It is not right. Yet already \nMedicare and Social Security are both paying out more benefits than \nthey take in from taxes. Medicare and Social Security are paying out \nmore benefits than they take in from taxes now--not some other day, \nnow.\n  The problem is particularly urgent in Medicare, which paid out nearly \n$30 billion more than it took in last year and which is on the road to \nbankruptcy in about 10 years--10 years from now, a bankrupt Medicare. \nThis is not alarmism. It is math. It is a fact. And the studies that \nillustrate the gravity of the problem come from members of the \nPresident's own Cabinet who serve as the Medicare trustees.\n  In discussing the Medicare Part A trust fund, for example, the \nMedicare trustees report that expenditures for this program have \nexceeded income every year since 2008, and projected expenditures \ncontinue to do so every year until the fund becomes exhausted in 2024, \nwhich is not that far away.\n  What do the President's own trustees think we should do about all of \nthis? This is from their report:\n\n       The financial projections in this report indicate a need \n     for additional steps to address Medicare's remaining \n     financial challenges. Consideration of further reforms should \n     occur in the near future. Not some other day, now.\n\n  Again, these are the President's own trustees. They are the ones \nsaying we need to do something about the problem; not just me, the \nMedicare trustees.\n  Yet Democrats are telling those on the hard left, don't worry about \nit, don't worry about it. They won't do anything to reform and protect \ntheses programs. For some reason these groups all applaud, as if this \nis some kind of an achievement--as if this is some kind of an \nachievement, allowing entitlements to crumble. That is the kind of \nleadership vacuum we have had on this issue from Democrats in \nWashington literally for years. Here is a concrete example of what I \nmean.\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\n  The Medicare Modernization Act requires Medicare trustees to send a \nfunding warning letter whenever Medicare begins to rely on the Treasury \nfor more than 45 percent of its financing. The law then requires the \nPresident to submit a plan to Congress on how he plans to address the \nshortfall. The trustees issued their first such warning back in 2007, \nand they have continued to issue one every year since. President Bush \nsubmitted his plan. This President has ignored the warnings every year \nhe has been in office, every year.\n  Here is another example. In 2010 the Director of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office warned that ``the single greatest threat to \nbudget stability of the Federal Government is the growth of Federal \nspending on health care.'' Yet how did President Obama and his allies \nrespond to these warnings about overspending on health care? He \nincreased Federal spending on health care by $580 billion. That was \ntheir response, to increase spending on health care by $580 billion. \nThat was their solution.\n  As for Social Security, the only thing we hear from Democrats is that \nthey don't want to talk about it. Don't want to talk about it? Why in \nthe world wouldn't they want to talk about the fact that this vital \nprogram started spending out more than it took in in 2010 for the first \ntime in nearly 30 years, and that its trustees now estimate that it \nwill keep spending more than it takes in for 75 years unless we \nstrengthen it?\n  But, again, it is not just a question of when these programs go \nbroke, it is also about the strain they continue to put on the rest of \nthe Federal budget on their way to going broke. Look, I understand that \nwhen it comes to government spending, those on the hard left have no \nlimiting principle. No limiting principle. They don't think about this. \nThey think every dollar secured is sacrosanct forever and forever, \namen. But when you are in charge, when you are the steward of the \nNation's finances, you don't have that luxury. You are actually \nresponsible.\n  These are just a few of the ways in which Democrats have been slowly \nundermining the very programs they claim to champion, making it even \nharder for us to reform and strengthen them in the future. The good \nnews is these challenges are neither unprecedented nor insurmountable. \nWe have done it before. When a President of one party has decided to \nsit down with leaders of the other party in Congress, we have faced up \nto challenges such as these and made the tough choices necessary to \nresolve them.\n  In 1983, President Reagan worked with Tip O'Neill to reach an \nagreement that increased the retirement age and laid the groundwork for \npreserving Social Security for decades to come. In 1997, Medicare faced \ntotal insolvency by 2001. President Clinton, working with a Republican \nCongress, reached an agreement that added decades to the life of the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  We can do this. We can do this. But the President, as I have said, \nhas to lead. That is the issue. It is that simple.\n\n\n                             Rules Changes\n\n  Madam President, we have been having a spirited discussion this week \nover the plans of the Democratic majority to break the rules to change \nthe rules. That is how my friend from Nevada repeatedly described it \nwhen Republicans considered doing something similar several years ago \nbut wisely chose not to.\n  At the end of the following year, my friend was poised to become \nSenate majority leader, which was back in 2006. With the experience of \nhaving served in the minority in his mind, the majority leader, the \nsoon-to-be majority leader, the Senator from Nevada, made a commitment \nto practice the Golden Rule, as he put it, by running the Senate with \nrespect for the rules and for the minority rights the rules protect.\n  Unfortunately, he appears to have repudiated that clear commitment. \nUnfortunately, he no longer recognizes, as Senator Byrd did, by the \nway, that the Senate was not established to be efficient but to make \nsure minorities are protected.\n  Then my friend recognized that is what the Senate is all about. That \nis what he said back then. Now he says the primary consideration is \n``efficiency.'' He seeks to minimize concerns about this majoritarian \npower grab by characterizing the effect as ``tiny,'' just a little \nchange, a ``minor change,'' as changing the rules just a little bit.\n  But when one of my new Members asked the majority leader if this \nchange occurred what recourse he would have to ensure he ever got an \namendment to the bill, the majority leader quipped, ``You can always \nvote against the bill.'' In other words, my friend from Nevada \nacknowledged that if this change occurred, the minority will no longer \nhave any ability to ensure that it and those whom it represents have a \nmeaningful voice in the legislative process.\n  My new colleague was surprised, but I can't say I was. After all, the \nmajority leader brazenly told Senator McCain that ``the days of \namendments are over.''\n  The record of the Democratic leadership, of course, backs this up. It \nis engaged in a systemic effort to use and abuse Senate procedures to \nmarginalize the voice of the minority in the legislative process. Let \nus review the record.\n  It used to be unprecedented to use Senate rule XIV frequently. This \nrule allows the majority to bypass committees and write bills behind \nclosed doors. Doing so deprives all Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, of the chance to have their committee work actually make any \ndifference.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the majority has \nused this rule to bypass committees nearly 70 times--70 times. When \nRepublicans were last in the majority under Senator Frist, we used that \nrule less than half as often, only 30 times to be specific, which is a \nmuch lower rate, proportionately speaking.\n\n  When a bill that has bypassed committee goes straight to the floor \nunder the current Democratic leadership, there often isn't an \nopportunity to participate there either. In fact, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, the current Democratic leadership \ncontinues to break records there as well. It has blocked Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle from offering amendments on the floor 68 \ntimes--68 times. That is a conservative figure in which the majority \nhas simply made it impossible for any Senators to offer any amendments \non the floor. For if the Democratic leadership indicates it won't let \nus offer any amendments to a bill, and in response we don't allow the \nmajority to get on the bill, then there is no tree to fill that shows \nup in the statistics, but there is a filibuster. Of course, the \nfilibuster statistic doesn't indicate the reason for the filibuster in \nthe first place. Let me say that again. The filibuster statistic \ndoesn't indicate the reason for the filibuster in the first place.\n  But even this conservative figure is 70 percent greater than the \nnumber of times the six prior majority leaders combined--combined--shut \ntheir colleagues out of the amendment process. Our friend, the majority \nleader, cavalierly dismisses this unprecedented blocking of Senators of \nboth parties from offering amendments. He said this behavior has ``no \nbearing on what's going on around here.'' It has ``no bearing on what's \ngoing on around here.''\n  Well, maybe in his mind it doesn't, but that is a pretty convenient \nand, frankly, self-serving attitude coming from the one who is picking \nthe amendments. It is a little bit bigger deal to the other 99 of us \nwho don't get to offer any amendments, when our constituents elected us \nto be a meaningful voice for them.\n  Of course, that wasn't the majority leader's view when he was in the \nminority and had to live under that procedure. Senator Frist as \nmajority leader blocked his colleagues from offering amendments a \nrelatively modest 15 times in 4 years--15 times in 4 years. Do you know \nwhat the reaction of my friend from Nevada was when Senator Frist did \nthis a relatively modest number of times over 4 years? He said it was \n``a bad way to run the Senate.'' He said it was a ``very bad \npractice.'' He said it ``runs against the basic nature of the Senate.''\n  Well, if it was a bad way to run the Senate, if it was a very bad \npractice, if it ran against the basic nature of the Senate to do it 15 \ntimes in 4 years, what would be the fair way to characterize the \npractice when it happened nearly 70 times on bills, especially when \nmany of those never went\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nthrough committee? Is it fair to conclude that this sort of stewardship \nof the Senate might be more than just a few tweaks shy of how this \ninstitution, which is supposed to protect the rights of all Senators, \nincluding those in the minority, is supposed to function?\n  But the current Democratic leadership wasn't content to stop there in \nmarginalizing the minority. Because the minority isn't allowed to offer \namendments in committee and isn't allowed to offer amendments on floor, \nsome of our Members began to put forth legislative ideas by moving to \nsuspend the rules.\n  This wasn't exactly a level playing field for us because of the \nrequirement in the Senate rules that motions to suspend the rules \nreceive 67 votes to prevail. But even if the deck was stacked against \nus, it was a chance for us to put our ideas and those of our \nconstituents before the body.\n  Well, of course, that was even too much, too much legislative freedom \nfor the majority. Even if the majority started with a 27-vote built-in \nadvantage under the rules to defeat these motions, having to bother \nwith them was just too much, just too much of a bother. It got in the \nway of efficiency. So the majority leader used a simple majority to \nchange Senate procedure to shut down the minority there too.\n  Even that is not enough. That is not enough. The same Democratic \nleadership now wants to take away the right to extend the debate on \nmotions to proceed to a measure. Don't worry, they say. Don't worry \nabout it. Trust us, they say. We would never take away the right to \nextended debate on the measure itself.\n  Really? Really? In light of the systemic effort to marginalize the \nminority at every turn, are we supposed to believe that the current \nmajority won't subsequently cite ``efficiency'' as a reason to take \naway that Senate rule as well? Are we supposed to believe this \nassurance when the Democratic leadership so easily discards past \nunequivocal commitments to respect the rights of the minority?\n  On the record of this Democratic leadership, there is no basis, none, \nto believe that the proposed changes are ``tiny,'' that they are \n``minor,'' that they would affect the Senate just ``a little bit'' or \nthat they would stop there. To my colleagues who have never served in \nthis body in the minority, who have never served under different \nleadership, this is not how the Senate is supposed to function.\n  To my Democratic friends in particular who have never served in the \nminority but no doubt will at some point, are you prepared to live \nunder the rules you are now demanding? Are you prepared to be shut out \nfrom even offering amendments when the shoe is on the other foot?\n  We in the minority cannot fairly expect the majority to allow us to \noffer every amendment we wish to a bill. I understand that. We need to \nexercise self-restraint and good judgment as well. We know we will not \nget every amendment we wish to offer. But the majority cannot prevent \nus from offering amendments in committee, block us from offering \namendments on the floor before cloture, and change Senate procedure so \nit can rule out of order motions we want to offer after cloture and \nthen turn around and assert that these systemic practices ``have no \nbearing on what's going on around here.'' That is an abdication of \nresponsibility.\n  I would encourage my friend the majority leader not to employ a \nheavy-handed procedure. With the House of Representatives in control of \nRepublicans, it is important to note here, what short-term advantage \nwould be gained by all of this nuclear option activity? The House of \nRepresentatives is in the hands of my party. So you will have degraded \nthe Senate, created a bad precedent for the next time you are in the \nminority, and sent measures to the House nowhere. But in the long term \nit will establish a precedent for breaking the rules to change the \nrules that our Democratic colleagues will have to endure when they are \nnext in the minority.\n\n  Now, what we should be doing, Madam President, is we should work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to resolve our respective differences. \nThat is what the Standing Rules of the Senate anticipate, and that has \nbeen how changes to Senate rules have occurred in the past. We can \nreach agreement, as previous majority leaders have done, without making \nthe Senate irrelevant.\n  The time for the majority leader and myself to discuss these matters \nhas come.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Under the previous order, the following hour is equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                          Entitlement Programs\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the minority leader, Senator McConnell, \nhas addressed two issues: the entitlement programs as well as rules \nchanges. I would defer to my colleagues from New Mexico and Oregon to \naddress the rules changes. I would like to briefly respond to Senator \nMcConnell on entitlements.\n  There is no question that as a Senate and House of Representatives we \nshould address the longevity and solvency of Social Security and \nMedicare. It should be part of our conversation about the deficit \nfacing this country and the debt of our Nation. But the way we approach \nit, the changes we make, are significant. It should be looked at \ncarefully.\n  On the issue of Social Security, I might remind those following this \ndebate that the answer from the Republican side for years has been to \nprivatize Social Security; to get government out of the business of \nretirement and let individuals take their life savings in Social \nSecurity and invest them. That debate disappeared when we had a \nrecession recently--in the last 7 or 8 years--and people saw their life \nsavings evaporate, melt away, as a result of downturns in the stock \nmarket. They started envisioning what would have happened had they \nretired at that moment in time with their Social Security savings. So \nthe Republican answer of privatization of Social Security is a \nnonstarter and never mentioned in polite company in these times because \nit is not a credible position.\n  My belief is Social Security has performed admirably since its \ncreation under President Franklin Roosevelt. I can recall in 1983, when \nwe revised Social Security in anticipation of the baby boomers' \narrival, we said: We will collect more money while they are still \nworking so we can take care of them when they arrive in large numbers \nafter they retire.\n  That is exactly what has occurred, with 10,000 people turning 65 \nyesterday in America, 10,000 today, 10,000 tomorrow, and 10,000 a day \nfor the next 18 years. The boomers have arrived, having paid a lifetime \ninto Social Security, and, rightfully, they expect their coverage to be \nthere when they need it. It will be. But beyond the 21 or 22 years of \nsolvency and longevity, I believe we should take a step further.\n  Having studied this for some time--the Simpson-Bowles Commission and \nother places--I think it is thoughtful and perhaps careful for us to \ntake a look at the future of Social Security and that we need to create \nsomething like the Simpson-Bowles Commission on Social Security to \nreport back to us in 6 or 8 months with a plan to increase the \nlongevity of Social Security for 75 years. I think we can do that, and \nwe can do it in a sensible way since we have 20 years to make small \nchanges and then let them play out to give solvency to Social Security. \nWe can then bring the issue to the floor and let bipartisan groups of \nSenators offer alternatives, if they wish.\n  But let's do this on Social Security separate from this deficit and \ndebt debate. Social Security does not add one penny to the deficit. It \nis an important program, a critical program. Let's take care of it in \nthe future, but let's do it separate from the debt debate.\n  Medicare is another story. Medicare has 12 years of life left. Let me \nmake a point of saying it has 8 of those years because of President \nObama's leadership. He said: We will reduce the reimbursement to \nproviders under Medicare over the next 10 years because we are going to \nincrease the number of people under health insurance coverage under \nObamaCare. As we reduce the compensation to providers, we will buy\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\nmore life for Medicare. And we did, literally--12 years. We need to do \nmore; 12 years is not enough.\n  What I said yesterday and will repeat today is we cannot come up with \na solution on Medicare in the next 2 or 3 weeks. We shouldn't even try. \nIt is too important, it is too serious when it comes to this fiscal \ncliff debate. But Medicare entitlement reform should be part of our \nconversation over the next 10 years in deficit reduction. Let's find a \nway to do it that does not reach the extreme of the Paul Ryan budget, \nwhich created premium supports which literally foreclosed opportunities \nfor seniors to have Medicare coverage when they needed it the most.\n  Let me also add to my colleague's comments that the notion about \nextending the eligibility age for Medicare is one we ought to think \nabout long and hard. To think a person would retire at the age of 64 or \n65 and not have Medicare coverage until 67 raises an obvious question. \nThese people in their midsixties, probably with a health history, will \nfind it difficult to buy health insurance on the open market or afford \nwhatever is available. I want to make sure there are no gaps in \ncoverage for those who need it the most--retired Americans who have a \nhealth history and can't find affordable health insurance. So before we \njump at the notion of increasing the eligibility age for Medicare, \nlet's make certain there are insurance exchanges, good competition, and \naffordable health care available for those seniors. That should be part \nof the conversation about this entitlement reform.\n  Let's get to entitlement reform, but let's start where we should. \nLet's bring in the revenue and taxes needed for deficit reduction. That \nis the President's plan. We sent a bipartisan bill to the House--a bill \npassed in the Senate--to protect every American family making $250,000 \nor less so that they have no increase in their income taxes on January \n1 after the cliff. It is in the hands of the Speaker of the House. He \ncould call it today. He could pass it today. I hope he will. That is \nwhat the President is asking.\n  What we are also saying is those who have lived the American dream, \nhave been successful and blessed with wealth and a good position in \nAmerica, should be willing to give a little more in taxes so another \ngeneration would have a chance to attain that American dream. Asking \nthose in the highest income categories to pay a little bit more to \nreduce our deficit is not unreasonable. It is the President's starting \nposition, and should be, before we get into serious discussion about \ndeficit reductions over the long period.\n  I will now yield to my colleagues and thank them for their \nleadership. I will say, as a way of introduction, what the Republican \nSenate leader failed to mention, which that in the last 6 years we have \nhad no fewer than 386 filibusters on the floor of the Senate. Senator \nMcConnell, as their leader, has led us into more filibusters than ever \nin the history of the Senate. That is why most people who tune in to C-\nSPAN and look at the Senate floor say: Where are the Senators? Why \naren't they here working? We have been stuck in Republican filibusters \nto a record level.\n  What my colleagues are addressing is a way to avoid that in a \nsensible manner which could apply to either party in the majority or \nthe minority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                          Senate Rules Changes\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I am pleased to be here with my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Tom Udall, to talk a little about \nthe issue of how this body, which was once considered the world's \npremier deliberative body, can actually discuss and decide things in \nthis modern era--a modern era that has seen unlimited paralysis, with \nhuge hurdles placed in the way of addressing the large issues facing \nAmerica.\n  The last couple of days we have heard a lot of passionate terms--\nterms such as power grab and suppression of minority rights, broken \npromises or abuse of the rules. I must say all of those allegations \ncreate a smoke screen designed to take away from thoughtful \nconversation about a broken system, about the dysfunction of the \nSenate. So let's take a step back and recognize that the goal of this \ndiscussion about rules is to simply enhance or restore the ability of \nthis body to deliberate and decide issues.\n  Perhaps during the time we have the honor to serve in this body we \nwill be able to once again claim that we are the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. The conversation often starts with the Constitution \nand about the design of this body as being the cooling saucer, as \nPresident Washington was alleged to have claimed. And, indeed, the \nearly debate over this body did say let's take a longer term for \nSenators--6 years rather than 2--so they are more insulated from the \npublic debate. Let's have the indirect election of Senators. States \nused to have a legislative process to decide who would represent them \nin the Senate rather than direct election. Let's do that so there is a \nlittle more insulation for Senators to be able to thoughtfully consider \nissues, whereas the House might be a little rash.\n  But, colleagues, there is a huge difference between being a cooling \nsaucer and a deep freeze. Indeed, we have become a deep freeze.\n  Let's take a look at this first chart. This chart essentially shows \nthe rise in the number of cloture motions. If you can't see the \ndetails, what you can see is the trend of this great soaring number. I \nthink what captures attention is that during the 6 years Lyndon Johnson \nwas majority leader in this body he had to file just one cloture \nmotion--just one--in order to get to a final simple majority vote.\n  During the 6 years that Senate Majority Leader Reid has presided here \nwe have had 386 filibusters. Realizing that each one can consume a week \nof the Senate's time, we quickly see the paralysis that has invaded \nthis body.\n  When Members talk about the frustration of not getting to \nappropriations bills and how few of them we have considered and \ndebated, we know why. It is because of the incessant, day-in-and-day-\nout filibusters launched by members of the minority. This must be \naddressed.\n  I first came to the Senate to observe this Chamber in 1976. I was an \nintern for Senator Hatfield. I sat in the staff gallery and covered the \ndebate that summer over the Tax Reform Act of 1976. There were no \ncameras on the Senate floor, no e-mail, so I would run down and meet \nSenator Hatfield outside of the elevators and brief him on each \namendment. I watched as every hour or hour and a half an amendment was \nbrought up, it was debated in this body, and it was voted on. There was \nno filibuster of a motion to proceed. There was no filibuster of \namendments. There was no 3-week deep freeze during the negotiation of \nwhat amendments would come up because it was understood we were here as \na majority body to debate issues.\n  The filibuster would be a rare exception, occurring once or twice in \none's career, when someone would stand and say: There is a principle so \nprofound at stake, an interest of such concern to me personally, to the \nNation, or to citizens of my own State that I am going to break and \ninterfere with the majority decision and hold this floor and make my \ncase before the people. But that is not what we have now. So there are \nvarious ideas being put forward on how we can restore the filibuster as \nsomething that happens in front of this Chamber, in front of the \npublic; that there is accountability and transparency that facilitates \ndebate. Rather than throwing accusations about abuses of power, let's \njust have a thoughtful debate about how to make this Chamber work.\n  One question is whether we should have filibusters on the motion to \nproceed. I have a little chart that shows what has happened. It used to \nbe unheard of that the motion to proceed was filibustered. In the time \nperiod between about 1930 and 1970 the motion to proceed was only \nfilibustered 12 times or roughly once every 3 to 4 years.\n  What we have here is 57 filibusters in 2007-2008 of just the motion \nto proceed. In other words, we see this growing trend of trying to \nparalyze the Senate from even getting to a debate on an issue. This \nmakes no sense because whatever one is filibustering at the front end \none can do at the back end. So we need to consider the possibility of \nsaying, no, this does not enhance debate.\n  Filibustering to prevent the Senate from debating cannot possibly \nenhance debate. So we need to be thoughtful about whether we continue \nthis change, this change that has emerged since 1970.\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\n  We need to look at the problem of motions being filibustered going to \nconference committee. A conference committee is a chance to negotiate \nwith the House on a bill that has been passed by both bodies. Why \nshould we possibly obstruct a bill from getting to conference \ncommittee? Yet we rarely have a conference committee now because of the \nroutine threat to filibuster the motions necessary to get to conference \ncommittee. Yes, we should still be able to debate and filibuster what \ncomes back from conference committee. Absolutely. But to prevent \nnegotiations--again, that doesn't seem reasonable in any frame other \nthan to paralyze this body, which is paralysis not about debate, it is \nabout preventing debate.\n  I put forward the notion of the talking filibuster. That is simply to \nsay that the American people believe that if you are going to object to \na simple majority vote and say there should be more debate, then there \nshould be more debate--more debate on this Chamber floor. So I am \nproposing that after cloture, when you have a majority but not a \nsupermajority, that Members be required to actually debate. I can tell \nmy colleagues that the public reaction to this is so strongly in the \naffirmative. And there are other ideas being put forward that merit \nthoughtful consideration.\n  Today the minority leader said the test should be whether you feel as \nthough a proposal would work when you place yourself in the minority. \nBoth Senator Udall and I have expressed that very position from the \nbeginning of this conversation 2\\1/2\\ years ago, that whatever we \nsupport on this floor needs to be something we would accept in the \nminority, and that means it enhances debate and dialog without crushing \nin any way the right of the minority to be heard.\n  Madam President, at this moment I yield the floor for my colleague \nfrom New Mexico, who has done a spectacular job at framing that we have \na responsibility to American citizens to enable this Chamber to work \nand that we have an opportunity at the start of every 2 years to have a \nthoughtful and considerate debate on how to fulfill that \nresponsibility.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the remaining time on the Democratic side be equally divided \nbetween Senator Murray and me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I say to Senator Merkley, \nwho has been a good friend and partner on this issue of filibuster \nreform, I couldn't agree more with his comments and with the kinds of \nthings he has been talking about: commonsense proposals to make the \nSenate work.\n  What Senator Merkley and I have been talking about is the way we can \nhave the Senate do the work of the American people. We just went \nthrough an election. We know our States are hurting. People want to \ncreate jobs. They want us to deal with health care costs and make sure \nthere is quality health care. On education reform, we haven't even \nreauthorized the No Child Left Behind Act or dealt with education. So \nall of those issues are front and center. As we know, the last couple \nof years, because of the filibuster and because of the delay and \nbecause of the obstruction we have had go on, we haven't been able to \nget to those issues. And I think Senator Merkley has experienced what I \nhave when we have talked to our friends on the Republican side--they \nagree it is not working.\n  Really what we are trying to do is come up with commonsense proposals \nsuch as the Senator has talked about to make the Senate work. The first \none is very simple. It is to make sure that the motion to proceed to a \nbill will not be debatable. We are talking about not allowing \nfilibusters on the motion to proceed because, as we have seen on the \nchart here, we are in a situation where we now cannot even get on the \nbills. So this is a commonsense proposal.\n  One of the other areas we are trying to address deals with conference \ncommittees. There are three debatable motions--three motions that can \nbe filibustered to get us into the conference committee. We have not \ngone to conference as a result, and so we don't resolve differences \nbetween the House and the Senate--another important area we could \nreform and really make the process work much better.\n  The final one is one Senator Merkley and I have worked on. Senator \nSpecter, a Republican who at the very end of his career became a \nDemocrat, talked about it as the talking filibuster. He said: If you \nare going to object, if you are going to slow down the Senate and \nprevent the Senate from doing anything, you should have to come down \nhere and talk about it. That is really the essence of what we are \ntrying to do--shift the burden onto the people who are obstructing to \nsay: Come down here and talk about it. And as Senator Merkley has said \nseveral times, it could be that what you talk about, you become a hero \nor you become a bum in the eyes of the American people. But the reality \nis that the Senate is deliberating, the Senate is doing its work, the \nSenate is engaging--we are engaging each other and having a debate \nabout those particular issues.\n  I think these are commonsense proposals, and the minority should \nunderstand that we have thought through these proposals in such a way \nthat if we were in the minority, we could live with them. That is the \ncrucial fact here. We are not trying to ram something through that we \ncouldn't live with in the minority. I believe this place can work a lot \nbetter and we can do a better job if we just work with each other and \ntry to come up with rules and not abuse the rules.\n  My colleague and our leader, Senator Murray, has joined us. Senator \nDurbin was here earlier. I know the time has been equally divided. It \nwas shortened a little bit with Senator Durbin's talk at the beginning \nof our half hour. At this time, I yield for Senator Murray's remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank my colleagues.\n  We have been hearing a lot recently about the inability of our \nNation's elected officials to come together on a balanced and \nbipartisan budget deal. Here in Washington, DC, this issue is often \nviewed through the prism of partisanship and political point-scoring.\n  The conversations and the coverage are very focused on the moment \nthat we are in--this debate, the next few weeks, the next year--but for \nfamilies who are sitting around their tables and in communities across \nAmerica, this issue is about a lot more than that. It is about their \nlives and their futures. It is about tough questions too many of them \nhave to ask themselves every day: Will they be able to afford to stay \nin their homes? Will they get the support they need to get skills and \nget back on a job? Are they going to be able to send their kids to \ncollege or go to the doctor when they get sick? Is Medicare going to be \nthere for their parents or for them or for their children? Are their \ntaxes going to go up next year?\n  Those are the questions they are asking, and they want their elected \nofficials to come together around real answers and real solutions and \nsmart policies that work for families like theirs.\n  These are the people I am fighting for as we work toward a balanced \nand bipartisan deal in this lameduck session of Congress. Those are the \nquestions I feel very strongly we need to be answering. That is why I \nam absolutely focused on making sure any deal we make over the next few \nweeks works for middle-class families and for our seniors and for our \ncountry, and that is why I have been very clear that I will not sign on \nto a deal that throws the burden of deficit reduction right on to the \nbacks of families and communities who have already sacrificed so much.\n  As cochair of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction last \nyear, I made it very clear: Democrats were willing to compromise, we \nwere willing to make some tough concessions, but only in the context of \na balanced and fair deal that called on the wealthy to pay their fair \nshare as well. As we all know, Republicans didn't just refuse to meet \nus halfway then, they wouldn't even step out of their corner. They \ninsisted that seniors and the middle class feel all of the pain in that \ndeal and that the wealthiest Americans--millionaires and billionaires--\nbe protected\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\nfrom paying a single penny more in taxes.\n  Democrats rejected that deeply unfair approach, and we decided to \nkeep fighting for the middle class rather than roll over and let \nRepublicans lock in new giveaways to the rich and major cuts to \nprograms on which our families depend. And then we made our case to the \nAmerican people. We built our campaigns from the top to the bottom \naround the idea that budgets need to work for our middle class and that \nthe wealthy need to pay their fair share. The Republican approach--the \nRyan budget plan--was literally on the ballot, and Romney and Ryan and \nother Republicans were not shy about telling the American people they \ndidn't think the rich should pay a penny more in taxes in this deal. \nWell, not only did Democrats win races across the country, but in exit \npolling it was clear that the vast majority of Americans supported our \napproach to deficit reduction--a balanced approach, an approach that \ncuts spending responsibly but also calls on the wealthy to pay their \nfair share. Voters spoke pretty clearly in this election, and they \nstood behind Democrats to fight for a budget deal that works for the \nmiddle class.\n  We are hearing encouraging words from some of our Republican \ncolleagues who have indicated a willingness to put revenue on the table \nand to break the stranglehold DC lobbyist Grover Norquist has on the \nmodern Republican Party. One of my Republican Senate colleagues said \nRepublicans should ``put revenue on the table . . . We don't generate \nenough revenue.'' And he said he would not be beholden to the Norquist \npledge.\n  Another has said:\n\n       The world has changed. And the economic situation is \n     different. Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill realized that in the \n     1980s. I think everything should be on the table.\n\n  Another said:\n\n       I'm not obligated on the pledge . . . The only thing I'm \n     honoring is the oath that I take when I'm sworn in in \n     January.\n\n  Another Republican Senator recently said:\n\n       I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old \n     pledge. If we do it his way, then we'll continue in debt.\n\n  Of course, Grover Norquist is fighting back. He called those \nstatements by my Republican colleagues impure thoughts; he called one \nof them a weasel. He is used to blind allegiance from the Republican \nParty, and he is not going to take this lying down. But I am hopeful \nthat more and more Republicans will break away from Grover Norquist and \nthat they will actually follow up on their new rhetoric with a genuine \nwillingness to help us call on the wealthy to pay their fair share. And \nit should be easy for them because the Senate actually has already \npassed a bill to do that and in a way that works for our middle class. \nThe Senate passed a bill that would extend the tax cuts for 98 percent \nof our workers and 97 percent of small business owners and just let the \ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire as scheduled. We have sent \nthat bill over to the House now. The President said he would sign it. \nAll House Republicans have to do is pass that bill, and a significant \nchunk of the fiscal cliff will disappear for the middle class. When \nthat is done, we will then continue the serious conversation we need to \nhave about our country's budget future.\n  But there is no reason middle-class families should have to go into \nthe holidays not knowing if their taxes are going to go up. Democrats \nand Republicans both agree that the middle class should have their tax \ncuts extended. So there is no reason the House should continue holding \nthat bill and the middle class hostage.\n  By the way, one conservative Republican in the House agrees. \nRepresentative Tom Cole of Oklahoma told his colleagues and reporters \nyesterday: ``The first thing I'd do is make sure we don't raise taxes \non 98 percent of the American people.'' He said that was ``the right \nthing to do'' and that ``where there is common ground . . . we should \nseize that common ground.'' I applaud Representative Cole for that \ncommonsense and brave position. I am hopeful that he can persuade other \nRepublicans to do the right thing for our families, small business \nowners, and communities across the country who have so much at stake \nand who are looking to us to solve this problem. I am hopeful they will \njoin Senate Democrats and pass that middle-class tax cut, and I am \nconfident that once we move forward on that bill, then both sides will \nsit down and listen to the American people, allow the wealthy to pay \nmore, and then focus on the questions families are asking about--our \nbudgets, our priorities, our fiscal health, and the future of the \nNation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the fiscal \ncliff this country is facing and is coming upon us on January 1. As my \ncolleagues have been pointing out, Congress must act soon to take on \nthe numerous expiring tax provisions in the sequester. I believe \nPresident Obama needs to supply the leadership in those efforts. If he \ndoes not, we know taxes are going to go up on all Americans; we know \nthe economy is going to be thrown back into a recession; and we know \nunemployment will return to even higher rates than we have right now.\n  Our recovery from the last recession has been far too sluggish. We \nsee that all across the country. It has left too many Americans still \nout of work. Today our economy has created 9 million fewer jobs than we \nwere promised under the President's own stimulus plan. Our economy has \nrebounded far more slowly than it did following previous recessions. As \na nation we simply cannot afford another recession right now.\n  It would be especially tragic if there were a recession caused by a \nfailure of leadership coming out of the White House. That is what we \nare trying to avoid, and we have a very limited amount of time to do \nit.\n  As chairman of the Republican policy committee, we have come out with \na policy paper called ``On the Fiscal Cliff, Entitlement Reform Is \nKey'' because what we see is that no amount of tax revenue will fix \nentitlement spending when we look at the history of the United States. \nOver the last 40 years the average amount of tax revenue was a little \nover 18 percent of the gross national product. The highest ever was a \nlittle over 20 percent of the gross national product. Yet when we take \na look at the tidal waves coming at us of Social Security and Medicare, \nunless we deal with those two tidal waves we are going to significantly \nhave problems long term, and that message to the markets is going to be \none that is quite destabilizing.\n  Tax increases do not solve the spending problem. If we do what the \nPresident requests, which is raising tax rates on people with over \n$200,000 a year of income, in terms of spending for next year that \nwould pay for about 6.8 days. If we did it at the other level of over \n$1 million of income as some suggested, it would only pay for 4 days of \nspending.\n  I am very concerned about what I call the fiscal cliff. Yesterday, \nPolitico reported that some Democrats want to call it the fiscal slope. \nIt is time for Democrats in Washington to stop searching for better \nsound bites and start looking for solutions.\n  President Obama has said repeatedly that he wants to take a balanced \napproach. This balanced approach should govern how we deal with other \nissues as well and how Democrats work with Republicans in the Senate. \nGiven the challenges we face, it is unfortunate that some of the \nPresident's closest allies in the Senate are for pushing the exact \nopposite approach.\n\n\n                             Rules Changes\n\n  The majority leader and some members of his party have now proposed \nwhat would be an unprecedented power grab that will forever change this \nChamber's rules. It will make it easier for the political majority to \nsilence those who disagree with them and even harder to find common \nground. I am speaking, of course, about the Democratic plan to change \nthe rules of the Senate to drastically limit the use of the filibuster.\n  I believe the majority leader would take a dangerous step toward \nabolishing the rights of the political minority and restricting the \nright to free and open debate. They seem to want to break the rules to \nchange the rules, and I believe it is fundamentally wrong to break the \nrules in order to change the rules. This would be a terrible mistake \nand a irresponsible abuse of power. The rules of the Senate ensure a \nbalanced approach to debating important matters such as the fiscal \ncrisis.\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nAmong these rules, filibuster is critically important.\n  The filibuster was created so that competing groups of Senators would \nactually have to work together to find responsible solutions--not \nsolutions based on one political ideology or the other.\n  Back when he was a Senator, President Obama understood the need for \nrules to protect the rights of political minorities. In 2005, then-\nSenator Obama said:\n\n       If the majority chooses to end the filibuster--if they \n     choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic \n     debate--then the fighting and bitterness and the gridlock \n     will only get worse.\n\n  Another former Senator was Vice President Biden, currently the \nPresident of the Senate. He agreed. He said:\n\n       At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee \n     or a bill, it is about compromise and moderation.\n\n  At the time, in 2005, some Republicans wanted to vote on well-\nqualified judges despite Democrats' insistence not to. They believed we \nneeded to change the Senate rules to get these votes. Back then, \nDemocrats called this the nuclear option. That is because of the damage \nit would do to the balance and compromise in Washington. Today some of \nthose same Democratic Senators are preparing to use this nuclear option \nthemselves.\n  Anytime one party or group is frustrated with the Senate's \ninefficiency, there are always calls to change the rules. The \nfrustration is natural, but it is also intentional. Our Nation's \nFounding Fathers purposely made the pace of the Senate deliberate. They \nwanted to make sure there was free debate on important subjects. That \nis what has happened now for more than 200 years.\n  Way back in 1789, the very first session of the first Congress, \nSenators used the rules to slow down one of the first votes this body \never took. Naturally, there were complaints at the time about the \ndelay. The father of our Constitution, James Madison, explained the \nimportance of the rules that allowed the brakes to be applied to \npolicymaking. He wrote:\n\n       If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary.\n\n  Angels have always been in very short supply in Washington, so voters \nmust keep an eye on government officials and hold them responsible. \nThose officials must also keep close watch on each other. At times they \nmust be able to stop each other from doing harm.\n  Restricting the right to debate would seriously undermine the ability \nof Senators to keep that watchful eye. It will lead to more bickering, \nmore bad blood, and more bills being written by one party behind closed \ndoors. There will be less transparency, less consideration of the \nunintended consequences in bills and less open discussion for the \nAmerican people to see.\n  The filibuster is not just about stopping bad ideas. More often it is \nabout amending bills to make them better. It is about taking the time \nto have the reasoned discussion that the Founders knew we should be \nhaving. It is about maintaining the balanced approach the President is \ncalling for in these important talks on the fiscal cliff. It is about \ngiving members of the minority and the people they represent a chance \nto offer their solutions.\n  Instead of allowing that measured approach the Founders intended, \nwhat we are seeing is the majority leader has already done an awful lot \nto limit debate. He has already restricted the rights of minority \nSenators and the people they represent. He has bypassed committees at \nan extraordinary pace, and he has made unprecedented use of the \nparliamentary trick known as filling the tree.\n  Senator Reid has filled this amendment tree 67 times since he has \nbeen majority leader. That is more than twice as often as the four \nprevious majority leaders combined. Now the majority leader wants to \ncut off debate and abolish the filibuster. He wants to change the rules \nby breaking the rules. He would set the precedent that just 51 Senators \ncould band together to change any rule of the Senate at any time. \nCurrently, it takes 67 votes to change the rules of the Senate. In \nJanuary it might be filibusters on motions to proceed. Then when the \nmajority gets impatient on something else, it might change the rules \nagain.\n  President Obama recognized in 2005 the damage that this kind of \nchipping away at minority rights would do to prospects for compromise. \nIf Senate Democrats succeed now, they will destroy, for temporary \npolitical gain, any hope of achieving a truly balanced solution to the \nchallenges we face as a nation.\n  Our political system functions on majority rule but with strong \nminority rights. That is true when the minority is outvoted 51 to 49 or \n99 to 1. Democracy is not winner-take-all. The right to debate is not a \nluxury for the majority to hand out. It is essential to our system of \ngovernment. Majorities are temporary. Being forced to listen to someone \ngive an opinion you disagree with can be exasperating, but as a country \nit does us more good than harm.\n  Way, way back, John Adams wrote on the need for minorities to have \nthe ability to stop the majority in the legislature. He said:\n\n       Every Member must possess it, or he can never be secure \n     that himself and his constituents shall not be sacrificed by \n     all the rest.\n\n  That was centuries ago. Sixteen years ago, Senator Robert Byrd spoke \nto the newly elected Members of the Senate about the history of this \nbody. He said:\n\n       As long as the Senate retains the power to amend and the \n     power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the people will \n     be secure.\n\n  Through his excessive use of filling the tree, the current majority \nleader has gone a long way toward gutting the power to amend. The \nproposals he has now made to do away with the power of unlimited debate \nwould do even greater harm to the liberties of the people. Many \nSenators here today were not around 16 years ago to hear that speech by \nSenator Byrd, but I hope all of us on both sides of the aisle take his \nwarning to heart.\n  If Members on the other side of the aisle are frustrated with how the \nSenate is being run, look at how the majority leader has set the \ncalendar and cut off amendments. Don't take this terrible and \nirresponsible step. We are not only arguing about the rights of the \nSenators to speak, we are not just talking about maintaining rules for \ntheir own sake, or even the terrible precedent that would be set under \nthe proposal of the majority leader. We are talking about the rights of \nthe people we represent, the right to be heard in the Senate.\n  The Senators who are so eager to change our rules by breaking the \nrules should not be so eager to take away the rights of the American \npeople whom those rules were designed to protect. The cost is simply \ntoo high. We have too much important work to do in the Senate. We \nshould be focused on doing all we can to avoid the fiscal cliff, to \ngrow our economy, and to create the jobs the American people need and \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I want to echo the words of my colleague from Wyoming with \nregard to the whole issue of the Senate rules. I come from the House of \nRepresentatives. I came to the Senate having first served in the House \nof Representatives, three terms there. The House of Representatives, of \ncourse, is very structured. There is a Rules Committee. If someone \nwants to get an amendment considered, debated, voted on in the House of \nRepresentatives, there is a process. They have to go plead their case \nto the Rules Committee.\n  The Rules Committee can decide, no, we are not going to allow that \namendment to be considered; we are not going to allow that amendment to \nbe debated. They can decide which amendments are offered in what order \nand how much time is allowed on each amendment. It is a very structured \nprocess in the House of Representatives, but it makes it very difficult \nfor an individual Member to be able to have their voice heard in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  That is the way it works. I had the luxury, I guess, while I was \nserving there of being in the majority. But even in the majority a lot \nof times I could take what I thought was a very worthwhile amendment, \nreflective of the views of the people who sent me there to represent \nthem, and they could shoot it down. I never got a chance to have that \namendment debated or voted on.\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\n  That is what is distinctive about the Senate. That is what the \nFounders intended with the Senate--to allow for open debate, to allow \nindividual Members to come down to represent their constituencies and \nto debate the big issues of the day in a way that is different and \ndistinct from the House of Representatives.\n  I think what many of my colleagues who are proposing this rules \nchange want to see happen is they want to see the Senate function more \nlike the House. It was not designed to. This is a very different place. \nIt was designed to be a very different place where we have debate, \nwhere we have votes on amendments, where individual Members have an \nopportunity--particularly members of the minority in the Senate--have \nan opportunity to have their voices heard and the voices of their \nconstituents heard.\n  So this is an unprecedented power grab by the majority. What the \nmajority leader is proposing is essentially to break the rules to \nchange the rules. That will be a legacy, if he is successful, that he \nwill have to live with because he will change the way that this \ninstitution has functioned for so long. If we think about how this \nought to be done, there is a process by which rules changes can be \nconsidered in the Senate, and it starts with the leaders consulting and \ntalking about whether some of those changes ought to be put in place, \nwhether those are appropriate, and then getting the necessary two-\nthirds vote that is required under the rules of the Senate to change \nthe rules.\n\n  The Senate is a very different place from the House of \nRepresentatives. What we do ought to reflect that. We should not have \nthese power grabs and attempts to violate the rules of the Senate in \norder to change the rules in a way that is completely inconsistent with \nthe history and the tradition in the Senate. What the Founders intended \nwhen they created the Senate, distinct and separate from the House of \nRepresentatives, was to allow for debate and votes on amendments.\n  I hope the majority leader and members of his party will see clearly \nto do the right thing and to go about this in the right way; that is, \nfor the leaders to consult, and if there is a need for changes in the \nrules or modifications, let's do it in the way it has always been done, \nnot by breaking the rules or changing the rules.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Madam President, I wish to speak as well to the issue that was raised \nby my colleague from Wyoming; that is, the fiscal cliff. We are on the \nthreshold of something that could be very harmful to the economy of \nthis country, very harmful to jobs. If we go over the fiscal cliff, the \nexperts are telling us--and by the experts I mean not only private \neconomists but the CBO and others in Washington, DC, who analyze and \nstudy such things--that we could plunge the country into another \nrecession, we could see unemployment go above 9 percent if tax rates go \nup and a sequester is triggered a little more than 1 month from now. \nLonger term, we place unsustainable fiscal imbalances largely because \nof entitlement programs that have not been reformed in a way that \naligns our current demographics with the needs of these programs.\n  Entitlement spending is the largest driver of our national debt over \nthe long term. Those who argue that we can dig our way out of more than \n$16 trillion in debt simply by raising taxes are ignoring reality. We \nhave to do something to address what is our real problem in Washington, \nDC; that is, the spending problem, not the revenue problem. While it is \ntrue Federal revenue has declined over the past few years, it is due to \nthe great recession, not because tax rates are too low. The average \nratio of Federal revenue to GDP over the past 40 years has been about \n18 percent. According to the Congressional Budget Office most recent \nforecast, under the current tax rates--the tax rates in place today--\nrevenues from 2013 to 2022, the next decade, would average roughly 18 \npercent of GDP.\n  So let's be clear about exactly what the CBO is saying. The CBO is \ntelling us Federal revenues will return to the historical average over \nthe next 10 years without raising taxes on anyone. We are going to get \nback to the historical average. In fact, according to the CBO, under \nthe current tax rates, revenues as a percentage of GDP will reach 18.6 \npercent by 2022, and that is more than one-half of a percent higher \nthan the historical average.\n  Clearly, any deal to address our fiscal situation should be first and \nforemost about spending, not taxes. Our spending problem is exemplified \nby the past few years in particular. If we go back to the fiscal year \n2007, before the recession, total Federal revenue was roughly $2.5 \ntrillion and total Federal spending was approximately $2.7 trillion. So \n$2.5 trillion in revenue and $2.7 trillion in spending, so we were \nstill running a deficit of about $200 billion a year. For fiscal year \n2012, which recently ended, total Federal revenue was $2.45 trillion, \nbasically back to the prerecession levels, but total Federal spending \nwas above $3.5 trillion. So what happened. Tax revenue is back to where \nit was before the recession, but Federal spending is now $800 billion--\nalmost $1 trillion--higher than it was just 5 years ago in fiscal year \n2007. It is no wonder that Federal spending and our national debt will \ncontinue to grow for the foreseeable future.\n  According to the CBO, mandatory spending, which comprised about 60 \npercent of total Federal spending in fiscal year 2012, is going to \ncontinue to grow, and if we look at what is driving that, it is \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those programs alone represent \nover 40 percent of Federal spending currently. Spending on these \nprograms is projected to grow at an unsustainable rate and we cannot \nsimply raise taxes to pay for all this new spending. That is the \nproblem. We have a spending problem in Washington, DC, and not a taxing \nproblem.\n  We have to make significant changes in these programs to make our \nFederal entitlements sustainable and in line with today's demographics, \nand we need Democrats to join us in that effort.\n  To put a fine point on all that, I wish to mention what the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office report, which was issued on \nNovember 12 of this year--just a couple weeks ago--said: ``With the \npopulation aging and health care costs per person likely to keep \ngrowing faster than the economy, the United States cannot sustain the \nFederal spending programs that are now in place. . . .''\n  That is from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The President's own fiscal commission, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, \nnoted in its official report: ``Federal health care spending represents \nour single largest fiscal challenge over the long run.''\n  Earlier this month, the Washington Post editorial board said, \n``Entitlement reform must be on the table.''\n  Of the debt reduction plan, the Post editorial board went on to say, \n``No serious plan can exclude entitlements.''\n  So we have experts inside and outside the government, we have the \neditorial boards of newspapers around this country, all recognizing \nwhat the real issue is; that is, the fact that Washington spends too \nmuch and it spends too much on programs that are unsustainable for our \nfuture.\n  What we have to be able to do is to come up with ways in which we can \nreform these programs to make them more sustainable. Of course, if we \nlook at Medicare spending alone, in 1967, it was proposed that by 1990 \nMedicare would spend about $12 billion. That is what the Congress \nprojected when they created that program in 1967. That calculation, by \nthe way, included inflation. If we look at actual Medicare spending in \n1990, it was $110 billion--almost 10 times the amount that was \nestimated in 1967. This year, we will spend $550 billion on Medicare. \nTen years from now, the Congressional Budget Office projects we will \nspend $1.1 trillion on Medicare.\n\n  With regard to Social Security, for the past 2 years, this program \nhas been operating at a cash deficit. If we look at the next 75 years, \nbenefits promised to current and future beneficiaries exceed payroll \ntax revenue and trust fund redemptions by $8.6 trillion. The present \ncourse of Social Security is unsustainable, and the trustees report \nprojects that the trust fund is going to be exhausted by the year 2033.\n  In order to protect Social Security for future generations, it, too, \nmust be reformed. We have to take on what is driving Federal spending \nand that is\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\nentitlement programs. We have to reform them. Raising taxes is not the \nsolution.\n  The President's only proposal so far is to raise taxes on small \nbusinesses to generate this next year what would be $68 billion in \nrevenue which, by raising the two top tax rates in the process, would \nhit nearly 1 million small businesses. What is ironic about that is \nraising taxes on the small businesses that create jobs in this country \nand that grow our economy--actually raising taxes on them to generate \n$68 billion would fund the government a little under 1 week. That is \nwhat we are talking about. The dimensions of this problem are so vast \nwe cannot solve them simply by raising taxes and particularly raising \ntaxes on the very people we are looking to--small businesses. Raising \ntaxes on small businesses would do harm to the economy. We would give \nback everything we get in the form of higher tax revenue by reduced \neconomic growth. We have to deal with the fundamental problem we have; \nthat is, entitlements.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will work with us. I hope the \nPresident will work with us. The President knows what the problems are, \nbut he has folks all across the country who are putting pressure on him \nto not deal with the issue of entitlement reform. But I hope he will \ncome to the table and address this issue. We have a spending problem \nand we have a growth problem. If we can address the spending problem, \nget entitlement program reform on a sustainable path. If we can get \nprogrowth tax reform put in place to grow the economy and expand the \neconomy, we can solve these problems. People across this country expect \nus to. The world expects us to. The financial markets expect us to. It \ncan't be done simply by raising taxes on small businesses which so far \nis all we have gotten from the administration and from many of the \nDemocrats in Congress.\n  We have to fix the spending problem and the growth problem. We have a \nsolution to do that. We hope our colleagues will work with us to do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Working Together\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, one of the most visible expressions of \nthe strength and resilience of our democracy is the moment when the \nincoming President stands on the steps of the Capitol, lays his hand on \nthe Bible, and takes the oath of office. In that moment, America \nundergoes a peaceful transition of power that so many countries can \nonly hope for or, as in this year, the President will smoothly resume \nhis duty for another 4 years.\n  As we anticipate this remarkable moment in just a few short weeks, we \nare reminded of the ability of the American people to come together, \neven after long and challenging campaigns. I will watch the \ninauguration and remember my own difficult campaign. As we reflect on \nthis past year, we are all reminded that this President, the House, and \nthe Senate have not been given any mandate by the American people. For \nproof, look no further than the close margin of victories and the wide \ndisparity in the ideology between the two parties. The only mandate is \nfor Republicans and Democrats to work together.\n  What we saw during this election was an American electorate \nfrustrated by gridlock in Washington and a Congress that does not get \nenough done for the American people. Our Nation has endured a brutal \ncampaign season of attack ads and partisan sniping. The ads are now off \nthe air, the campaign offices are cleaned out, and now we face some \nvery difficult decisions. Right now, Congress must find a way to steer \nour Nation away from this fiscal cliff. We must move forward knowing \nthat the only way to build a better, stronger nation is by working \ntogether and finding solutions on which both Republicans and Democrats \ncan agree. Any solution to the impending fiscal cliff must be a \nbipartisan effort that fairly weighs the concerns of both parties. We \nmust find a way to come together right now. The severe spending cuts \nand looming tax increases require it.\n  Nevada is already struggling to overcome the highest rates of \nunemployment, foreclosures, and bankruptcies in the Nation. The threat \nof this fiscal cliff and any failure to find a solution would have a \nreal and negative impact on the recovery of my State. In the days \nfollowing the election, I received phone calls from job creators in \nNevada concerned about this fiscal cliff. These business owners told me \nthis fiscal cliff would be too much for Nevada. Their employees are \nalready bearing the brunt of Congress's inaction. Find a solution, they \ntold me, and cut a deal. The devastating effect this fiscal cliff would \nhave on Nevada's small businesses would simply be too much for their \nbusinesses and the small business sector in Nevada to handle.\n  There are a number of issues Republicans and Democrats can work \ntogether on to address immediately. First, we must stop living by a \ntemporary Tax Code. Right now, there is no certainty for a small \nbusinessman or woman to grow or start a new endeavor. These men and \nwomen need to know how to plan for the future so they can invest in new \nequipment, new buildings, and more employees.\n  Second, we need fundamental tax reform. As with many small businesses \nacross this country, businesses want nothing more than to grow, hire \nmore people, and pass on a legacy to their children and grandchildren \nthat shows with hard work and dedication, anything is possible in \nAmerica. As I have often said, our current Tax Code is too costly, too \ncomplex, and too burdensome. There is no question the Tax Code is \nunfair and needs an overhaul. Our Nation is long past due for an honest \ndiscussion about how to transform our Tax Code into one that encourages \njob growth and one that doesn't hinder it.\n  Third, we need to put a stop to the ever-increasing number of \nregulations. Instead of encouraging businesses to develop and grow, \nWashington has increased their burden with miles and miles of \nregulatory redtape, passed a health care law that is costing jobs, and \ncontinues with a top-down, Washington-knows-best mentality that has led \nto an anemic economy.\n  While I do not believe sequestration is the answer, Congress must \nengage in honest debate on spending reform to right our Nation's fiscal \nsituation. Nevadans and all Americans deserve a federal government that \nis more efficient and more effective. Washington cannot continue to \nspend money we don't have and place our Nation in deeper debt and \nthreatening future opportunity for our children and grandchildren.\n  Divisive partisan politics does a great disservice to every American. \nFar too many Nevadans are forced to stay up late at night wondering how \nthey are going to make their mortgage payment, send their children to \ncollege or feed their family. While people across our country are \nstruggling to get by, Congress has a responsibility to prioritize the \npeople over the party and find a way to avoid this looming crisis and \nget our economy back on track.\n  These next few weeks are absolutely critical for the health of our \ncountry. Similar to that moment when the President takes office, how we \nwork together to reach across the aisle and find bipartisan solutions \nis a testament that our democracy--the greatest democracy in the \nworld--is alive and well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HELLER. I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  As I was mentioning, like that moment when the President takes \noffice, how we work together to reach across the aisle and find \nbipartisan solutions is a testament that our democracy--the greatest \ndemocracy in the world--is alive and well. Let's not squander this \nopportunity to place our Nation on a path to greater economic \nprosperity.\n  The American people have children to raise, mortgages to pay, \nbusinesses to grow, and new discoveries to make. It is time for \nCongress to come together to make the tough decisions necessary so that \nAmericans can get back to work and create a brighter future for \ngenerations to come.\n  Madam President, thank you very much. I yield back the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion to proceed to S. 3254.\n  Mr. REID.

Is there further debate on the \nmotion to proceed?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S6995-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6995-S7031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike section 313, relating to a limitation on the \n     availability of funds for the procurement of alternative fuel)\n\n       Strike section 313.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I want to describe to the Senate what we \njust did. It is a little different from what we sometimes do around \nhere, which is we have long threats of filibusters on motions to \nproceed; then, we, finally, often or sometimes reach unanimous consent \nagreements to proceed. What we did here--and it was very deliberate--\nwas to proceed by motion, not by unanimous consent, to this bill so \nthat if persons were going to filibuster the motion to proceed, they \nwere then going to have to come to the floor and debate it--not just \nsimply threaten to filibuster the motion to proceed, but they would \nhave to come and actually debate it. Because I believe that is the \ncorrect way for us to operate.\n  Motions to proceed, I believe, have been abused. The threats to \nfilibuster those motions have been allowed to be successful. One way we \ncan overcome what has been a bad habit of allowing threats to \nfilibuster motions to proceed to succeed is to basically tell those \nfolks, our colleagues, that if they want to filibuster a motion to \nproceed--in this case, the Defense authorization bill--they are going \nto have to come over and filibuster.\n  This is something which is significant. It may sound like a nuance to \nmany. I think it probably would to most outside this body and our \nstaffs as to what I am saying. But it is important to those of us who \nare trying hard to get this body to be more functional that we use the \nexisting rules--and I am all in favor of rules changes, by the way--but \nthat we use in the meantime the existing rules to get this body more \nfunctional than it is right now. And one of those existing rules is the \none we just used, which is to proceed by a motion to proceed, and then \nto indicate, as our leader just did, there appears to be no one who \nwishes to be recognized to debate it, and then for the Chair to put the \nquestion, the Presiding Officer to then put the question to the body: \nAll those in favor of the motion say ``aye,'' all those opposed say \n``nay.'' The ayes have it, and now we are on the bill.\n  So, Madam President, I have a long opening statement. I will, \nhowever, with the assistance here of my friend, Senator McCain, also \nmake the following statement. There is no cloture motion which is filed \nor pending. We hope we can adopt this bill without a cloture motion. We \nare hopeful that people who have amendments will bring them over. We \nwill try to dispose of them, either by saying we could agree to them or \nwe cannot agree and putting them in line for debate; but proceeding in \na way that if folks, colleagues, have amendments, they bring over those \namendments and let us try to work those amendments through this process \nwithout having to go through cloture and without having to set aside \npending amendments in order to make other amendments pending.\n  If we can proceed without a cloture motion, we are not going to have \nto use that process of setting aside pending amendments, making other \namendments pending, because if we can avoid a cloture motion, we are \nnot going to have a postcloture period where that pendency of \namendments becomes relevant. If we are not going to need to go to a \ncloture, then it is not relevant that an amendment is made pending \nbecause the bill is open to amendment. That is what we are hoping to \ndo.\n  We are willing to stay here late hours. Senator McCain and I have \nspent a lot of time talking about this--we spent a lot of time getting \nthis bill to the floor, by the way; and it came out of our committee \nunanimously--but we spent a lot of time talking about how do we get \nthis bill done in 3 days because that is what we told the majority \nleader we think we can do. By the way, that is all the time we are \ngoing to have. The majority leader has made it clear we do not have \nmore than 3 days.\n  We want colleagues, Senators, who have amendments to bring those \namendments to us. We will try, if we cannot resolve them, to put them \nin packages. If they need to be debated and voted on, that is fine. \nThat is what we are here for. We are going to then try to line up those \namendments so that we will go back and forth to the extent we can \nbetween Democrats and Republicans offering amendments and voting on \nthose amendments.\n  So, therefore, I intend to object, in the absence of a cloture motion \nbeing filed, to laying aside amendments because, again, in the absence \nof a cloture motion pending, there is no need to do that and it \nconfuses and complicates the life of the managers of this bill. So I \nwant to make that clear to our colleagues.\n  I wonder if Senator McCain might have a comment on that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, could I say, I thank my dear and old \nfriend from Michigan. I was recollecting that he and I have now worked \ntogether for over a quarter of a century. But far more important than \nthat, this legislation and how we handle it, I say to all my \ncolleagues, can be a model for how this body should do business: Take \nup a piece of legislation, have amendments and debate, and move \nforward. If that requires long hours, and even occasionally a Friday or \neven more, then I think our colleagues should be prepared to do that. \nWe are not sent here for a 3-day workweek. We are sent here to do the \npeople's business.\n  I am not proud, Madam President--and I will not point fingers at \nanybody--it was judged by historians the last session of Congress was \nthe least productive since 1947. Now, maybe Senator Levin and I were \naround in 1947, but we do not remember exactly what happened in those \ndays. But the fact is that when we are looking at basically continuous \ngridlock, day after day, week after week, month after month, then we \nhave to change the way we do business.\n  Hanging over all this, I say to my friends on this side of the aisle, \nis a change in the rules, which could cause what we used to call the \nnuclear option, which we were able to avoid some years ago when this \nsort of same thing was contemplated on the confirmation process of \njudges.\n  So we are now proceeding, I say to my friend from Michigan, without a \nmotion to proceed, without a cloture vote, without the normal \nparliamentary back and forth that takes up 2 or 3 days of every week \nhere, and we want people to come to the floor, have amendments--as \nthere is one pending from the Senator from Colorado--we debate it \nopenly and honestly, we have votes on it, and we move forward. If it \nrequires quite a while--because we are talking about this Nation's \nsecurity, the National Defense Authorization\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\nAct--then we should be willing to spend those hours on it.\n  So it seems to me, if we can do what the distinguished chairman and I \ncontemplate; that is, that we move forward with the amendments, we have \nopen and honest debate--we will work with any of our Members to try to \nmake sure their issues and their amendments get the consideration they \ndeserve. But we also may have to put in long hours in order to do so. \nThere is no reason to use a parliamentary mechanism to keep us from \naddressing this Nation's national security. The lives of the men and \nwomen who are serving are dependent upon the work we are doing, and for \nsomeone--individual Members of this body--to hold up the whole process \nbecause of his or her specific issue is not appropriate treatment of \nthis issue.\n  I urge all my colleagues to cooperate. I believe we can show the \nentire country that we are capable of moving forward and addressing the \nissues in a measured, mature, and productive fashion, which is what the \nAmerican people are demanding of us. I do not need to remind my \ncolleagues of our approval ratings. But there is ample reason for that \ndisapproval because we have not moved forward and done the people's \nbusiness.\n  Again, I urge all my colleagues to show the kind of forbearance and \nthe kind of maturity that is necessary in order to complete this \nlegislation.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank my friend from \nMichigan, Chairman Levin, for his leadership in writing this year's \nDefense authorization bill. We have worked together for many years now, \nand the chairman has set a high standard of cooperation and \nbipartisanship that befits the esteemed history of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee.\n  I am pleased that we will finally have the opportunity to discuss and \ndebate this crucial piece of bipartisan legislation, which has been on \nthe Senate's calendar for almost 6 months. My colleagues and I have \ncome to the Senate floor numerous times during those months to ask the \nmajority leader to call up the Defense authorization bill. While I had \nhoped to get started on this bill much earlier, I do appreciate the \nmajority leader's offer to bring up the bill with an open process for \ndealing with amendments. Unfortunately, here we are, with only a few \nweeks left in this Congress, just beginning debate on one of the most \ncritical pieces of legislation the Congress annually considers. So I \nask my colleagues' cooperation in offering relevant amendments with \nlimited time for debate, so that we may afford all Senators an \nopportunity to address their ideas and concerns with respect to \nnational defense.\n  Because of the delay in bringing up this bill, we are considering the \nDefense authorization bill under the imminent threat of budget \nsequestration mandated by last year's Budget Control Act. Pentagon \nleadership has repeatedly warned that these automatic, across-the-board \ncuts to defense spending, totaling almost half a trillion dollars over \nthe next decade, would devastate the Department's ability to provide \nfor the Nation's defense. Sequestration would undermine the readiness \nof the armed services; dramatically reduce our ability to project power \nand defend our interests at a time when the world is becoming more \ndangerous; jeopardize the livelihood of civilian and uniformed \npersonnel alike; and bring with it the likelihood of hundreds of \nthousands of layoffs. Furthermore, the way in which these cuts would be \napplied will likely require that thousands of contracts be terminated \nand renegotiated at a huge cost to the taxpayer.\n  It is unconscionable that the President has not come to the Congress \nwith a proposal to avoid the devastation of sequestration, not only on \nour national security but on our economic security as well. It has been \nover a year since the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, or \nsupercommittee, admitted defeat, and the President has shown no \nleadership and offered no solutions to the impending sequestration. \nMany of us in this body have been meeting and discussing potential \nalternatives to sequestration. Sequestration will take effect on \nJanuary 2, just a short time from now. We need leadership to avoid this \ndisaster and to address the spending and revenue issues that have \nbrought our Nation to the fiscal cliff.\n  The Fiscal Year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act contains many \n``must pass'' authorizations, including a pay raise for our men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces, bonuses, health care, and quality of life \nprograms that are essential to the readiness of our Armed Forces and \nthe well-being of their families. The bill helps to address the needs \nof wounded service members and their families. Military construction \nand family housing projects cannot proceed without the specific \nauthorizations contained in this bill.\n  This bill also includes important authorities that support our \nnational security objectives around the world, including an extension \nof the Afghan Security Forces Fund, a program instrumental to our \nefforts to build the capacity of the Afghan Army and Police. It also \nextends the CERP program which provides commanders on the ground with \nthe ability to fund small-scale humanitarian projects that directly \nbenefit the Afghan people, as well as the Coalition Support Funds \nprogram which reimburses cooperating nations supporting the effort in \nAfghanistan. The bill also contains a provision mandating an \nindependent assessment of the size, structure, and capability \nrequirements of the Afghanistan National Security Forces necessary to \nprovide enduring security for their country so it does not revert to a \nsafe haven for international terrorism.\n  In the area of military compensation, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the President's request for fiscal year 2013 for pay and \nbenefits of current and retired members of the military represents more \nthan one-quarter of DOD's total base budget request. In light of this, \nthe bill would establish a Military Compensation and Retirement \nModernization Commission to review these benefits and recommend any \nfuture changes necessary to ensure both quality of life and sustainable \nbenefits for those who serve.\n  In the area of acquisition and contracting, the bill includes \nprovisions that would improve how the Department buys weapons systems \nand other goods and services by prohibiting the use of cost-type \ncontracts for the production of major weapon systems; requiring the \nDepartment to revise its ``profit policy'' to make sure that it \neffectively incentivizes contractors to control costs; requiring that \nthe Department notify Congress of potential termination liability on \ncontracts for major weapon systems; and calling on the Department to \nimprove its guidance on how it procures capability in response to \n``joint emergent operational needs''.\n  Several provisions in the bill continue the committee's strong \noversight of troubled programs. The bill fences 50 percent of the \nfunding for the second Ford-class aircraft carrier until the Navy \nsubmits a report on how it will control its construction costs, while \nthe accompanying Senate report directs the Navy to recertify the \ncurrent $8.1 billion cost cap on CVN-79. Other provisions \nenhance oversight of, and transparency into, the Navy's Littoral Combat \nShip Mission Packages; subject how the Air Force maintains and \nmodernizes F-22A aircraft to greater oversight; and continue strong \noversight of the F-35 program.\n\n  This year's bill also contains important initiatives intended to \nensure proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars by codifying the 2014 \ngoal for the Department of Defense to achieve an auditable statement of \nbudgetary resources; requiring the implementation of recommendations \nprovided by the GAO to eliminate duplicative programs and functions; \nimposing additional protections for DOD whistleblowers; and requiring a \ndetailed cost estimate and personnel plan for the new Defense \nClandestine Service.\n  Another important provision would require the commander of U.S. Cyber \nCommand to provide a strategy for the development and deployment of \noffensive cyber capabilities to serve as deterrents to, and for \nresponse in the event of, a cyberattack. I believe strongly that cyber \nwarfare will be the key battlefield of the 21st century, and I am \nconcerned about our ability to fight and win in this new domain without \na robust offensive capability. Crafting a comprehensive, well-defined \nstrategy, required under this provision and others, should also spur \nU.S. Cyber Command to identify critical personnel\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\nrequirements for offensive cyber missions, which are presently \nunderstaffed.\n  Again this year, the committee restricted further construction on \nGuam related to the realignment of U.S. Marines in the Pacific theater \nuntil Congress has a clear understanding of the costs and strategic \nimplications of the proposed force realignments on our strong allies in \nthe region. The bill also contains no funding for the Office of \nEconomic Adjustment activities on Guam, and it requires future requests \nfor the construction of public facilities and infrastructure be \nspecifically authorized by law, thereby eliminating another potential \nsource of earmarks.\n  In addition, this bill would impose restrictions on DOD expenditures \nto develop a commercial biofuels industry. I strongly support continued \nDefense Department research in energy technologies that reduce fuel \ndemand for our weapons systems and save lives on the battlefield. But I \ndo not condone siphoning defense funds from those critical efforts to \npay $27 per gallon for biofuels or $170 million to use as venture \ncapital for the construction of a commercial biofuels refinery. This is \nnot a core defense need and should be left to the private sector, or to \nthe Department of Energy, which received over $4 billion last year for \nenergy research and development for related programs. The committee's \naction corrects this misplacement of priorities.\n  Even without the massive budget cuts that will occur if sequestration \nis not averted, the President last year proposed $487 billion in \ndefense budget cuts by fiscal year 2021. The total funding authorized \nin this bill reflects the President's reduced defense budget plan. \nHowever, within that total funding, the Armed Services Committee cut an \nadditional $3.3 billion from programs requested by the Department of \nDefense to fund congressional special interest items. I am concerned \nthat, in light of the budget realities facing the Pentagon and the \nNation, at a time when our military is being asked to make drastic cuts \nin personnel, some of our colleagues continue to divert resources from \nvital military requirements to fund unnecessary and unrequested \nprojects.\n  Some argue that the Department of Defense does not have a monopoly on \ngood ideas. While true, the committee has an obligation to ensure that \nfunding added to new programs results in tangible value to our national \nsecurity and our military personnel. Terms like ``Committee \ninitiative,'' as used in this bill, do not effectively disguise \nadditions to the budget that are earmarks by any other name. Two \nperennial additions that highlight the problem of unrequested \nauthorizations are the Industrial Base Innovation Fund, IBIF, and the \nDefense Rapid Innovation Program, DRIP, which together are earmarked \nfor $230 million in this bill. These funds were not requested by the \nDepartment of Defense and as a result, the Department has struggled to \nput them on contract and manage the money for any useful purpose.\n  Serious threats face our Nation, most recently evidenced by the \ndeaths of four brave Americans in Benghazi, and our Armed Forces are \nstill engaged in operations in Afghanistan and deployed around the \nworld. At the same time, our Nation is facing a severe fiscal crisis \nwhich is only weeks away, due to the unwillingness or inability of the \nPresident and Congress to agree on a solution to the current tax-and-\nspending stalemate.\n  And once again, Congress has failed to enact either an authorization \nor appropriations bill for the Department of Defense almost 2 months \ninto the fiscal year. We have failed to provide the Department with a \nbaseline to plan for sequestration, if it is ultimately not averted. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to swiftly approve this legislation so \nthat a Defense authorization bill can be enacted before the end of the \nyear.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Arizona for \nthose comments.\n  Madam President, on behalf of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nam pleased to bring S. 3254, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2013, to the Senate floor. The Armed Services Committee \napproved the bill by a unanimous, 26-0 vote, making this the 51st \nconsecutive year that our committee has reported a defense \nauthorization act. Every previous bill has been enacted into law.\n  This year's bill would authorize $631.4 billion for national defense \nprograms--the same amount as the President's budget request and $31 \nbillion less than the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2012. U.S. \nforces are drawing down in Afghanistan and are no longer deployed in \nIraq. However, real threats to our national security remain and our \nforces are deployed throughout the globe. I am pleased that this bill \nprovides our men and women in uniform the funding and support that they \nneed as they engage in continued combat in Afghanistan, work to track \ndown al-Qaida and associated forces in the Arabian Peninsula and North \nAfrica, and perform other military missions around the world.\n  First and foremost, this bill continues the increases in compensation \nand quality of life that our service men and women and their families \ndeserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing military \noperations around the world. For example, the bill authorizes a 1.7 \npercent across-the-board pay raise for all military personnel, extends \nover 30 types of bonuses and special pays aimed at encouraging \nenlistment, reenlistment, and continued service by active-duty and \nreserve military personnel, and authorizes increases to several of \nthese bonuses; does not accept Department of Defense proposals that \nwould have increased the cost of medical care for service members and \ntheir families by establishing enrollment fees for TRICARE Standard and \nTRICARE for Life, and increasing TRICARE deductibles and the annual \ncatastrophic cap; authorizes $30 million in supplemental impact aid and \nrelated education programs for the children of service members, and \nadjusts the impact aid formula to alleviate delays in impact aid funds; \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to provide recommendations for \nstatutory or regulatory changes to further increase career and service \nopportunities for women in the armed forces; and strengthens \nprotections on consumer credit for members of the armed forces.\n  The bill includes funding needed to provide our troops the equipment \nand support that they need in Afghanistan, while preparing the way for \na transition of responsibility to Afghan forces. For example, the bill \nfunds the President's request for $88 billion for overseas contingency \noperations; fully funds the President's request for $5.7 billion to \ntrain and equip the Afghan National Army and Afghan Police--growing the \ncapabilities of these security forces so those forces can continue the \ntransition to taking the security lead throughout Afghanistan by 2014; \nreauthorizes the use of DOD funds to support a program to reintegrate \ninsurgent fighters into Afghan society at the requested level of $35.0 \nmillion; reauthorizes the Commanders' Emergency Response Program in \nAfghanistan with a reduction in the Administration's request, given \nreductions to U.S. force levels in Afghanistan; reauthorizes the \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Fund at a reduced level and restricts the \navailability of the authorized funds until the Secretary of Defense \nsubmits information on how new projects will be sustained following \ncompletion; and requires an independent assessment of the size and \nstructure requirements of the Afghanistan National Security Forces \nnecessary to ensure that Afghan forces are capable of providing \nsecurity for their own country after 2014.\n  The bill also contains a number of provisions that will help improve \nthe management of the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. \nFor example, the bill enhances protections for contractor employees who \nblow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse on DOD contracts; restricts \nthe use of ``pass-through'' contracts by requiring that at least 50 \npercent of the work on any service contract be performed by the prime \ncontractor or by a subcontractor identified in the contract; lowers the \ncap on contractor salaries and compensation that is allowable for DOD \nreimbursement from $750,000 to $230,700; prohibits the use of cost-type \ncontracts for the production of major weapon systems, with limited \nexceptions; and adds $59 million to enable the DOD IG to provide more \neffective oversight and help identify waste,\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nfraud, and abuse in DOD programs, especially in the area of \nprocurement.\n  There are a number of controversial issues that are not addressed in \nthis bill.\n  First, the sole detainee-related provision in this bill is a one-year \nextension of existing language addressing certifications for transfers \nof GITMO detainees and the construction of facilities inside the United \nStates to house GITMO detainees. I understand that some of my \ncolleagues would like to revisit issues we addressed last year \nregarding the authority to detain individuals apprehended in the course \nof our ongoing fight with al-Qaida, the Taliban, and associated forces, \nand they have that right, but those issues are not addressed in the \nbill reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Second, the bill does not authorize new rounds of base closures, as \nrequested by the administration. In fact, the bill includes a one-year \nmoratorium on implementing any realignment that would result in a \nmilitary installation falling under the threshold for closure without \ngoing through the BRAC process. The Department of Defense has achieved \nsavings through previous BRAC rounds, but there are other options--\nincluding further reductions to our overseas basing structure--that \nshould be considered to achieve savings before Congress authorizes a \nnew round of base closures inside the United States.\n  Third, in accordance with the policy that the Armed Services \nCommittee has adopted over the last two years, the bill does not \ncontain any earmarks, as defined in rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate. I continue to believe that we it is wrong for us to give up \nthe power of the purse given to Congress in the Constitution. I don't \nbelieve that the executive branch has a monopoly on good ideas; in \nfact, I think that we are often more receptive to creative, new ideas \nthat can lead to advances in the national defense than the defense \nbureaucracy is. Nonetheless, there are no earmarks in this bill.\n  Finally, I would like to discuss four issues in the bill that are of \nparticular importance to the Department of Defense and the Nation.\n  First, the budget proposal included a plan by the Air Force to retire \nor realign various aviation units, resulting in a 4.8 percent reduction \nto the Air National Guard, compared to a reduction of only 1.2 percent \nto the active duty Air Force. The Air Force provided no convincing \njustification for the imbalance in these cuts. Some of the proposed \ncuts in National Guard force structure were accompanied by proposed \nincreases in active duty force structure for the same aircraft. The \nrationale provided for other cuts was inconsistent with statements that \nthe Air Force made as recently as two years ago about the capability of \nits aircraft. In fact, the Air Force was unable even to provide the \ncommittee with consistent numbers documenting the impact of the \nproposed cuts on affected locations.\n  The bill before us rejects the Air Force plan and fully restores $1.4 \nbillion in fiscal year 2013 funding for the force structure that the \nAir Force proposed to cut--without increasing the overall top-line of \nthe defense budget. While we understand that the Air Force has to make \ntough choices in its budget, major changes in Air Force structure are \ntoo important to be made without the support of objective analysis. For \nthis reason, the committee bill would delay the actions proposed by the \nAir Force and instead establish a national commission to provide an \nobjective analysis of how the structure of the Air Force should be \nmodified to best fulfill current and anticipated mission requirements \nin a manner consistent with available resources. It is our expectation \nthat this analysis will provide a far more sound and defensible basis \nfor future force structure decisions.\n  Second, the bill establishes a Military Compensation and Retirement \nModernization Commission to review elements of military compensation \nand retirement benefits with the objective of modernizing these \nsystems, ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of All-\nVolunteer force, and enabling a high quality of life for military \nfamilies. In proposing such a commission, the Department of Defense \ntook note of significant changes in the demographics of the national \nworkforce and private sector retirement plans, concerns about the \nextent to which military compensation is deferred and the vesting of \nbenefits is delayed, and the continuing fiscal pressures on the nation. \nAs recommended by the Department, the provision in our bill provides \nfor expedited legislative consideration of the commission's \nrecommendations--including an up-or-down vote on those recommendations \nwithout amendment. Our legislation would ensure that proposed changes \ndo not break faith with the current force by expressly requiring that \nthe commission's recommendations grandfather all members serving in the \narmed forces as of the date of enactment of the provision.\n  Third, the bill includes a provision requiring the Department of \nDefense to develop and implement a plan to reduce the size of its \nworkforce of civilian employees and contractor employees by an amount \ncommensurate with the 5 percent reduction in military end-strength \nplanned through fiscal year 2017. This provision recognizes the reality \nthat a reduction in military end-strength and force structure should be \naccompanied by a comparable reduction in supporting elements.\n  In recent years, we have come to understand the critical role played \nby the acquisition workforce--and the risk that we could lose billions \nof dollars in failed acquisition programs by trying save millions of \ndollars in ill-advised cuts to that workforce. But it is not just the \nacquisition workforce that plays a critical role in ensuring that our \nmilitary is prepared to meet current and future challenges. DOD's \ncivilian workforce also includes 45,000 nurses, pharmacists, and other \nmedical professionals; 86,000 personnel in cybersecurity, information \nassurance and related fields; 15,000 personnel in science and \ntechnology; and 6,000 personnel in intelligence functions. Our civilian \nemployee workforce plays a critical role in ensuring that our troops \nget the supplies that they need, that they receive the pay that they \nearn, that their bases are safe and well-maintained, and that their \nchildren receive the education that they deserve. Without this \nworkforce, we would not be able to build, test, and maintain the weapon \nsystems we need to face today's challenges, and we would not be able to \nconduct the research and development we need to keep our technological \nedge into the future.\n  In the current budget environment, however, no area of the Department \nof Defense can be off limits as we look for savings. I am well aware \nthat the Department has already developed plans to reduce its civilian \nemployee workforce by two to three percent over a 5-year period, and is \nachieving additional savings through an ongoing pay freeze for its \ncivilian employees. However, these efficiencies initiatives were \ndeveloped before the current budget crunch and fall short of the 5 \npercent reduction planned for military end strength. The cuts imposed \non the Department's contractor employee workforce have been \nsignificantly less deep. The provision in our bill should ensure that \nsavings achieved in the Department's civilian personnel workforce and \ncontractor employee workforce are brought in line with the savings \nachieved through the newer, deeper cuts to military end strength. It is \nour expectation that the Department will utilize a deliberative, needs-\nbased planning process to achieve this objective.\n  Finally, the bill includes a number of provisions on energy \nconservation, energy research, and alternative fuels. The Department of \nDefense is the single largest consumer of energy in the United States, \nspending close to $20 billion a year on purchases of fuel and \nelectricity. I am pleased that the bill authorizes $150 million for the \nEnergy Conservation Investment Program and $200 million for the \nresearch of innovative technologies, including technologies that will \nenhance energy security and independence, through the Rapid Innovation \nProgram. In the long run, these 12 investments should result in \nsubstantial savings in fuel costs, reduce logistics requirements for \nmilitary operations, and enhance our energy security.\n  The bill also contains two provisions--each adopted on a razor-thin \n13-12 vote--restricting the Department's continued investment in \nalternative\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nfuels. The first provision prohibits the use of fiscal year 2013 funds \nfor the production or purchase of an alternative fuel if the cost \nexceeds the cost of traditional fossil fuels available for the same \nuse. The second provision prohibits the Department from entering into a \ncontract to plan, design, or construct a biofuels refinery or any other \nfacility or infrastructure used to refine biofuels, unless specifically \nauthorized by law. These provisions may result in short-term savings, \nbut they will impose significant long-term costs by undermining the \nDepartment's efforts to diversify its fuel supplies and enhance its \nenergy independence and security. It is my expectation that we will \nrevisit these provisions as we debate this bill on the Senate floor.\n  As of today, we have roughly 1.4 million U.S. soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines serving on active duty--with tens of thousands \nengaged in combat in Afghanistan and stationed in other regional \nhotspots around the globe. While there are issues on which Members may \ndisagree, we all know that we must provide our troops the support they \nneed. Senate action on the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2013 will improve the quality of life of our men and women \nin uniform and their families. It will give them the tools that they \nneed to remain the most effective fighting force in the world. Most \nimportant of all, it will send an important message that we, as a \nNation, stand behind them and appreciate their service.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this vital \nlegislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2985\n\n  Senator Udall's amendment is now pending, and I am wondering whether \nthere is a time agreement yet on this amendment and, if not, whether we \ncan work on a time agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Pursuant to Senator Levin's question about a \ntime agreement, I ask unanimous consent that the majority side have 30 \nminutes to speak to my amendment and the Republican side have 15 \nminutes to speak to my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent to speak to my \namendment for 10, 12, maybe 15 minutes. I know Senator Inhofe would \nlike to speak. Then I have additional speakers on our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today in support of \nthe Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform who stand \nwatch around the clock around the world to protect us from a truly \nstaggering range of threats. As I have alluded, I rise specifically to \nspeak to my amendment No. 2985, which I have introduced in concert with \nour military officials and leadership.\n  As a proud member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have \ndesigned this amendment to support the Department of Defense and their \nefforts to pursue alternative fuels and energy investments. Senators \nMurray, Shaheen, Bingaman, Hagan, Kerry, Begich, and Tom Udall have \njoined me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  We, as Senators and as Americans, frequently acknowledge the courage \nand the sacrifice of our troops. But I would also point out that they \nare incredibly smart, insightful, and forward thinking. In order to \nkeep ahead of current enemies and future threats, our military leaders \nmust be students of history. They have to understand the past in order \nto predict the future. They have to be ready to face challenges from \nthe air, sea, and land, and now increasingly from the cyber domain. \nThey must prepare to defend our Nation from hostile nation States such \nas Iran and from terrorist organizations such as al-Qaida.\n  In order to do all of this, they must have the best technology in the \nworld. We must also provide them with the flexibility to adapt to an \never-changing landscape and the resources they need to research, \ndevelop, and employ new technologies. That is our solemn commitment, \nand I would offer our solemn responsibility, to those who fight on our \nbehalf. They have placed themselves between us and harm's way. In \nreturn, we promise to invest in the technology, training, and resources \nthey need to stay safe.\n  For me and many of our colleagues that includes encouraging, \nsupporting, requiring, actually, the DOD to invest in energy sources \nand fuel technologies that reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nUltimately, section 313 of the Defense authorization bill before us \ntoday would severely limit the ability of the Department of Defense to \nuse alternative fuels.\n  Given the threats facing our Nation today and in the future, that is \nnot acceptable. I want to point out the Department of Defense strongly \nopposes the constricting provisions in the current Defense \nauthorization bill for that reason and for a number of other reasons. I \nwant to quote what the Office of the Secretary of Defense says about \nsection 313.\n  The OSD says that 313 is ``detrimental to DOD's long-term energy \nsecurity;'' that it is ``overly broad,'' ``ambiguous,'' and it \n``restricts the flexibility of military commanders.'' Those are the \nDOD's words about this section. I want to point out I strongly agree \nwith those words. Therefore, I have offered this very simple amendment \nthat would remove this limiting provision from the bill. I firmly \nbelieve that removing section 313 of the Defense authorization bill is \nin the best interests of our military and our country. Let me tell you \nwhy.\n  In the carrying out of the work of our Nation, the Department of \nDefense consumes approximately 330,000 barrels of oil every single day. \nThat works out to 120 million barrels of oil per year. That is a truly \nstaggering number. This year, given those numbers, the military has \nalready spent $15 billion on fuel. Because of rising global oil prices \nthat is about $2.5 billion more than they forecast, and the year is not \neven over yet. We have another month to go.\n  Those rising costs in dollars and operational capability are \nstaggering. Think of it this way: For every 25-cent increase in the \nprice per gallon of oil, the military's fuel bill increases by $1 \nbillion. So then what happens? In order to make up for that shortfall, \nthe DOD then has to pull money from the operations and maintenance \naccounts, which means that rising fuel costs result in less training, \ndeferred maintenance, and reduced operational capability.\n  Let me be clear. The current language that was added to this bill by \nsome of my colleagues tells the Defense Department they cannot pursue \nenergy security and instead must rely on an energy source that is \nquickly eating away at their capabilities and effectiveness. That means \nour people are less prepared when they go into harm's way, and they are \nless ready to fight when it matters most. For me, and I hope for the \nmajority of my colleagues, that is far too steep a price.\n  That is why the DOD is investing in technology to increase fuel \nefficiency, promote conservation, and to find alternatives to foreign \noil. General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has \nsaid simply but powerfully: Saving energy saves lives. It should tell \nus something that in an era of reduced DOD budgets our senior leaders \nremain fully committed to this effort. We should support them in these \ncommonsense approaches. That is why the DOD is funding research and \ndevelopment for new fuels that can be made from biological feed stocks. \nAnd these are fuels that can be literally grown here and refined here, \nright in our own country, right at home.\n  This R effort I am alluding to is part of a proud legacy of \nmilitary research programs that have benefited our entire country \nthrough many decades. So what I am saying is even under the threat of \nsequestration, investments in new energy technology and alternative \nfuels remain a top priority for our military leadership. For those who \nwould say we cannot afford to spend money on alternative fuels, our \nuniformed senior leaders tell us otherwise and, in fact, suggest that \nwe cannot afford not to make these investments.\n  Let me share another way of looking at this. The investment is tiny \nwhen we compare it to the potential payoff. For less than .03 percent \nof the defense budget, our military is building a foundation for a new \ndomestic energy\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\nsource that could save billions of dollars and keep more of the money \nwe do spend on fuel right here at home.\n  We spend about $300 billion a year on overseas sources of oil--$300 \nbillion. If we could keep one-twentieth of a percent of that money at \nhome we would pay for this program. Let me put it in perspective \nanother way.\n  For about half of what we spend on military bands each year, we could \nbe establishing a domestic energy industry. For less than the cost of a \nsingle F-35, we could diversify our energy portfolio and drive down \ncosts. We would be taking billions of dollars out of the hands of \nterrorists and reducing the risk to our military personnel.\n\n  So in that context, what is the problem? Well, the proponents for \ncutting off these investments in alternative fuels argue that the \nDefense Department should not be involved in the development of new \nenergy sources. I think it has already become clear, but I want to say \nit again: I could not disagree more. These biofuels, when we produce \nthem, cannot be used as leverage against us. These refineries cannot be \noverrun by Nigerian rebels or blockaded by Iranian gun boats.\n  Energy security is national security. This is exactly the kind of \ninvestment our military should be making. In fact, military R has \nsustained the enormous technological advantage that we have maintained \nover our adversaries historically. Our willingness to invest in the \nfuture has kept us safe. So my colleagues say the DOD should not be \nspending money on energy development. I would respectfully remind them \nwe have always spent money on energy development, and it has made us \nsafer.\n  If that view had prevailed in years passed, we would not have a \nnuclear-powered Navy. Without military investment in emerging \ntechnologies, we would not have jet engines, microchips, microwave \novens, radar, or GPS navigation. Ensuring our energy security ought to \nbe a national priority. Our reliance on foreign oil is a threat to our \nsecurity and our economy. Our reliance on foreign oil harms our economy \nand our national security. Now we have the chance to do something about \nit.\n  This is a national problem. That is why DOD has partnered with the \nDepartment of Energy, Department of Agriculture, and private industry \nto find a solution. That is exactly how our government is supposed to \nwork.\n  If we believe the DOD has a vested interest in having reliable \nsources of fuel and energy, then we should agree they have a role to \nplay in ensuring that new fuels we have to develop meet their needs.\n  Now, as with any technology, the cost of alternative fuels starts \nhigh, but they are coming down steadily. As we all know, the price of \noil continues to climb and, equally important, is subject to those \nsudden spikes due to unpredictable global events. My colleagues who are \nopposed to the DOD energy programs would have us believe that \nalternative fuel prices are unaffordable. But let me share some facts.\n  In 2009 the Navy paid about $66 per gallon for biofuels used for \nresearch. But that price decreased over a 3-year period by 61 percent. \nDuring that same period, oil prices rose by about 120 percent. Today, \nright now, drop-in biofuels for cars and jet aircraft are available for \naround $4 per gallon. These costs will continue to drop if we keep \nmaking smart investments in smart technologies.\n  These are the facts, but even if we disagree with those points, there \nis another important factor I hope we will consider. Section 313 of the \nDefense authorization bill harms military missions and technologies \nthat are being used right now to find and destroy our enemies.\n  Let me explain. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has said the \nlanguage is so broad and so poorly defined that it would prohibit the \nDOD from purchasing any nonpetroleum fuel that costs more than \ntraditional fuels. So we have to ask, what does that mean?\n  Let me give a couple of examples. That would include the solid oxide \nfuels used in rockets and missiles. That would include coal-to-liquid \nfuels. That includes alternative fuels purchased overseas where there \nare no petroleum-based fuels available, like in South Africa and in \ncountries that have mandatory alternative fuel blends. It restricts \nfuel blends to a 50-50 ratio, even if that is not the best or the most \npractical mix.\n  So the outcome of that would be if the DOD wanted to use a more \nefficient or cost-effective mix of traditional fuel to biofuel, they \nwould not be able to do so. So I believe section 313 of the bill we are \ndebating will send the wrong political message as well. It will make \ninvestors wary of the U.S. Government's commitment to weaning ourselves \noff foreign oil. It would help keep us reliant on foreign oil. Let me \nlist the countries: Russia, Venezuela, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, I have not \neven mentioned Iran.\n  It is poorly drafted and damaging to our security. Instead, we have \nan opportunity today to help our military and our country. This is how \nwe move forward. This is not about an environmental agenda or some kind \nof a green conspiracy. It is about doing the right thing, supporting \nour military brass, establishing a stronger national security and \nenergy security posture in the years ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to strike section 313. \nAs I conclude, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Gillibrand and Tom \nUdall be added as cosponsors to my amendment No. 2985 to S. 3254.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has a time issue and she would like to have 5 \nminutes before my time will begin. That is acceptable.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate my \ncolleague's graciousness in allowing me to speak first.\n  I rise today in support of Senator Udall and his amendment, which \nwould restore the Department of Defenses' ability to invest in advanced \nbiofuels. I don't think we should be tying the hands of our military as \nthey attempt to manage a significant national security threat our \nenergy dependence.\n  As our Nation has become more technology dependent, our energy use \nhas increased dramatically. Businesses and families are more conscious \nthan ever of how they use energy and its costs. Our military is no \ndifferent.\n  Advanced technology has not only reshaped our economy, it has also \nchanged how we think about defense. No matter how you look at it, as \nlong as we are dependent on other nations for our energy, we have a \nfundamental strategic vulnerability. Fortunately, for the first time \nsince the oil crisis in 1979 our military is making real progress \naddressing it. I hope we will get out of their way.\n  Over the past ten years the Department of Defense has invested \nsignificant time and resources into improving our nation's energy \nsecurity.\n  Energy security is not some sort of feel-good, pie in the sky, goal \nthat would be nice to have. Energy security is imperative to the \nsuccess of today's military, and it becomes more critical with each \npassing generation.\n  As our Current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Dempsey has said: \nWithout improving our energy security, we are not merely standing still \nas a military and as a Nation, we are falling behind.\n  Let's be clear: Energy security is national security. Our military \nleadership understands this. Our Sailors, Soldiers, Airmen and Marines \nunderstand this. Other countries including some of our strongest \ncompetitors also understand this. And we ignore this fact at our own \nperil.\n  As is often the case when our military commits itself to a new \nmission, particularly when you add a little friendly inter-service \ncompetition, we are seeing dramatic results. For example, new solar \narrays and mini smart grids have allowed Marines at Forward Operating \nBase Jackson, in Helmand province, Afghanistan to cut their fuel use \nfrom 20 gallons to 2.5 gallons per day. More efficient cargo management \nand routing are projected to save Air Mobility Command half a billion \ndollars over the next decade. By reducing\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\ndrag, new stern flaps are expected to save the Navy almost $500,000 \nannually per ship in fuel costs.\n  I saw the Navy's new stern flaps in person earlier this year during \nan Energy Subcommittee hearing I chaired aboard the USS Kearsarge. The \npurpose of the hearing was to highlight the significant advancements \nthe Navy continues to make in both energy efficiency and harnessing \nnew, renewable energy resources. One of those important, home-grown \nenergy resources is biofuels.\n  Biofuels offer reliable, domestic energy, capable of powering our \nmost advanced military equipment. The Navy recently demonstrated the \ncapabilities of advanced biofuels during a massive exercise that \nfeatured a Carrier Strike Group powered exclusively on renewable \nenergy, highlighted by a F-18 traveling at twice the speed of sound and \na ship traveling at 50 knots.\n  Despite biofuels' impressive performance record and their potential \nstrategic impact, we continue to hear two arguments against further \ninvestment by the Department of Defense.\n  The first is that energy investments should be handled by the \nDepartment of Energy and not the Department of Defense.\n  Energy security is going to require an all-of-government approach, \nand that is the direction we are currently going with the Department of \nAgriculture and the Department of Energy playing a fundamental role on \nthe biofuels initiative. In addition, as the largest fuel consumer in \nthe world today--and by far the largest in the U.S. Government--the \nDepartment of Defense has a special role to play in this effort.\n  Moreover, because of our dependence, we continually send our men and \nwomen in uniform into harm's way to maintain our access. In the past \nyear alone, the Arab spring, conflict in Libya, and the threat of \nIranian mining of the Strait of Hormuz have all demonstrated the \nchallenges of assuring continuous access to overseas oil.\n  Not only is access to oil difficult to maintain, instability in the \nglobal price of oil continues to plague our economy and our defense \nbudget as well. Every $1 dollar increase in the price of oil per barrel \ncosts DOD $130 million. Last year alone, the Department was forced to \nshuffle $1.3 billion from other accounts to cover increased fuel costs.\n  The second criticism we often hear is that biofuels are too \nexpensive.\n  It is true that advanced biofuels are not yet in full production and \ncannot compete with an oil market that is over 100 years old. However, \nin the last two years alone, DOD investment has caused the price to \ndrop dramatically. Moreover, biofuels are more immune from the price-\nshocks that are increasingly consuming our defense budget.\n  In addition, as many of you know, there are significant costs to \ntraditional foreign sources of energy--unseen at the gas pump--\nassociated with protecting our shipping lanes and oil supplies. For \nover 60 years, we have been patrolling the Persian Gulf. These costs \nfor oil remain underappreciated.\n  The fact is, throughout its history, our military has played a \nleading role in energy innovation and development. From wind, to coal, \nto oil, to nuclear power, their ability to exploit new forms of energy \nhas been key to our Nation's technological edge and combat \neffectiveness. As Admiral Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations, has \nnoted, ``efforts to reduce the Navy's dependence on fossil fuels and \noutdated energy technologies is in the finest traditions of military \nscientific leadership.''\n  For our military the issue of energy security and investment in \nbiofuels is simple: dependence on foreign oil is a strategic \nvulnerability, creates problematic fluctuations in the defense budget, \nand puts our men and women in uniform at unnecessary risk.\n  We need to make sure our military leaders are able to continue their \nhistoric tradition of identifying long-term challenges and seeking \ninnovative ways to solve them. Energy use is no different and nothing--\nincluding the Congress--should get in the way. We can't allow the \ndebate over the military's energy use to become a proxy for other \nideological debates around energy. We should let our military do what \nit does best. We should let them lead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I hear all the time from my good friend \nwho is involved in this. In this rare case it is true. The Senator from \nColorado and I are very close friends, and he and I disagree on this \nissue. I think it is important for us to understand where this came \nfrom. Senator McCain and I are responsible for section 313, and I think \nwhen people understand what it is, all of these arguments I have heard \nagainst it, none of them holds weight. What we are trying to do is \nexperiment in green energy at the expense of our ability to defend \nAmerica, and our readiness. Our military is deployed in more locations \naround the world at a greater rate than was ever the case during the \nCold War. I sometimes say, I look wistfully back on the days of the \nCold War. Back then we had an enemy we could define. It was an enemy \nwho was predictable. That is not the case anymore, and after almost two \ndecades fighting and all of these contingencies worldwide, including \nfour major regional conflicts with a force structure that is 40 percent \nsmaller and equipment that is decades older than the military readiness \nduring its decline, this is what we are faced with right now. All of \nthis is coming at a time when the Obama administration has cut the \ndefense budget, projecting over the 10-year period, by some $487 \nbillion. If the Obama sequestration becomes a reality, that would be $1 \ntrillion over this period of time coming out of our defense budget.\n  Even the Secretary of Defense, President Obama's Secretary of \nDefense, said that would be devastating. He used the word \n``devastating.'' But if that were not enough, the Obama administration \ncontinues to force the military to spend greater proportions of its \nalready depleted funds on an expensive green energy agenda, to include \nthe purchase of biofuels for operational use and construction of \ncommercial biofuel refineries.\n\n  I fully support the development and the use of alternative fuels, \nincluding biofuels, but not at the expense of the military. Secretary \nMabus's primary focus must be or should be on the readiness of the \nNavy, not on propping up the biofuel industry.\n  By the way, I have to remind everyone we have a bureaucracy called \nthe Department of Energy. They are the ones who are supposed to be \ndoing all of this experimentation we talked about. Our Navy, according \nto the Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Jon Greenert, will see a 15-\npercent increase in the number of ships set to deploy, with the number \nof ships and attack boats deployed at any time rising from 93 today to \n107 by 2016. This increased deployment rate will impact sailors and \nmarines as well as the required maintenance of ships and aircraft.\n  President Obama talked about pivoting to Asia from the Middle East \nand some of the concentrations. This is going to create another very \nserious problem. When every defense cut dollar degrades our military \nreadiness, why should we want our Navy to pay four times the amount \nthan almost any other fuel, or in some cases 100 times the amount? With \na military budget that continues to decrease, where is the Navy going \nto get additional funding to pay its biofuel bill?\n  What is the Navy willing to give up in order to pay this bill? What \nis DOD willing to give up in order to pay the higher fuel bills? They \nhave been talking about this on the other side. However, the higher \nfuel bills are not what this section 313 is all about. We discussed \nthis in the committee. I fully support the efforts that make it \naffordable are mixed in, but biofuels still face challenges in \ntechnologies that remain imprudent. Again, we have a Department of \nEnergy that is supposed to be doing this.\n  This is a 2011 RAND report, which says:\n\n       There is no direct benefit to the Department of Defense and \n     the services from using alternative fuels rather than \n     petroleum-derived fuels. In short, the military is best \n     served by efforts directed at using energy more efficiently \n     in weapon systems and at military installations.\n\n  That is a 2011 RAND Commission direct quote.\n  Despite the recent assertions by biofuel lobbyists that the two \nbiofuel provisions in S. 3254, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\n2013, do not restrict the Department of Defense from purchasing \nalternative fuels, including biofuels, section 313 allows the continued \nuse of the Department of Defense funding for biofuels for testing but \nprecludes them from using the funds authorized for readiness and \ntraining. That is what this is all about, readiness.\n  Section 313 contained in the bill is intended to restore fiscal \nresponsibility and accountability for defense spending at a time when \nour Nation simply cannot afford to waste taxpayers' funds on \nspeculative green initiatives such as Solyndra and dozens of other \ncompanies that are foundering or bankrupt despite billions of \ngovernment investment, as they call it.\n  A recent DOD report revealed that the biofuels program will amount to \nan extra $1.8 billion a year in fuel costs to the Navy alone. That is \njust the Navy, not the Air Force, not the rest of them. This ludicrous \npricetag is not surprising.\n  Through congressional oversight efforts, we found that in 2009--now \nlisten to this, this is significant--the Navy paid an outrageous $424 a \ngallon for 20,000 gallons of renewable diesel. In December of 2011, the \nNavy purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12 million, equaling \nabout $27 a gallon. That is $27 a gallon we are talking about in our \ndefense budget when we are paying for something that should cost $3, \nmaybe $4 a gallon.\n  The Navy is not the only service being subjected to this greening \nagenda. Last month the Air Force bought 11,000 gallons of alcohol to \njet fuel at $59 a gallon, twice as much per gallon as what the Navy was \nforced to spend. So we are talking about amounts such as $400, $450, \nand $29 a gallon for fuel just to experiment, and this is something the \nDepartment of Energy should be doing if anyone is going to be doing it.\n  DOD has been forced to drastically cut its personnel, the number of \nbrigade combat teams, ships, fighters, and airlift, and it has had to \neliminate or postpone critical military modernization programs. Now \nthanks to President Obama's defense budget cuts, DOD can't afford to do \nbusiness as usual. Yet they are being coerced to spend $27 a gallon.\n  Secretary Panetta has warned repeatedly that President Obama's deep \ncuts will have a devastating effect to our economy. He used the word \n``devastating'' when he talked about what was going to happen if he is \nsuccessful in the next step, which would be the sequestration.\n  Knowing this, how could anyone support including another $1.8 billion \nfrom an already stretched budget? President Obama's climate chief, \nHeather Zichal, defended the green fleet by arguing that even a dollar \nrise in gasoline prices would cost DOD $30 million. I think my good \nfriend, the Senator from Colorado, said essentially the same thing. I \nagree with it. If every $1 of rise in gas prices costs $30 million, a \n$27 increase in fuel costs due to the forced use of biofuels would add \nup to about $660 million. So that argument falls completely flat.\n  Realizing that the economic angle is a political loser, the Obama \nadministration has tried to say that it is about national security in \ngetting off of foreign oil. That is where I want to get.\n  I spent several years as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and several years as the ranking member. All during that \ntime, people were saying the one thing we all agree on is we need to be \noff of foreign oil. We need not to be dependent upon the Middle East. \nYet right now we know no one is going to refute this fact, no one in \nthis room, no one today or in the future, that when we had the USGS \nreports and the other reports saying that we now are in a different \nposition than we have been before. People are saying of the resources \nand the reserves in fossil fuels--and I am talking about ``oil and \ngas''--we are No. 1 in the world now. We didn't used to be. Two years \nago we couldn't have said that. Right now we are. We have the \nopportunity, and we can look at the opportunity, in terms of our \nreserves that are usable, of being totally self-sufficient.\n  The other thing that is so disturbing, when people talk about they \ndon't want to be dependent on the Middle East, therefore we have to \nspend billions of defense dollars to experiment on biofuels when, in \nfact, we could be completely self-sufficient, all we have to do is do \nwhat every other nation in the world does, and what is that? Every \nother nation in the world depletes it. They go after their own \nresources. We have recoverable reserves in gas and oil to take care of \nthis country for the next 50 and 90 years, respectively, and yet we are \ntrying to use this as an argument to go and spend this money on \nexperimental biofuels. I think that part of the argument has to be \nexposed for what it is. It is a phony argument.\n  You know, we look, we see, and people ask from around the world, they \nsay why is it that your country, the United States--in my position on \nthis committee I have been asked this many times--why is it that you \nare the only country that won't exploit its own resources, and I say, \nwell, it is a political thing.\n  Right now if you want to do something about becoming energy totally \nsufficient--I asked the other day, because the President keeps saying, \nwell, you know, you are wrong because if we were to develop all of our \npublic lands and be able to get the resources off of that, it would \ntake 10 years for that to reach the pump--I actually called up a man \nnamed Harold Hamm. He has testified before our committees up here in \nWashington several times. I said, let me ask you a question. I am going \nto be on a TV show and they are going to ask me, if this administration \nwould lift all of the restrictions we have on public lands how long \nwould it take for the first barrel of oil that would come from that to \nreach the pumps? Otherwise, you go through the refining process and all \nof that, because we have heard this administration say it would take 10 \nyears. Well, in fact, it would take--his answer was--and I said: Be \ncareful, Harold Hamm, because I am going to use your name on nationwide \nTV. He said: Yes, I have thought about this. It would take 70 days. Not \n10 years but 70 days.\n\n  So we are talking about sufficiency that we could have just in this \ncountry in a matter of days, not in a matter of years. And I only bring \nthat up--and I know people don't think it should be part of this \ndebate, but it is because they are using the argument that we have to \nuse billions of defense dollars in experimenting with biofuels to wean \nus off fossil fuels when, in fact, we are doing that now. And we have a \nDepartment of Energy that is responsible for actually carrying that \nout. The argument completely falls on its face.\n  It was the U.S. Geological Survey report that revealed that America \nhas 26 percent of the world's recoverable conventional oil reserves--\nwhich is more than we are using, so we could become independent--and \nalmost 30 percent of the world's technically recoverable conventional \ngas resources. So with all these things in mind, the Congressional \nResearch Service agrees and the USGS agrees we could become \nindependent. So it all comes together.\n  This isn't happening in a vacuum. We have a good bill here, and we \nneed to get it done in the short period of time given us by the \nleadership. I think we can do it. I agree with the chairman of the \ncommittee that we can get this done. But this one amendment is one that \nwould, probably more than any other amendment, take away our ability to \nspend this money on readiness--on readiness for the experimental \nprogram on green energy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder \nof the time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. \ntoday the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Udall amendment No. \n2985; further, that there be no second-degree amendment in order to the \namendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to commend Chairman Levin, who has \nbrought his usual thoughtful approach to these issues, and to thank him \nfor his help specifically in two areas in which I have been interested.\n  I also see my friend Senator McCain. He and I have worked often on \nthese and other matters, and I thank him for his wise counsel as well.\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, I am going to talk briefly on two \namendments in which I have a special interest. The first is the \namendment of Senator Udall to strike section 313 of the bill.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nI have followed closely the proposition that the Department of Defense \nis the single largest user of energy in the United States, with annual \nfuel expenditures in excess of $16 billion. This is an extraordinary \nthirst the Department of Defense has for energy. It creates a host of \nissues for the Pentagon, and fluctuations in global energy prices can \nhave dramatic effects on defense spending. For every $10 increase in a \nbarrel of oil, it costs the American military annually an extra $1.3 \nbillion.\n  Recognizing the potential instability DOD's current energy needs can \ncause, military experts from across the various branches of the armed \nservices have begun looking at ways to cut energy use and find energy \nalternatives. I continue to hear all of this discussion about how this \nis somehow a ``green agenda,'' that it is a subversive plot and that it \nis being forced upon a resistant Pentagon. I would like to take a \nminute or two to say that I don't think anything could be further from \nthe truth, and I wish to describe for a moment why I feel that way.\n  First, those who oppose defense energy initiatives often argue that \nin today's fiscal environment, the country can't afford to waste money \non energy programs when it is necessary to provide for our Nation's \nsecurity. I don't believe it is an either/or proposition because my \nview is that an investment in energy efficiency and energy self-\nsufficiency is hugely important to protecting our country's national \nsecurity in a dangerous time.\n  I have heard some argue that military research, development, and \ntesting of alternatives to oil-based fuels is a ``misplacement of \npriorities,'' but this argument is based largely on the proposition \nthat biofuels currently cost more per gallon than petroleum. But the \nreality is that the makers of biofuels have not reached full-scale \nproduction, and the Department of Defense contracts include research \nand development costs. So any attempt at a gallon-to-gallon analysis of \nbiofuels versus petroleum is really what I would call an apples-to-\noranges comparison. The fact is that DOD investments in biofuels \ndevelopment have resulted in a cost-per-gallon reduction--a cost-per-\ngallon reduction of 94 percent in just the last 3 years.\n  Bloomberg New Energy Finance analysts predict that some aviation \nbiofuels will be cost-competitive with standard jet fuel by 2018, given \nthe continuation of current rates of development. So in about 5 years, \nthe American biofuels industry could produce fuel for our military \naircraft and vehicles at a cost equal to that of foreign oil.\n  The Truman National Security Project recently held a press call with \nretired generals, and one in particular was quoted as saying the \nfollowing:\n\n       Moving away from oil . . . ensures we remain the most \n     capable and effective fighting force on the planet. . . . And \n     this is what this is all about. This is not about politics or \n     saving polar bears. It is about being effective as a fighting \n     force.\n\n  Those are not my words but the words of an important retired general.\n  So that is what this boils down to, in my view--having the most \neffective fighting force and being in a position to save the lives of \nour servicemembers.\n  I know there is going to be a fair amount of discussion throughout \nthe debate on this bill about this issue, but I continue to believe \nthat energy efficiency and energy self-sufficiency increase our \nnational security. I hope my colleagues will support the Pentagon's \nalternative energy efforts and vote for Udall amendment No. 2985.\n  Briefly, I wish to turn my attention to the other amendment I have, \nand I again thank Chairman Levin and Senator McCain for giving me this \nopportunity to speak.\n  This morning the Associated Press reported that Iraq war contractor \nKellogg Brown & Root has sued the Federal Government to pay the $85 \nmillion in damages KBR owes soldiers sickened because of KBR's \nnegligence.\n  This case started in 2003 when members of the Oregon National Guard \nwere assigned to provide security for contractors from KBR in Iraq at \nthe Qarmat Ali water treatment facility. These soldiers and others were \nexposed to dangerous levels of chemicals, including sodium dichromate, \nwhich contains hexavalent chromium, one of the most carcinogenic \nchemicals on Earth.\n  A group of the exposed soldiers sued KBR based on the evidence \nindicating KBR managers were aware of the presence of the dangerous \nchemicals but failed to warn the soldiers working in and around the \nplant. A jury recently agreed that KBR was negligent and awarded the \nsoldiers $85 million in damages, and more of the affected soldiers also \nhave lawsuits pending, so the damage awards, in my view, are likely to \nincrease significantly.\n  However, a recently declassified indemnification provision in the \ncontract between KBR and the U.S. military for work in Iraq passed all \nfinancial liability for misconduct from KBR to U.S. taxpayers, even in \ncases of--and I want to emphasize this--willful misconduct by KBR. \nThese provisions also provided for unlimited reimbursement of legal \ncosts incurred by KBR. In effect, the company--KBR--was handed a blank \ncheck drawn on the American taxpayer, and yesterday the company went to \ncourt to cash that check.\n  My amendment would prevent DOD from putting the American taxpayer on \nthe hook for the negligence of contractors without notifying Congress. \nOur soldiers know when they sign up that they are putting their lives \non the line, but they expect their commanders and the contractors \nworking beside them to not expose them to unnecessary risk.\n  Both the DOD inspector general and a jury have confirmed what Oregon \nsoldiers and I and other members of the Oregon congressional delegation \nhave been saying for years--that KBR failed to protect our soldiers \nfrom a known threat. We can't know if the fact that KBR had basically a \nget-out-of-jail-free card caused them to be negligent, but what we do \nknow is we shouldn't let this happen again.\n  My amendment was debated as part of the last DOD authorization bill, \nand my understanding is that it was actually acceptable to both sides, \nbut we weren't able to get it into the final bill. I hope now, \nespecially in light of today's news right over the wire services this \nmorning, we can agree to include this amendment before more of our \nbrave men and women in uniform are harmed by the actions of negligent \ncontractors who then try to pass the buck to American taxpayers.\n  I again thank Chairman Levin and his staff for their leadership, and \nI look forward to working with them, particularly on this amendment \nhere this afternoon.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Udall \namendment, of which I am very pleased to be a cosponsor. I want to \nstart, though, by thanking our terrific chairman, who we are so proud \nis from Michigan, and the distinguished ranking member for all their \nhard work in putting together what is incredibly important to support \nour troops and what they need, for their families' needs, and giving us \ntools for a strong defense.\n  Part of having a strong defense is making sure we give the military \nthe flexibility they need and deserve to use the fuels that make sense \nfor them and not tie their hands for any reason. As we go forward, we \nknow there are opportunities to both save lives and dollars by using a \nvariety of fuels. This amendment, by striking language that stops the \nmilitary from having that flexibility, is very important.\n  We all know our dependence on oil has serious costs in terms of \ndollars but, more importantly, in terms of lives. One in every 50 \nconvoys results in a U.S. casualty. We lose an American life from every \n50 convoys. Since 2003 more than 3,000 troops have been killed in those \nattacks. Most of the time, military leaders will tell us: We are moving \ntroops and moving fuel to be able to support the troops. So we need to \ngive the military opportunities, whether it is from new kinds of \nhydrogen fuel cells or biofuels or advanced batteries.\n  There is a tremendous amount of work that is happening in Michigan \nthrough TACOM and TARDEC, which\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\nare the arms of the Army that are doing the very important research and \ndevelopment of new technologies, and they have now developed advanced \nbattery technology they are using in the field that will save money and \nlives. So these are important things to be doing as we move forward to \nthe future, and the Udall amendment would guarantee we can continue to \ndo that.\n  The Navy estimates that they spend about $84 billion--$84 billion--\nevery year protecting oil supplies. Think about that--not being able to \ndo what we need to do on the front lines in terms of defense but just \nprotecting the oil supplies, shipping lanes, and commercial vessels in \nthe Persian Gulf region alone.\n  Again, this amendment would save lives, save money, and it would \nallow the Department of Defense to move forward on these new \ntechnologies, such as hydrogen, E85, and biofuel blends for flex-fuel \nvehicles such as the ones we are building in Michigan. These new \ntechnologies are our future. They are our future in jobs, and they \ncertainly are our future as it relates to saving dollars and getting us \noff foreign oil and, as I said before, are so important to our military \nand to all of us in saving American lives.\n  The operational benefits of using different kinds of fuel are \nenormous. We have research going on in Michigan right now around \nadvanced batteries. I was pleased to be there at the launch of the \nfirst advanced-battery Jeeps going into the field, allowing those \nconvoys of trucks to be brought down to a much smaller level and thus \nstopping the endangerment over the years of thousands of our troops. \nShorter supply lines means more flexibility for our men and women in \nuniform and less danger for them on the front lines.\n  I strongly support the Udall amendment. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor. This will give our military the flexibility they need to \naccomplish their mission. Why in the world would we want to limit the \nflexibility of our military as they move forward to the next generation \nof new technologies to save dollars and lives?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Hagan, Kerry, Begich, and Franken be added as cosponsors of my \namendment No. 2985.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I believe we are reaching the \nend of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All Democratic time has expired.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I would add just a couple final remarks.\n  I think we have heard a compelling reason to remove section 313 from \nthe National Defense Authorization Act. National security is energy \nsecurity and vice versa. Let's stand with our military leadership, \nlet's stand with our NCOs, and let's stand with our enlisted personnel \nand ensure that the military can continue to invest in this important \narea of energy security which will save lives, create economic \nopportunity, and make sure we can project force abroad and protect the \nvalues we hold so dear.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment at 2:00 p.m. We have \na tentative agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is not a tentative agreement; there is \na unanimous consent order that we are going to vote at 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment at 2 p.m.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair, what are we \nwaiting for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To get on the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment introduced by \nSenator Udall of Colorado. The purpose of this amendment is to strike \nsection 313 from the National Defense Authorization Act that would \nplace undue restrictions on Department of Defense's alternative energy \ninvestments. This provision, during our committee mark-up, passed by \nthe closest of margins by a 13-12 vote.\n  Section 313 aims to block the Department from purchasing or producing \nalternative fuels if the cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels. \nThis would force key decisions regarding energy security to be made \nexclusively on the basis of cost, without regard for the mission, \nmilitary capability, or circumstance.\n  Maybe the intent of section 313 to kill the alternative fuel project \ncurrently being conducted under the authority of the Defense Production \nAct, Title III. However, the impact this provision would have on our \nmilitary operators, creates a real strategic vulnerability to our men \nand women on the ground, which reach far beyond biofuels. For example, \nif the Department wanted to deploy a hydrogen-fueled unmanned aerial \nvehicle that could operate for an extended duration in a combat zone, \nthis amendment would prevent that since the cost of hydrogen fuel may \nbe higher than a traditional fossil fuel. Or if the Department wanted \nto generate fuel or energy at tactical locations, including waste-to-\nenergy technology, which the DOD is exploring today, section 313 would \nagain prevent that. Section 313 may also prevent the Department from \npurchasing non-traditional fossil fuels, such as E85 or B20 biofuel \nblends, for flex fuel vehicles. Potentially, any fuel which is not a \n``traditional fossil fuel'' could be affected.\n  Mr. President, the sponsors of section 313 have focused on current \nhigh costs associated with the production of alternative fuels. \nHowever, Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, has already testified before \nthe Armed Services Committee that the Navy will not purchase any \nalternative fuel for operational purposes until they are cost-\ncompetitive with traditional fossil fuels. It's as simple as that. The \nDepartment is positioning itself to take advantage of drop-in \nalternative fuels when they are cost competitive with traditional \nfossil fuels. This is a prudent insurance policy that requires \ninvestments today, which section 313 would prevent.\n  For years now, the Department has been subjected to significant \nspikes in the global price of oil, which has created huge bills to pay, \nleaving less funding for training exercises, flying hours, steaming \ndays, and other negative impacts to readiness. The Department estimates \nthat for every 25 cent increase in the prices of a gallon of oil, it \ncosts the DOD an additional $1 billion to cover the costs, whether it \nis a result of foreign actions or natural disasters such as Hurricane \nKatrina. The advancement of a reliable, domestic energy source such as \nbiofuel would provide us with a safeguard against such unpredictable \nexpenses. In my view, global price volatility is a burden the \nDepartment should not be subjected to, particularly if it can be \navoided by establishing a viable domestic alternative. Yet section 313 \nappears designed to ensure that the DOD remains entirely dependent upon \ntraditional fossil fuels.\n  Admittedly, the current price for alternative fuel is high. For \nexample, the Navy purchased biofuel this past July for demonstration \npurposes at approximately $16 per gallon. Yet small batches of any new \ntechnology are expensive, as that is the very nature of research and \ndevelopment. With time to develop a domestic alternative fuel market, \nthe costs of alternative fuels will continue to drop, as the price has \nalready been cut in half since 2009. Furthermore, our military has a \nrich history of innovation. Investments in technology such as global \npositioning services, microchips, and the Internet have each carried \nwith them significant up-front costs, but have ultimately paid sizeable \ndividends far beyond their initial military usage.\n  The Navy has a notable and effective track record in the arena of \nalternative fuel development, going back to when the Navy first \nswitched from sails to steam and coal in the 1850s. Once again from \ncoal to oil around the time of World War I, and in the 1950s from oil \nto nuclear propulsion for aircraft carriers and submarines. And each \nperiod has had its complement of critics. Yet think of where we would \nbe today without that long-term eye toward innovation and military \ncapability.\n  In section 313 there is yet another practical problem in its \nexception clause, which allows the Department to continue engine or \nfleet certification of 50/50 fuel blends. That is far too narrow\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\nto cover the wide-ranging array of research and development activities \nconducted by the Department. In the future, it may be determined that \nthe proper ratio for a weapons platform requires a blend of 60/40, or \n70/30. Limiting the DOD to only 50/50 blends would put an entirely \narbitrary restriction upon the Department, and is simply not wise.\n  Mr. President, the DOD and Secretary Mabus have told us that the \ndevelopment of a domestic capability to produce cost-competitive \nadvanced drop-in biofuels at a commercial scale is important to our \nlong-term national security. It is a core defense need. We were also \nreminded of our strategic vulnerability to fossil fuels and the need to \nimprove our energy security in the last iteration of the 2010 \nQuadrennial Defense Review. There are valid questions concerning how \nmuch a gallon of biofuel will cost in the long run compared to a \ntraditional fossil fuel. Last year alone, the DOD purchased billions of \ngallons of fuel at a cost of $15.3 billion to conduct worldwide \nmilitary operations. And we now pay 225 percent more for fossil fuel \nthan we did just 10 years ago. And 12 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct goes to fuel for automobiles. By striking section 313, we allow \nthe DOD the freedom to pursue a domestic production capability and it \nis a smart long-term investment.\n  Keeping section 313 would hinder efforts currently underway to \ncurtail our reliance on foreign oil by fostering a domestic biofuel \ncapacity. Those in opposition to the Department's alternative energy \ninvestments have argued that the cost of these initiatives is too high. \nThey claim that the money would be better spent on other priorities \nwithin the DOD. Mr. President, these arguments are shortsighted. The \nDepartment has told us that investment in alternative fuels represents \nless than 4 percent of the Department's total planned investment in \noperational energy initiatives over the next 5 years, and less than 0.6 \npercent of what the Department spent on fuel last year. Our military \nleaders have stated time and again that it is in our national security \ninterest to make these strategic investments, that there is a concrete \nneed to increase flexibility and insulate our forces against volatility \nin the global oil market. For the future, our men and women in uniform \nwill need alternative fuels to keep our supplies diverse and effective, \nespecially for our legacy fleet of ships and planes, which will be with \nus for decades to come. The DOD has been examining, testing, and \ncertifying alternative fuels for operational use since 2003. Last July, \nthe Navy successfully demonstrated biofuels with no operational \ndifferences in the performance of their ships and aircraft. These \nefforts are relatively small, yet an important part of the Department's \nstrategy to improve energy security.\n  Section 313 is in direct conflict with these goals. Reducing our \ndependence on fossil fuels is a strategic vision that has been \narticulated and embraced in the past on a bipartisan basis--by \nPresident George W. Bush in his 2006 State of the Union Address and by \na large bipartisan majority in Congress in the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007. That bipartisan path is still the best approach \ntoday.\n  I thank Senator Udall and the co-sponsors for introducing this \nimportant amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to \nensure that our military has the flexibility necessary to meet their \nenergy requirements and bolster our national security, by striking \nsection 313.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I understand Senator Baucus and Senator \nMurray are on their way and wish 5 minutes each to speak relative to \nthis amendment. I ask unanimous consent that between now and 1 o'clock, \nthey be allocated 5 minutes each and that the amendment then still \nwould be the pending amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed to the amendment of \nSenator McCain and that when those two Senators arrive and are \nrecognized, they be allowed to speak for 5 minutes each on the Udall \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request for extra \ntime for Senator Baucus and Senator Murray?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Webb \nbe added as a cosponsor to Senator McCain's amendment that he is now \ngoing to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3051\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3051 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Portman, proposes an amendment numbered 3051 to S. 3254.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize additional Marine Corps personnel for the \n    performance of security functions for United States embassies, \n          consulates, and other diplomatic facilities abroad)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 402. ADDITIONAL MARINE CORPS PERSONNEL FOR THE MARINE \n                   CORPS SECURITY GUARD PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Additional Personnel.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall develop and \n     implement a plan which shall increase the number of Marine \n     Corps personnel assigned to the Marine Corps Embassy Security \n     Group at Quantico, Virginia, and Marine Security Group \n     Regional Commands and Marine Security Group detachments at \n     United States missions around the world by up to 1,000 \n     Marines during fiscal years 2014 through 2017.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the increase under paragraph \n     (1) shall be to provide the end strength and resources \n     necessary to support an increase in Marine Corps security at \n     United States consulates and embassies throughout the world, \n     and in particular at locations identified by the Secretary of \n     State as in need of increased security in light of threats to \n     United States personnel and property by terrorists.\n       (b) Consultation.--The Secretary of Defense shall develop \n     and implement the plan required by subsection (a) in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State pursuant to the \n     responsibility of the Secretary of State for diplomatic \n     security under section 103 of the Diplomatic Security Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 4802), and in accordance with any current memorandum \n     of understanding between the Department of State and the \n     Marine Corps on the operational and administrative \n     supervision of the Marine Corps Security Guard Program.\n       (c) Funding.--\n       (1) Budget requests.--The budget of the President for each \n     fiscal year after fiscal year 2013, as submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, \n     shall set forth as separate line elements, under the amounts \n     requested for such fiscal year for each of procurement, \n     operation and maintenance, and military personnel to fully \n     fund each of the following:\n       (A) The Marine Corps.\n       (B) The Marine Corps Security Guard Program, including for \n     the additional personnel under the Marine Corps Security \n     Guard Program as result of the plan required by subsection \n     (a).\n       (2) Preservation of funding for usmc under national \n     military strategy.--In determining the amounts to be \n     requested for a fiscal year for the Marine Corps Security \n     Guard Program and for additional personnel under the Marine \n     Corps Security Guard Program under paragraph (1), the \n     President shall ensure that amounts requested for the Marine \n     Corps for that fiscal year do not degrade the readiness of \n     the Marine Corps to fulfill the requirements of the National \n     Military Strategy.\n       (d) Reports.--\n       (1) Reports on program.--Not later than October 1, 2014, \n     and annually thereafter through October 1, 2017, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall, in coordination with the \n     Secretary of State, submit to Congress a report on the Marine \n     Corps Security Guard Program. Each report shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) A description of the expanded security support provided \n     by Marine Corps Security Guards to the Department of State \n     during the fiscal year ending on the date of such report, \n     including--\n       (i) any increased internal security provided at United \n     States embassies and consulates throughout the world;\n       (ii) any increased support for emergency action planning, \n     training, and advising of host nation security forces; and\n       (iii) any expansion of intelligence collection activities.\n       (B) A description of the current status of Marine Corps \n     personnel assigned to the Program as a result of the plan \n     required by subsection (a).\n       (C) A description of the Department of Defense resources \n     required in the fiscal year ending on the date of such report \n     to support the Marine Corps Security Guard program,\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\n     including total end strength and key supporting programs that \n     enable both its current and expanded mission during such \n     fiscal year.\n       (D) A reassessment of the mission of the Program, as well \n     as procedural rules of engagement under the Program, in light \n     of current and emerging threats to United States diplomatic \n     personnel, and a description and assessment of options to \n     improve the Program to respond to such threats.\n       (E) An assessment of the feasibility and advisability of \n     authorizing, funding, and administering the Program as a \n     separate program within the Marine Corps, and if such actions \n     are determined to be feasible and advisable, recommendations \n     for legislative and administrative actions to provide for \n     authorizing, funding, and administering the Program as a \n     separate program within the Marine Corps.\n       (2) Report on changes in scope of program in response to \n     changing threats.--If the President determines that a \n     modification (whether an increase or a decrease) in the scope \n     of the Marine Corps Security Guard Program is necessary or \n     advisable in light of any change in the nature of threats to \n     United States embassies, consulates and other diplomatic \n     facilities abroad, the President shall--\n       (A) notify Congress of such modification and the change in \n     the nature of threats prompting such modification; and\n       (B) take such modification into account in requesting an \n     end strength and funds for the Program for any fiscal year in \n     which such modification is in effect.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This amendment is to authorize additional Marine Corps \npersonnel for the performance of security functions for the U.S. \nEmbassies, consulates, and other diplomatic facilities abroad.\n  The tragic events in Benghazi on September 11 and the ongoing tumult \nthroughout the Middle East and north Africa should serve as a stark \nreminder that the security environment confronting American personnel \nserving in U.S. Embassies and consulates abroad is as dangerous as any \ntime I can remember.\n  Despite claims by some, al-Qaida and its affiliates remain dangerous \nand determined to kill Americans. This reality must force us to \nreassess the threat to U.S. Embassies and consulates around the world \nand provide additional resources and military end strength; that is, \nU.S. marines, to increase protection of diplomatic personnel from those \nthreats. This amendment will do that. It will provide the necessary end \nstrength and resources to support an increase in Marine Corps security \nat U.S. Embassies and consulates throughout the world--up to 1,000 \nadditional personnel--in particular at locations identified by the \nSecretary of State as in need of increased security in light of known \nand emerging threats to U.S. personnel and property by terrorists.\n  Most Americans believe that U.S. marines are stationed to protect our \nEmbassy personnel abroad, but I think they would be surprised to learn \nthat marines are assigned in only slightly more than half of our \ndiplomatic missions worldwide--182 missions in 137 countries. Moreover, \ntheir numbers are small. A typical detachment consists of only six \nmilitary Marine personnel. Today there are 126 U.S. diplomatic missions \noutside the United States without Marine Corps security protection, \nincluding parts of Asia and Africa where we suspect al-Qaida is \nexpanding its presence.\n  As the nature of threats to American diplomatic personnel is \nchanging, the Marine Corps security guard mission has not. The current \nmission of this program dates back to the post-war era of 1948, \nprincipally for the protection of classified information and equipment \nin diplomatic facilities.\n  The Marine Security Guard Program is also the only Marine Corps \nprogram that is under the operational command of the Department of \nState. For this reason, this amendment would also require the President \nto present discrete budget requests for Marine Corps security personnel \noverseas in support of diplomatic personnel and Marine Corps end \nstrength and resources required to maintain readiness to protect our \nnational security. These are distinct missions, and increasing one--as \nis necessary in light of the attack in Benghazi--cannot come at the \nexpense of another.\n  Americans may believe our marines are the first line of defense in \nattacks on diplomatic compounds overseas. The truth is that they are \nnot. They are not mandated to engage with attackers and in some cases \nmay not be permitted to engage. For this reason, this amendment calls \non the Department of Defense to reassess this mission and rules of \nengagement as we increase our capability to protect embassies and \nconsulates throughout the world.\n  As the world now knows, there were no marine guards at the consulate \nat Benghazi at the time of the September 11 attack despite the rapidly \ndeteriorating security situation. Would their presence have made a \ndifference and saved the lives of our heroic Ambassador and his \nsecurity personnel? I think I know the answer to that question, and so \ndo the American people.\n  So I think it is time for the administration to rapidly complete a \nreassessment of the risk to U.S. personnel conducting diplomacy abroad \nposed by terrorists and others wishing to do us harm and ensure that \npersonnel at all 285 missions, not just 182, have adequate protection, \nincluding by U.S. marines. I am not saying this amendment requires that \nmarine presence at every one of these missions. What we are saying is \nthat as a result of the risk assessments, we have sufficient \nauthorization and appropriation for adequate protection, part of \nwhich--and a major part--is the presence of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  I call on my colleagues to fulfill the mission of the Marine Security \nGuard Program to ensure that U.S. personnel are protected and authorize \nthe necessary end strength and resources for the Marine Corps to \nachieve this necessary goal.\n  Mr. President, at this time I yield to Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2985\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nallowing me to speak about an amendment we are going to be voting on at \n2 o'clock. I wish to express my concerns with provisions in the Defense \nauthorization bill that we are currently considering that would limit \nthe Department of Defense in investing in alternative fuels.\n  This underlying bill is a very important piece of legislation. I have \nalways supported it to make sure our military has the equipment and \nresources and effective policies it needs to perform its mission. But I \ncan't support the inclusion of provisions that would severely limit the \nDepartment's ability to use alternative fuels. I strongly believe those \nlimitations will cause lasting harm to our national security and our \nmilitary readiness and our efforts to decrease American dependence on \nforeign oil. That is why we are considering an amendment that I \ncosponsored that will strike one of those troubling provisions in \nsection 313 of the committee-passed bill.\n  As many of our colleagues are aware, DOD is the single largest \nconsumer of oil in the world, using over 355,000 barrels of oil per day \nin fiscal year 2011. Even though we have increased the domestic supply \nof traditional fossil fuels here in the United States, the price of oil \nis still set on the global market. That means that DOD's fuel bill was \nsignificantly more than it had budgeted for, mostly, of course, due to \nthe price of fuel being higher than expected. In fact, in fiscal year \n2012, the Navy alone was $500 million over its budget for fuel, and \nthat is just one of our services. So what does that mean? It means our \nmilitary leaders have had to pull billions of dollars from operational \naccounts in recent years, which has led to decreased unit readiness, \ndeferred maintenance on some of their critical equipment, and less \ntraining for our troops preparing for deployment into harm's way. \nConveniently, critics of biofuels leave out these very real threats \nwhen they insist on the kinds of harmful policies the amendment we are \noffering addresses.\n  It is true that alternative fuels will not replace fossil fuels in \nthe immediate future, but it is also true that replacing even a \nfraction of the oil consumed by the Department of Defense with domestic \nalternative fuels will advance our national security and our military \nreadiness, it will save many millions of dollars, and it will protect \nthe Department from the price volatility of the global oil market and \nspur a domestic industry that will decrease our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Some of our colleagues have said this is all about the cost of \nalternative fuel, and they will likely use some misleading figures \nattributed to a training\n\n[[Page S7007]]\n\nexercise that actually, by the way, ended up proving these types of \nfuels work seamlessly. But the truth is that the cost of biofuels has \ndecreased by over 50 percent in the last 2 years alone. The truth is \nthat the test fuel purchase they like to mention was only 0.3 percent \nof the Navy's annual fuel bill. And the truth is that those concerns \nover costs don't take into account the very real and very high price of \ninaction and continued dependence on oil.\n  I mentioned earlier that the Department uses 355,000 barrels of oil \nevery day. The Department estimates that for every 25-cent increase in \nthe price per gallon of oil, it will spend over $1 billion in \nadditional fuel costs. Given the high price of oil and gas, that is not \na bet I want to make long term.\n  We are facing difficult fiscal times, as everyone here knows, and the \nDepartment of Defense, like the rest of the Federal Government, has to \nmake sure it is responsibly spending taxpayer dollars--today and \ntomorrow. The Department's efforts to develop alternative fuels is in \nkeeping with the best traditions of military technology development \nprograms.\n  In the past, programs have brought us products that have benefited \nboth DOD and the civilian users, such as GPS or jet engines, microwave \novens, and cell phones. Our Navy pioneered the transition from sails to \ncoal, from coal to oil, and from oil to nuclear power. I know we can \nmake the next leap to alternative fuels--and we need to.\n  Our Nation's reliance on foreign oil is a significant and well-\nrecognized military vulnerability. Our military leaders are telling us \nthe ability to use fuels other than petroleum is critical to our \nnational energy security. The Department is strongly opposed to the \nlanguage limiting its flexibility in the committee-passed bill, and DOD \nsupports our amendment.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us and support the amendment we will be \nvoting on shortly and strike this troubling provision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3051\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the following Senators be added \nas cosponsors to my amendment No. 3051: Senators Inhofe, Ayotte, Brown \nof Massachusetts, and Webb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Boxer also \nbe allocated 5 minutes to speak on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, are we going to voice-vote the amendment \nat this time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Can I ask the Senator from Montana if he wishes to speak \non the Udall amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on Senator \nMcCain's amendment No. 3051. We are not quite ready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2985\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friends from Michigan and \nArizona for their gracious willingness to find an opportunity for me to \nmake a brief statement.\n  I rise today in strong support of the amendment to protect the \nmilitary's ability to purchase American-made fuels.\n  Powering our military with American-made energy makes our country \nsafer and our economy stronger. Tying our hands and forcing the \nAmerican military to depend on foreign oil is short-sighted and \ndangerous. Instead, we need to give our commanders the flexibility to \npower our military with homegrown energy, like Montana camelina that \nsupports jobs right here in America.\n  The Department of Defense is the largest single user of oil in the \nworld--consuming more than 355,000 barrels of oil per day last year. \nDespite increased domestic production of fossil fuels, rising global \nprices and market volatility caused DOD's fuel bill to rise by more \nthan $19 billion in 2011. The trend is expected to continue.\n  This is why I strongly support the efforts of our military leaders--\nthat is what they want--to develop and employ alternative fuels. Our \nmilitary leaders recognize the problem of rising fuel costs and \ndependence on foreign oil. The Pentagon's largest energy user, the Air \nForce, has established a goal of purchasing half of its domestically \nconsumed aviation fuel from alternative sources by the end of 2016. The \nNavy has also invested in the F-18 Green Hornet program--a fighter jet \npowered by a biofuel blend.\n  The DOD relies on a sustainable biofuel market to meet its goal of \nlessening the nation's dependence on foreign oil. It is very important \nto the Pentagon. Regrettably, a provision in the underlying bill will \nlimit our military's ability to develop alternative fuels.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle are concerned that this section of \nthe Committee-passed bill would cause harm to our national security and \nmilitary readiness. That is why I am fighting to allow the Pentagon to \nenter into long-term deals to buy biofuels as long as they are made \nright here in the USA.\n  Montana is in the perfect position to provide the homegrown fuels our \nNation needs to move toward energy security.\n  There is clearly a demand from both the military and the private \nsector to use American-made biofuels.\n  In 2011, the Navy, the Department of Energy and the Department of \nAgriculture aimed to assist the development and support of a \nsustainable commercial biofuels industry. They investigated the \ndevelopment biofuels as alternatives to diesel and jet fuels.\n  The agreement included Montana farmers and corporations. Limitations \nplaced on our military's procurement of alternative fuel would be \ndetrimental to Montana's alternative fuel industry.\n  As a result of investing in biofuels, renewable Montana-grown crops \nlike camelina have been used by our military as the predominate \nfeedstock for biofuel blends. I call these freedom fuels. Why? Because \nthey help get us off of foreign oil and help bring good paying jobs to \nMontana.\n  Researchers at Montana State University Northern in Havre, MT showed \nearly that camelina to be a promising dryland crop for use in biodiesel \nand other bioproducts. Camelina, also known as ``Gold of Pleasure,'' is \nan oilseed crop that includes canola, mustard and broccoli. The small-\nseeded, cool-climate crop has been grown in Europe and the Northern \nplains of the United States.\n  Since its initial production, the cost per gallon of camelina-based \nfuel in Montana has dropped annually by half.\n  That is another reason why I think it makes sense to ramp up our \ndomestic energy production, whether it is biofuels wind, coal, oil, \nnatural gas, or hydropower. We need an energy policy that puts America \nback in control. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil and work \nto develop all of our domestic resources--just like we have in my State \nof Montana.\n  Alternative fuels will not replace fossils fuels all-together--no \nway. However, replacing even a small fraction of fuel consumed by our \nmilitary with alternative fuels made here in the United States can \nimprove strategic flexibility, insulate the defense budget from spikes \nin the cost fossil fuels, create good-paying jobs for Americans, and \nmake the United States a more secure nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer \nbe allocated 5 minutes of debate time on the Udall amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3051\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are waiting for just one further word on the McCain \namendment. We hope to be able to voice-vote that in the next few \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the matter of Senator Boxer, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 3051) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while we are waiting for \nfurther debate on the Defense authorization bill and any possible \namendments, I wanted to offer a couple of comments regarding all of the \nconcern in the Nation about the fiscal cliff as we approach that \nfateful day of December 31 and the need to get something done.\n  In the opinion of this Senator, sequestration, which is this \nadditional cut of $1 trillion in a most unorthodox way, is like a meat \ncleaver coming down and cutting off--I am rounding here--$\\1/2\\ \ntrillion off defense and $\\1/2\\ trillion off nondefense discretionary. \nSequestration, let us remember, in the historical context was never \nsupposed to happen. Sequestration was a mechanism that was set up in \nthe Budget Control Act in August 2011, almost a year and a half ago. \nThe act called for $1 trillion to be cut off of the top to begin with, \nand it set up a process by which additional deficit reduction over a \n10-year period would occur. That process was--after the $1 trillion was \nwhacked off, which it already has been--a supercommittee of six from \nthe House and six from the Senate would deliberate and a majority vote \nof that committee of 12 could determine additional deficit reduction \nthat would apply over the next 10 years.\n  To give a little incentive for that supercommittee not to deadlock, \nthe process of sequestration was set up which, in effect, was this meat \ncleaver that in a nondiscriminate way was going to drop a meat ax \napproach of another $\\1/2\\ trillion out of defense and $\\1/2\\ trillion \nout of nondefense discretionary, which nobody wanted. It was never \ncontemplated sequestration was going to go into effect because the \neffects were going to be so onerous that surely people of goodwill \ncould come together on a 12-member committee and not deadlock. But, \ninstead, at least one would provide the majority, even if it were only \n7 to 5 out of the 12, because the alternative was so unpalatable.\n  Of course, we know what happened. People of goodwill, in this highly \ncharged atmosphere of the coming Presidential election--this is almost \na year and a half ago--could not agree. The ugly head of excessive \npartisanship raised itself, and the ugly head of excessive ideological \nrigidity raised itself, and the supercommittee deadlocked 6 to 6 which, \nunder the law, left the meat cleaver to drop, the budget meat ax to \ndrop. That is what we are facing today. We are facing something that \nnobody ever intended to go into effect.\n  So how do we get out of this? We have people of goodwill that have to \nbe reasonable and utilize a little common sense, lessen their \npartisanship, lessen their ideological rigidity. That is the atmosphere \nunder which we can come together.\n  I wish to tell a story and then I am going to sit down. I wish to \ntell the story about one of the brightest shining moments in government \nwhich occurred back in 1983 when this Senator was a young Congressman. \nWe were within 6 months of Social Security running out of money. Two \nold Irishmen, one who was President, and his name was Reagan, and the \nother one who was Speaker, and his name was O'Neill, decided they were \ngoing to do something about this. They were reasonable people who could \noperate in a bipartisan way and in a nonideological way.\n  They said: What we are going to do is take this subject that is so \nthorny--namely, Social Security--so thorny at the time of elections, \nand we are going to take it off the table at the next election so as \nnot to use it as a hammer to beat your opponent over the head, and we \nare going to do it in the mechanism of a blue ribbon panel that is \ngoing to make recommendations on the solvency of Social Security.\n  That committee met. They reported to the Congress in a bipartisan \nway, and the Congress passed that recommendation overwhelmingly. The \nPresident signed it into law, and that made Social Security solvent for \nthe next 50-plus years from 1983. I think the most current estimates \nare that it is now something like 2034.\n  So we see what was done so effectively. But we have to have people of \ngood will who will come together and will do so with some common sense, \nwhich is what this place has not been operating on in a long while.\n\n  I wanted to share that memory of one of the great moments of \ngovernment working as our government is intended to work.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \napproximately 20,000 military families with loved ones on the autism \nspectrum. Sadly, thousands of these Americans suffering from autism are \nnot receiving the treatments that are the best practices that have been \ndetermined they need. These military families are receiving fewer \nservices than their civilian government counterparts across the \ncountry, many of whom have been rightly aided by laws passed in over 60 \npercent of our States representing over 75 percent of the country's \npopulation.\n  Autism places tremendous strains on our Nation's military families \nand nonmilitary families--including tremendous health, financial, and \nemotional tolls. I wish to share briefly just a couple stories from our \nbrave military families.\n  One veteran was severely wounded in Iraq while heroically serving our \ncountry. His injuries forced him to medically retire. Because he is \nretired, his autistic son Shane was no longer eligible to receive the \nABA services he had previously received. The wait list for Medicaid \nwaiver services is over 9 years. Shane's family had to sell their home \nto pay the roughly $5,000 per month of out-of-pocket expenses that the \nABA treatments require that he so desperately needs. The money is \nrunning out for their family, and their family's effort is only to do \nwhat is best for their son. Without any relief, we risk allowing brave \nmilitary families just like this one to fall through the cracks.\n  Another Active-Duty marine, who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan \nthree times, has maxed out his ABA care for therapy treatments to treat \nhis 11-year-old autistic son Joshua. Joshua is nonverbal and his safety \nis a key concern, so Joshua is prescribed 35 hours of these ABA therapy \ntreatments each week. Due to the severity of Joshua's symptoms, the \nfamily is faced with the nearly impossible decision of forgoing the \nrecommended care for their son or paying the bills out of pocket as \nlong as they are able to.\n  In my opinion--and it is shared by many families--this should never \nhappen to any child, but it should also particularly not happen to the \nchild of someone from our military service. That is why I am submitting \nan\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\namendment requiring TRICARE to cover medically recommended autism \ntreatments, including ABA therapy, in a manner that is consistent with \nbest practices so our military families, our heroes, get the care they \nneed for their children, children such as Shane and Joshua.\n  Every parent who has a child with autism faces challenges in ensuring \nthat their child has access to the treatments they desperately need. \nFor military families, these challenges are often compounded by \nfrequent deployments overseas, frequent movements to different bases \nacross State lines, and sometimes gaps in coverage.\n  Today, TRICARE coverage of ABA is severely limited. It is capped at \n$36,000 per year for an Active-Duty servicemember. This falls far below \nwhat is medically recommended. This care is limited to Active-Duty \nservicemembers only. Guard and Reserve families receive intermittent \ncare, and children of retirees cannot get any coverage at all.\n  As a consequence, military servicemembers must often turn to State-\nrun Medicaid programs to help their children, but these programs are \noften unavailable to a mobile military family because of the extensive \nwait lists. In Maryland, for example, the wait is 17 years long, \nessentially eliminating ABA coverage during the early development years \nwhen a child needs it most. The wait list in Virginia, for example, is \nover 10 years long.\n  Even more remarkable than TRICARE not covering these treatments is \nthat the Office of Personnel Management has already determined that \nsuch treatments may be covered as medical therapies for Federal \ncivilian employees. A recent court decision, which DOD is still \nreviewing and may appeal, determined that TRICARE must cover these \ntreatments, but this decision is being applied under the most narrow \ndefinition in the interim, limiting the potential pool of providers. \nThis amendment basically requires TRICARE to provide coverage and \ndeliver services in a manner that is consistent with best practices. \nThis would, thereby, improve access to care for our military families, \nand it would finally align TRICARE with the other types of coverage \nthat is available in civilian sectors.\n  We have a duty to stand by our military families and to address this \nvery difficult health issue that affects their children. When we ask \nour men and women to serve, we promise we will support them and their \nfamilies. This amendment simply fulfills that promise.\n  I also rise to speak about another issue concerning the armed \nservices authorization bill, and this is equally as serious and \ntroublesome; that is, the issue of sexual violence.\n  While the vast majority of our servicemembers serve our country \nhonorably and bravely and are simply the best our country has to offer, \nsexual violence in the military continues to occur at an alarming rate \nby a minority of servicemembers who should not be serving.\n  Despite Secretary Panetta's efforts to create a zero-tolerance policy \nin 2011, still more than 3,000 military sexual assaults were reported. \nBut the DOD's estimates themselves indicate that number is much closer \nto 19,000 cases.\n  In the words of DOD:\n\n       [Sexual violence in the military] is an affront to the \n     basic American values we defend, and may degrade military \n     readiness, subvert strategic goodwill, and forever change the \n     lives of victims and their families.\n\n  All our service branches have in place some version of a policy that \nsends convicted sex offenders to an administrative separation process \nfor discharge. However, the most recent Annual Report on Sexual Assault \nin the Military shows that in fiscal year 2011, 36 percent of convicted \nsex offenders remained in the Armed Services, despite these policies.\n  If one-third of convicted sex offenders within the military are being \nretained, then clearly we must do better. Creating a uniform standard \nto correct deficiencies in the respective branch policies would be a \ngood step forward.\n  Experts reviewing current policies have found that the Navy has \nestablished a mandatory policy that calls for administrative discharge \nof any personnel who are convicted of a sex offense.\n  My amendment would require the Department to oversee that each \nservice branch establish policies that would mandate servicemembers \nconvicted of a sex offense be processed for administrative separation. \nThis means each such perpetrator would get due process but that the \nprocess would be required.\n  This amendment is common sense, and it is one that would strengthen \nthe policies the services have actually already put in place and \nreinforce DOD's zero-tolerance policy.\n  I am very pleased Senators Collins and Snowe have joined me as \ncosponsors of this amendment, and I wish to thank them for their \nleadership.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cardin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2985\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the Udall \namendment. I have great admiration and respect for the Senator from \nColorado as well as his cousin who now presides. I have concerns about \nthis amendment that were raised during the committee markup. I think \nthey have become even more of a concern since that time period.\n  Let me begin by saying as someone who spent 5 years in the Pentagon, \none as a marine and four as a defense executive, I would hope that the \ntop order of business for our President as he begins his next term \nwould be to call for a reexamination, a rigorous reexamination of all \nof the programs in the Department of Defense.\n  In other words, not quite to zero-based but to examine the \njustifications for all of the programs that are in place with an eye \ntoward the realities of the future, I think we could benefit as a \ncountry. People who care about national security, but also care about \nthe tax bills they are getting, would benefit as well from something of \na triage of the programs in the Department of Defense.\n  We should ask the Secretary of Defense and his people who work--or \nher--with these programs to examine which programs in DOD are the must-\nhaves, which are absolutely vital to our national security, and which \nprograms are the need-to-haves, the programs that might place our \nnational security at some level of risk if they were to be altered or \nmodified. Then we also need to have some painful examination of \nprograms that might be called the nice-to-haves, those that are \nessentially ancillary to the harder definitions of national security, \neven though they have been supported.\n  I would say these, the costly biofuels programs, in the sense that we \nare proposing to fund them in the operational environment at this time, \nwould have to qualify as nice-to-haves. That does not mean we should \neliminate the biofuels programs. There is money in R to continue to \nexamine them.\n  But I will tell you, Mr. President, what a must-have is. A must-have \nis our shipbuilding program. When I was commissioned in the U.S. Marine \nCorps in 1968, we had 930 combatant ships in the U.S. Navy. By the time \nwe went into the post-Vietnam drawdowns, we had 479 combatants.\n  When I was Secretary of the Navy in 1987-1988, we were able to \nrebuild the Navy up to 568 combatants. Since that time, national \nstrategy has changed. Our commitments have changed, but the size of the \nNavy has been dramatically reduced down to the point where today it is \nabout 285 operational combatant vessels.\n  We have been trying, since I came to the Senate, to rebuild the Navy \nup to a\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\nminimum of 313 combatants. It is very difficult to do this when we have \nother programs in place that are not directly contributing to our \nnational security but are competing for programs.\n  I understand the concerns about energy independence. I also would \nlike to remind my colleagues of the advances we have made in this \ncountry in that area just over the past few years in a way that many of \nus could not even have imagined 6 years ago when I came to the Senate. \nThe International Energy Agency just made a report called ``The World \nEnergy Outlook,'' and in this report as summarized by Reuters the \nUnited States, according to their estimates, will overtake Saudi Arabia \nand Russia as the world's top oil producer by 2017.\n  IAEA Chief Economist Faith Birol told a news conference in London \nthat he believed the United States would overtake Russia as the biggest \ngas producer by a significant margin by 2015, and by 2017 it would \nbecome the world's largest oil producer.\n  Will this prediction hold out? I don't know, but are we on our way \ntoward significant gains in terms of our energy independence? Yes, we \nare. The language in section 313, which this amendment proposes to \nstrike--I want to be very clear about this--does not affect programs \nthat have been discussed here in such areas as hydrogen fuel as a fuel \nof choice for engine design or doing away with R dollars. It is just \nnot true.\n  It states, in part, that this restriction goes to the cost of \nproducing or purchasing alternative fuels if they exceed the cost of \nproducing traditional fossil fuel that would be used for the same \npurpose--very narrowly defined.\n  There is a second paragraph in section 313 that goes to an exception \nto this program, which only applies to 50-50 blends of fuels. I \npersonally believe that section should be modified and actually could \nbe modified in conference. I think it is too narrow. But in general \nthis is not a paragraph that totally does away with the biofuels \nprogram in the Department of Defense.\n  We have to make decisions. We have to get competitive programs into \nthe Department of Defense. We must increase the readiness. We are not \nproposing to decrease the research and development programs. For those \nreasons, I will be opposing this amendment with the hope that we can \ncontinue the R programs for biofuels.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to be very proud to support \namendment No. 2985. I think it has to do with our military readiness; I \nthink it has to do with our national security; and I think that the \nfact that we have this opportunity is commendable. I thank Senator \nUdall for it.\n  Striking section 313 is important because that section harms DOD's \nability to diversify its fuel supplies by developing and using \neffective alternative fuels.\n  Now, lots of colleagues can come down here and proclaim this isn't \nimportant or it is important. You know what. I want to listen to the \nDOD themselves and what they say. There was an Armed Forces press \nservice news report in July 2012, and this is what they said:\n\n       Smart investing and less reliance on petroleum-based fuels \n     will help ensure an agile, lethal, and adaptable combat \n     force, and, ultimately, national security.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I was distraught when I heard that the Armed \nServices Committee, by one vote, put in the section that would stop the \nability of the DOD to invest in these very important fuels so they can \nhave an ``agile, lethal, and adaptable combat force and, ultimately, \nnational security.''\n  Now this is coming from the DOD. Why on Earth would anyone support \nsomething that the DOD tried to take away, the ability of the DOD to \nhave an agile force?\n  I don't understand it. I can't understand it. The report also quotes \nAssistant Secretary of Defense Sharon Burke who said:\n\n       The department is going to have ships, planes and vehicles \n     that were designed to use petroleum fuels for a very long \n     time to come. . . . [Alternative fuels] investment ensures \n     our equipment can operate on a wide range of fuels, and \n     that's important for our readiness over the long term.\n\n  How many wars do we have to have over oil?\n  How many wars do we have over oil? I can tell you a story from a \ncolleague of mine who said he went up to the White House when George W. \nBush was President before the Iraq war, and George W. Bush had pictures \nof all the oil wells in Iraq.\n  If anyone says there was no connection to oil and that war, I would \nsay they are wrong. I have met with many veterans who say the same \nthing. They don't want to go and fight and die for oil.\n  So this is of critical importance, this vote. There is no more \nimportant mission for the Department of Defense than to fight and win \nbattles needed to defend our Nation and return our troops home safely \nto their families.\n  Section 313 could undercut the ability of the Department of Defense \nto achieve these goals.\n  In a letter to Senator Udall, Vice Admiral Cullom said:\n\n       Section 313--\n\n  That's the section we are trying to strike--\n\n       Section 313 is overly broad and has the potential to \n     restrict investments that would address tactical and \n     operational needs for our Navy. . . . As fuel technologies \n     advance, the Navy may wish to test and satisfy multiple types \n     of alternative fuel, including some that might be 100 percent \n     alternative fuel, not a blend.\n\n  Why would anyone in this Senate want to stop us from developing \nalternative fuels? I don't get it. We are trying so hard to become \nenergy independent. We have made great success under President Obama \nwith fuel economy in place and investment in alternative energy.\n  The military says it is important for them to ``ensure an agile, \nlethal and adaptable combat force, and ultimately, national security.'' \nTheir words. In addition to everything else, this is a need that the \nmilitary has definitely outlined for us.\n  A Statement of Administration Policy on the House Defense \nauthorization bill, which contains a nearly identical provision, says \nthat affecting DOD's ability to procure alternative fuels in this way \nwould ``further increase America's reliance on fossil fuels, thereby \ncontributing to geopolitical instability and endangering our interests \nabroad.''\n  Some of the same people who called for boycotts on Iran, which I \nsupport, somehow believe it is not important for us to be free from \nreliance on those kinds of countries for our oil. It makes no sense. We \ncan't make these compartments. We are going after countries that have \noil, and we are right to do it because they are dangerous, many of \nthem. We are embargoing. We have embargoes on many of them. We have \nsanctions on many of them. At the same time, with the other hand we are \nsaying to the DOD: Forget about alternative fuels. It makes no sense \nfrom a national security perspective.\n  In addition to harming the military's ability to achieve its goals \nthat I have outlined here, that were written very clearly by the \nDefense Department itself, section 313 precludes research into fuels \nsuch as hydrogen, which has the potential to power some military \nvehicles over much longer missions.\n  I have been around a while. Something tells me Big Oil is calling the \nshots. I would hope not, but I don't understand why this section, which \nSenator Udall is trying to strike, is in this bill when the military \nsays it is critical for them to continue this program.\n  The section could also prevent DOD from purchasing fuels that are \nsold today in the United States, such as E-85, which is 85 percent \nethanol. The Department of Defense has flex-fuel vehicles in its suite \nthat can run on E-85.\n  Can you imagine going after that as well? It would restrict DOD's \nefforts to develop technologies to generate fuel at tactical locations, \nincluding waste to energy. These are precisely the types of \ntechnologies in which the Nation should be investing.\n  I thank Senator Udall for bringing this to our attention. This is a \nvery important amendment, perhaps one of the most important I have \nvoted on in a long time.\n  I will close by saying this: If you believe this country should be \nenergy independent, then vote with Senator Udall. If you believe it is \ndangerous for us to rely on oil from countries who want to cause us \nharm, then you\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\nshould support the Udall amendment. If you believe it is good for our \nhealth, our environment, to invest in alternative energy, then vote for \nthe Udall amendment. It is a win-win-win and, most of all, the military \ntells us we should continue this program. It is important so that we \nhave an agile, adaptable force, and it is important for our national \nsecurity.\n  I will be proud to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Colorado \nis recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

I was going to add something further to the request, and \nthat is that there be 5 minutes of debate on the Gillibrand amendment \nand then Senator Mikulski be recognized to speak as in morning business \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator will suspend for a moment.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I request my amendment be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Gillibrand], for herself, \n     Ms. Collins, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3016.\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the processing for administrative separation \n from the Armed Forces of members who are convicted of certain sexual \noffenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and not punitively \n            discharged in connection with such convictions)\n\n       On page 138, strike lines 14 through 20 and insert the \n     following:\n       (8) A requirement that each Secretary of a military \n     department establish policies that require that each member \n     of the Armed Forces under the jurisdiction of such Secretary \n     whose conviction for a covered offense is final and who is \n     not punitively discharged from the Armed Forces in connection \n     with such conviction be processed for administrative \n     separation from the Armed Forces, which requirement shall not \n     be interpreted to limit or alter the authority of such \n     Secretary to process members of the Armed Forces for \n     administrative separation for other offenses or under other \n     provisions of law.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``covered offense'' means the following:\n       (A) Rape or sexual assault under subsection (a) or (b) of \n     section 920 of title 10, United States Code (article 120 of \n     the Uniform Code of Military Justice).\n       (B) Forcible sodomy under section 925 of title 10, United \n     States Code (article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice).\n       (C) An attempt to commit an offense specified in \n     subparagraph (A) or (B) under section 880 of title 10, United \n     States Code (article 80 of the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice).\n       (2) The term ``special victim offenses'' means offenses \n     involving allegations of any of the following:\n       (A) Child abuse.\n       (B) Rape, sexual assault, or forcible sodomy.\n       (C) Domestic violence involving aggravated assault.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment \nthat I believe is on an incredibly urgent matter.\n  Today the vast majority, almost all of our servicemembers, serve this \ncountry so honorably, so bravely. But there is a very small number who \ndo not, who are engaging in sexual assault in the military. Despite \nSecretary Panetta's efforts to have a zero tolerance policy in this \ncountry, in 2011 alone there were 3,000 military assaults reported, and \nthe Secretary of Defense reports the real number is much closer to \n19,000 assaults. In the words of the DOD, sexual violence in the \nmilitary ``is an affront to the basic American values we defend, and \nmay degrade military readiness, subverts our strategic goodwill, and \nforever changes the lives of victims and their families.''\n  My amendment is very simple. Today each of the services have policies \nthat address this issue, but the one that the Navy has is the best. My \namendment requires the Department to oversee that each of the service \nbranches has established a policy that would mandate that \nservicemembers convicted of sexual offenses will be processed for \nadministrative separation.\n  The reason this is so important is because one-third of convicted \nsexual offenders in the military are still retained. They are still \nserving. So, obviously, we must do better. We need a uniform standard \nto correct these deficiencies in the respective branch policies to be \nable to serve our military families and our military members as we \nshould.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the \nGillibrand amendment.\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I would like to say Senator Collins \nand Senator Snowe are cosponsors of this amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of this \namendment, which will require that every military service must \nestablish a crystal-clear, zero-tolerance policy that military \npersonnel who are convicted of a sexual offense will not be permitted \nto continue to serve our Nation in uniform.\n  According to the Department of Defense, approximately 3,000 sexual \nassaults were reported in the military in 2011. Yet some estimate that \nthe actual number of sexual assaults in our military in 2011 is closer \nto 19,000, accounting for the terrible reality that many attacks are \nnever reported. Without question, this is an entirely unacceptable \nsituation, and is another compelling reason that the Department of \nDefense, as well as Congress, must continue to do what is necessary to \neliminate, once and for all, sexual assaults from occurring within our \nmilitary ranks.\n  Unfortunately, as my colleague Senator Gillibrand has noted, each of \nthe services have different policies for dealing with military \npersonnel who are convicted of a sexual offense. As a result, according \nto the Department of Defense's April 2012 Sexual Assault Prevention and \nResponse report, approximately 40 percent of servicemembers who have \nbeen convicted of a sexual offense in a courts-martial are not \ndischarged or dismissed as part of that judgment.\n  Our honorable and law-abiding military personnel deserve far better. \nAnd that is why our amendment is so important. By requiring all \nmilitary services to establish a policy that all who are convicted of \nsexual assaults must be processed for administrative separation from \nthe military, we will remove from our military ranks sexual assault \noffenders who threaten the welfare of the men and women of our armed \nservices, as well as their families.\n  I was very pleased to join with Senator Gillibrand in crafting this \namendment, and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage \ntoday. Unfortunately, our work is not yet done, which is why I have \nalso joined with Senator Klobuchar to develop several additional \namendments to this bill in furtherance of the effort to eradicate \nsexual assault in the military. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting each of these amendments as well. We owe it to our military \npersonnel to do everything possible to stop sexual assaults from \noccurring within our armed services.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know of no further debate on the Gillibrand amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non the adoption of the amendment, No. 3016.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand under the unanimous consent agreement the \nSenator from Maryland is to be recognized for 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am not going to linger because there \nis much to be discussed on the Defense authorization. What I wish to \ntalk about for a few minutes is about the safety and security of the \nUnited States of America, meaning our solvency and the demonstration of \nour ability to govern.\n  We need a sense of urgency about solving the fiscal cliff problem. We \nneed to end the culture of delay in this institution. I am very \nconcerned that as we talk about solving the problems of the fiscal \ncliff, there is this whole dynamic going on. There is this whole patter \ngoing on, from staff level to Senators. It is, oh, we are going to be \nhere until Christmas Eve.\n  I think that is a disaster. I think it is a disaster for our economy, \nI think it is a disaster for the demonstration of our ability to \ngovern, and I think it is a disaster for our standing in the world. We \nneed to show we can govern ourselves, and we can put ourselves on a \nsound fiscal path with the right combination of growth, frugality, and \nensuring a safety net for the most vulnerable of our citizens. I am \nhere to say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, both sides of \nthe dome, and even the White House: Let's get the job done. I propose \nlet's really conscientiously work hard to make sure we have a framework \nthat we could vote on by the weekend of December 15.\n  Why do I want December 15 as a deadline? It is Saturday. Mr. \nPresident, you, yourself, have tweeted about--Oh, let's have Saturday \nas Small Business Week. We have had cyber Mondays. Let's have a strong \neconomy closing of the week before Christmas.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, if we show that we can govern and \nactually pass a bill by Saturday, December 15, that does exactly what I \nsaid. It shows that we have a sense of frugality and are on a path \nwhere we are solving our issues around debt, but we also have the \nelements that promote growth and ensure a safety net for the most \nvulnerable. We could do three things: We could show that we can govern. \nThat would be very big in the mind of the public, that we could govern \nourselves. It would be important to the public, and it would be \nimportant to the world, particularly those who lend us money.\n  It would be an enormous sense of boosting consumer confidence 10 days \nbefore Christmas. We would show that we are on the way to solving our \nproblems. For those who benefit from either Federal employment or \ncontracts with the Federal Government, there would be stability in \ntheir employment.\n  I can also say as to the stock market we could have a floor under the \nstock market, and we might even have a jump in the stock market. Just \none-third of Americans believe Congress can be counted on to behave \nlike responsible adults--only one-third. They have seen no compromise \nor cooperation. They have seen lip service. We don't need to be trading \npet rocks over what we need to do, and we should not throw them either. \nWe have to come together, both sides of the aisle, both sides of the \ndome, with the White House.\n  We do not lack in ideas. The content for a solution is not new. We \nhave had excellent people working on this. We have seen Simpson-Bowles \nin a report, Domenici-Rivlin, wise heads giving us good ideas. We have \nhad the supercommittee that fleshed out a lot of these issues and knows \nwhere the disagreements are. We have had the Gang of 6, the Gang of 8. \nLet's get to the Gang of 100 and pass this bill. I would be happy with \nthe Gang of 51.\n  I want to be sure we know, because we do know, the ideas. We do not \nlack in ideas. What we lack is will and momentum to get this job done. \nMy principles are simple and straightforward: No. 1, let's have a sense \nof urgency. No. 2, make sure when we look at cuts that we count the \ncuts that we have already done. For example, the $900 billion we have \ndone in the Budget Control Act because that would also include the $450 \nbillion that we have done in defense spending--the kinds of issues we \nhave talked about. Let's also count the $550 billion that we did in \nreforming Medicare during health care reform.\n  We have had good words, now we need good deeds and swift action. Just \nthink what it would mean to reach an agreement by December 15. \nAmericans could see that we can work together. Think about the energy \nthis would unlock to avoid a sequester. Think about what a signal this \nwould be to middle-class people on Main Street as well as the people on \nWall Street because business would have certainty, we would have \nconsumer confidence, and we could have a new self-confidence about \nourselves that we could govern.\n\n  The Presiding Officer and I represent a great State. We represent a \nState that has an innovative economy, from both the Federal Government \nand its great Federal labs, such as NIH, to its great national security \nareas, such as the Cyber Command at Fort Meade. Yes, they would be \ndevastated by a sequester. So would our contractors, both defense and \ncivilians. Great iconic institutions such as Hopkins would take a huge \nhit in not only research and development but in providing care to the \nneedy, care to the desperate who come from all over the country to get \nhelp for a sick child or an aging relative or to get eyesight restored \nat the\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\nWilmer Eye Institute. Sure, I am for jobs in Maryland, but I am here \ntrying to stand for America.\n  We need to show we can govern, and we cannot wait until December 24, \nthat somehow or another this is going to be Santa Claus, because if we \ndon't act soon, we are going to get rocks in our socks, and I think \nthey would be well deserved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois be allocated 7 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask that \nthe Senator modify his request that the Senator be immediately followed \nby Senator Kyl to offer an amendment, with the proviso that it is \ncleared by the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we just concluded a Presidential campaign. \nWho could have missed it? There were a lot of issues that were \ndiscussed, but one of particular interest to me was one that involves a \npersonal effort I have made to pass a piece of legislation known as the \nDREAM Act. I introduced the DREAM Act 11 years ago. Things move slowly \nin the Senate, but this has taken way too long.\n  It has been heartening over the years to watch the support for the \nDREAM Act grow among the American people. It has also been interesting \nto me that in the last Presidential campaign one of the issues asked of \nGovernor Romney, as well as President Obama, pointblank, was: Are you \nfor the DREAM Act? I guess that says quite a bit for this piece of \nlegislation and the idea and principle behind it.\n  When I introduced the DREAM Act 11 years ago, it was because I met a \nyoung woman from Chicago, Tereza Lee, who was Korean, who came to this \ncountry as a child, was raised in the United States, but her parents \nnever filed the necessary documentation. So Tereza Lee was graduating \nfrom high school in Chicago, an accomplished pianist, and she had been \naccepted at the Manhattan Conservatory of Music in the Juilliard School \nof Music, but she was undocumented, she was not a citizen, she was not \nhere legally.\n  So she came to our office and asked what she could do, and we had to \nadvise her mom, under the law, Tereza, having lived in this country for \nmore than 16 years, had to leave and go back to Brazil, where her \nfamily had been before they immigrated to the United States, wait 10 \nyears, and then try to come back in. What a waste of talent. So I \nintroduced the DREAM Act to give her and many like her a chance--a \nchance to be legalized, to become part of America.\n  Over the years, we have had many votes. I have always had a majority \nvote on the floor, a bipartisan majority vote, but I have been unable \nto break the filibuster from the other side of the aisle.\n  Well, now this issue's time has come because this President issued an \nexecutive order earlier this year to allow those who have been here and \nwould qualify for the DREAM Act to stay without deportation if they \nregistered, made it clear that they qualified otherwise for the DREAM \nAct, had no serious criminal past that would jeopardize anyone in the \nUnited States, and go through the process of review to be \nfingerprinted, to be basically identified as part of the system.\n  It was a great leap of faith for these young people, who had been \nhere for so many years hiding, to step up in front of somebody and say: \nI am going to report myself to the Government of the United States. But \nthey did it. Tens of thousands did it, and they continue to.\n  This deferred action that is being offered to so many of these young \npeople gives them a chance now to work in the United States, to go to \nschool in the United States, and to be here legally. That is why this \nissue is so important. But we are far from finished. We have not passed \nthe law. We have an executive order from the President that gives them \nthis chance.\n  This weekend, in Kansas City, MO, hundreds of DREAMers--that is what \nwe call these young people now--are going to get together. They are \npart of the largest national organization of DREAMers: United We Dream. \nThey will be planning their next effort--advocating for immigration \nreform legislation that will bring them and their families out of the \nshadows once and for all and give them a chance to earn their way to \nlegal status and citizenship in America.\n  One part of immigration reform--the DREAM Act--is near and dear to \nme. But I want to see comprehensive immigration reform before it is all \nover. We know if we pass the DREAM Act, it will help the economy, \ncreating new jobs and economic growth when the talent of these young \npeople, as they come out of high school and college, is brought into \nour economy.\n  In my home State of Illinois, by 2030, the DREAM Act would contribute \n$14 billion in economic activity and DREAMers would create up to 58,992 \nnew jobs.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate frequently to tell their stories. \nThey used to hide in the shadows. They did not want to talk about who \nthey were because they were undocumented and afraid of being deported. \nMany were deported. But I came to the floor to tell the stories of \nthose who had the courage to step up and identify themselves and run \nthat risk, just so people knew who they were.\n  I will tell a story today about Pierre Beranstain.\n  Pierre and his sister were brought to the United States by their \nparents from Peru in 1998, when they were children. Pierre did not \nspeak a word of English when he first arrived in Carrollton, TX, but he \nworked hard to learn English. He excelled academically and was accepted \ninto the Academy of Biomedical Professions in his high school.\n  In 2006, Pierre was accepted at Harvard, one of the best universities \nin our country. He went on to get a bachelor's degree with honors. He \nis currently pursuing a master's degree at Harvard Divinity School.\n  In addition to working on this graduate degree, he is active in his \ncommunity. Among many other volunteer activities, Pierre works at \nRenewal House, a domestic violence shelter in Boston.\n  His volunteer work led Harvard to award Pierre the Thomas E. Upham \nScholarship, which is given to an outstanding graduate student \ncommitted to public service.\n  Pierre recently wrote an article about growing up as an undocumented \nimmigrant. This is what he said:\n\n       I am not a criminal, a monster, a predator, or someone who \n     sits at home doing nothing substantive or meaningful. I care \n     for this country; I care for its successes as well as its \n     struggles, for its joys as well as its sorrows. I am not \n     asking that our government maintain an open-door policy \n     for immigrants. I am simply asking that it give an \n     opportunity to those of us who have proven ourselves.\n\n  Well, Pierre is right. America needs young people just like him, who \nlove their country and are dedicated to caring for our society's most \nvulnerable.\n  So what do the American people think about the idea of the DREAM Act? \nListen to a recent poll. A Bloomberg poll found that 64 percent of \nlikely voters--almost 2 out of 3, including 66 percent of \nIndependents--support the policy, compared to only 30 percent who \noppose it. By a margin of 2 to 1, the American people know this is the \nright thing to do.\n  Now we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. On our side, \nthe negotiating effort will be led by Senator Schumer of New York, who \nchairs the Immigration Subcommittee, and a number of us will join in \nthat effort. We are going to join with those on the other side--\nSenators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Susan Collins, Rand \nPaul, and Senator-elect Jeff Flake--who have expressed an interest in \nthis issue to make sure we move forward in a bipartisan fashion to try \nto finally find a solution to immigration reform.\n  Let me close by thanking Senator Jon Kyl and Senator Kay Bailey\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\nHutchison. Yesterday they introduced the ACHIEVE Act, which has been \ncalled the Republican version of the DREAM Act. I have worked with them \nfor a long time. We share many of the same ideas. We have some \ndifferences. I have some concerns, but I appreciate that Senator Kyl \nand Senator Hutchison have come forward with this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry I will not have the chance to work with these \ntwo Senators on this measure because they are both retiring. But I hope \nwe can build on what they have offered on their side of the aisle in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  In that spirit, let me point out two major concerns with the ACHIEVE \nAct. The bill is limited to young people who arrived in the United \nStates since the age of 13 or under. That would have the effect of \nexcluding DREAMers who were brought when they were still children at \nthe age of 14 or 15.\n  Let me give you two examples of people I know.\n  This is a picture I have in the Chamber of Tolu Olubunmi. She was \nbrought to America from Nigeria when she was 14 years old. Tolu \nobtained a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering 10 years ago. She \nstill cannot work as an engineer. We can use her talent.\n  Let me also show you a picture of Novi Roy. He was brought to America \nfrom India when he was 14 years old. Novi graduated from the University \nof Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a bachelor's degree in economics \nand two master's degrees, one in business administration and one in \nhuman resources. His dream is to help provide affordable health care to \na lot of people who do not have it in America.\n  Tolu and Novi should be eligible for the DREAM Act. They would not be \nunder the ACHIEVE Act. The other thing is, I want them to have a path \nto citizenship. At the end of the day, after they have earned their \nstripes, paid their price, paid the taxes, did everything they were \nsupposed to do, give them a chance--not to go to the front of the line \nbut the back of the line--and give them a chance to be American \ncitizens. It is the right thing to do.\n  It is time for this to become a truly bipartisan issue. I hope in the \nnext Congress we can truly come together for the sake of these young \npeople, and so many others just like them all across America, to \nfinally let their dream come true.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3123\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk No. 3123.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Risch, Mr. Lugar, Mr. DeMINT, Mr. \n     Cornyn, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Wicker, Ms. Ayotte, Ms. Collins, and \n     Mr. Sessions, proposes an amendment numbered 3123.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require regular updates of Congress on the military \n    implications of proposals of the United States and Russia under \n  consideration in negotiations on nuclear arms, missile defense, and \n             long-range conventional strike system matters)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064. BRIEFINGS AND CONSULTATIONS ON THE MILITARY \n                   IMPLICATIONS OF PROPOSALS OF THE UNITED STATES \n                   AND RUSSIA UNDER CONSIDERATION IN NEGOTIATIONS \n                   ON NUCLEAR ARMS, MISSILE DEFENSE, AND LONG-\n                   RANGE CONVENTIONAL STRIKE SYSTEM MATTERS.\n\n       (a) Briefings and Consultations.--\n       (1) Briefings.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every 120 days thereafter, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall, in coordination with the Chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provide to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a briefing on the military and \n     strategic implications of any offer or proposal, by either \n     the Russian Federation or the United States, to limit or \n     control nuclear arms, missile defense systems, or long-range \n     conventional strike systems, including any proposal as part \n     of formal negotiations between the two countries or otherwise \n     exchanged between official entities of the two countries.\n       (2) Basis of quarterly consultations.--The briefings under \n     paragraph (1) shall serve as the basis for quarterly \n     consultations to be provided by the Secretary to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress on any current proposals \n     described in that paragraph.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     any agreement of the United States with the Russian \n     Federation related to missile defense, nuclear weapons, or \n     long-range conventional strike systems that would limit, \n     constrain, or reduce the Armed Forces or armaments of the \n     United States in any militarily significant manner may be \n     made only pursuant to the treaty-making power of the \n     President as set forth in Article II, section, 2, clause 2, \n     of the Constitution of the United States, as consistent with \n     section 303(b) of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.\n       (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Let me begin by saying that I send this amendment to the \ndesk with an understanding of the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and of the Armed Services Committee that before I would \nrequest a vote on this amendment, we would work out the language, the \nspecific language of this amendment, along with the ranking members, \nand would not ask for a vote unless that is achieved.\n  This amendment has been offered not only for myself, but also \nSenators Lieberman, Inhofe, Risch, Lugar, Sessions, DeMint, Cornyn, \nRubio, Wicker, Ayotte, and Collins. Our purpose is to get a greater \ninvolvement at an earlier stage of the Senate in discussions between \nthe United States and the Russian Federation regarding nuclear arms, \nmissile defense, and potentially long-range conventional strike \nsystems. These are all three matters that have been the subject of \ntreaties and agreements.\n  There has been an indication by different people within the \nadministration, indeed even the President, that he may be wanting to \ntalk to the Russian Federation representatives about additional \nagreements in these areas.\n  There have been concerns that the Congress is not adequately briefed \non those discussions and certainly not at an early enough date. \nClearly, if these agreements reach a formal stage, they can require \nratification by the Senate. We think it is important that they not be, \nin effect, negotiated in their entirety before they are known to the \nSenate and before some input from Members of the Senate can be provided \nto the administration.\n  What the amendment as originally introduced therefore would do is to \nrequire regular updates of Congress on the military implications of \nproposals that the United States and Russia have under consideration in \ntheir negotiations on nuclear arms, missile defense, or long-range \nconventional strike systems, and in its current form would require the \nSecretary of Defense to brief the Foreign Relations, the Armed \nServices, and the Appropriations Committees.\n  One of the changes that we might want to make here is that the \nbriefings might include other groups within the Congress as well. These \nbriefings could occur, under this proposal, no later than 30 days after \nthe act goes into force, and would affect the quarterly briefings where \nthe administration would, on a quarterly basis, provide consultation \nbetween the Congress and the Secretary of Defense regarding any \nproposals to limit or reduce nuclear arms, missile defense or, as I \nsaid, long-range conventional strike systems.\n  The amendment also does something else which we may have to modify \nthe language of, but it would express the sense of Congress that any \nagreement between the United States and Russia\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\nthat would limit or constrain or reduce our missile defense or our \nnuclear weapons or long-range conventional strike systems in any \nmilitarily significant manner could only be done pursuant to the \ntreaty-making power of the President as set forth in the Constitution. \nAnd that, of course, is in order to protect our right to consult, \nprovide advice and consent to any matters that reach that level of \nnegotiation between the administration and, in this case, the Russian \nFederation.\n  We will have more to say about this if we have an opportunity to \nfurther debate. As I said, I am happy to sit down with the chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee \nto consider any changes they might want to make to this language with \nthe purpose of getting it adopted, rather than just having something to \ntalk about.\n  This is something we need. Congress needs to be advised. We need to \nbe consulted on matters this important. I do not think the \nadministration would argue with that; it is a matter of coming to an \nagreement on how we would actually do it.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona, Senator \nKyl, for his willingness to sit down and try to work this out in a way \nwhich is satisfactory to him and the Foreign Relations Committee. We \nvery much appreciate that. We know what he is after and we believe \nthere should be consultation. So we are trying to make that happen.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3099\n\n  (Purpose: To improve mental health care programs and activities for \n               members of the Armed Forces and veterans)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3099.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3099.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment that is pending in front of \nus is to improve the mental health and suicide prevention services. It \nis language that is derived from our Mental Health ACCESS Act, which \nwas unanimously approved by the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  This amendment is critical legislation that improves how DOD and VA \nprovide mental health care. I think everyone in this body knows about \nit and is distressed by the alarming rate of suicide and mental health \nproblems in our military and veterans populations.\n  We know our servicemembers and veterans have faced unprecedented \nchallenges, multiple deployments, difficulty finding a job here at \nhome, isolation in their communities, and some have faced very tough \ntimes reintegrating into family life with loved ones trying to relate \nbut not knowing how. These are the challenges our servicemembers and \nveterans know all too well. But even today as they turn to us for help, \nwe are losing the battle.\n  Time and again we have lost servicemembers and veterans to suicide. \nWhile the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have taken very \nimportant steps toward addressing this crisis, we know more does need \nto be done. We know any solution depends on reducing wait times and \nimproving access to mental health care. We know they need to have the \nproper diagnosis, and we know we need to achieve true coordination of \ncare and information between the Departments of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs.\n  What this amendment does is require a comprehensive, standardized, \nsuicide prevention program across the Department of Defense. It \nrequires the use of best medical practices in suicide prevention and \nbehavioral health programs to address some serious gaps that exist in \nthe current programs, and this amendment expands eligibility for VA \nmental health services to family members of our veterans. This \namendment would also give servicemembers an opportunity to serve as \npeer counselors to fellow Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and create a \nquality assurance program for the historically troubled disability \nevaluation system.\n  It would require the VA to offer peer support services at all medical \ncenters and create opportunities to train more veterans to provide \nthese needed peer services. It will require the VA to establish \naccurate and reliable measures for mental health services.\n  We must have an effective suicide prevention program in place. It is \noften only on the brink of crisis that a servicemember or a veteran \nseeks care. If they are told, sorry, we are too busy to help you, we \nhave lost the opportunity to help them. To me and to all of us here, \nthat is not acceptable.\n  I wish to thank Senator Levin and Senator McCain for their work on \nthis Defense authorization bill and for their help in bringing this \namendment to the floor today. I believe there are no objections to this \namendment, and I hope we can move it as quickly as possible.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to add Senator Baucus as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to commend and thank Senator Murray \nfor her huge effort in this area. Her efforts on behalf of our veterans \nand our troops have been instrumental in bringing some of the \ncorrections that are needed to the forefront, and we very much welcome \nthis amendment. It touches issues which are very much on the minds of \nmost Americans; that is, the mental health care we provide for our \nveterans and for our troops.\n  I simply not only support this amendment, but I wish to commend \nSenator Murray for her leadership and her initiative and I hope and \nbelieve it can be passed on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3099.\n  The amendment (No. 3099) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know we have matters under discussion \nwith the distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking member of \nthe committee. I have discussed with them that I am not bringing up an \namendment at this point. But let me talk about an amendment that I will \nbring up and expect to pass at some point.\n  The amendment I will call up at some appropriate point is legislation \nI have been trying to get enacted for more than 3 years called the Dale \nLong Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act. This legislation \nimproves the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act, which is the Federal \ndeath and disability program for our Nation's first responders who are \nkilled or disabled in the line of duty.\n  Just so Senators will know, an earlier version of this legislation \nwas adopted here on the Senate floor by voice vote in December 2011. \nThe Presiding Officer will recall it was almost exactly a year ago when \nwe brought that up. It was adopted as part of the FAA Air \nTransportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. During the \ncourse of conference negotiations related to the FAA legislation, the \nHouse Judiciary chairman Lamar Smith and I negotiated additional \nmeasures to be added to the legislation. Our work together produced a \npackage of improvements that contains a modest expansion of benefits \nfor deserving emergency medical responders, and a host of reforms to \nmake the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program stronger, more \neffective, and more cost efficient.\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\n  The legislation has become one of the cornerstones of the partnership \nwe have between the Federal Government and our first responders and \nwill make that partnership even stronger. In fact, the reforms Chairman \nSmith and I developed in consultation with the Department of Justice \nand the first responder community completely offset and eliminate an \nestimated modest increase in spending.\n  Unfortunately, at that time, due to an error made by the \nCongressional Budget Office, the matter was dropped from the FAA \nconference report. The CBO, to their credit, later corrected their \nerror, and provided an official cost estimate which makes clear this \nlegislation will result in no new Federal spending. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a copy of that letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n     June 22, 2012.\n\n\n  H.R. 4018--Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvements Act of 2012\n\n     As ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary \n         on June 6, 2012\n       CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4018 would have no \n     significant cost to the federal government. Enacting the bill \n     could affect direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures apply. However, CBO estimates that any effects \n     would be insignificant for each year. The legislation would \n     not affect revenues.\n       Under current law, the families of public safety officers \n     who have died as a result of injuries sustained in the line \n     of duty are eligible for a one-time payment of about \n     $320,000. Public safety officers who have been permanently \n     disabled are eligible for the same payment, but this payment \n     is subject to the availability of appropriated funds.\n       This legislation would make members of rescue squads or \n     ambulance crews operated by nonprofit entities eligible for \n     benefits paid when public safety officers are permanently \n     disabled or die as a result of injuries sustained in the line \n     of duty. H.R. 4018 also would narrow the eligibility of \n     members of rescue squads or ambulance crews for benefits \n     under the Public Safety Officers' Benefit (PSOB) program; as \n     a result, some individuals would no longer receive benefits \n     that they could receive under current law. The bill would \n     prevent individuals from receiving certain benefits under the \n     program if they receive payments from the September 11th \n     Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. In addition, the proposed \n     legislation would make many technical and administrative \n     changes that aim to expedite the processing of claims for \n     benefits.\n       Based on the number of fatalities of members of nonprofit \n     rescue squads or ambulance crews in recent years, CBO expects \n     that, on average, a few persons each year would be affected \n     by the proposed legislation and that additional payments from \n     the PSOB program would be made. CBO estimates that those \n     payments would total $13 million over the 2013-2022 period. \n     However, based on information from the Department of Justice, \n     we expect that those costs would be offset by savings from \n     other provisions of the bill that would result in fewer \n     persons receiving PSOB payments than will receive them under \n     current law. As a result, CBO estimates that enacting the \n     legislation would have no significant net effect on direct \n     spending or discretionary spending from the PSOB program.\n       H.R. 4018 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and \n     would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.\n       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz. \n     The estimate was approved by Theresa Gullo, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Despite our setback, Chairman Smith and I were, and have \nremained, determined to move forward. I know I have his full support \nfor inclusion of this measure in the Defense authorization measure we \nnow consider, and I greatly appreciate the efforts he made in a \nbipartisan manner to get this done. In fact, the legislation containing \nthis amendment was unanimously passed in the House of Representatives \nin June of this year by a voice vote.\n  I know a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle care about \nreforming government programs and making the Federal Government work \nbetter. This is a bipartisan measure that does that. It will speed up \nclaims processing, it will reduce costs to the Department of Justice, \nand it will lessen unnecessary paperwork burdens for claimants. It has \npassed with overwhelming Democratic and Republican support in the \nHouse. It had stalled in the past over misguided objections. Some might \nsay this is not the responsibility of Congress. As a constitutional \nmatter, that is simply not true. It is a matter of policy.\n  Since 1976, Congress has made the judgment that the right thing to do \nis to take care of surviving spouses and children of police officers, \nfirefighters, and emergency medical responders who are killed in the \nline of duty. Congress has always provided assistance to these heroes. \nIf there is a Senator who believes this is beyond the responsibility of \nCongress, then introduce and defend legislation to repeal the policy \nfirst enacted in 1976.\n  Americans take care of each other. We live by the ideal that we take \ncare of our own. Just as the Federal Government is working hard to help \nthose suffering from Hurricane Sandy or as the Federal Government \nprovides critical assistance to people and communities devastated by \ntornadoes or droughts or wildfires, just as Congress stood by the \nfamilies of those killed in the attacks of September 11, 2001, we take \ncare of our own. We always will.\n  As I said, at some appropriate time I will call up the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand the Senator will take about 10 minutes; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Somewhere in that vicinity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And then the Senator will take approximately 10 minutes?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would like to be recognized at the conclusion of \nthe remarks of the Senator from Vermont for about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask that the two Senators be recognized for 10 minutes \neach as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Wall Street\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, sometimes there is no end to arrogance. \nI find it literally beyond comprehension that we have folks from Wall \nStreet who receive huge bailouts from the people of our country, from \nworking families in this country, because of the greed and recklessness \nand illegal behavior that Wall Street did to drive us into this \nrecession, and now these very same people are coming here to Congress \nto lecture us and the American people about how we have to cut Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid while they enjoy huge salaries and \nretirement benefits.\n  Lloyd Blankfein is the CEO of Goldman Sachs. In 2006 and 2007 he was \nthe highest paid executive on Wall Street, making over $125 million in \ntotal compensation. My understanding is that he has wealth of hundreds \nof millions of dollars. Goldman Sachs received a $278 million refund--\nGoldman Sachs did--from the IRS in 2008 even though it made a profit of \n$2.3 billion. During the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs received a \ntotal of $814 billion in virtually zero interest loans from the Federal \nReserve and a $10 billion bailout from the Treasury Department. This is \nthe CEO of Goldman Sachs. Now, with his huge wealth, he is coming here \nto Washington to lecture the American people on how we have to cut \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for tens of millions of \nAmericans who are struggling now to keep their heads above water.\n\n  This is a statement Lloyd Blankfien recently made, I believe, on a TV \nshow:\n\n       You're going to have to, undoubtedly, do something to lower \n     people's expectations, the entitlements, and what people \n     think they're going to get because they're not going to get \n     it. Social Security wasn't devised to be a system that \n     supported you for a 30 year retirement after a 25 year career \n     . . . So there will be certain things, like the retirement \n     age will have to be changed, maybe the benefits will have to \n     be affected, maybe some of the inflation adjustments will \n     have to be revised . . . But, in general, entitlements have \n     to be slowed down and contained.\n\n  This comes from a man worth hundreds of millions of dollars whose \ncompany, along with the rest of the companies on Wall Street, drove \nthis country\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\ninto the recession it is in, which, by the way, contributed to the \ndeficit we are in. He is coming to Capitol Hill to lecture us and \nlecture the working families in this country on how we have to cut \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I think arrogance has no end, \nthat people from Wall Street can come down here and tell us that.\n  I think most Americans understand that the reason we are in the \nterrible recession we are in right now and the reason we went from a \n$236 billion surplus when Bill Clinton left office has everything in \nthe world to do not with Social Security but with the fact that we went \ninto the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and forgot to pay for them; we \ngave huge tax breaks to people such as Mr. Blankfein and did not offset \nthem; passed the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, not paid \nfor; and as a result of the Wall Street recession, significantly less \nrevenue is now coming into the Federal Government. That is why we went \nfrom a $236 billion surplus in 2001 to a $1 trillion deficit today.\n  The deficit is a serious issue and it has to be addressed, but it has \nto be addressed not in the way that Mr. Blankfein, Pete Peterson, and \nthe other Wall Street billionaires want us to address the deficit but \nin a way that is fair to working people. Among other things, we have to \nprotect Social Security, protect Medicare, protect Medicaid.\n  I was appreciative the other day when I read that the White House has \nsaid something that many of us have wanted them to say, which is that \nSocial Security had nothing to do with the deficit; Social Security \nshould be treated separately. I think that is a real step forward. Many \nof us signed a letter to that effect.\n  But what does worry me is this issue of chain CPI. I want everybody \nto understand what the chain CPI is about. Nobody outside of Capitol \nHill knows what it is about. What it is about is reformulating how we \ndetermine COLAs. If this chain CPI passed, what it would mean is that \nif somebody was 65 now--this would go into effect immediately if it \nwere passed--by the time they were 75, there would be a $560-a-year \nreduction in what they otherwise would have gotten in Social Security \nbenefits through the COLAs. By the time they are 85, it would be $1,000 \na year. We must defeat any and all efforts to oppose a chain CPI not \nonly on Social Security beneficiaries, but it would also apply, if my \ncolleagues can believe this, to disabled veterans. Mr. Blankfein and \nhis other CEO friends on Wall Street really want us to balance the \nbudget on the backs of the disabled vets? Well, this Senator surely is \nnot going to support that.\n  There are ways to deal with deficit reduction that are fair. \nEverybody has to understand that we have already cut approximately $1 \ntrillion in benefits. So when we talk about $4 trillion in deficit \nreduction, $1 trillion has already taken place.\n  Second of all, obviously, at a time when the wealthiest people are \ndoing phenomenally well and we have growing wealth and income \ninequality in America, of course we have to repeal Bush's tax breaks \nfor people making $250,000 a year or more. That is another $1 trillion. \nWe have to appreciate the fact that one out of four corporations in \nAmerica doesn't pay a nickel in taxes. We can bring in significant \namounts of revenue through tax reform that asks corporations to start \npaying their fair share of taxes. We are losing $100 billion a year \nbecause corporations and the wealthy are stashing their money in the \nCayman Islands and other tax havens, thus losing substantial revenue in \nthe United States.\n  Defense spending has tripled since 1997. We are now spending almost \nas much as the rest of the world combined. Let's take a serious look at \ndefense spending. If we do that, make some changes toward efficiency in \nMedicare and Medicaid, make them more efficient but not cut benefits, \nwe can move toward serious deficit reduction without cutting Social \nSecurity, without cutting Medicare, and without cutting Medicaid.\n  We just had an election a few weeks ago--November 6--and what I think \nthe American people said is that the time is now for the wealthy to \nstart paying their fair share of taxes. We have seen poll after poll \nafter poll, including from some very conservative people who are saying \ndo not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I think it is time \nfor the Senate and the Congress to start listening to the American \npeople. Let's go forward with deficit reduction, but let's not do it on \nthe backs of the elderly, the children, the sick, or the poor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we are working toward a national \ndefense authorization act, and as we do that, I rise to discuss the \nimportance of assessing and planning for and mitigating the national \nsecurity effects of climate change.\n  Our changing climate is not simply a green issue invented by \nenvironmentalists and conservationists; climate change threatens our \nstrategic interests, our military readiness, and our domestic security \nin many ways. It is a serious national security issue--so says not just \nme but the U.S. Department of Defense and, indeed, our national \nintelligence community.\n  In 2011 the Defense Science Board provided the Secretary of Defense \nguidance for a governmentwide approach to preparing for the effects of \nclimate change, concluding that ``climate change will only grow in \nconcern for the United States and its security interests.''\n  The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review by the Department of Defense \nnoted that climate change is one of the things that ``will play \nimportant roles in the future security environment.''\n  The White House's 2010 national security strategist stated that \n``climate change . . . threaten(s) the security of regions and the \nhealth and safety of the American people.''\n  Back to 2008, Dr. Thomas Fingar, then Deputy Director of National \nIntelligence for Analysis and the Chairman of the National Intelligence \nCouncil, said that ``global climate change will have wide-ranging \nimplications for U.S. national security interests for the next 20 \nyears.''\n  In a report requested by the CIA, the National Research Council wrote \nthis year that ``while climate change alone does not cause conflict, it \nmay act as an accelerant of instability or conflict.''\n  In 2006 the Center for Naval Analysis, a federally funded research \nand development center that has advised the Navy and Marine Corps since \n1942, convened a military advisory board of retired three-star and \nfour-star admirals and generals and asked them to report on national \nsecurity and the threat of climate change. The report stated:\n\n       While uncertainty exists . . . regarding . . . the future \n     extent of projected climate change, the trends are clear. The \n     nature and pace of climate changes being observed today . . . \n     pose . . . grave implications for our national security.\n\n  And, of course, as the Presiding Officer knows, in the 5 years since, \nthe evidence has tracked the worst of those climate change projections, \nnot the most gentle.\n  Our Nation's top military strategists, our Nation's top researchers, \nthe National Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences all \nhave recommended that our national security institutions prepare for \nthreats caused by climate change.\n  On the other hand, we have a tiny fringe of scientists, many of whom \nare funded by industry, that denies these facts and urges us to \nmaintain the status quo. In effect, that little fringe urges us to do \nnothing. This is the same strategy, often the same organizations, and \nin some cases even the same people who denied in the past that \ncigarettes are bad for us or that lead paint harms children. They are \nprofessional, industry-paid deniers at large.\n  The choice is a clear one, and I recommend we follow the findings of \nour military leaders. They have determined that climate change is real \nand that our national security requires us to reject the false science \nof the climate deniers.\n  The National Intelligence Council has identified more than 30 U.S. \nmilitary installations that are threatened by risks associated just \nwith rising sea levels. One is Diego Garcia. It is a small island south \nof India and home to a logistics hub for U.S. and British forces in the \nMiddle East and to Air Force Satellite Control Network equipment. The \nNavy reports that the average elevation of Diego Garcia is \napproximately 4 feet. Even absent a\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\nstorm or tsunami, this installation is threatened by inundation from \nslow and steady sea level rise.\n  The Norfolk Naval Air Station and Naval Base on the southern end of \nthe Chesapeake Bay is the Navy's largest supply center and home to the \nU.S. Atlantic fleet. A New York Times analysis this past weekend using \nU.S. Geological Survey and NOAA data showed that a 5-foot sea level \nrise would permanently flood portions of that base. The base is at \ncontinuing risk, of course, from storm surges. By the way, a 5-foot sea \nlevel rise is now predicted to be a possibility in this century.\n  Eglin Air Force Base on Florida's gulf coast, the largest Air Force \nbase in the world, is threatened by storm surge, sea level rise, and \nsaltwater infiltration. We know that climate change loads the dice for \nmore and more severe extreme weather.\n  Retired Brigadier General Steven Anderson and retired Lieutenant \nGeneral Daniel Christman recently used Hurricane Katrina as an example \nof how extreme weather can cause what they call ``negative operational \nimpacts'' to our military. In response to Katrina, the National Guard \nmobilized 58,000 National Guard members to the relief effort at the \nsame time that 79,000 Guard members were deployed fighting the war on \nterrorism. The generals pointed out that although Louisiana's physical \ninfrastructure did not hold, our National Guard did hold. But the \nlimits of even our exceptional National Guard would be tested by these \nchanges in extreme weather, and it is imperative that we prepare our \nemergency management and responders for a new normal of new extremes.\n  Climate change will also create new strategic challenges. Climate \nevents such as droughts and heat waves, floods and storms exacerbate \npolitical and military tensions in areas around the world with fragile \ngovernments and instability. This can result in violent conflict and in \nrefugee problems.\n  It is not just the shock of extreme weather that portends danger. As \nthe temperature of the air and ocean steadily rises, the amount of \nmoisture in the atmosphere will change and the composition of the \noceans will change. Habitats will change, growing conditions will be \naltered, and the snows and glaciers that feed great rivers will change, \nchanging the seasonal flows of the rivers. The world's great \nagricultural deltas will face both those changes in the rivers and \nrising sea levels. All of these changes will disrupt food supplies and \nwater resources. Many poorer regions are unprepared to deal with the \neffects of famine, drought, crop failure, flooding, and disease that \ncan be anticipated. These slower moving climate disasters will create \nmigration, competition for resources, and government instability that \nin turn sets the stage for more international unrest.\n  Last, the changing environment will affect our military's operating \nenvironment. Sea ice in the Arctic is already vanishing, and new Arctic \nwaterways are opening. In September, Reuters reported that the first \nChinese icebreaker crossed the Arctic, with the expedition leader \nexplaining how surprised he was to find the route to be so open. In \naddition to new shipping routes, the reduction in Arctic sea ice makes \noil, gas, and mineral exploration more likely there. These new \noperational challenges will expand the Coast Guard's mission along our \nArctic borders and the Navy's mission in the Arctic Ocean.\n\n  The Department of Defense and our intelligence community have \naccepted the science of climate change and the fact that we need to \nprepare for it. We customarily rely on the professional judgments of \nthe sober and thoughtful leaders of these great national security \norganizations. Their assessments are based on sound and comprehensive \nscience and analysis. I respect the solemn mission our national \nsecurity institutions have to protect the United States and its \ninterests, and I trust their judgment.\n  Their judgment is echoed by significant Republican leaders. Our \nformer colleague, Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, who was \nthe chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee, has said:\n\n       Leading military and security experts agree that if left \n     unchecked, global warming could increase instability and lead \n     to conflict in already fragile regions of the world.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       We ignore these facts at the peril of our national security \n     and at great risk to those in uniform who serve this nation.\n\n  George Shultz was Secretary of Treasury and Labor and Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget under President Nixon, and the \nSecretary of State under President Reagan. He leads the Hoover \nInstitution's Shultz-Stephenson Task Force on Energy Policy and has \nalso served on the advisory boards of Stanford's Precourt Institute for \nEnergy and MIT's Energy Initiative. In his words, ``. . . the globe is \nwarming, which is not a matter of opinion, but a matter of fact. The \narctic is melting. If you could bring together the constituencies \nconcerned with national security, the economy and the environment--both \nlocal and global--that would be a potent coalition.''\n  So I hope Members on both sides of the aisle can agree that when it \ncomes to protecting our American interests at home and abroad, we \nshould believe our national security institutions when they warn us of \nthe security and strategic implications of climate change rather than \nalign ourselves with a questionable fringe of industry-allied deniers. \nUltimately, as I have said before on this floor, we are beholding to \nour children and grandchildren to do something about the carbon \npollution that is causing this climate change. And history's verdict \nfor our failure will be harsh.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in a moment I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent that we proceed to a debate, to Senator Feinstein, who will \nspeak on an amendment that she intends to offer but not offer it at \nthis time. I will then ask she be followed by Senator Paul, who will \nspeak on that same amendment. It is our intention then to move to a \nvote on the Leahy amendment to improve the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits Program. This falls within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee, but the chairman, whose amendment it is, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Grassley, have both approved this amendment, and I \nwould simply alert other Senators that if they wish to speak on this \namendment, for or against, that it is our intention to proceed to a \nvote on the Leahy amendment following the speaking of Senator Paul and \nSenator Feinstein.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed in that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  I am going to offer an amendment--a version of it was introduced as a \nseparate bill last year as S. 2003. The cosponsors of the amendment are \nSenators Paul, Lee, Coons, Collins, Lautenberg, Gillibrand, and Kirk. I \nask unanimous consent to add Senators Tester, Johnson of South Dakota, \nSanders, Whitehouse, and Heller as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This amendment is almost identical to the bill I \nintroduced a year ago. That bill has a bipartisan group of 30 \ncosponsors. It is called the Due Process Guarantee Act, and the co-\nsponsors include five Republicans: Senators Lee, Paul, Collins, Kirk, \nand Moran. Thanks to Chairman Leahy, the bill had a hearing earlier \nthis year in the Judiciary Committee, as the Presiding Officer will so \nnote, on February 29, 2012.\n  The amendment I will offer clarifies questions that arose during last \nyear's defense authorization bill about the U.S. Government's power to \ndetain its citizens indefinitely. Last year's bill had detention \nprovisions in it that never had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, \nthe Intelligence Committee, or the Armed Services Committee.\n  Let me just take a minute to describe why this is such an important \nissue for me.\n  When I was a very young girl--I remember it was a Sunday because my \nfather worked every other day of the week--my father took me down to a \nracetrack just south of San Francisco\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\ncalled Tanforan. It was the beginning of World War II. The racetrack \nwas then a staging point for Japanese Americans en route to more \npermanent detention centers.\n  Here is the edict that was put out:\n\n       Western Defense Command and Fourth Army Wartime Civil \n     Control Administration, Presidio of San Francisco, \n     California, April 1, 1942, Instructions to All Persons of \n     Japanese Ancestry, Living in the Following Area:\n\n  Then it describes the area. It says:\n\n       All Japanese persons, both alien and non-alien, will be \n     evacuated from the above designated area by 12:00 o'clock \n     noon Tuesday, April 7, 1942.\n       No Japanese person will be permitted to enter or leave the \nabove described area after 8:00 a.m., Thursday, April 2, 1942, without \nobtaining special permission from the Provost Marshal of the Civil \nControl Station.\n\n  This was an order which remanded all persons of Japanese ancestry \ninto custody for the duration of World War II.\n  Let me show you a little of what these facilities looked like. Shown \nin this picture I have in the Chamber is Tanforan Racetrack, and these \nare the barracks that were put up to house Japanese-American citizens \nand non-citizens--only because they were of Japanese ancestry.\n  In this next picture, this is what it looked like close up. This is a \nyoung person walking out of this small cell in that barrack.\n  In this next picture, these are Japanese Americans standing in line--\nand here is the racetrack--either to get food or for some other reason.\n  This stuck in my memory, and I believe it was a stain on the \ngreatness of this country. As I saw the barbed wire, these men, women, \nand children housed in horse stables, in small buildings, as you can \nsee, it was an experience I will never forget.\n  To ensure that this shameful experience was never repeated, almost 30 \nyears after the 1942 evacuation order was issued, Congress passed and \nPresident Nixon signed into law the Non-Detention Act of 1971, which \nrepealed a 1950 statute that explicitly allowed detention of U.S. \ncitizens without charge or trial.\n  The Non-Detention Act of 1971 clearly states:\n\n       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the \n     United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.\n\n  Despite this history, during last year's debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill some in this body advocated for the indefinite \ndetention of American citizens. This is an issue that has been the \nsubject of much legal controversy since 9/11.\n  Proponents of indefinitely detaining citizens apprehended in the U.S. \nargue that the Authorization for Use of Military Force--what we call \nthe AUMF--that was enacted in the wake of 9/11 is ``an act of \nCongress,'' in the language of the Non-Detention Act, that authorizes \nthe indefinite detention of American citizens regardless of where they \nare captured.\n  They further assert that their position is justified by the U.S. \nSupreme Court's plurality decision in the 2004 case of Hamdi v. \nRumsfeld. However, that position is undercut by the 2003 case of \nPadilla v. Rumsfeld in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. So we have \na kind of muddle.\n  But let me discuss the facts of the Hamdi case because it is \nimportant to note that Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen who took up \narms on behalf of the Taliban and was captured on the battlefield in \nAfghanistan. The Supreme Court effectively did uphold his military \ndetention, so some of my colleagues seize upon this to say that the \nmilitary can today indefinitely detain even U.S. citizens who are \narrested domestically.\n  However, the Supreme Court's opinion in that case was a decision by a \n4-to-4 plurality that recognized the power of the government to detain \nU.S. citizens captured abroad as ``enemy combatants'' for some period, \nbut otherwise repudiated the government's broad assertions of executive \nauthority to detain citizens without charge or trial.\n  To the extent the Hamdi case permits the government to detain a U.S. \ncitizen ``until the end of hostilities,'' it does so only under a very \nlimited set of circumstances; namely, citizens taking an active part in \nhostilities who are captured in Afghanistan and who are afforded \ncertain due process protections, at a minimum.\n  Additionally, decisions by the lower courts have contributed to the \ncurrent state of ambiguity. For example, consider those decisions \ninvolving Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in Chicago. He \nwas initially detained pursuant to a material witness warrant based on \nthe 9/11 terrorist acts.\n  In Padilla, the Second Circuit held that AUMF did not authorize his \ndetention, saying:\n\n       We conclude that clear congressional authorization is \n     required for detentions of American citizens on American soil \n     because . . . the Non-Detention Act . . . prohibits such \n     detentions absent specific congressional authorization.\n\n  The Second Circuit went on to say that the 2001 Authorization for Use \nof Military Force--and I quote--``is not such an authorization, and no \nexception to [the Non-Detention Act] otherwise exists.''\n  So here is the problem. We have the Supreme Court that says one thing \nin a limited way and a federal appeals court that says another thing on \nan issue not directly addressed by the Supreme Court. When we debated \nthis issue on the Senate floor last year, the Senate ultimately agreed \nto a compromise amendment which passed by an overwhelming 99-to-1 vote. \nI worked on that with Senators Lee, Paul, Levin, McCain, Durbin, Leahy, \nand the amendment provided the following:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     existing law or authorities relating to the detention of \n     United States citizens, or lawful resident aliens of the \n     United States, or any other persons who are captured or \n     arrested in the United States.\n\n  Now, that was adopted to say, leave things as they are right now. It \npreserved the current state of the law, continuing to leave it to the \ncourts to resolve who is right about whether the AUMF authorizes the \nmilitary detention of anyone apprehended domestically.\n  I believe strongly the time has come now to end this legal ambiguity \nand to state clearly once and for all that the AUMF or other \nauthorities do not authorize such indefinite detention of Americans \napprehended in the United States.\n  To accomplish this, we are offering an amendment which affirms the \ncontinuing application of the principles behind the Non-Detention Act \nof 1971. It amends that act to provide clearly that no military \nauthorization allows indefinite detention of U.S. citizens or green \ncard holders who are apprehended inside the United States.\n  The amendment states, ``An authorization to use military force, a \ndeclaration of war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the \ndetention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent \nresident of the United States apprehended in the United States unless \nan Act of Congress expressly authorizes such detention.''\n  That affirms the Second Circuit's clear statement rule from the \nPadilla case. Some may ask why this amendment protects green card \nholders as well as citizens. Others may ask why the amendment does not \nprotect all persons apprehended in the United States from indefinite \ndetention? Let me be clear. I would support providing the protections \nin this amendment to all persons in the United States whether lawfully \nor unlawfully present.\n  But the question is, Is there enough support in this body to expand \nthis amendment to cover others besides U.S. citizens and green card \nholders? I do not believe there is. We got 45 votes last year on a \nsimilar amendment protecting U.S. citizens. We have re-worked the \namendment and gained more support this year, as reflected in the co-\nsponsors we have today. So my hope is that at least we can clear up the \nlaw with strong protections for citizens and legal permanent residents.\n  Wherever we draw the line on who should be covered by this \nlegislation, I believe it violates fundamental American rights to allow \nanyone apprehended in the United States to be detained without charge \nor trial. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have proven time \nand time again they are up to the challenge of detecting, stopping, \narresting, and convicting terrorists found on U.S. soil, having \nsuccessfully arrested, detained, and convicted hundreds of these \nheinous people, both before and after 9/11.\n  For example, since January 2009, 98 individuals have been \nsuccessfully arrested inside the United States by the\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\nFBI and other Federal or local law enforcement officers on terrorism-\nrelated charges. Last month, the staff of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee compiled a list of the individuals arrested in the past 4 \nyears as part of more than 50 different terrorism investigations. The \nlist was based on publicly available information from the FBI, the \nCongressional Research Service, and media reports. I have it here and I \nask unanimous consent to have the list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Terrorist Arrests and Plots Stopped in the United States 2009-2012\n\n\n  (Compiled by Senate Intelligence Committee staff based on publicly \navailable information from the FBI, the Congressional Research Service, \n                           and media reports)\n\n       (1) Ralph Deleon, (2) Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales \n     (Santana), (3) Arifeen David Gojali--Conspiracy to Provide \n     Material Support to Terrorism--November 2012.\n       On Friday, November 16, 2012, the FBI arrested Deleon, \n     Santana, and Gojali who were planning to travel to \n     Afghanistan to attend terrorist training and commit violent \n     jihad. Deleon, of Ontario, California, is a lawful permanent \n     resident alien, born in the Philippines. Santana, of Upland, \n     California, is a lawful permanent resident, born in Mexico, \n     and whose application for citizenship is pending in the U.S. \n     Gojali, of Riverside, California, is a United States citizen. \n     According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District \n     Court in the Central District of California, the defendants \n     conspired to provide material support to terrorists knowing \n     or intending that such support was to be used in preparation \n     for or in carrying out: conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim, or \n     injure persons and damage property in a foreign country; \n     killing and attempting to kill officers and employees of the \n     United States; killing nationals of the United States; \n     conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction outside the \n     United States; and bombing places of public use and \n     government facilities. The complaint further alleges that \n     Santana, Deleon, and Gojali conducted preliminary training in \n     southern California at firearms and paintball facilities to \n     prepare for terrorist training overseas.\n       (4) Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis--Plot to Bomb New \n     York Federal Reserve Bank--October 2012.\n       On October 17, 2012, the FBI arrested Ahsan Nafis, a \n     Bangladeshi national, as he attempted to detonate what he \n     believed to be a 1,000-pound bomb at the New York Federal \n     Reserve Bank in lower Manhattan's financial district. The \n     defendant faces charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass \n     destruction and attempting to provide material support to Al \n     Qaeda. According to an FBI press release, the accused, \n     ``traveled to the United States in January 2012 for the \n     purpose of conducting a terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Nafis, \n     who reported having overseas connections to Al Qaeda, \n     attempted to recruit individuals to form a terrorist cell \n     inside the United States. Nafis also actively sought out Al \n     Qaeda contacts within the United States to assist him in \n     carrying out an attack.''\n       (5) Adel Daoud--Plot to Bomb Downtown Chicago Bar--\n     September 2012.\n       On Friday September 14, 2012, Adel Daoud attempted to \n     detonate what he believed to be a car bomb outside a bar in \n     downtown Chicago. Daoud, a U.S. citizen, was arrested as part \n     of an ongoing FBI counterterrorism operation after he was \n     discovered on the Internet seeking information on how to \n     conduct terrorist attacks. According to an FBI press release, \n     ``In about May 2012, two FBI online undercover employees \n     contacted Daoud in response to material Daoud posted online \n     and thereafter exchanged several electronic communications \n     with Daoud. According to the affidavit, during these \n     communications Daoud expressed an interest in engaging in \n     violent jihad, either in the United States or overseas.''\n       (6) Douglas L. Wright, (7) Brandon L. Baxter, (8) Anthony \n     Hayne, (9) Connor C. Stevens, and (10) Joshua S. Stafford--\n     Plot to Bomb Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge in \n     Ohio--May 2012.\n       These five men were arrested on May 1, 2012 after they \n     attempted to detonate an explosive device set on the \n     Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge in Ohio that was \n     given to them by an undercover FBI agent. The accused men are \n     self-proclaimed anarchists who considered carrying out a \n     series of attacks, but ultimately decided to target the \n     bridge in Ohio after an initial plot to use smoke grenades to \n     distract law enforcement in order for co-conspirators to \n     topple financial institution signs atop high rise buildings \n     in downtown Cleveland failed to materialize. ``The defendants \n     conspired to obtain C-4 explosives contained in two \n     improvised explosive devices to be placed and remotely \n     detonated,'' according to the complaint.\n       (11) Bakhtiyor Jumaev and (12) Jamshid Muhtorov--Conspiracy \n     to Provide Material Support to the Islamic Jihad Union \n     (IJU)--March 2012.\n       On March 15, 2012, the FBI arrested Bakhtiyor Jumaev who \n     was charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material \n     support to the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU). The FBI had been \n     conducting an investigation into the activities of Jumaev and \n     his associate, Jamshid Muhtorov, who was arrested in January \n     2012 on similar charges. Jumaev and Muhtorov had pledged \n     support for the IJU and Jumaev sent funds to Muhtorov, \n     specifically intended for the IJU. The U.S. Government has \n     designated the IJU as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n       (13) Amine El Khalifi--Plot to carry out a Suicide Bomb \n     Attack against the U.S. Capitol--February 2012.\n       Amine El Khalifi, an illegal immigrant from Morocco, was \n     arrested on February 17, 2012 for attempting to detonate a \n     bomb in what was envisioned to be a suicide attack against \n     the U.S. Capitol Building. According to an FBI press release, \n     ``El Khalifi allegedly traveled to a parking garage near the \n     U.S. Capitol building. El Khalifi took possession of a MAC-10 \n     automatic weapon and put on a vest containing what he \n     believed to be a functioning bomb. Unbeknownst to El Khalifi, \n     both the weapon and the bomb had been rendered inoperable by \n     law enforcement. El Khalifi walked alone from the vehicle \n     toward the United States Capitol, where he intended to shoot \n     people and detonate the bomb. El Khalifi was arrested and \n     taken into custody before exiting the parking garage.'' The \n     FBI made initial contact with Khalifi in January 2011. Over \n     the course of the year he cited his anger over the ``war on \n     terrorism'' and the ``war on Muslims'' as his rationale \n     behind planned attacks against a military installation and a \n     restaurant in Washington D.C. After acquiring and testing \n     dummy explosives given to him by FBI affiliates, Khalifi \n     modified his plans to conduct a suicide attack against the \n     U.S. Capitol.\n       (14) Sami Osmakac--Plot to Bomb Locations in Tampa, \n     Florida--January 2012.\n       On January 7, 2012, the FBI arrested Sami Osmakac, a \n     naturalized U.S. citizen born in the former Yugoslavia \n     (Kosovo) on one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass \n     destruction. The FBI used a sting operation to apprehend \n     Osmakac who was 25 years old at the time of his arrest. \n     According to FBI investigators, in September 2011, an FBI \n     source reported that Osmakac and another person had asked for \n     Al Qaeda flags at the source's business. The source continued \n     to interact with Osmakac and report to the FBI about his \n     activities. Osmakac allegedly expressed interest in \n     obtaining firearms and explosives for attacks he was \n     planning in the Tampa area, and the source introduced him \n     to an FBI undercover employee reputed to have access to \n     such materials. The undercover employee supplied Osmakac \n     with hand grenades, an assault rifle, a pistol, a car \n     bomb, and an explosive belt. Osmakac was unaware that the \n     items actually did not work. In the course of his plotting \n     Osmakac purportedly discussed targets such as ``night \n     clubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the Operations \n     Center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office in Ybor \n     City, and a business in the South Tampa,'' according to a \n     DOJ press release. Muslims in Tampa reportedly aided the \n     FBI in its investigation. Osmakac purportedly exhibited \n     extremist views prompting at least one local Muslim to \n     tell authorities about him.\n       (15) Jose Pimentel--Plot to Bomb New York City Targets and \n     Troops Returning from Combat Overseas--November 2011.\n       On November 19, 2011, New York City police arrested a \n     convert to Islam named Jose Pimentel on terrorism charges. \n     According to New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W. \n     Kelly, Pimentel purportedly discussed killing U.S. military \n     personnel returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, in \n     conjunction with bombing post offices in and around \n     Washington Heights and police cars in New York City, as well \n     as a police station in Bayonne, N.J. The alleged would-be \n     bomber was building explosive devices when he was arrested \n     after two years of surveillance by the New York City Police \n     Department (NYPD). Pimentel reportedly discussed his plans \n     with an individual he did not know was an NYPD criminal \n     informant. Pimentel sympathized with Al Qaeda and drew \n     inspiration from now-deceased radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. \n     The alleged would-be bomber purportedly tried but failed to \n     correspond with Awlaki via e-mail, and the cleric's death may \n     have sped up Pimentel's plotting. According to the criminal \n     complaint filed in the case, the NYPD tracked Pimentel's \n     internet activity, finding that Pimentel had posted online \n     pro-Al Qaeda material as well as an article detailing how to \n     make a bomb from Inspire Magazine. Working in the apartment \n     of an NYPD criminal informant, Pimentel supposedly followed \n     Inspire's bomb making instructions, scraping match heads, \n     collecting the incendiary material, as well as drilling holes \n     in three pipes, among other steps.\n       (16) Mansour Arbabsiar--Plot to Assassinate the Saudi \n     Ambassador to the United States--October 2011.\n       Mansour Arbabsiar was arrested after he approached a DEA \n     informant, who he believed was a member of Los Zetas, to hire \n     the cartel to carry out a terrorist attack against the Saudi \n     ambassador at a restaurant in Washington. Mr. Arbabsiar had \n     many connections to Iran's military and the Qods Force.\n       (17) Rezwan Ferdaus--Plot to Attack U.S. Capitol and \n     Pentagon--September 2011.\n       On September 28, Rezwan Ferdaus, a U.S. citizen from \n     Ashland, MA, was arrested on terrorism charges. He allegedly \n     plotted to attack the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol with \n     explosives-laden remote-controlled airplanes. According to \n     DOJ, he also planned a ground assault in conjunction with his \n     aerial\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\n     attack, intending to use firearms and to involve six \n     conspirators in this phase of his plot. Ferdaus also \n     purportedly attempted to provide Al Qaeda with modified cell \n     phones he believed would be used as detonators for improvised \n     explosive devices intended to harm U.S. soldiers abroad. As \n     described by DOJ, FBI undercover employees acting as members \n     of Al Qaeda supplied Ferdaus with money, fake explosives for \n     the airplanes, firearms, and hand grenades. In turn, (among \n     other things) Ferdaus provided the cell phone detonators to \n     these phony Al Qaeda recruiters as well as a training video \n     on how to construct them. Ferdaus supposedly began plotting \n     in 2010. In January 2011, he discussed his plans with an FBI \n     informant. In May 2011, he visited the Washington, DC, area \n     to conduct surveillance of his targets and view the site from \n     which he intended to launch his remote-controlled airplanes. \n     According to the FBI, Ferdaus believed that one of his \n     airplanes could collapse the Capitol dome.\n       (18) Agron Hasbajrami--Plot to Fight in Pakistan--September \n     2011.\n       On September 6, 2011, Agron Hasbajrami was arrested at John \n     F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City as he tried \n     to board a flight to Turkey. Hasbajrami allegedly planned to \n     join a jihadist fighting group in the Federally Administered \n     Tribal Areas of Pakistan. He also purportedly sent more than \n     $1,000 to Pakistan to support the efforts of a militant with \n     whom he communicated.\n       (19) Naser Abdo--Plot to Attack Targets Near Fort Hood--\n     July 2011.\n       On July 27, 2011, U.S. Army Private Naser Abdo was arrested \n     near Fort Hood in Texas for allegedly plotting a shooting \n     spree and bombing in the area--near the same place where Army \n     Major Nidal Hasan reportedly killed 13 individuals in 2009. \n     Abdo, described in the media as a Muslim soldier in the 101st \n     Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY, was supposedly absent \n     without leave from the Army after applying for conscientious \n     objector status. A November 2011 superseding indictment \n     charged Abdo with one count of attempted use of a weapon of \n     mass destruction, one count of attempted murder of officers \n     or employees of the United States, two counts of possession \n     of a firearm in furtherance of a federal crime of violence, \n     and two counts of possession of a destructive device in \n     furtherance of a federal crime of violence. Abdo allegedly \n     purchased gunpowder, shotgun ammunition, and a magazine for a \n     semi-automatic pistol at a gun store near Fort Hood. An \n     employee at the gun store supposedly brought Abdo to the \n     attention of law enforcement officers. Federal officials have \n     noted that Abdo also possessed a .40 caliber handgun, bomb \n     making materials, and an article on how to construct an \n     explosive device, among other items. The article was from \n     Inspire, an English-language magazine produced by Al Qaeda in \n     the Arabian Peninsula.\n       (20) Ulugbek Kodirov--Plot to Assassinate President Obama--\n     July 2011.\n       Ulugbek Kodirov, an Uzbek living in Alabama, was arrested \n     when he sought assistance to kill President Obama either by \n     shooting him or using explosives. The affidavit said that the \n     source whom Kodirov contacted for help told authorities that \n     Kodirov supported Islamic extremists and regularly viewed \n     jihadist websites.\n       (21) Emerson Begolly--Plot to Encourage Jihadist Acts in \n     the United States--July 2011.\n       On July 14, 2011, Emerson Begolly, a U.S. citizen from New \n     Bethlehem, PA, was indicted for attempting to encourage \n     jihadists to commit acts of terrorism within the United \n     States and distributing information related to explosives \n     online. In August 2011, he pleaded guilty to ``soliciting \n     others to engage in acts of terrorism within the United \n     States and to using a firearm during and in relation to an \n     assault on FBI agents.'' According to DOJ, Begolly posted \n     ``links to a 101-page document that contain[ed] information \n     on how to set up a laboratory, conduct basic chemistry, and \n     manufacture explosives.''\n       (22) Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif and (23) Walli Mujahidh--Plot \n     to Attack Seattle Military Processing Center--June 2011\n       On June 22, 2011, Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif and Walli \n     Mujahidh, were arrested on terrorism and firearms charges for \n     plotting to attack a Seattle military processing center. An \n     FBI sting operation apprehended the two as they took \n     possession of machine guns they had purchased for the plot. \n     The firearms had been rendered inert as part of the sting \n     operation. Assistant Attorney General for National Security \n     Todd Hinnen described the plot as, ``driven by a violent, \n     extreme ideology.'' While the two reportedly had not worked \n     out all of the details of their plot, they allegedly were \n     frustrated by ``American war policies'' and hoped for an \n     attack that would garner wide attention.\n       (24) Yonathan Melaku--Plot to Shoot Targets in Washington, \n     DC, Area--June 2011\n       On June 23, 2011, DOJ announced that Yonathan Melaku, an \n     Ethiopian native living in Alexandria, VA, was charged with \n     destruction of property and firearm violations. These charges \n     stemmed from five shootings at military installations in \n     Northern Virginia between October and November 2010. No one \n     was harmed in the shootings. It is unclear to what extent \n     Melaku, a Marine Corps reservist, was driven by jihadist \n     motivations; however, investigators linked Melaku to a spiral \n     notebook with numerous Arabic statements referencing the \n     Taliban, Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, ``The Path to Jihad,'' as \n     well as a list of several other individuals associated with \n     foreign terrorist organizations. Law enforcement officials \n     also found a video when they searched Melaku's bedroom. It \n     reportedly depicted ``Melaku in an automobile driving near \n     what appears to be the U.S. Marine Corps Heritage Museum and \n     repeatedly firing a handgun out the passenger-side window.'' \n     In the video, he allegedly states, ``that's my target. That's \n     the military building. It's going to be attacked,'' and then \n     he shouts, ``Allah Akbar.''\n       (25) Waad Ramadan Alwan and (26) Mohanad Shareef Hammadi--\n     Material Support to Al Qaeda in Iraq--May 2011\n       Alwan and Hammadi were arrested on May 25, 2011 in Kentucky \n     on charges to commit conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals abroad \n     and provide material support, including weapons, to Al Qaeda \n     in Iraq among other charges.\n       (27) Ahmed Ferhani and (28) Mohamed Mamdouh--Plot to Attack \n     New York City Targets--May 2011\n       On May 12, 2011, Ahmed Ferhani (an Algerian native living \n     in Queens, NY) and Mohamed Mamdouh (a naturalized U.S. \n     citizen from Morocco) were arrested for plotting to blow up a \n     synagogue as well as churches in New York City. However, the \n     duo had not chosen a specific target. New York City officials \n     alleged that Ferhani was driven by a hatred of Jews and a \n     belief that Muslims are mistreated the world over. He and \n     Mamdouh allegedly had purchased firearms and a hand grenade \n     from an undercover detective posing as a gun dealer.\n       (29) Joseph Jeffrey Brice--Testing Explosives and Proving \n     Material Support to Terrorists--May 2011\n       Joseph Jeffrey Brice was arrested on charges of \n     manufacturing an unregistered firearm and later an additional \n     charge of providing material support for terrorism. Police \n     began to take an interest in Mr. Brice after he was seriously \n     injured in April 2010 while testing a homemade bomb. \n     Investigators discovered videos Brice posted that depicted \n     suicide bombings in Pakistan and links to a terrorism \n     magazine with instructions on how to make explosives. He also \n     posted bomb making videos to YouTube under the name \n     ``StrengthofAllah.'' Mr. Brice also plotted with an \n     unidentified man to rob a Zions First National bank in Idaho \n     although the plot was never acted upon. Authorities believe \n     Brice was not a Muslim; rather, he assumed a Muslim identity \n     online in order to sell his bomb-making expertise.\n       (30) Hafiz Muhammed Sher Ali Khan, (31) Irfan Khan, and \n     (32) Izhar Khan,--Material Support to the Pakistani Taliban--\n     May 2011\n       Six individuals located in South Florida and Pakistan were \n     indicted in the Southern District of Florida on charges of \n     providing financing and other material support to the \n     Pakistani Taliban, a designated foreign terrorist \n     organization.

He was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass \n     destruction. He also allegedly plotted to purchase material \n     to make an improvised explosive device and had researched \n     potential U.S. targets. A chemical supplier provided \n     information to the FBI about a suspicious attempted purchase \n     by Aldawsari. Prosecutors have stated that among the targets \n     Aldawsari researched was the home address for former \n     President George W. Bush. He also researched the names and \n     home addresses of three American soldiers who had previously \n     served at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n       (35) Roger Stockham--Plot to Attack Shia Mosque in \n     Michigan--January 2011\n       Roger Stockham was arrested on January 24, 2011 outside the \n     Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan. Mr. \n     Stockham, a Vietnam veteran from Southern California, was \n     caught with explosives in his vehicle outside the Michigan \n     mosque. Authorities found a large but undisclosed quantity of \n     class-C fireworks including M-80s, which are banned in \n     Michigan, in his car.

Unbeknownst to \n     him, Mr. Martinez was working with undercover FBI agents the \n     whole time as they had been monitoring him since October 1, \n     2010 when a confidential source tipped off authorities to the \n     potential danger. Martinez had attempted to recruit up to \n     five other people to his plot, but they all declined to help \n     him.\n       (37) Mohamed Osman Mohamud--Plot to Bomb Christmas Tree \n     Lighting Ceremony--November 2010\n       Mohamed Osman Mohamud a US Citizen from Somalia was charged \n     with attempting to detonate a vehicle bomb at a Christmas\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\n     tree lighting ceremony in Portland, OR on November 26, 2010. \n     The arrest was the culmination of a months-long investigation \n     and the explosives he was trying to detonate were inert. \n     Mohamud was in touch with contacts in Pakistan and he was \n     trying to travel overseas to engage in a violent jihad, \n     according to the FBI. Mohamud told undercover agents that he \n     had been trying to commit a violent jihad for 4 years, since \n     he was 15.\n       (38) Mohamud Abdi Yusuf and (39) Abdi Mahdi Hussein--\n     Material Support to Al-Shabaab and Conspiracy to Structure \n     Financial Transactions--November 2010\n       On November 1, 2010, Mohamud Abdi Yusuf was arrested on \n     charges of providing material support to al Shabaab and one \n     charge of conspiracy to structure financial transactions. \n     Abdi Mahdi Hussein was arrested one day later on a charge of \n     conspiracy to structure financial transactions. The \n     indictment alleged that Yusuf and Hussein sent funds to al \n     Shabaab supporters in Somalia from licensed money remitting \n     businesses operating in the United States, in part by using \n     fictitious names and telephone numbers to conceal the nature \n     of their activities.\n       (40) Farooque Ahmed--Plot to Bomb Washington, DC, Subway \n     Stations--October 2010\n       Farooque Ahmed was arrested on October 27, 2010, and \n     charged with conspiring with others he believed to be Al \n     Qaeda operatives to bomb subway stations in Washington, DC. \n     His co-conspirators turned out to be undercover law \n     enforcement officers.\n       (41) Abdel Hameed Shehadeh--Travel Abroad to Wage Jihad--\n     October 2010\n       Abdel Hameed Shehadeh was arrested on October 22, 2010, in \n     Honolulu, HI.

According to the plea agreements and other \n     documents filed with the court, Paul Rockwood converted to \n     Islam, and later became a strict adherent to the violent \n     jihad-promoting ideology of cleric Anwar Al-Awlaki. According \n     to the filed court documents, after he moved to King Salmon, \n     Alaska in 2006, Paul Rockwood continued his adherence to Al-\n     Awlaki's ideology and by early 2010, he formalized a target \n     list to include 15 specific locations all outside the state \n     of Alaska. In April 2010, Paul Rockwood gave his written \n     target list to his wife, Nadia, who, knowing of its purpose, \n     carried the list with her on a trip to Anchorage. The FBI's \n     Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) subsequently obtained the \n     target list. On May 19, 2010, JTTF agents questioned Paul \n     Rockwood and provided him a copy of the target list. In \n     response to agents' questions, Rockwood made false \n     statements, denying he had created such a list, denying the \n     purpose of the list and denying ever having such a list. JTTF \n     agents also questioned Nadia Rockwood on May 19, 2010, about \n     transporting the target list authored by her husband to \n     another person. In response, Nadia Rockwood also made false \n     statements to FBI agents.\n       (48) Zachary Adam Chesser and (49) Proscovia Kampire \n     Nzabanita--Conspiracy to Murder ``South Park'' Creators--July \n     2010\n       On July 21, 2010, Zachary Adam Chesser, of Fairfax County, \n     Va., was arrested on charges that he provided material \n     support to al-Shabaab, a designated foreign terrorist \n     organization.

Chesser eventually admitted to encouraging \n     violent jihadists to attack the writers of South Park, \n     including highlighting their residence and urging online \n     readers to ``pay them a visit.'' Chesser's wife, Proscovia \n     Kampire Nzabanita, eventually pleaded guilty to making a \n     false statement to an FBI agent during the course of the \n     FBI's investigation of her husband.\n       (50) Mohamed Alessa and (51) Carlos Almonte--Attempting \n     Material Support to Terrorism--June 2010\n       On June 5, 2010, two New Jersey residents, Mohamed Alessa \n     and Carlos Almonte, were arrested at JFK in New York prior to \n     boarding separate flights to Egypt.

In July 2011, Mohamed \n     pleaded guilty to the charges filed against him.\n       (75) Abdow Munye Abdow--False Statements in a Terrorism \n     Investigation--October 2009\n       On October 13, 2009, a federal grand jury returned a two-\n     count indictment charging Abdow Munye Abdow with making false \n     statements to the FBI after being stopped during a road trip \n     from Minneapolis to Las Vegas with young men, allegedly \n     facilitating their travel to Somalia to fight for al-Shabaab.\n       (76) David Coleman Headley and (77) Tahawwur Hussain Rana--\n     Terrorism Conspiracy--October 2009\n       On October 29, 2009, David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur \n     Hussain Rana were arrested for their alleged roles in \n     conspiracies to provide material support and/or to commit \n     terrorist acts against overseas targets, including facilities \n     and employees of a Danish newspaper that published cartoons \n     of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005. Eventually Headley pleaded \n     guilty to a dozen charges of terrorism stemming from the \n     November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India. Headley also \n     admitted to attending training camps in Pakistan to prepare \n     for terrorist attacks and to traveling to Mumbai to conduct \n     surveillance in 2005.\n       (78) Najibullah Zazi, (79) Adis Medunjanin, and (80) Zarein \n     Ahmedzay--Conspiracy to Use Weapons of Mass Destruction--\n     September 2009\n       On Sept. 8, 2009, Zazi drove from Denver to New York, \n     carrying explosives and other materials necessary to build \n     bombs and carry out attacks in New York City, including a \n     plan to bomb the New York subway system. However, shortly \n     after arriving in New York, Zazi learned that law enforcement \n     was investigating his activities, so he traveled back to \n     Denver, where he was arrested on Sept. 19, 2009. Medunjanin \n     and Ahmedzay were later arrested in connection with Zazi's \n     bombing plot. All three men had traveled to Pakistan for \n     terrorist training and along with others, planned the New \n     York terrorist attacks. Three other individuals were indicted \n     in connection with this terrorist plot:\n       (81) Mohammed Wali Zazi, Najibullah Zazi's father was \n     arrested in the fall of 2009 for lying to investigators. On \n     February 1, 2010, he was indicted for conspiring to dispose \n     of his son's bomb-making materials and chemicals. In July \n     2011, the elder Zazi was found guilty in federal court on one \n     count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and one count of \n     obstruction of justice.\n       (82) Ahmad Wais Afzali, a Queens Imam, was arrested for \n     tipping off Zazi to the FBI investigation. Afzali had been a \n     source of information for federal and New York City \n     investigators in the past. On March 4, 2010, Afzali pleaded \n     guilty to lying to federal officials. He stated in court that \n     he lied about a conversation he had with Zazi tipping him off \n     to the FBI's investigation.\n       (83) Naqib Jaji, Zazi's uncle, eventually pleaded guilty to \n     obstructing justice.\n       (84) Michael Finton--Plot to Bomb the Springfield, \n     Illinois, Federal Building--September 2009\n       On September 23, 2009, Michael C. Finton, who had converted \n     to Islam was arrested after he drove a van he thought was \n     loaded with explosives--but was actually full of inert \n     materials provided to him by the FBI--to the Paul Findley \n     Federal Building in Springfield, IL. Prosecutors say he \n     parked and locked the vehicle, then moved a few blocks away \n     before twice making cell phone calls he believed would \n     trigger a blast that would kill or injure people inside the \n     building. In May 2011, he pleaded guilty to attempting to \n     bomb the building and was sentenced to 28 years in prison.\n       (85) Daniel Patrick Boyd, (86) Hysen Sherifi, (87) Anes \n     Subasic, (88) Zakariya Boyd, (89) Dylan Boyd, (90) Mohammad \n     Omar Aly Hassan, and (91) Ziyad Yaghi--Terrorism Violations--\n     July 2009\n       On July 27, 2009, seven individuals in North Carolina were \n     charged with conspiring to provide material support to \n     terrorists and conspiring to murder, kidnap, maim, and injure \n     persons abroad. The indictment alleged that Daniel Boyd and \n     the other defendants conspired to provide material support \n     and resources to terrorists, including currency, training, \n     transportation, and personnel. The defendants also conspired \n     to murder, kidnap, maim, and injure persons abroad during \n     this period. The object of the conspiracy, according to the \n     indictment, was to advance violent jihad.\n       (92) James Cromitie, (93) David Williams, (94) Onta \n     Williams, and (95) Laguerre Payen--Plot to Blow up Synagogues \n     and Shoot down U.S. Military Planes--May 2009\n       These four men were arrested for plotting to bomb \n     synagogues in the Bronx, New York. Additionally, they planned \n     to use Stinger, surface to air missiles, to shoot down \n     military planes at New York Air National Guard Base. The men \n     were contacted by FBI informants and given inert weapons, \n     which they proceeded to try and use, which is when they were \n     apprehended.\n       (96) Salah Osman Ahmed--Providing Material Support to al-\n     Shabaab--July 2009\n       On February 19, 2009, Salah Osman Ahmed pleaded guilty to \n     providing material support to al-Shabaab.\n       (97) Abdifatah Yusuf Isse--Providing Material Support to \n     al-Shabaab--April 2009\n       On February 19, 2009, Abdifatah Yusuf Isse guilty to \n     providing material support to al-Shabaab.\n       (98) Kamal Said Hassan--Providing Material Support to al-\n     Shabaab--February 2009\n       On February 19, 2009, Kamal Said Hassan pleaded guilty to \n     providing material support to al-Shabaab and making false \n     statements to the FBI.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is also important to understand that suspected \nterrorists who may be in the United States illegally can be detained \nwithin the criminal justice system using at least the following four \noptions: One, they can be charged with a Federal or State crime and \nheld; two, they can be held for violating immigration laws; three, they \ncan be held as material witnesses as part of Federal grand jury \nproceedings; and, four, they can be held under section 412 of the \nPATRIOT Act for up to 6 months.\n  I wish to be very clear about what this amendment is and what it is \nnot about. It is not about whether citizens such as Hamdi and Padilla \nor others who would do us harm should be captured, interrogated, \nincarcerated, and severely punished. They should be. But what about an \ninnocent American? What about someone in the wrong place at the wrong \ntime with the wrong skin color?\n  The beauty of our Constitution is that it gives everyone in the \nUnited States basic due process rights to a trial by a jury of their \npeers. That is what makes this Nation great. As Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor wrote for the plurality in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld:\n\n       As critical as the Government's interests may be in \n     detaining those who actually pose an immediate threat to the \n     national security of the United States during ongoing \n     international conflict, history and common sense teach us \n     that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential \n     to become a means for oppression and abuse of others who do \n     not present that sort of threat.\n\n  Just think of it. If someone is of the wrong race and they are in a \nplace where there is a terrorist attack, they could be picked up, they \ncould be held without charge or trial for month after month, year after \nyear. That is wrong. Experiences over the last decade prove the U.S. is \nsafer now than before the 9/11 attacks. Terrorists are behind bars, \ndangerous plots have been thwarted. The system is working and hopefully \nimproving each day.\n  So I think now is the time to clarify U.S. law to state unequivocally \nthat the government cannot without trial or charge indefinitely detain \nAmericans and green card holders captured inside this country.\n  The Federal Government experimented with indefinite detention of U.S. \ncitizens during World War II, a mistake we now recognize as a betrayal \nof our core values. Let's not repeat it. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\n  I yield the floor for Senator Paul.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Feinstein's \namendment. I compliment her on her work. I also echo the importance of \nthe right to trial by jury. In fact, I am appalled that anyone would \nthink we could arrest anyone in our country without charging them and \ngiving them a right to a trial. It seems so fundamentally un-American.\n  I agree with her also that I think the Supreme Court would apply this \nto anyone. Our amendment will say citizens and permanent residents. But \nI think the Supreme Court, if challenged, will uphold the right to \ntrial by jury of anyone within the United States.\n  Today, we will either affirm the right to trial by jury or restrict \nit. Today, we will vote to affirm the sixth amendment to the \nConstitution or we will spurn it. Today, we will vote to affirm 800 \nyears of history, beginning with the Magna Carta, or we will relinquish \nor, at the very least, diminish a right that Jefferson referred to as \n``the only anchor yet imagined by man, which a government can be held \nto the principles of its Constitution.'' The right to trial by jury was \na check on oppressive government.\n  Opponents of the right to trial by jury will come and they will argue \nthat the American homeland is now a battlefield and that we must \ncircumscribe our right to trial by jury to be safe from terrorists. But \nif we give up our rights, have not the terrorist won? If we let fear \nrelinquish our rights--if we relinquish our rights because of fear, \nwhat is it exactly then we are fighting for?\n  We are asked to relinquish our rights because the battlefield is \nlimitless. It is, though, not a temporary suspension they are asking \nfor, and they request this because they also say the battle is also \nwithout limit. This is not a war that is going to end, nor is it a \nright they will suspend temporarily. They are asking people to \nrelinquish their right to trial by jury for the rest of this limitless \nwar.\n  Those Senators who would propose limiting the right to trial by jury, \nthey deflect and demur that everyone will still have a habeas hearing. \nA habeas hearing is important. They must present the body and a judge \nmight say: Why are you holding this person? But it is not the end of \ndue process; it is the beginning of due process.\n  A habeas hearing is not due process. It is the beginning. We must \nstill have a trial by jury or we do not have the due process our \nFounding Fathers fought for. Those Senators who would abridge this and \nsay a habeas hearing is enough should remember Blackstone's admonition, \n``Every new tribunal, erected for the decision of facts without the \nintervention of a jury . . . is a step towards establishing \naristocracy, the most oppressive of absolute governments.''\n  We are told we cannot do this. We have to put these people outside \nthe constitutional court, that somehow we need something beyond the \nConstitution, that the Constitution is not enough to convict \nterrorists. Yet hundreds of terrorists have been convicted. In fact, \ntwo terrorists in my little small town, Bowling Green, KY, were \napprehended and were tried and were convicted to life for terrorism. We \ncan do it.\n  We are told that only terrorists associated with al-Qaida will this \nbe applied to. We will only take away the right to trial by jury if \nthey are part of al-Qaida. But part of the security apparatus also \ntells us to know your neighbor. Know your neighbor so you can report \nyour neighbor.\n\n  In fact, we are told by the government some of the characteristics \nthat might make you a terrorist. We are told by the Department of \nJustice that if you have stains on your clothing, that if you are \nmissing fingers, if you have changed the color of your hair recently, \nthat if you prefer to pay in cash, that if you own weatherized \nammunition, if you own multiple guns, you might be a terrorist; that \nyour neighbor should report you.\n  Do we want to relinquish our right to trial by jury if the \ncharacteristics of terrorism are wanting to pay by cash? In Missouri, \nthey had fusion centers. They are supposed to accumulate information \nabout terrorists and sort of assimilate Federal and local and have \nbetter communications.\n  Sounds good. I am all for better communications. Before 9/11 we did \nmess up. We did not communicate well. But from this fusion center comes \na document that says: Beware of people who have bumper stickers \nsupporting third-party candidates, beware of people who believe in \nstricter immigration laws, beware of people who support the right to \nlife; they might be terrorists. This is an official document. Do we \nwant to give up the right to trial by jury when we are being told \nsomeone who keeps food in their basement might be a terrorist?\n  Am I the only one who fears the relinquishing of a right we have had \nfor 800 years? Am I the only one who fears that a terrorist might be \nsomeone whom we might describe as someone who is a constitutionalist? \nThis is an ancient right to trial by jury we have had since virtually \nthe beginning of our historic times. The Greeks and the Romans had a \nform of right to trial by jury.\n  In 725 A.D., Morgan of Glamorgan, the Prince of Wales, said, ``For as \nChrist and his Twelve Apostles were finally to judge the world, so \nhuman tribunals should be composed of twelve wise men.'' We have been \ndoing this for hundreds upon hundreds of years. We saw it as a way to \ncheck the oppression of the King but also to check the potential \noppression of government.\n  England and America have for centuries prized this right to trial by \njury. It seems a shame to scrap it now. Our Founders believed so firmly \nin the right to trial by jury that they enshrined it in the body of the \nConstitution, again in this sixth amendment and again every State of \nthe Union has within the body of its constitution the right to trial by \njury.\n  It seems a shame to scrap it now. Churchill proudly remembers our \njoint devotion to trial by jury. He writes, ``We must never cease to \nproclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the \nrights of man which are the joint inheritance of the English-speaking \nworld and which through the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, habeas \ncorpus, trial by jury and the English common law find their most famous \nexpression in the Declaration of Independence.''\n  Senator Lafollette, a famous Senator from Wisconsin, put it well. He \nsaid:\n\n       Let no man think that we can deny civil liberty to others \n     and retain it for ourselves. When zealot agents of the \n     government arrest suspected radicals without warrant, hold \n     them without prompt trial, deny them access to counsel and \n     admission of bail . . . we have shorn the Bill of Rights of \n     its sanctity . . .\n\n  Today we have a chance to reaffirm our belief in the right to trial \nby jury. We have a chance to replace fear with confidence, confidence \nthat no terrorist and no country will ever conquer us if we remain \nsteadfast, steadfast to the principles of our founding documents.\n  We have nothing to fear except our own unwillingness to defend what \nis naturally ours, our God-given rights. We have nothing to fear that \nshould cause us to relinquish our rights as free men and women. I urge \nmy colleagues to reject fear, to reject the siren call for an ever more \npowerful government.\n\n  Justice White put it well when he said:\n\n       A right to jury trial is granted criminal defendants in \n     order to prevent the oppression by the government.\n\n  It is not just about a fair trial, it is about checking your \ngovernment. This vote today is about more than just combating terrorism \nor a fair trial, it is about relinquishing the right to the checks and \nbalances, to the checks that cause and help us to check the relentless \ngrowth of government. It is about whether a free people are willing to \nremain steadfast in our defense of an 800-year-old right that finds \njustice for the accused and provides restraint and limits on despotism.\n  I hope my colleagues will today vote against limitations on the trial \nby jury, recognize its sanctity, and recognize the importance of \nsomething that brings Members from the right side of the aisle together \nwith Members of the left side of the aisle who believe strongly in the \ndefense of the Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nFeinstein-Lee amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. At \nthe outset, I wish to note this amendment is the product of bipartisan \ndiscussion and collaboration on an issue that is important to all \nAmericans. I am pleased to have been a part of that process.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have worked closely together over the course \nof the past year to craft what we believe represents a very prudent \ncourse in protecting both our Nation and our liberties at the same \ntime. Security is important. And precisely because it is important it \nmust not be acquired at the expense of our individual liberty. It may \nwell be said that government's most important basic responsibility is \nto protect the liberties of its citizens. Our Nation has fought wars on \nAmerican soil and around the world in defense of individual liberty, \nand we must not sacrifice this most fundamental right in pursuit of \ngreater security, especially when we can achieve security without \ncompromising liberty.\n  The Feinstein-Lee amendment does precisely that. It protects liberty \nby ensuring that no American will be deprived of due process. The fifth \namendment states:\n\n       No person . . . shall be deprived of life, liberty or \n     property, without due process of law.\n\n  The sixth amendment, likewise, guarantees that individuals accused of \na crime will have access to an attorney and access to a trial by a jury \nconsisting of that person's peers. Our amendment protects those rights \nand it provides the following:\n\n       An authorization to use military force, a declaration of \n     war, or any similar authority shall not authorize detention \n     without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent \n     resident of the United States apprehended in the United \n     States.\n\n  It is important to note the Supreme Court has never specifically held \nthat an authorization for the use of military force somehow authorizes \nthe indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen or a U.S. person apprehended \nwithin the United States, and I don't think we should break new ground \nhere. I don't think we should start opening that precedent and suggest \nthat is somehow acceptable. The Constitution does, in fact, require \nnothing less than traditional due process for all Americans apprehended \nwithin the United States.\n  As Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia has written:\n\n       The gist of the Due Process Clause, as understood at the \n     founding and since, was to force the government to follow . . \n     . common-law procedures traditionally deemed necessary before \n     depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. When a \n     citizen was deprived of liberty because of alleged criminal \n     conduct, those procedures typically required committal by a \n     magistrate followed by indictment and trial.\n\n  I understand and respect, of course, the fact that we live in \nperilous times. We, unfortunately, as Americans have enemies not only \naround the world but even within our own borders. This is unfortunate. \nThis creates challenging times for us. I hope and pray every day we \nwill be successful in fending off those who would harm us, those who \nhate our way of life and everything about us and will do everything in \ntheir power to destroy us and our liberty. But that does not--it \ncannot, it will not--mean we, as Americans, should surrender our basic \ninstinct to be free.\n  We must stand behind our 225-year-old founding document as it has \nbeen amended to ensure that our liberty isn't taken away from us to \ngive us a path toward providing for our security without jeopardizing \nthe freedom our American citizens cherish so much and have fought so \nhard and for so long to protect.\n  Granting the U.S. Government the power to deprive its own citizens of \nlife, liberty, or property without full due process of law goes against \nthe very nature of our Nation's great constitutional values. This \namendment--the Feinstein-Lee amendment--protects those values. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, somewhere on this desk I have a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBaucus be added as a cosponsor to my amendment No. 3018.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it now be in \norder for Senator Leahy to call up his amendment No. 2955; that the \ntime until 6 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form; that at 6 p.m. \nthe Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Leahy amendment No. \n2955; further, that there be no amendments in order to the Leahy \namendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, but I am not objecting, I \nwish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman.\n  Is it our intention to continue to consider amendments following this \namendment, and I don't know whether there is a possibility of votes, \nbut we certainly--isn't it correct to say we could consider amendments, \nand we will try to dispose of them given the limited time we have to \nconsider the bill?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would be my hope that after this vote, we would be able \nto clear amendments, perhaps----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Debate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And to have the Senators debate amendments.\n  I know Senator Coburn will be here between now and 6 o'clock to \ndebate the Leahy amendment. We don't need to protect him further since \nthe time is equally divided, and he can have part of the half hour of \ntime.\n  But it is my hope that people who want to dispose of amendments will \ncome after the 6 o'clock vote and bring these amendments to our \nattention, see if our staffs can make progress, clear amendments, and \nmaybe package some votes for tomorrow morning. We can make progress \nafter this vote if our colleagues will cooperate with us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend, and I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2955\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2955.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2955.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is actually a simple amendment. It \nstrengthens the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act. That is the \nFederal death and disability program that we have for our Nation's \nfirst responders who are killed or disabled in the line of duty. There \nis nothing new to this body in this amendment.\n  An earlier version of this legislation was adopted on the Senate \nfloor by voice vote in December of 2001. It was adopted as part of the \nFAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. In \nfact, following the Senate's adoption of the amendment, I worked \nclosely with the House Judiciary chairman, the distinguished Member of \nthe House, Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas. He and I added additional \nreforms so we ended up with an improved bill. We ended up with a\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\nmodest expansion of benefits for deserving emergency medical responders \nand a host of reforms to make the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \nProgram stronger, more efficient, and more cost-effective.\n  The most important thing, CBO, which initially had concern, reviewed \nit and found this cost nothing. The CBO recognized the cost savings \nassociated with the reforms and efficiencies that we incorporated and \ndetermined that the modest expansion of benefits was fully offset by \nthese reforms. What we are saying, since 1974, this country has \nrecognized that we have first responders who are killed and disabled in \nthe line of duty whose families deserve our help. This bipartisan \nlegislation does that.\n  We have determined that a police officer who is shot in the line of \nduty, a first responder, a firefighter, an emergency medical responder \nand others who are killed in the line of duty, died as a result of \ntheir work in the line of duty, that they would have and share in the \nsame benefit we have provided for the whole country. This clarifies the \npolicy for all first responders who serve their communities in an \nofficial capacity.\n  It is hard to think of anybody who could possibly disagree with this \namendment. It costs taxpayers nothing. It builds upon and improves what \nwe have always done.\n  Let me tell a story. Before we had this act, before we had this law, \nwhen I was a young State's attorney, the police chief in Manchester, \nVT, responding to a burglary, was shot and killed. He was a man, the \nsole support of his wife and his aging mother. It turned out there was \nno program at that time, no assistance from the state or Federal \nGovernment. This was prior to 1974, 1976, and there was no program to \ncare for them, to care for the widow. Therefore, there was not even \nmoney to pay for his funeral.\n  I was president of the Vermont State's attorneys association at the \ntime, and I started making calls around the State. We quickly raised \nthe money for his funeral and for some modest help for his family. I \nstill remember that funeral. It was one of those days we often have in \nthe winter during a snowfall when there are very large snowflakes. They \ncall them silver dollar snowflakes, and they are very large. They were \nfalling gently out of the sky. But on the two-lane road leading to this \nsmall church, a typical New England church with a white steeple on it, \nfor miles and miles all we saw is that of the snow coming down in the \nreflection. The blue lights from the police cars were flashing, the red \nlights from the firetrucks were flashing, and the white and red lights \nfrom the ambulances were flashing. I have never forgotten that.\n  Today, thanks to Federal legislation, if that happened again, there \nwould at least be benefits, as it should be. But this is something that \ncould happen in Vermont or Rhode Island or any other State in this \ncountry. This measures contained in this amendment were passed in the \nHouse overwhelmingly by voice vote in June of this year. It passed here \non the floor of the Senate by voice vote before that. It has no cost to \nthe taxpayers, which is something Chairman Smith and I worked on \ntogether to ensure. I hope it will pass and at 6 o'clock we vote on it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask that time be equally divided during the call of the \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDeMint be added as a cosponsor of the amendment entitled ``Feinstein-\nCollins amendment No. 3018.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment offered by Senator Feinstein. The purpose of our amendment is \nto make clear that a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident arrested \nin this country cannot be detained indefinitely without charge or \ntrial. This amendment is necessary because current law with respect to \nthe indefinite detention of U.S. citizens within the United States \nremains unclear after more than 11 years of a persistent conflict in \nwhich the enemy often does not distinguish itself from civilians.\n  Without this amendment, it is conceivable that an American citizen \ncould be arrested, detained, and held without charge or trial in order \nto address the gap in the law. Our amendment is necessary.\n  Last year the fiscal year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act \ndefined the scope of the detention authority provided under the 2001 \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force for detainees captured outside \nthe United States. But the scope of detention authority, as it relates \nto U.S. citizens and lawful residents captured or arrested inside the \nUnited States, was left nebulous.\n  Because of this legal ambiguity, despite the guarantees enshrined in \nour Constitution, an American citizen could be indefinitely detained \nwithout charge or trial, even if they are detained in the United \nStates.\n  I do not believe that many of us intended to authorize such a \nsweeping detention authority within the United States when we voted to \nallow our military to pursue al-Qaida following the 9/11 attacks.\n  Because Congress was responsible for authorizing the use of military \nforce in the first place, it is our duty, our obligation, to define \ncarefully the scope of the detention authority we intended in the AUMF. \nIf we do not clarify this important issue, the Federal courts and the \nexecutive branch will be left to substitute their judgment for ours. \nThis amendment specifically addresses the issue of American citizens \nand lawful permanent residents detained in the United States, and it \nwould clarify that it is not the intention of the Congress to allow for \ntheir indefinite detention.\n  Let me briefly mention what the Feinstein-Collins amendment does not \ndo.\n  First, it does not change the ruling in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. In that \ncase, the Supreme Court ruled that an American citizen who wages war \nagainst U.S. troops in an active combat zone can be taken into \npreventive detention in order to keep that person from continuing to \nwage war overseas against American military forces.\n  When an American citizen leaves this country to wage war against his \nfellow citizens, he relinquishes certain rights, otherwise supported by \nthe Constitution, and I agree with the Court's decision in this case.\n  Next, this amendment does not preclude intelligence gathering \nsubsequent to a suspected terrorist being taken into detention.\n  The intelligence gathered from a suspect in the hours or days after \nhis arrest can be vital to preventing further acts of violence or in \nuncovering terrorist networks at home or abroad. This amendment \nbalances the ability to gather this important information with the \nsuspect's rights by providing some flexibility within the \nConstitution's bounds.\n  For example, it does not circumscribe the existing public safety \nexception to Miranda. This exception permits law enforcement, in \ncertain circumstances, to engage in a limited and focused unwarned \ninterrogation and allows the government to introduce the statement as \ndirect evidence in a judicial proceeding. Law enforcement officials, \nconfronted with an emergency, may question a suspect held in custody \nabout an imminent threat to public safety without providing Miranda \nwarnings first.\n  In addition, nothing precludes other Federal agents from gathering \nintelligence without providing Miranda rights. Under current law, a \nU.S. citizen cannot be tried in a military tribunal, and that does not \nchange under our amendment.\n  Finally, this amendment does not change the treatment of those who \nare here on temporary visas, such as students or travelers--the kind of \nvisas that were used by the 9/11 terrorists.\n  In closing, let me talk about how this amendment would have changed \nthe treatment of some U.S. citizens detained under the authorization \nfor use of military courts during the last 11 years had it become law.\n  First, because this amendment only covers American citizens captured \nin\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\nthe United States, it would not have affected the detention of John \nWalker Lindh, for example. So the only U.S. citizen affected by this \namendment would have been Jose Padilla. If this amendment were the law, \nJose Padilla's detention would have ended as it did under the Bush \nadministration--in a Federal courtroom, where he was charged with \naiding terrorists in a terrorist organization.\n  Since 2001 terrorism has claimed far too many victims, both abroad \nand here in our country. But it is crucially important that in pursuing \nthe war on terrorism, we must assure our fellow citizens their \nconstitutional rights--the very foundation of what makes us Americans. \nFor this reason, I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Feinstein's \namendment, and I strongly urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2955\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes noting \nwhy I am against the expansion of the Dale Long Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits Improvements Act. And it is a great example of where we find \nourselves in the country. If you read the Constitution and look at the \nenumerated powers, we have a Federal program to benefit what is really \nthe responsibility of States. Now, nobody is going to say this isn't a \nbeneficial program to those poor families who might need this. And the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee has done a wonderful job in terms \nof offsetting this so that there is no additional cost, and for that I \ncongratulate him. But this is a great example of why we have $88 \ntrillion in unfunded liabilities and are $16 trillion in debt--because \nwe are doing a function that is truly the responsibility of the States.\n  The PSOB Program was originally designed, in its original design, to \nbe a model so that the States would set up and demonstrate to them how \nthey could structurally set up their own programs. Over the last 30 \nyears, Congress has continued to expand this program, and now we spend \nabout $81 million to $85 million a year on this program. I am not \nsaying it is not needed money for the families, but we are going to \nexpand a program that is truly not a Federal responsibility.\n  I have no hopes this will be defeated. I know it won't. But I wanted \nto raise this question: Given what is in front of us, it is one thing \nto meet the needs under our Federal requirements for Medicare and \nMedicaid, but when are we going to stop expanding programs that aren't \ntruly our responsibility? The cause is great. It is appropriate for a \ngovernment agency to help in times for the people who actually put \ntheir lives on the line for us. But is it a Federal responsibility? The \nanswer is no, it is not. It is a State responsibility. As we assume \nmore and more responsibilities for the States, with budget deficits in \nexcess of $1 trillion, what we are going to do is find ourselves at a \npoint where we are going to have to make cuts in programs that are our \nresponsibility.\n  All I ask you to do is think about whether this is truly a \nresponsibility of the Federal Government and whether we ought to be \nexpanding the program. It is well-intentioned and does great work, I \ndon't discount that. It is well-deserved, I don't discount that. But is \nit a responsibility of the Federal Government?\n  I would state to the chairman that I would be happy to have a voice \nvote on this and not force a vote because I know the outcome and we \nshouldn't waste everybody's time to do that. So I ask for a voice vote \nand to vitiate the vote that is scheduled for 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that request?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am not sure what that request was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was for a voice vote on the Leahy \namendment now.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be asking for the yeas and nays at \nthe appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we will be \nvoting at 6 p.m. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And as I understand, the managers will be requesting a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Vermont have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma \nhas noted his objection, and I appreciate him doing that, but I would \nalso note that we share different views on this. For example, the \nSenator from Oklahoma was the lone vote opposing the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2012. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram has saved the lives of hundreds and even thousands of our \npolice officers. He opposes the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act, \nwhich provides a Federal death benefit to surviving families of first \nresponders who are killed in the line of duty. And he is objecting to \nthe passage of the bipartisan, bicameral, and cost-neutral Public \nSafety Officers' Benefits Improvements Act of 2012, which would make \nimportant reforms to a program that has assisted the families of \nthousands of police officers and other first responders who have lost \ntheir lives protecting their communities and fellow citizens.\n  During the months when we were trying to pass the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefits legislation, we heard from Chuck Canterbury, the \nhighly respected president of the Fraternal Order of Police. He is one \nof our Nation's law enforcement leaders. He wrote to the chairs of both \nthe Senate and House Judiciary Committees about the distinguished \nSenator's opposition to this cost-neutral Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits Program reform, and he concluded:\n\n       The FOP views this not as a politician embracing the \n     principle of federalism, but as a . . . ploy to place even \n     greater strain between law enforcement and other public \n     safety officers that serve on the local and State level and \n     their colleagues employed by the Federal government. When a \n     police officer puts himself in harm's way, he does not stop \n     to think about jurisdiction. He does not ask the offender if \n     he is committing a local, State, or Federal crime. He acts in \n     the best interest of the safety of those he swore to protect. \n     A family that loses a loved one in the line of duty should \n     not just be left adrift, their sacrifice ignored because \n     their loved one was a local firefighter or State Trooper and \n     not a Federal agent.\n\n  I hope the Senate will overwhelmingly pass this bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. We have always supported our first responders. I think \nback to my own experience in law enforcement and also the experience of \nformer Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado, who I joined to \nwrite legislation, based upon his experience in the sheriff's \ndepartment in Colorado, and my experience as a prosecutor, to provide \nassistance to state and local law enforcement to obtain bulletproof \nvests. The amendment we consider today is in that same spirit. Anybody \nwho served in law enforcement, anybody who served as a volunteer \nfirefighter or emergency medical responder, anybody in any part of this \ncountry who serves in these capacities knows the need for this. The \nfact that we have been able to improve the existing law, with no cost \nto the taxpayer, is even better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from the Congressional Fire Services Institute, International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Fire Fighters, \nNational Fire Protection Association, National Volunteer Fire Council, \nand the American Ambulance Association in support of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 28, 2012.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We are writing to express support for \n     S.A. 2955, which would amend S. 3254, the National Defense \n     Authorization Act to include language from the Public Safety \n     Officers' Benefits Improvements Act (PSOBIA). As you know, \n     the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program provides \n     critical assistance to the families of public safety officers \n     who suffer a fatal injury in the line of duty and to public \n     safety officers who suffer a permanently disabling injury in \n     the line of duty.\n       PSOBIA would make several important changes to how PSOB is \n     administered, including making employees and volunteer \n     members of private, non-profit EMS/rescue\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\n     agencies eligible. Volunteer and career firefighters and EMTs \n     in private, non-profit fire departments already qualify for \n     PSOB while their counterparts in non-fire-based, private non-\n     profit EMS systems generally do not. PSOBIA fixes this \n     inequity.\n       The bill also clarifies that public safety officers who \n     suffer a fatal vascular rupture injury in the line of duty \n     are eligible for PSOB. The Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits \n     Act was enacted in 2003 and created a presumption that public \n     safety officers who suffer a fatal heart attack or stroke \n     within 24 hours of engaging in emergency response activity \n     are considered to have died as a result of a line of duty \n     injury and thus qualify for PSOB. Vascular rupture is a type \n     of injury that is similar to but technically distinct from \n     heart attack and stroke.\n       To reiterate, our organizations support S.A. 2955, which \n     makes several minor but extremely important changes to how \n     the PSOB program operates without any additional cost to the \n     federal government.\n           Sincerely,\n     Congressional Fire Services Institute,\n     International Association of Fire Chiefs,\n     International Association of Fire Fighters\n     National Fire Protection Association\n     National Volunteer Fire Council.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    American Ambulance Association,\n\n                                                November 27, 2012.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon.  John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain: We are \n     writing to ask your support for a critical amendment to the \n     FY 13 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Senate \n     Amendment 2955, the Dale Long Public Safety Officers' \n     Benefits Improvements Act of 2012.\n       The American Ambulance Association (AAA) is the primary \n     trade association for ground ambulance service agencies whose \n     combined membership provides emergency and non-emergency \n     medical services to over 75% of the U.S. population. Each day \n     our first responders put their lives on the line to serve our \n     nation, yet they face an inequity in the existing Public \n     Safety Officer Benefits Program, a longstanding Federal \n     program designed to help honor those that lose their lives in \n     the line of duty.\n       In order to fix this inequity, we strongly urge you to \n     support Senate Amendment 2955. The amendment includes \n     critical improvements to the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \n     Program, also known as the Dale Long Public Safety Officers' \n     Benefits Improvements Act of 2012. This amendment would make \n     members of rescue squads or ambulance crews operated by \n     nonprofit entities eligible for benefits paid when a public \n     safety officers is permanently disabled or dies in the line \n     of duty. The amendment also includes a host of important \n     reforms to the program including the reduction of claims \n     processing and administrative to name a few. Just as \n     importantly, the Congressional Budget Office has provided a \n     neutral score on the issue\n       Every state in the country has communities that have \n     elected to have their emergency medical services provided by \n     nongovernmental EMS agencies. The Public Safety Officer \n     Benefit (PSOB) program, however, currently applies only to \n     those public safety officers employed by a federal, state, or \n     local government entity. The brave men and women employed by \n     nongovernmental EMS agencies provide the same vital emergency \n     medical services as governmental officers and do so daily in \n     the same dangerous environments. It is unfair to penalize \n     nongovernmental public safety officers and their families \n     simply because their employer is a non-profit EMS agency \n     which cannot afford to offer the same level of benefits as \n     the PSOB program. This amendment would correct this inequity.\n       We thank you for all your years of service to our country \n     and to the support you've provided to the nation's first \n     responders. Again, we urge you to support Senate Amendment \n     2955 as you move forward on the NDAA bill. If you have any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact Tristan North of \n     the AAA at tnorth@the-aaa-.org or 202-486-4888.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Steve Williamson,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                   American Ambulance Association.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask to call up amendments Nos. 3007, \n3008, 3009, 3010, and 3013.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And No. 3011.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I was listening to the dialog here that was \ngoing back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican time has expired under the \ncurrent order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes for the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I just wanted to comment that I was \nlistening to the discussion going on here about the Leahy amendment.\n  I don't know what the history of all this is, but I simply want to \nsay that I think the Senator from Oklahoma asked a very legitimate \nquestion that we all ought to consider; that is, Is this legitimately a \nFederal responsibility? Given the fiscal plight that we are in and \ncareening toward the cliff, do we want to keep expanding Federal \nprograms? But in deference to his colleagues and the timeframe here, he \nsaid he understands that it will be a virtually unanimous vote despite \nhis question, which is legitimate and I think we all ought to consider. \nBut that was rejected. And then the response to somebody who I think \nwas trying to be deferential to the Senator from Vermont and his \nproposals sort of is put in a position where it looks as though he is \nnot trying to be conscious of the situation that exists.\n  I think he asked a legitimate question to which all of us, given our \ncurrent fiscal situation, ought to give due consideration.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would note that this is a very modest \nexpansion of benefits for emergency medical technicians who serve at \nthe direction of a state emergency response system, and is entirely \noffset by other provisions in the amendment. It simply reforms and \nimproves what is already law and adds no cost--no Federal cost.\n  And if I could have the attention of the Senator from Indiana, this \nis less an expansion than a correction to a gap in the existing law. It \nis a reform of programs we have, and it is of no cost to the Federal \ntaxpayers.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona on the floor. I am perfectly willing \nto yield back my time and go to vote if he wishes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, two things.\n  No. 1, we are going to proceed to the rollcall vote in a moment, and \nwith Senator McCain's support and consent, I would like to let our \ncolleagues know we will be here after this vote. That doesn't mean \nthere will be any additional votes tonight. That is not up to us to \ndecide; that is the leadership call. But we will be here to try to \nclear amendments for either voice votes or for votes tomorrow if there \nare no rollcall votes today or for debate. Senator McCain and I are \nprepared to stay here to receive the amendments people want to discuss \nand to see if we can't get some of them cleared and perhaps voice-voted \ntonight.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield all remaining time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nBingaman), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk), and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Bennet).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have been talking now with Senator McCain. This is what \nour plan is for tonight and for the morning. In the morning, we would \nhope we would be able--we would first hope to address the Kyl \namendment. We would hope to take up and dispose of the Kyl amendment \nfirst thing in the morning.\n  We would then expect to move to Senator Ayotte's amendment, to which \nthere may or may not be a second-degree or a side-by-side amendment \noffered. After that matter is disposed of, we would expect then to move \nto a Hagan amendment. And, in between, it is our intent to offer \ncleared amendments.\n  I will let Senator McCain join me on this. But these are amendments \nwhich have been cleared. People will have a chance overnight to look at \nthem and see if there is any reason that they want rollcall votes or \nvoice votes on these. If there are, we expect they are going to have to \ncome down, object, and vote on those matters. But our staff works hard. \nWe work with the committees of jurisdiction, we work with people we \nbelieve have any interest in these amendments. We have perhaps 50 or \n100 amendments which we are looking at.\n  We want to accommodate Senators. We also want to accommodate \npotential opponents. We have done our best to do both, sponsors and \nopponents. But that is our plan for tonight and for tomorrow morning. \nWe expect we would then ask Senator Hagan to be recognized tonight to \nspeak on an amendment, not to call it up but to speak on an amendment \nthat she would be offering tomorrow in the queue which I just \ndescribed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I \nthink we have made reasonably good progress today. I think we have \ndisposed of a number of important amendments. We still have a number of \nissues, particularly the detainee issue, which will probably require \nthat we have a number of speakers. But also I hope we could reach a \ntime limit on that.\n  The Senator mentioned that there may be possibly a side-by-side or a \nsecond-degree amendment to the Ayotte amendment. But I think the \nchairman would agree, we have made pretty good progress. We have still \ngot quite a long way to go. We have a full day tomorrow. Hopefully we \ncan get it down to a bare minimum of amendments so we can finish.\n  I thank all of our colleagues for their cooperation. We thank the \nSenator from North Carolina for discussing her amendment this evening.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There will be no more votes tonight. After Senator Hagan's \nremarks are completed, I ask unanimous consent that there be a period \nof morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, Mr. President, I wish to call up amendment \nNo.----\n   Mr. LEVIN. Forgive the interruption again, Mr. President. I hate to \ninterrupt. There will be no amendments called up tonight. The \nexpectation is that you would be recognized tomorrow in that queue to \ncall up the amendment, but that tonight you proceed without calling the \namendment up, holding that off until tomorrow.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about an amendment I am \ngoing to call up tomorrow, amendment No. 3995. I believe it is \ncritical, this amendment to our long-term national security. In August \nof 2011, the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, and \nthe Navy signed a memorandum of understanding to invest $170 million \neach to spur the production of advanced aviation and marine biofuels \nunder the Defense Production Act.\n  This joint memorandum of understanding requires substantial cost \nsharing from private industry of at least a 1-to-1 match. The main \nobjective of this memorandum of understanding is to spur the \nconstruction or retrofit of commercial scale advanced biofuel \nrefineries. These facilities will produce drop-in advanced biofuels \nmeeting military specifications. They will be located in geographically \ndiverse locations for ready market access, and will have no significant \nimpact on the supply of agricultural commodities for the production of \nfood.\n  As the largest single consumer of fuel in the world, the Department \nof Defense uses approximately 120 million barrels of oil each year, \nspending over $17 billion in fiscal year 2011 on fuel. This dependency \non a single source of energy leaves our military's readiness at risk.\n  When the price of oil goes up $1, it costs the Navy an additional $30 \nmillion and the entire Department of Defense over $100 million. Last \nyear alone, this forced the Navy to pay an additional $500 million \nbecause the price of fuel was higher than budgeted.\n  DOD is not going to allow these additional fuel costs to directly \naffect our missions in Afghanistan. However, cost overruns could force \nthe military to curtail training and less urgent operations resulting \nin increased risk to future missions. Developing a commercially viable \nbiofuels industry could help DOD diversify its fuel source and reduce \nthe risk of energy volatility.\n  Our senior military leaders understand that programs such as this MOU \nare critical to national security. In July, the Secretary of the Navy, \nthe Chief of Naval Operations, and the Marine Corps Commandant \nexpressed their concern to Chairman Levin.\n\n       The demand for fuel in theater means we depend on \n     vulnerable supply lines, the protection of which puts lives \n     at risk. Our potential adversaries both on land and at sea \n     understand this critical vulnerability and seek to exploit \n     it.\n\n  The Navy and the Marine Corps have been aggressively evaluating how \nboth energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy can provide \ntactical benefits to expeditionary forces.\n  Given the impact of this MOU to our national security, I was \ndisappointed when the Senate Armed Services Committee marked up the \nfiscal year 2013 Defense authorization bill and an amendment was \nadopted that would prevent the Defense Department from participating \nfurther in the MOU. The bipartisan amendment that I offer today seeks \nto strike that measure.\n  I believe Senators on both sides of the aisle agree that energy \nsecurity is a national security imperative.\n  However, there are honest disagreements over how the United States \npursues energy independence. These divergent views are reflected in the \ndebate over the joint MOU.\n  One argument used by opponents of the MOU is budget related. Given \nthe current budget restraints, the Department of Defense should not be \nspending resources to help spur a commercially viable advanced biofuels \nindustry. It is important to put in context the amount of money the \nNavy is spending on this program. The $170 million dedicated to the MOU \nin one fiscal year represents .03 percent of the entire fiscal year \n2013 budget request of the Department of Defense. Let me repeat that. \nIt is .03 percent.\n  This is not to dismiss concerns about our current budget situation. I \ntoo am\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\ndeeply concerned about our country's fiscal path, and I continue to \nadvocate for Congress to put politics aside and remake the tough \nchoices necessary to ensure future generations are not burdened by \nunsustainable debt. However, as we tackle our budgetary challenges, we \nmust not harm programs important to our national and economic security. \nThis joint MOU is one such program.\n  What about the cost of advanced biofuels? In the past 2 years, the \ncost of biofuels purchased for these 50-50 fuel blends used in Navy \ntraining exercises has dropped by over 50 percent. Moreover, the Navy \nhas made clear that they will not procure large quantities of biofuels \nfor operations until they are cost competitive with traditional fuels. \nThe MOU is bringing the cost of biofuels in line with petroleum, and \nnow is not the time to stop the program from reaching its goals.\n  As I mentioned earlier, diversifying our energy mix will also help \nprotect our military from the costs associated with price spikes in \noil. Sudden energy cost increases force DOD to reallocate finite \nresources away from long-term priorities.\n  Critics of the MOU often say if the government wants to promote \nadvanced biofuels, we have a Department of Energy. Of course, the \nDepartment of Energy has an important role to play, but so does the \nNavy and the Department of Agriculture. From my perspective, leveraging \nthe unique capabilities of each agency, in partnership with the private \nsector, exemplifies the type of innovative approach needed to solve our \ncountry's most vexing problems.\n  Looking back in history, the Navy's leadership on energy innovation \nis nothing new. It was the Navy that shifted from sail to steam in the \nmiddle of the 19th century, steam to oil in the early 20th century, and \npioneered nuclear power in the middle of the 20th century. At each of \nthese transitions, there were those who questioned the need, challenged \nthe cost, or simply opposed change of any kind.\n  I want to make clear that today's debate is not about oil versus \nbiofuels. I was very pleased with the recent International Energy \nAgency report that projected that the United States would be the \nworld's top oil producer by 2020 and a net exporter of oil around 2030. \nHowever, this does not mean we should abandon efforts to diversify our \nenergy supply.\n  In 1913, on the eve of World War I, Winston Churchill made a historic \ndecision to shift the power source for the British Navy ships from coal \nto oil. This decision was not without controversy, but Churchill \nsuccessfully argued that safety and certainty in oil lies in ``variety \nand variety alone.''\n  Although at the time Churchill was talking about oil, his message is \njust as applicable to today's debate about biofuels. True energy \nsecurity requires energy diversity.\n  I urge my colleagues at a later date--tomorrow--to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to read as follows.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, even in this dysfunctional Senate, we as \nMembers, we as Senators have a unique opportunity to be advocates for \nthose who need our help, and we need to provide a voice for those who \nare in need. For years--a decade, really--I have been an advocate for \nallowing increased engagement with Cuba. I have been an advocate for \nKansas and American farmers having the opportunity to sell their \nagricultural commodities to Cuba. I have always believed that increased \nengagement with Cuba is a better way to bring about the changes that we \nall desire for the Cuban people.\n  Additionally, I thought that our policy toward Cuba was especially \ndamaging and created a significant disadvantage to Kansas farmers and \ntheir competition for markets around the globe, and it was ineffective \nbecause it was a unilateral embargo. The market and demand for American \ncommodities do exist off our coastline, and yet Congress and \nadministrations over the years have failed to make it possible for \nthere to be much sale or much relationship, commercial relationship, \nwith the people of Cuba.\n  For more than a decade I have worked to open those Cuban markets to \nAmerican agriculture. In 2000 I offered an amendment to the Treasury \nappropriations bill when I was in the House of Representatives that \nremoved those trade sanctions on food, agriculture, commodities, and \nmedicine. It paved the way for American farmers to sell their crops to \nCuba for the first time in more than 40 years.\n\n  The language of that amendment ultimately became part of legislation \ncalled the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, TSRA. \nOver the years, administrations have made changes that have tightened \nthe rules under that legislation and made it, again, difficult for our \nfarmers to sell agricultural commodities to Cuba. On multiple occasions \nI have fought to reverse those decisions, those new rules by \nadministrations, to make it easier for us to sell those commodities. We \nare not even talking about trade; we are simply talking about the sale \nfor cash of those commodities.\n  In fact, we went through this last year as I offered an amendment to \nan appropriations bill that was approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee to change those regulations. I say all that because I want to \nhighlight how important and how long term my interest in this issue has \nbeen, but that is not the point of what I want to talk about tonight. I \nwant to establish that this matters. But even despite the fact that it \nmatters, I have taken a hiatus, in fact, and announced to the \nAppropriations Committee this year that I would not be offering that \namendment again.\n  It is not that I have changed my mind about the value of engagement \nor the importance for Kansas and American farmers to be able to sell \ntheir commodities to Cuba, but it is a sincere recognition on my part \nthat the Cuban Government has a responsibility to cooperate with the \nUnited States on an issue that many of us are concerned about, which is \nthe unjust detention of an American citizen, Alan Gross.\n  Nearly 3 years ago, December 3, 2009, Alan was arrested in Havana \nwhere he had been working as a U.S. Government subcontractor that had a \ncontract for USAID, an agency whose mission is to help those in need. \nAs a USAID subcontractor, Alan had made five trips to Cuba where he \nhelped a small, peaceful, nondissident Cuban Jewish community. He was \narrested. He was detained without charges for 14 months. Later, he had \na 2-day trial resulting in a 15-year prison sentence for alleged \n``actions against the independence or territorial integrity of the \nState.''\n  Since his arrest, now a long time ago, his detention so long ago, \nAlan's health has deteriorated. He has lost more than 100 pounds and \nsuffers from several debilitating medical conditions. During his \nimprisonment, several members of his family have faced serious illness. \nHis daughter has been diagnosed with breast cancer, and his 90-year-old \nmother has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer.\n  In light of Alan's continued detention, deterioration of his health, \nand the health problems experienced by his family, 42 of my colleagues \njoined me and Senator Cardin earlier this year calling on the Cuban \nGovernment to release Alan on humanitarian grounds and allow him to \nreturn to his family in the United States. In recent news--in fact, \njust yesterday--I learned from a press report that Cuba planned to make \nan announcement regarding Alan Gross. It fueled hope on the part of \nmany of us that the announcement would be that he would be released. \nSadly, unfortunately, today the announcement was nothing other than \ntheir assessment, Cuban assessment, that Alan is in good health.\n  I asked my staff and others who know me and know about this issue to \nsay their prayers last night that the release would occur. Once again, \nCuba has failed to do what is right and proper. It is unclear whether \ntheir claim that Alan Gross is in good health is true. Certainly, many \nreports indicate that is not the case. He has never been examined by an \nindependent medical examiner, something that is required by \ninternational law.\n  It is past time for Cuba to release Alan and allow him to return to \nhis family. Failure to do so makes any improvement in the relationship \nbetween\n\n[[Page S7031]]\n\nour two countries so much more difficult and highly unlikely. I think \nthat would benefit the people of Cuba, but their government continues \nto take an unjust course. Alan should be released and Cuba should do \nthe right thing. Mr. Gross devoted his professional life to helping \nothers through his work in international development. He and his family \nhave suffered more than most could endure over the last 3 years.\n\n  Continuing our efforts to bring Alan home, next week, on December 3--\nthe 3-year anniversary--Senator Cardin and I will introduce a \nresolution calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. \nGross. I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this resolution to \nhelp send the clear message to Cuba that even those of us who want a \nbetter relationship, even those of us who have been willing to cast the \nvotes to increase that opportunity for a relationship between the \nUnited States and Cuba, want Alan Gross to come home. It is my hope the \nCuban Government will reverse course and that Alan can finally come \nhome to his wife Judy and to their family.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in that effort and perhaps, more \nimportantly, I ask Americans to join us in the prayer for Alan's \nrelease.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S7031-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BAILEY FINE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and give thanks \nto my State director, Bailey Fine, who is retiring at the end of the \n112th Congress after 27 years of devoted service. There is great \nsadness but deep appreciation as I say goodbye to Bailey who, in 1982, \nran my reelection campaign to the Maryland House of Delegates; then \nserved as my campaign aide during my first congressional race in 1986; \nas my district director for 20 years; and, finally, as my State \ndirector during my first term in the Senate.\n  Over the years, Bailey has been a friend to my entire family, a \ntrusted confidant, a reliable sounding board for my legislative \ndistrict and statewide agendas. For more than three decades I have been \ntruly fortunate to have her at my side, providing knowledgeable advice \nand a commonsense approach to the many issues that face Members of the \nHouse and Senate.\n  Bailey is a people person who understands how our work in Washington \naffects the everyday lives of Marylanders, and she regularly reminds my \nstaff and me of that fact. Bailey's knowledge of Baltimore and of \nMaryland is unparalleled. She grew up in Northern Virginia but settled \nin Baltimore in 1970 where she worked first for the Housing \nCommissioner and later for the late Mayor William Donald Schaeffer.\n  During her years handling special projects for the mayor, Bailey \ndeveloped a deep love for Baltimore City and a true understanding of \nhow Baltimore works. Bailey became a creative genius at promoting and \nhighlighting the many achievements of the city under Mayor Schaeffer. \nBefore Mayor Schaeffer left city hall, he nominated Bailey to serve as \npresident of the Baltimore City school board. In that role, she helped \nparents navigate the school bureaucracy, suggested workable solutions \nfor teachers, and brought a commonsense approach to the Baltimore City \nschool system.\n  But Bailey's knowledge and expertise goes beyond how government \nworks. She has her pulse on Baltimore and on Maryland. She knows the \nkey players in the city and the State, many of them on a personal \nlevel. For many years Bailey has been the go-to person when people need \nto get things done.\n  Without a doubt, Bailey has been an invaluable resource to my entire \nstaff, to me, and to the people of Maryland. But she is also a tireless \nadvocate and a voice for families and individuals who may not have had \nthe understanding or resources to access the services they need. \nWhether it is working with the mayor of Oakland when spring floods \nthreatened a dam near the town, getting housing and other services for \na veteran, or working with community groups to improve their schools, \nBailey is a relentless public servant. There is also no denying that \nher energy and enthusiasm are unstoppable and unsurpassed and that her \nretirement will leave a real void.\n  Through her efforts, so many people have been connected to jobs, \naffordable housing, quality health care, or government benefits. So \nmany of these people have benefited from her advocacy, their lives \nchanged for the better, and most of them will never know her name. To \nme, that is the highest form of public service.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to recognize the many contributions that \nBailey has made and the example she has set for public service. I also \nwant to take this opportunity to thank Bailey's family, her husband \nStanley, and her children Michael and Laura, for their support and \nunderstanding as Bailey has worked to help others.\n  Today is Bailey and Stanley's 41st wedding anniversary, and on \nDecember 8 Laura will be married. Please join me in wishing Bailey Fine \na healthy and happy retirement and well-deserved time with her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S7031-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7031-S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REFORMING THE SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I wish to talk about our \nefforts to change the Senate rules. There has been a great deal of \ncomment on this subject lately.\n  I have listened with great interest to the arguments against these \nchanges by the other side. Let me just say at the outset: Senators \nMerkley, Harkin, and I are not talking about taking away the rights of \nthe minority. We are not abolishing the filibuster.\n  But there must be change. The unprecedented use and abuse of the \nfilibuster and other procedural rules has prevented the U.S. Senate \nfrom doing its job. We are no longer the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. In fact, we barely deliberate at all.\n  For most of our history, the filibuster was used very sparingly. But \nin recent years, what was rare has become routine. The exception has \nbecome the norm. Everything is filibustered, every procedural step of \nthe way, with paralyzing effect. The Senate was meant to cool the \nprocess, not send it into a deep freeze.\n  For some reason, ever since the Democratic majority came into the \nupper Chamber in 2007, the Senates of the 110th, 111th, and current \n112th Congress have witnessed the three highest totals of filibusters \never recorded. A recent report found the current Senate has ``passed a \nrecord-low 2.8 percent of bills introduced in that chamber, a 66 \npercent decrease from the last Republican majority in 2005-2006, and a \n90 percent decrease from the high in 1955-1956.''\n  Our proposal to reform the rules is simple, it is limited, and it is \nfair. Again, we are not ending the filibuster. We preserve the rights \nof the minority. We are only proposing that, No. 1, Senators should be \nrequired to go to the floor and actually tell the American people why \nthey oppose a bill or nominee in order to maintain a filibuster; and \nNo. 2, motions to proceed to a bill or to send a bill to conference \nshould be nondebatable. These are sensible changes. Yet we are warned \nthat these simple reforms will transform the very character of the \nSenate, will leave the minority without a voice. These arguments are \ncovers for continued abuse of the rules.\n  The reforms are modest--some would say too modest. But they would \ndiscourage the excessive use of filibusters. The minority still has the \nright to filibuster, but not the right to do so by simply making an \nannouncement and then going out to dinner or, more likely, to a \nfundraiser.\n  Nevertheless, the other party insists we are attacking the rights of \nthe minority. But there seems to be another message, too, with a truly \nodd logic. They say that if we make any reasonable changes in January, \nthey may make radical ones in the future. In short, if we dare to \nreform any rule, they might throw out all of them when they are in the \nmajority. How this comports with their stated concern for the rights of \nthe minority is unclear.\n  It is also being argued that we are breaking the rules to change the \nrules. This has been repeatedly charged by the minority leader. We \ndisagree. We are reforming the rules to save the Senate. The status quo \nis abusing the rules and debasing the Senate. It is a choice between \nrules reform and rules abuse.\n  History contradicts the minority leader as well. Members of the other \nside have agreed with changing the rules when they have been in the \nmajority. The Record is already chock\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\nfull with their past remarks, fervent in their support for changing the \nrules with a simple majority vote.\n  This reminds me of a story my Uncle Mo used to tell. A former Senator \nonce said of himself that ``never has the clammy hand of consistency \nrested upon my shoulder.'' He meant it too. On one occasion, he \nintroduced a bill, and he pushed very hard for it. Then, seeing the \ntide was turning, he led the fight against his own bill. A constituent \nsent him a telegram that read ``I thank God for your courageous \nstand.'' And he replied, ``Which one?''\n  And so the question: how to change the rules? The Constitution is \nclear on this point. The Senate rules reforms can be accomplished by a \nsimple majority at the start of the new Congress in January. This is \nthe ``constitutional option,'' not a ``nuclear option.'' That is \nsomething else, and I will speak to it in a moment.\n  This has been a heated topic of debate this week on the Senate floor, \nparticularly between the majority and minority leaders. I have followed \nthe debate carefully, and I would like to address some of the \ndistinguished minority leader's concerns.\n  Earlier this week, Leader McConnell said the following:\n\n       This small group of primarily senate sophomores is now \n     proposing that when the Senate gavels in at the beginning of \n     the new Congress, a bare majority of senators can disregard \n     the rule that says changes to the Senate's rules can only be \n     approved on the same broad bipartisan basis we reserve for \n     approving treaties and overriding presidential vetoes, a \n     supermajority-plus.\n\n  I am glad he framed our argument in this way. Why do treaties and \nveto overrides require a supermajority vote? Because those requirements \nare enshrined in our Constitution. The Constitution is very specific \nabout when a supermajority is needed and, just as clearly, when it \nisn't.\n  Article I, section 5 of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, \n     punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the \n     Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\n\n  When the Framers required a supermajority in the proceedings of \nCongress, they explicitly stated so in the Constitution, as they did \nfor expelling a Member. On all other matters, such as determining the \nChamber's rules, a majority requirement is clearly implied.\n  The constitutional option has been used numerous times since the \ncloture provision was adopted in 1917, the last being in 1975 when it \nwas the catalyst for amending the filibuster rule to its current form.\n  In 1957, then-Vice President Richard Nixon noted while presiding in \nthe Senate, ``[W]hile the rules of the Senate have been continued from \none Congress to another, the right of a current majority of the Senate \nat the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming as \nit does from the Constitution itself, cannot be restricted or limited \nby rules adopted by a majority of a previous Congress.''\n  Current Republican Senators agree. Senator John Cornyn said in 2003:\n\n       Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent \n     Congress could not amend by majority vote, one Senate cannot \n     enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by \n     majority vote.''\n\n  And Senator Orrin Hatch noted in 2005 that a\n\n     simple majority can invoke cloture and adopt a rules change \n     it is clear that the Senate, at the beginning of a new \n     Congress, can invoke cloture and amend its rules by simple \n     majority.\n\n  As I said earlier, some on the other side of the aisle have drawn a \nfalse equivalency between the constitutional option and the \nRepublicans' threatened nuclear option of 2005. Yet this misses a \ncrucial distinction. The nuclear option sought to change Senate rules \nin midsession. The constitutional option follows Senate precedent and \nwould change the rules only at the start of the new Congress.\n  We don't have to reform the rules with only a majority vote in \nJanuary. That is up to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nEach time the filibuster rule has been amended in the past, a \nbipartisan group of Senators was prepared to use the constitutional \noption. But they didn't have to. With the inevitability of a majority \nvote on the reforms looming, enough Members agreed on a compromise and \npassed the changes with two-thirds in favor.\n  We could do that again in January. I know many of my Republican \ncolleagues agree with me. The Senate is not working. I said 2 years ago \nthat I would push for the same reforms at the beginning of the next \nCongress--regardless of which party was in the majority. If Leader \nMcConnell was going to be the majority leader in January, I would ask \nhim to work with me on implementing these reforms.\n  I will say again that the proposed changes will reform the abuse of \nthe filibuster, not trample the legitimate rights of the minority \nparty. I am willing to live with all of the changes we are proposing, \nwhether I am in the majority or minority.\n  The other side has suggested that a change in the rules is an affront \nto the American public but the real affront would be to allow the abuse \nof the filibuster to continue.\n  It has also been suggested that ``the campaign is over.'' Well, this \neffort to change the rules has something to do with the results of the \ncampaign. The American people sent us a message. We have to change the \nway we do business. We have to govern and pay attention to jobs and the \neconomy and the things that matter to American families. That was their \nmessage, and we would do well to listen to it.\n  As to the comment that some of the reformers are ``sophomores,'' true \nenough. Senator Merkley and I are relatively new to this Chamber, but I \ndon't think the American people think that is a bad thing because we \ncame here to find solutions, to actually get things done for the \nAmerican people. But what we found was a graveyard of good ideas. No \nreal debate. No real consideration.\n  Under the abuse of the current rules, all it takes to filibuster is \none Senator picking up the phone, period. Doesn't have to even go on \nthe floor and defend it. Just a phone call by one Senator. No muss. No \nfuss. No inconvenience. Except for the American public. Except for a \nnation that expects and needs a government that works, a government \nthat actually works together and finds common ground.\n  Maybe some of my colleagues believe that the Senate is working as it \nshould that everything is fine. Well, Mr. President, we sophomores do \nnot take that view. It isn't working. It needs to change, and I know \nplenty of experienced Senators agree.\n  The American people, of all political persuasions, are clamoring for \na government that actually gets something done. The challenges are too \ngreat, the stakes are too high, for a government of gridlock to \ncontinue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S7032-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Ahearn, \nSpecialist in International Trade and Finance with the Foreign Affairs, \nDefense and Trade Division of the Congressional Research Service (CRS). \nRay will retire on December 28, after more than 37 years of \ndistinguished government service.\n  Mr. Ahearn began working as a trade and finance analyst at CRS in \nApril 1975, soon after receiving his MA in international affairs from \nthe Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, SAIS. He \nlater received his MA in economics from the George Washington \nUniversity and also represented CRS at the National War College in \nWashington, DC, graduating in 1991.\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\n  Upon joining CRS, Mr. Ahearn quickly established himself as a leading \nexpert in U.S. trade policy. He wrote numerous reports and confidential \nmemoranda and conducted hundreds of briefings for Members and \ncongressional staff on a broad range of international economic issues. \nThese issues addressed core topics on U.S. trade policy, such as U.S. \ntrade laws to open markets for U.S. exporters, trade reorganization, \nthe debate over free trade versus trade protectionism, and the future \nof U.S. trade policy. He also focused his authoritative and objective \nanalysis on international financial issues, including the 2008 global \nfinancial crisis and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis.\n  Mr. Ahearn is well known for his expertise and deep institutional \nknowledge of the global trading system, particularly with respect to \nthe World Trade Organization and related multilateral ``rounds'' of \ntrade negotiations over the past 4 decades. More recently, he led \nimportant innovative research on rising economic powers and their trade \npolicy implications for the United States. As a policy issue of growing \ncongressional interest, his insightful analysis will continue to \nsupport Congress in understanding the transformative changes underway \nin the global economy.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator Baucus in \ncommending Mr. Ahearn for his service. Over the years, Mr. Ahearn's \nimpressive portfolio of work also examined major U.S. trading partner \npolicies. Early on in his career, for example, he was a lead CRS expert \non the U.S.-Japan trade and economic relationship during heightened \ntrade tensions between our two countries. From September 1993 to August \n1994, he worked for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, USTR, \nto serve as Director of Trade Strategy for Japan and China. More \nrecently, Ray became the ``go to'' CRS analyst on the U.S.-EU trade and \neconomic relationship, writing reports and confidential memoranda and \nconsulting Congress on numerous topics, including on the EU's \npreferential trade agreements and regulatory issues.\n  Mr. Ahearn has been especially adept at examining complex issues in \ninternational economics of immediate importance to Congress and making \nhis analysis accessible to an audience that approaches the issues with \nvarying degrees of understanding. This skill has played an especially \ncritical role in successfully conveying to Congress the complex, \nmultidimensional challenges associated with globalization. For example, \nin 2009, Mr. Ahearn wrote a CRS report titled The Global Economic \nDownturn and Protectionism that addressed the issue of the perceived \nand real growth of trade restrictions by the United States and its \ntrading partners in response to the global economic crisis that emerged \nin 2008. In analyzing the issue, he constructed an analytical framework \nof three potential categories of restrictions that might be taken and \nthe potential consequences of each. Mr. Ahearn applied a similar \nanalysis in his timely CRS report Globalization, Worker Insecurity and \nPolicy Approaches, which examined the complex relationship between the \nincreased integration of the U.S. economy with the rest of the world \nand the decline in U.S. wages and worker security, an issue faced by \nall Members of Congress as they consider trade agreements and other \nglobal economic issues.\n  We wish Mr. Ahearn the very best in his retirement and thank him for \nhis exemplary record of service to Congress in directly supporting our \nwork on international trade and finance policy issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S7033-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING BOBBY PRICE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring LT Bobby Price, who died this month in Chula Vista, CA. \nFor many years, I had the pleasure and honor of working with this great \nchampion of America's veterans.\n  In fact, just 2 months ago, despite his grave illness, Bobby traveled \nto Washington, DC as the representative of the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nto meet with me regarding veterans' healthcare, homelessness, and job \nopportunities for our returning troops. As always, I was impressed by \nBobby's knowledge and understanding of issues affecting our veterans \nand by his passionate commitment to work on their behalf.\n  During more than 24 years on active duty in the U.S. Navy, Bobby was \nknown for his diligence and determination to carry out any task. Later, \nhe brought this same zeal and perseverance to his work as an advocate \nfor veterans.\n  No matter how hard Bobby worked, he always made time for his family. \nAs his wife, Julia, wrote, ``Day after day he showed me, our children \nand grandchildren how much he cared for us by giving his time, \ncompassion and generous spirit.''\n  Bobby Price received many awards recognizing his remarkable \ndedication to veterans including the San Diego County Veteran of the \nYear award. He served as commander of all California Veterans of \nForeign Wars posts and was active in other veterans organizations at \nthe local, State, and national level. At the time of his death, he was \npresident of the nonprofit Chula Vista Veterans Home Support Foundation \nand had served on the charity's board for 6 years.\n  On behalf of the people of California, who have benefitted so much \nfrom Bobby's life and work, I send my deepest gratitude and condolences \nto his wife, Julia; his sons, Paul Hoch, Russ Price, Marcus Bush, and \nAdam Price; his daughter, Adriana Bush; and his five grandchildren. \nBobby Price will be truly missed by all who were touched by his energy, \npassion for service, and devotion to his fellow veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S7033-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7033-S7034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OHIO UNIVERSITY POST CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the \ncentennial of the Post, an independent, student-run newspaper at Ohio \nUniversity in Athens, OH.\n  Finley Peter Dunne once noted that ``the newspaper . . . comforts the \nafflicted, and afflicts the comfortable.'' Newspapers also connect \nconcerned citizens with their elected officials by providing a venue \nfor valuable discussion on issues that affect our lives and \ncommunities. It is no secret that a free press is critical to \nstrengthening and preserving our democracy.\n  For 100 years, students at Ohio University have celebrated their \nfirst amendment rights by creating a newspaper that informs residents, \nstudents, and business leaders in Athens County about vital news on \ncampus, around Ohio, and throughout the world.\n  When students are encouraged to present structured, well-written \nviews in writing, they are given the opportunity to develop life-long \nskills that will serve them as citizens--and leaders--of our enduring \nAmerican institutions.\n  Ohio University has produced many first-class journalists, including \nthirteen Pulitzer Prize winners and reporters and columnists whose \nbylines and photographs appear in our Nation's leading newspapers. I \nregularly witness the fine reporting of several Post alumni, including \nColumbus Dispatch senior editor Joe Hallett and Washington \ncorrespondent Jessica Wehrman, among others.\n  As the tools and resources of journalism evolve, the Post continues \nto respond to a changing world. Whether students read the news on a \nhandheld device or hold newsprint in their hands, Ohio University \nstudents can expect to hear from an independent voice on campus and in \nAthens.\n  Throughout the next century, the Post will undoubtedly continue to \nplay a critical role in training student-journalists to shape and \ninform Ohio University. As we mark this milestone, it is my privilege \nto salute the students who work to keep this publication alive while \nfully participating in our first amendment freedoms. As the proud \nhusband of a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, Connie Schultz, I have \nimmense respect for journalists and the role they play in the public \nsphere. Improving our democracy starts with papers like the Post, that \nare willing to cultivate America's next generation of \njournalists.\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S7034-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       COMPLETION OF THE SERIES CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION OF CHINA\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the \ncompletion of the series, ``Culture and Civilization of China,'' \npublished jointly by Yale University and China International Publishing \nGroup. Having been published since the early 1990s, the award winning \nseries will be concluded this year with its final volume, ``Chinese \nSilks.'' The series has brought together leaders from both the United \nStates and China. Former President George H. W. Bush and Secretary of \nState Henry Kissinger have each head consulting committees.\n  I congratulate everyone who worked to make this series happen, in \nparticular the Director of Yale University Press John Donatich, the \nPresident of China International Publishing Group Zhou Mingwei, and \nU.N. Under Secretary General Joseph V. Reed.\n  I ask that Under Secretary General Reed's remarks at a September 19, \n2012, event to celebrate the completion of this series be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n Remarks by Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed at the Celebratory Luncheon \n  for the Conclusion of the Chinese Culture & Civilization Publishing \n   Project With Yale University Press and the Chinese International \n                  Publishing Group, September 19, 2012\n\n       We have come a long, long way with the great publishing \n     project known as CCC . . . started in 1988 and completed with \n     our final volume (our ninth) on ``Silks'' this autumn.\n       In President Levin's words--``CCC is the ``Crown Jewel'' of \n     Yale University''.\n       I have been very proud to have been associated with the \n     Press and CIPG on this historic publishing adventure.\n       Our Honorary Chair President George H.W. Bush has declared:\n       ``I have been privileged to serve as Honorary Chair for the \n     Culture & Civilization of China project. The CCC project has \n     had a profound impact on international relations between \n     China and the United States in a way that no other \n     undertaking has accomplished. The achievement of \n     collaboration in the development of this superb series of \n     beautiful volumes examining the cultural and artistic \n     heritage of China will serve as a model of cooperation for \n     the future generations committed to building an enduring bond \n     between our two great countries''.\n       The Chair of the Advisory Council Dr. Henry A. Kissinger \n     has called CCC--a ``seminal work''.\n       China has recognized the effort with bestowing the highest \n     Award--``The Special Book Awards of China'' to President \n     Levin and yours truly in the Great Hall of the People, by \n     Madame Liu Yangdon, a member of China's Politburo and State \n     Councilor.\n       CCC has published nine volumes--several having been awarded \n     distinguished honors the volume on painting  Three Thousand \n     Years of Chinese Painting  (1997) won The Hawkins Prize, the \n     highest award in the publishing industry. This volume was the \n     State Gift of the People's Republic to the United States \n     during President Jiang Zeming's State Visit in 1997. \n     President Jiang Zeming gave a copy of this work and the \n     volume on Chinese Architecture to President Bush for the Bush \n     Presidential Library in 2002.\n       President Hu Jintao visited Yale University in 2006 and \n     donated a large number of Chinese books to the University \n     including the Culture & Civilization series. President Hu \n     also introduced the newly published Chinese Sculture to Yale \n     faculty, staff and students.\n       The publishing effort was arduous and not without many \n     differences and difficulties. It is a miracle that we \n     published the volumes in such a cooperative manner. How can \n     one forget the drama with our very first volume on \n     ``Painting''? The map of China caused great review/\n     discussion--back and forth for weeks--the borders, the \n     provinces, the islands. There were other ``to and froes'' \n     but, in the end we have had ``a splendid and co-operative \n     result''.\n       There are so many to salute and thank for their efforts \n     starting with President Levin, Vice President Linda Lorimer, \n     former Yale University Press Director John G. Ryden (the \n     godfather of CCC), current YUP Director John Donatich and, of \n     course, all our colleagues at CIPG led by Vice Minister Cai \n     Mingzhao, President Zhou and the distinguished and brilliant \n     Editor Huang Youyi.\n       To the donors to CCC a special vote of appreciation and \n     admiration for their generosity.\n       CCC involved 435 specialists including 56 authors, 39 \n     translators and 340 consultants. 348 Museums and research \n     institutes from around the globe provided images, line-\n     drawings, photographs and maps.\n       I thank Julianne Griffin and Taiping Chang Knecknes and \n     Mary Pasti and Cynthia Forbes for their signal contributions. \n     A special salute to Charles Hill who first introduced me to \n     the Press for work on the CCC project and to James Watt of \n     the Metropolitan Museum for superb counsel.\n       All in all, CCC was a splendid effort. It has truly \n     contributed to the mutual understanding of the People's \n     Republic and the United States as well as having provided a \n     platform for education for citizens from around the world.\n       CCC is an historic publishing project. It is a gift for \n     future generations.\n       Once again, a salute and vote of thanks to one and \n     all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S7034-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, 70 percent of the earth is covered \nby water. Of that, 98 percent can be found in our oceans, which makes \nit unusable for drinking due to the salt content. Only about 2 percent \nof the world's water is fresh and, once polar ice caps and glaciers are \nsubtracted, it is a very small percentage that is available for human \nconsumption. Here in the United States we are blessed with, and rely \non, an abundance of available clean drinking water. However, even here, \nmechanical failures, natural disasters, and remoteness of location, can \ndiminish the availability of this vital resource.\n  I rise today to recognize Hydro-Photon, located in Blue Hill, ME, a \ncompany that has identified this problem and works diligently to supply \ninnovative, accessible solutions. By harnessing and shrinking the \nultraviolet--UV--technology used by many municipal water treatment \nplants, Hydro-Photon founder Miles Maiden created the SteriPEN which \noffers the same safe, efficient water purification used by the \ntreatment plants in a portable, personal device.\n  The SteriPEN, originally patented in 1999, was the first portable UV \nwater purifier on the market. The product kills viruses, bacteria, and \nprotozoa by emitting UV light that is absorbed by the microbes, \npreventing their reproduction. With this compact purifier, users are \nable to have safe drinking water anywhere.\n  A company conscious of the need to preserve and protect our natural \nbeauty and resources seems right at home in my home State where we are \nblessed with serene mountains and foothills, dense untouched \nwilderness, and a shoreline both beautiful and bountiful. Hydro-Photon \nis dedicated to the preservation and enjoyment of our natural splendors \nand with the clean water supplied by their SteriPEN, they are making it \neasier and safer for all to enjoy the great outdoors not only in Maine \nbut around the world.\n  Not only useful to the active outdoorsmen, the SteriPEN finds use in \na vast array of situations and locations. One example is the recent \nhurricane Sandy that had devastating affects along the northeastern \ncoast. Hydro-Photon recognized the necessity of clean water in such \ndire situations and selflessly stepped up to help, donating SteriPENs \nto those affected by the storm in New York and New Jersey.\n  For their inventiveness, dedication, and compassion for supplying an \nelement so basic to human life, Hydro-Photon is truly a remarkable \ncompany. I am proud to extend my congratulations on their success and \noffer my best wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/28/senate-section/article/S7034-4", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7034-S7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KELSEY LUCKHURST\n\n Mr. THUNE.

REPORT ON FEASIBILITY, COST, AND ADVISABILITY OF \n                   REUSING PITS IN NUCLEAR WARHEADS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A key concept of the proposed interim plutonium pit \n     strategy of the National Nuclear Security Administration is \n     to reuse existing pits to supplement the 20 to 30 pits per \n     year that the Administration asserts may be manufactured at \n     Los Alamos National Laboratory, given extensive modifications \n     to current facilities.\n       (2) Dr. Charles McMillan, director of the Los Alamos \n     National Laboratory, testified before Congress on April 18, \n     2012, that ``the extensive work required to convert these \n     concepts into systems that could be certified is yet to be \n     done''. Dr. McMillan elaborated that ``we must do the \n     scientific work to further understand the effects of aging \n     and to provide modern safety, safety that starts [with \n     insensitive] high explosive systems. If we choose this path, \n     it will require an investment over the next 5 to 10 years.''.\n       (3) Pit lifetime is another critical aspect of the proposed \n     interim plutonium strategy. The National Nuclear Security \n     Administration has confidence that pits will last up to\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\n     100 years. Yet, Dr. Siegfried Hecker, former director of Los \n     Alamos National Laboratory and a leading plutonium \n     metallurgist, was quoted on July 17, 2012, as saying, ``We \n     have never done enough of those [plutonium lifetime] \n     experiments that would make me feel more comfortable with \n     plutonium lifetimes in pits. So as far as I'm concerned, we \n     still haven't demonstrated that these pits can last 50, 60, \n     80 or 100 years as some people claim.''.\n       (4) Regarding the performance of older pits, a 2007 report \n     by the private scientific advisory group known as JASON \n     suggested that ``there must be a more detailed understanding \n     of the different types of dynamic strengths involved in the \n     weapons codes, and then a more complete understanding of how \n     these strengths vary with aging through relevant experimental \n     and theoretical work. This is fundamentally difficult . . . \n     New experiments should be carried out on both naturally and \n     artificially aged [plutonium].''.\n       (b) Report Required.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the \n     Secretary of Defense shall jointly submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the feasibility, \n     cost, and advisability of reusing pits in nuclear warheads \n     that includes the following:\n       (1) An assessment of the technical work and experimentation \n     that needs to be done to determine whether or not pit reuse \n     is likely to be a successful strategy that leads to the \n     certification of the safety, security, and reliability of \n     nuclear warheads using those pits and the schedule and cost \n     for that work and experimentation.\n       (2) A description of the criteria that must be met to \n     determine whether nuclear warheads that reuse pits can be \n     certified as safe, secure, and reliable and an estimate of \n     the time at which the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration anticipates having sufficient data to make \n     such a determination.\n       (3) A description of the experiments that have been \n     performed to determine whether nuclear warheads that reuse \n     pits can be certified as safe, secure, and reliable and an \n     assessment of the results of those experiments.\n       (4) An assessment of how pursuing pit reuse increases the \n     cost and complexity of life extension programs and program \n     planning by the National Nuclear Security Administration and \n     the effect of pursuing pit reuse on the safety, security, and \n     reliability of nuclear warheads.\n       (5) An assessment of the extent to which pursuing pit \n     reuse, as opposed to manufacturing new pits, limits the \n     incorporation of enhanced safety and security features into \n     life extension programs and limits improvements to the \n     performance margin in such programs.\n       (6) A description of the technical process for and cost \n     of--\n       (A) requalifying an existing pit for reuse with a weapon \n     for which it was designed; and\n       (B) requalifying an existing pit for reuse with a weapon \n     for which it was not designed.\n       (7) An assessment of the extent which the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council has reviewed the processes described in paragraph (6) \n     and the results of any such reviews.\n       (8) An explanation for the difference between the \n     assessment of the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     with respect to the lifetime of pits and the assessment of \n     Dr. Siegfried Hecker described in subsection (a)(3).\n       (9) An assessment of the work that has been done by the \n     national security laboratories of the Department of Energy or \n     by other entities with respect to pit aging since 2007 and \n     the results of that work.\n       (10) An assessment of the anticipated level of confidence \n     of the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense with \n     respect to experiments to artificially age plutonium and any \n     concerns that there may be differences between natural and \n     artificial aging of plutonium.\n       (11) An assessment of experiments that have been performed \n     to understand the performance of older pits across the full \n     stockpile-to-target sequence of nuclear warheads, including \n     in highly dynamic environments, and the results of those \n     experiments.\n       (12) A statement of the military requirement for pit \n     production to have a responsive infrastructure capable of \n     rapidly responding to technical or geopolitical strategic \n     surprises.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3034.

JANIB is also responsible for \n     recommending areas to enter and exit the transition process.\n       (2) According to a 2002 study on Women, Peace and Security \n     submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations \n     pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), ``the \n     suspension of or restriction on women's enjoyment of their \n     human rights'' can act as an early-warning indicator of \n     impending or renewed conflict. In Afghanistan, restrictions \n     on women's mobility and rights can signal the presence of \n     extremist or insurgent elements in a community.\n       (3) The security of Afghan women and girls in areas \n     undergoing security transitions will be an important gauge of \n     the transition strategy's success. Indicators by which to \n     measure women's security include the mobility of women and \n     girls, the participation of women in local government bodies, \n     the rate of school attendance for girls, women's access to \n     government services, and the prevalence of violence against \n     women.\n       (4) Maintaining and improving physical security for Afghan \n     women and girls throughout the country is critical in order \n     for women and girls to take advantage of opportunities in \n     education, commerce, politics, and other areas of public \n     life, which in turn is essential for the future stability and \n     prosperity of Afghanistan.\n       (5) Women who serve as public officials at all levels of \n     the Government of Afghanistan face serious threats to their \n     personal security and that of their families. Many female \n     officials have been the victims of violent crimes, but they \n     are generally not afforded official protection by the \n     Government of Afghanistan or security forces.\n       (6) Protecting the security and human rights of Afghan \n     women and girls requires the involvement of Afghan men and \n     boys through education about the important benefits of \n     women's full participation in social, economic, and political \n     life. Male officials and security personnel can play a \n     particularly important role in supporting and protecting \n     women and girls.\n       (7) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n     2012 states: ``As the Afghan National Police further develop \n     and professionalize, they will evolve towards a sustainable, \n     credible, and accountable civilian law enforcement force that \n     will shoulder the main responsibility for domestic security. \n     This force should be capable of providing policing services \n     to the Afghan population as part of the broader Afghan rule \n     of law system.''\n       (8) Women face significant barriers to full participation \n     in the ANA and ANP, including a discriminatory or hostile \n     work environment and the lack of separate facilities designed \n     for female personnel.\n       (9) As of September 2012, female recruitment and retention \n     rates for the Afghan National Security Forces are far below \n     published targets, as follows:\n       (A) Approximately 1,700 women serve in the Afghan National \n     Security Forces, or less than half of one percent of the \n     total force.\n       (B) In 2010, President Hamid Karzai announced plans to \n     recruit and train 5,000 women in the Afghan National Police, \n     or approximately 3 percent of the force, by 2014. Currently, \n     there are approximately 1,370 women in the ANP, or 0.87 \n     percent of the police force.\n       (C) Approximately 350 women currently serve in the Afghan \n     National Army, representing only 0.17 percent of the force. \n     The Government of Afghanistan has said that its goal is to \n     achieve a force that is 10 percent female. As of May 2012, \n     approximately 3 percent of new ANA recruits were women.\n       (10) Male security personnel often do not respond to \n     threats or incidences of violence against women, particularly \n     at the local level. They largely lack the training and \n     understanding needed to respond appropriately and effectively \n     to situations involving women. According to the Department of \n     Defense's April 2012 Report on Progress Toward Security and \n     Stability in Afghanistan:\n       (A) The Afghan Ministry of Defense ``lacks the combination \n     of policies, procedures, and execution to promote opportunity \n     and fair and respectful treatment of women in the force''.\n       (B) The Afghan Ministry of Interior ``faces significant \n     challenges in fully integrating and protecting women in the \n     ANP workforce, especially among operational units at the \n     provincial and district levels''.\n       (C) In the Afghan National Police, ``Many Provincial \n     Headquarters Commanders do not accept policewomen, as they \n     prefer male candidates and lack adequate facilities to \n     support females.''\n       (D) ``While women are greatly needed to support police \n     operations, a combination of cultural impediments, weak \n     recruitment, and uneven application of policies hinder \n     significant progress.''\n       (E) ``Although stronger documentation, implementation, and \n     enforcement of policies, procedures, and guidance to better \n     integrate women will help, time will be needed to change the \n     cultural mores that form the basis of many of the current \n     impediments.''\n       (11) The United States, the North American Treaty \n     Organization, and United States coalition partners have made \n     firm commitments to support the human rights of the women and \n     girls of Afghanistan, as evidenced by the following actions:\n       (A) According to the United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace and Security, ``integrating women and gender \n     considerations into peace-building processes helps promote \n     democratic governance and long-term stability,'' which are \n     key United States strategic goals in Afghanistan.\n       (B) The National Action Plan also states that ``the \n     engagement and protection of women as agents of peace and \n     stability will be central to United States efforts to promote \n     security, prevent, respond to, and resolve conflict, and \n     rebuild societies.'' This policy applies to United States \n     Government efforts in Afghanistan, where addressing the \n     security vulnerabilities of Afghan women and girls during the \n     period of security transition is an essential step toward \n     long-term stability.\n       (C) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n     2012 states: ``We emphasize the importance of full \n     participation of all Afghan women in the reconstruction, \n     political, peace and reconciliation processes in Afghanistan \n     and the need to respect the institutional arrangements \n     protecting their rights. We remain committed to the \n     implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     (UNSCR) 1325 on women, peace and security. We recognize also \n     the need for the protection of children from the damaging \n     effects of armed conflict as required in relevant UNSCRs.''\n       (12) The Strategic Partnership Agreement signed between the \n     United States and Afghanistan by President Obama and \n     President Karzai in June 2012 states, ``Consistent with its \n     Constitution and international obligations, Afghanistan shall \n     ensure and advance the essential role of women in society, so \n     that they may fully enjoy their economic, social, political, \n     civil and cultural rights.''\n       (b) Strategy to Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in \n     concurrence with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a strategy to be \n     implemented by the Department of Defense, working with the \n     NATO Training Mission Afghanistan (NTM-A) and Afghan \n     partners, to promote the security of Afghan women during the \n     security transition process.\n       (2) Elements.--The strategy required under paragraph (1) \n     shall include the following elements:\n       (A) A strategy to monitor and respond to changes in women's \n     security conditions in areas undergoing transition, including \n     the following actions:\n       (i) Seeking to designate a Civilian Impact Advisor on the \n     Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB) to assess the impact \n     of transition on male and female civilians and ensure that \n     efforts to protect women's rights and security are included \n     in each area's transition implementation plan.\n       (ii) Reviewing existing indicators against which sex-\n     disaggregated data is collected and, if necessary, developing \n     additional indicators, to ensure the availability of data \n     that can be used to measure women's security, such as--\n\n       (I) the mobility of women and girls;\n       (II) the participation of women in local government bodies;\n       (III) the rate of school attendance for girls;\n       (IV) women's access to government services; and\n       (V) the prevalence of violence against women; and \n     incorporating those indicators into ongoing efforts to assess \n     overall security conditions during the transition period.\n\n       (iii) Integrating assessments of women's security into \n     current procedures used to determine an area's readiness to \n     proceed through the transition process.\n       (iv) Working with Afghan partners, coalition partners, and \n     relevant United States Government departments and agencies to \n     take concrete action to support women's rights and security \n     in cases of deterioration in women's security conditions \n     during the transition period.\n       (B) A strategy to increase gender awareness and \n     responsiveness among Afghan National Army and Afghan National \n     Police personnel, including the following actions:\n       (i) Working with Afghan and coalition partners to utilize \n     training curricula and programming that addresses the human \n     rights of women and girls, appropriate responses to threats \n     against women and girls, and appropriate behavior toward \n     female colleagues and members of the community; assessing the \n     quality and consistency of this training across regional \n     commands; and assessing the impact of this training on \n     trainee behavior.\n       (ii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders to \n     develop and utilize enforcement and accountability mechanisms \n     for ANA and ANP personnel who violate codes of conduct \n     related to the human rights of women and girls.\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\n       (iii) Working with Afghan and coalition partners to \n     implement the above tools and develop uniform methods and \n     standards for training and enforcement among coalition \n     partners and across regions.\n       (C) A strategy to increase the number of female members of \n     the ANA and ANP, including the following actions:\n       (i) Providing, through consultation with Afghan partners, \n     realistic and achievable objectives for the recruitment and \n     retention of women to the ANA and ANP by the end of the \n     security transition period in 2014.\n       (ii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders \n     and coalition partners to address physical and cultural \n     challenges to the recruitment and retention of female ANA and \n     ANP personnel, including through targeted recruitment \n     campaigns, expanded training and mentorship opportunities, \n     parity in pay and promotion rates with male counterparts, and \n     availability of facilities for female personnel.\n       (iii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders \n     to increase understanding about the unique ways in which \n     women members of the security forces improve the force's \n     overall effectiveness.\n       (iv) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders to \n     develop a plan for maintaining and increasing the recruitment \n     and retention of women in the ANA and ANP following the \n     completion of the security transition.\n       (3) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall include in each \n     report on progress toward security and stability in \n     Afghanistan that is submitted to Congress under sections 1230 \n     and 1231 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Audit the Pentagon Act of \n     2012''.\n\n     SEC. 1802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 9 of Article 1 of the Constitution of the \n     United States requires all agencies of the Federal \n     Government, including the Department of Defense, to publish \n     ``a regular statement and account of the receipts and \n     expenditures of all public money''.\n       (2) Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code, requires \n     the agencies of the Federal Government, including the \n     Department of Defense, to present auditable financial \n     statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The \n     Department has not complied with this law.\n       (3) The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of \n     1996 (31 U.S.C. 3512 note) requires financial systems \n     acquired by the Federal Government, including the Department \n     of Defense, to be able to provide information to leaders to \n     manage and control the cost of government. The Department has \n     not complied with this law.\n       (4) The financial management of the Department of Defense \n     has been on the ``High-Risk'' list of Government \n     Accountability Office, which means that the Department is not \n     consistently able to ``control costs; ensure basic \n     accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the \n     budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; [and] \n     prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse''.\n       (5) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2002 (Public Law 107-107) requires the Secretary of Defense \n     to report to Congress annually on the reliability of the \n     financial statements of the Department of Defense, to \n     minimize resources spent on producing unreliable financial \n     statements, and to use resources saved to improve financial \n     management policies, procedures, and internal controls.\n       (6) In 2005, the Department of Defense created a Financial \n     Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a \n     directorate within the office of the Under Secretary of \n     Defense (Comptroller), to improve Department business \n     processes with the goal of producing timely, reliable, and \n     accurate financial information that could generate an audit-\n     ready annual financial statement. In December 2005, that \n     directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first \n     of a series of semiannual reports on the status of the \n     Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.\n       (7) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2010 (Public Law 111-84) requires regular status reports on \n     the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described \n     in paragraph (6), and codified as a statutory requirement the \n     goal of the Plan in ensuring that Department of Defense \n     financial statements are validated as ready for audit not \n     later than September 30, 2017.\n       (8) At a September 2010 hearing of the Senate, the \n     Government Accountability Office stated that past \n     expenditures by the Department of Defense of $5,800,000,000 \n     to improve financial information, and billions of dollars \n     more of anticipated expenditures on new information \n     technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to \n     achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of \n     the Department. At that hearing, the Government \n     Accountability Office could not predict when the Department \n     would achieve full audit readiness of such statements.\n\n     SEC. 1803.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SPECTRUM REALLOCATION.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Nation's mobile communications industry is a \n     significant economic engine, by one estimate directly or \n     indirectly supporting 3,800,000 jobs, or 2.6 percent of all \n     United States employment, contributing $195,500,000,000 to \n     the United States gross domestic product and driving \n     $33,000,000,000 in productivity improvements in 2011;\n       (2) while wireless carriers are continually implementing \n     new and more efficient technologies and techniques to \n     maximize their existing spectrum capacity, there is a \n     pressing need for additional spectrum for commercial mobile \n     broadband services, with one report predicting that global \n     mobile data traffic will increase 18-fold between 2011 and \n     2016 at a compound annual growth rate of 78 percent, reaching \n     10.8 exabytes per month by 2016;\n       (3) as the Nation faces the current spectrum shortage, \n     consideration should be given to both the supply of spectrum \n     for licensed networks and for unlicensed devices;\n       (4) while this additional demand can be met in part by \n     reallocating spectrum from existing non-governmental uses, \n     the reallocation of Federal Government spectrum for \n     commercial use must also be part of the solution, given that, \n     according to a 2012 Government Accountability Office study, \n     the percentage of the most highly valued spectrum, that below \n     3700 MHz, used exclusively or predominantly by the Federal \n     Government ranges from approximately 39 percent to 57 percent \n     with exclusive Government use accounting for 18 percent of \n     the total amount of spectrum below 3700 MHz;\n       (5) existing law ensures that Federal operations are not \n     harmed as a result of a reallocation of spectrum for \n     commercial use, including through the establishment of the \n     Spectrum Relocation Fund to reimburse Federal users for the \n     costs of planning and implementing relocation and, with \n     respect to spectrum vacated by the Department of Defense, \n     certification by the Secretaries of Defense and Commerce and \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that replacement \n     spectrum provides comparable technical characteristics to \n     restore essential military capability;\n       (6) wherever possible, Federal Government spectrum \n     identified for commercial use should be reallocated for such \n     use;\n       (7) commercial users should only be required to share \n     spectrum with government users as a transition mechanism \n     while spectrum is being cleared by Federal users or in \n     limited exclusion zones where relocation of existing Federal \n     uses is not feasible, or where it can be determined that \n     sharing will not significantly impair use of the spectrum for \n     broadband services;\n       (8) among existing Federal Government bands, the spectrum \n     between 1755-1780 MHz is particularly well-suited for \n     reallocation to commercial use because it is identified \n     internationally for commercial mobile services and is used \n     for that purpose throughout most of the world and because it \n     is immediately adjacent to existing domestic wireless \n     spectrum and would fit seamlessly into the current mobile \n     broadband spectrum portfolio allowing for more immediate \n     equipment development and deployment;\n       (9) the Department of Defense should prepare a long term \n     plan in consultation with relevant agencies and private \n     sector stakeholders to determine equitable outcomes for the \n     Nation in relation to spectrum use that balances the private \n     sector's demand for spectrum with national security needs;\n       (10) in most cases Federal operations can and should be \n     relocated from this band, possibly except for a limited \n     subset of operations in rural areas where a Federal \n     Government station cannot be relocated without jeopardizing \n     essential military capability;\n       (11) auctioning this band on a paired basis with the band \n     between 2155-2180 MHz that was designated for auction under \n     the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 \n     would permit alignment with existing services, facilitate \n     faster deployment of services, maximize efficient use of the \n     spectrum, and yield more dollars in auction revenues than if \n     the 1755-1780 MHz were auctioned by itself;\n       (12) the President should therefore expeditiously direct \n     Federal users on the 1755-1780 MHz band to prepare, not later \n     than May 31, 2013, a relocation plan that includes the costs \n     of relocating from this band; and\n       (13) the Federal Communications Commission reallocate this \n     band to commercial use and auction it on a paired basis with \n     the band between 2155-2180 MHz.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3121.

Mr. WEBB (for himself, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, and Mr. \nLieberman) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill S. 3254, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                      DIVISION E--STOLEN VALOR ACT\n\n     SEC. 5001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Stolen Valor Act of \n     2012''.\n\n     SEC. 5002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress find the following:\n       (1) Because of the great respect in which military service \n     and military awards are rightfully held by the public, false \n     claims of receiving such medals or serving in the military \n     are especially likely to be harmful and material to \n     employers, voters in deciding to whom paid elective positions \n     should be entrusted, and in the award of contracts.\n       (2) Military service and military awards are held in such \n     great respect that public and private decisions are correctly \n     influenced by claims of heroism.\n       (3) False claims of military service or military heroism \n     are an especially noxious means of obtaining something of \n     value because they are particularly likely to cause tangible \n     harm to victims of fraud.\n       (4) False claims of military service or the receipt of \n     military awards, if believed, are especially likely to \n     dispose people favorably toward the speaker.\n       (5) False claims of military service or the receipt of \n     military awards are particularly likely to be material and \n     cause people to part with money or property. Even if such \n     claims are unsuccessful in bringing about this result, they \n     still constitute attempted fraud.\n       (6) False claims of military service or the receipt of \n     military awards that are made to secure appointment to the \n     board of an organization are likely to cause harm to such \n     organization through their obtaining the services of an \n     individual who does not bring to that organization what he or \n     she claims, and whose falsehood, if discovered, would cause \n     the organization's donors concern that the organization's \n     board might not manage money honestly.\n       (7) The easily verifiable nature of false claims regarding \n     military service or the receipt of military awards, the \n     relative infrequency of such claims, and the fact that false \n     claims of having served in the military or received such \n     awards are rightfully condemned across the political \n     spectrum, it is especially likely that any law prohibiting \n     such false claims would not be enforced selectively.\n       (8) Congress may make criminal the false claim of military \n     service or the receipt of military awards based on its powers \n     under article I, section 8, clause 2 of the Constitution of \n     the United States, to raise and support armies, and article \n     I, section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to enact necessary and proper measures to carry into \n     execution that power.\n\n     SEC. 5003.

and\n       (B) to help veterans who are filing new claims to fully \n     develop those claims prior to filing them, shortening the \n     processing time required.\n       (6) The common goal of the two initiatives of the Texas \n     Veterans Commission, called the ``Texas State Strike Force \n     Team'' and the ``Fully Developed Claims Team Initiative'', is \n     to reduce the backlog of claims pending in Texas by 17,000 \n     within one year.\n       (7) During the first two months of these new initiatives, \n     the Texas Veterans Commission helped veterans complete \n     development of more than 2,500 backlogged claims and assisted \n     veterans with the submission of more than 800 fully developed \n     claims.\n       (8) In testimony before the Subcommittee on Disability \n     Assistance and Memorial Affairs of the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 21, \n     2012, Diana Rubens, Deputy Under Secretary for Field \n     Operations of the Veterans Benefits Administration, indicated \n     that the Department of Veterans Affairs has experienced \n     positive outcomes in projects with the Texas Veterans \n     Commission, stating that both Veterans Service Organizations \n     ``and state and county service officers . . . are important \n     partners in VBA's transformation to better serve Veterans.''.\n       (9) At the same hearing, Mr. John Limpose, director of the \n     regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in \n     Waco, Texas, testified that the ``TVC is working very, very \n     well'' with regional offices of the Department in Texas, \n     calling the Texas Veterans Commission a ``very positive story \n     that we can branch out into . . . all of our stakeholders.''.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall submit to Congress a plan to reduce the current backlog \n     of pending claims for benefits under laws administered by the \n     Secretary and more efficiently process claims for such \n     benefits in the future.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A summary of all steps the Secretary has taken thus far \n     to partner with non-Federal entities in support of efforts to \n     reduce the backlog described in paragraph (1) and more \n     efficiently process claims described in such paragraph in the \n     future, including two previous initiatives by the Texas \n     Veterans Commission, namely the 2008-2009 Development \n     Assistant Pilot Project and the 2009-2011 Claims Processing \n     Assistance Team.\n       (B) A plan for the Secretary to partner with non-Federal \n     entities to support efforts to reduce such backlog and more \n     efficiently process such claims in the future, including the \n     following:\n       (i) State and local agencies relating to veterans affairs.\n       (ii) Organizations recognized by the Secretary for the \n     representation of veterans under section 5902 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       (iii) Such other relevant government and non-government \n     entities as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (C) A description of how the Secretary intends to leverage \n     partnerships with non-Federal entities described in \n     subparagraph (B) to eliminate such backlog, including through \n     increasing the percentage of claims that are fully developed \n     prior to submittal to the Secretary and ensuring that new \n     claims are fully developed prior to their submittal.\n       (D) A description of what steps the Secretary has taken and \n     will take--\n       (i) to expedite the processing of claims that are already \n     fully developed at the time of submittal; and\n       (ii) to support initiatives by non-Federal entities \n     described in subparagraph (B) to help claimants gather and \n     submit necessary evidence for claims that were previously \n     filed but require further development.\n       (E) A description of how partnerships with non-Federal \n     entities described in subparagraph (B) will fit into the \n     Secretary's overall claims processing transformation plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3159.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON OVERSIGHT OF THE NUCLEAR \n                   SECURITY ENTERPRISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     was established as an independent entity within the \n     Department of Energy to manage and secure the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile of the United States and to manage nuclear \n     nonproliferation and naval reactor programs.\n       (2) Serious security and health incidents continue to occur \n     at sites of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n       (3) In September 2012, an official of the Government \n     Accountability Office testified to Congress that lax \n     laboratory attitudes toward safety procedures, laboratory \n     inadequacies in identifying and addressing safety problems \n     with appropriate corrective actions, and inadequate oversight \n     by site offices of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration were responsible for nearly 100 safety \n     incidents since 2000.\n       (4) On July 28, 2012, three unarmed individuals compromised \n     security at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee, and according to the Government Accountability \n     Office, ``gained access to the protected security area \n     directly adjacent to one of the nation's most critically \n     important nuclear weapons-related facilities''.\n       (5) In June 2006, hackers attacked an unclassified computer \n     system at the National\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\n     Nuclear Security Administration's Service Center in \n     Albuquerque, New Mexico, and gained access to a file \n     containing the names and social security numbers of more than \n     1,500 employees of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (6) As early as February 2005, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Energy identified problems with the retrieval \n     of badges from terminated employees at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory and other sites of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (7) In 2004, a pattern of safety and security incidents \n     that occurred over the course of a year prompted the stand-\n     down of Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (8) The National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     independent of the safety and security reform efforts of the \n     Department of Energy, has launched an overhaul of its \n     contracting oversight, placing an emphasis on contractor \n     self-policing through an untested ``contractor assurance'' \n     approach.\n       (9) The Government Accountability Office has given the \n     contractor administration and project management capabilities \n     of the National Nuclear Security Administration a ``high \n     risk'' designation and found there to be insufficient \n     qualified Federal acquisition professionals to ``plan, \n     direct, and oversee project execution''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there is a need for strong, independent oversight of \n     the United States nuclear security enterprise;\n       (2) any attempt to reform oversight of the nuclear security \n     enterprise that transfers oversight from the Department of \n     Energy to the National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     reduces protections for worker health and safety at \n     facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration to \n     levels below the standards of the Department of Energy, or \n     transfers construction appropriations for the nuclear \n     security enterprise from the Department of Energy \n     appropriation account to the military construction \n     appropriation account, should be rejected;\n       (3) the Office of Health, Safety, and Security of the \n     Department of Energy, which reports to the Secretary of \n     Energy but is also accountable for routinely reporting to \n     Congress on the performance with respect to safety and \n     security of the Department, including the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, and the role of that Office in \n     overseeing safety and security at the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, should not be diminished; and\n       (4) any future modifications to the management or structure \n     of the nuclear security enterprise should be done in a way \n     that maintains or increases oversight of critical \n     construction, security, and acquisition capabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3169.
