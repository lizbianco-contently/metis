Mr. President, for many years now the Ex-Im Bank, which is \nreferred to as the Export-Import Bank, has helped American companies \ngrow\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\nand sell their products overseas. For those same years the Ex-Im Bank \nhas enjoyed broad bipartisan support. It was a good idea when it \nstarted and it is still a good idea.\n  When it was last authorized in 2006, the Ex-Im Bank passed the House \nby voice vote and the Senate by unanimous consent. The unanimous \nconsent request was offered by a Republican Senator. So when Senate \nDemocrats brought the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank before the \nSenate last week, we hoped the legislation would proceed with \nbipartisan, bicameral support as it did in 2006. After all, the measure \nwill support about 300,000 jobs annually and help American exports \ncontinue to compete in the global economy. It passed the Banking \nCommittee here in the Senate unanimously. It had three Republican \ncosponsors and is backed by the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe Business Round Table, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and various \nlabor unions, including Machinists. It will actually reduce the deficit \nby $1 billion.\n  The Ex-Im Bank is one of the proposals we shouldn't have to argue \nover. This isn't something that deserves a fight. We should reauthorize \nit and move on quickly. But I am sorry to say, true to form, the \nRepublican leadership--I am directing that to the House Republican \nleadership--this morning is once again spoiling for a fight where there \nshouldn't be a fight. Yesterday House Majority Leader Cantor called \nthis bill that we are dealing with here to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank a \n``partisan amendment.''\n  This bill is cosponsored by the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee, Richard Shelby. Senator Shelby has been the chairman of that \ncommittee; he is now the ranking member. It is tough to call anything \nSenator Shelby puts his name on with a Democrat as partisan.\n  Cantor claimed this noncontroversial, commonsense measure is \nderailing efforts to pass the IPO bill that will expand innovators' \naccess to capital. It is simply not true. Leader Cantor should check \nwith his Senate colleagues. Many of them understand American exporters \nneed access to Federal financing to stay on a level playing field with \nglobal competitors.\n  Yesterday the senior Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, \nsaid without the Ex-Im Bank, ``Our ability to grow in South Carolina is \nnonexistent.'' In 2011, South Carolina exporters sold more than $130 \nmillion worth of goods abroad, thanks to Ex-Im Bank financing.\n  South Carolina is not the only State relying on the bank to keep \nbusiness thriving. Nevada companies exported $33 million of their \nproducts last year, thanks to financing from the Export-Import Bank. In \n2011, in the Presiding Officer's State of Delaware, the Ex-Im Bank made \nit possible for firms to sell more than $39 million worth of goods \noverseas.\n  Last year, the Ex-Im Bank supported 300,000 jobs across 49 States and \n2,000 cities in America.\n  China already provides more investment capital to its exporters than \nthe United States, Canada, Germany, and Great Britain combined, as \nSenator Graham said during his call yesterday. We had a conference call \nwith people concerned about this legislation. So we cannot allow that \ngulf to widen.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says: ``Failure to reauthorize Ex-Im \nwould amount to America's unilateral disarmament in the face of other \nnations' aggressive trade finance programs.''\n  I don't know if Eric Cantor has looked at this legislation. What is \nhe talking about? Why does he want to fight about this? Can't we do \nanything with the Republican-dominated House of Representatives, \nworking together?\n  The Chamber of Commerce said we do have a choice: We can compete or \nwe can cooperate. We can engage in yet another unnecessary, \nunproductive battle--and Cantor is picking a fight, but we are not \ngoing to. He has challenged us to a fight. We are not going to fight \nbecause this is bipartisan legislation--or we can work together to help \nAmerican businesses grow and hire. That is what we are going to do. The \nchoice should not be difficult. We do not want a fight.\n  The Senate will vote on this reasonable proposal today. Almost \n300,000 Americans had jobs last year--I repeat--because of this \nimportant legislation. I hope those workers come first as Republican \ncolleagues cast their votes today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1818-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we rise today to engage in a colloquy on \nan issue that is certainly front and center and has been for a long \ntime in our great Nation, and that is the issue of the health care \nbill. This bill is hurting working Americans and small businesses, and \nthey are the lifeblood of our economy.\n  Let me, if I might, talk about a company from Nebraska: Toba, Inc. \nToba is located in Grand Island, NE. They are a food distributor in \ncentral Nebraska. They employ about 200 to 300 people, depending on the \ntime of the year. It is companies such as this that are the heart and \nsoul of the Nebraska economy.\n  Tony Wald is the chief executive officer of Toba. He shared with me \nnot long ago that their health care premiums recently increased by 26 \npercent. Tony's insurance agency talked to him. Of course, Tony wanted \nto know: What is going on here? What is wrong? Well, the insurance \nagent said to Tony there were several provisions in the health care law \nthat were the reason for the increase.\n  Let me put this in perspective. That 26-percent increase is an extra \n$188,000 increase that ultimately falls in the laps of the employees of \nToba. Hundreds of working Americans will see their premiums go up as a \nresult of this health care law.\n  Let me point out something that is very obvious. That is a broken \npromise. Then-Candidate Obama promised that Americans would see their \npremiums decrease--decrease--by $2,500 by the end of his first term in \noffice. Well, that has not been the reality. This health care law \ndrives up premiums and Toba is a perfect example of that.\n  But I need not stop there. Let me talk about Yellow Van Cleaning and \nRestoration Services in Kearney, NE, just down the road a bit from \nGrand Island. This small business employs 48 people. The owner is a \nfine gentleman by the name of Dave Keiter. He believes he has \npositioned his company correctly to grow it. In fact, some recent \nmarket research that was done shows his company is poised for growth. \nThey have done all of the right things to take this small business and \nlay the right foundation so they can grow.\n  Dave was faced with a tough choice--a choice not caused by his \ncompetitors, a choice not caused by a bad economy. He was faced with a \ntough choice caused by President Barack Obama and Democrats in the \nHouse and Senate who passed the health care bill. What is his tough \nchoice? He had to choose not to expand because he will run smack-dab \ninto the employer mandate if he grows his business.\n  You see, this mandate requires that employers with at least 50 full-\ntime employees offer government-approved health insurance to their \nemployees or pay a fine of $2,000 per employee. Dave did the \ncalculation on this--a small\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\nbusiness, with tight profit margins, doing everything they can to make \nthe right decisions. Dave's calculation indicates he will be penalized \nmore than $50,000 a year if he grows beyond his current 48-member \nstaff.\n  There is no doubt about it. This law is stifling job creation. Not \nonly does this law prevent jobs from being created, it is forcing \nbusinesses to actually eliminate jobs.\n  An Iowa-based insurance company recently decided to exit the \nindividual insurance market, abandoning sales directly to individuals \nand families. So what happens? Thirty-five thousand policyholders lose \nthat insurance through that company. But it does not stop there. Mr. \nPresident, 110 employees will lose their jobs--70 in Nebraska.\n  A driving factor is the medical loss ratio provision in the law which \nmicromanages how insurance companies spend their revenues. The CEO of \nthe insurance company said job loss was ``a fairly predictable \nconsequence of the regulation.''\n  These are not hypothetical situations. Before the law was passed, I \ncame to the floor many times with my colleagues and pointed out the \nflaws in this ill-conceived legislation. Now we are telling real \nstories, real-life stories and talking about real people who have lost \ntheir jobs and are being impacted by this ill-advised law.\n  There is more. While I can directly point out that 70 Nebraskans lose \ntheir job, the Congressional Budget Office says the new law will mean \n800,000 fewer jobs over the next decade.\n  Similar to Yellow Van Cleaning in Kearney, NE, other businesses are \nholding off on hiring. In a recent Gallup survey, 48 percent of small \nbusinesses are not hiring because of the potential cost of health \ninsurance under the health care law.\n  Financial sector analysts at UBS have stated that the law is \n``arguably the biggest impediment to hiring, particularly hiring of \nless skilled workers.'' Those are the people who need the jobs most.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates average premiums will \nincrease by 27 to 30 percent under this law largely because the new \nhealth care law's coverage mandates will force premiums up.\n  It is no wonder Toba in Grand Island, NE, is seeing its health care \ncosts go up by a staggering $188,000 per year. The Medicare Actuary \nsays this law will increase health care spending by $311 billion over \nthe next 10 years. Two years have passed and things are only getting \nworse. This law is suffocating job growth around the country.\n  Let me, if I might, now turn to my colleagues. I have a question, if \nI might start with Senator Portman.\n  Senator Portman joins me on the floor and I appreciate that. I know \nthe Senator has a unique perspective because he has served as the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget. Does the Senator see \nthis law increasing costs in his home State? Is it straining job \ncreators as we are seeing in Nebraska?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I say to my colleague from Nebraska, I am afraid the \nanswer is yes. It is increasing costs and, therefore, making us less \ncompetitive. When we increase the costs of doing business, of course, \nit impacts the economy. The Senator has laid this out very well. I \nappreciate the Senator's comments this morning.\n  The Senator talked about the 800,000 jobs that are projected to be \nlost, and that is probably a conservative figure, given the information \nI am getting from back home and what the Senator just talked about. The \nSenator talked about the fact that premiums are going to increase \ndramatically--27 to 30 percent.\n  Since the Senator mentioned the Office of Management and Budget, I \nwill also say this is about our businesses and their ability to create \njobs and get this economy moving. It is about all of us as families and \nconsumers having higher costs. It is also about our Federal budget \ndeficit. We have an expert on that in Dr. Coburn, who will speak in a \nmoment. But the point is, this is increasing costs to all of us in \nvarious ways, and the budget deficit is already at record levels--a $15 \ntrillion debt. Our country, obviously, is awash in red ink, and one of \nthe reasons, of course, is higher health care costs. So this is \nimpacting us in a lot of different ways.\n  Let me address the Senator's question more directly, though, and that \nis in terms of the impact on business. I will tell the Senator, I have \nvisited over 100 factories in Ohio in the last few years, and in every \none I asked this question: What is going on with taxes and regulations \nand energy and health care? I have not been to a business yet that has \nnot told me their health care cost increases over the past couple years \nhave added to the uncertainty, the unpredictability, and, therefore, \nthe lack of investment into jobs and growth.\n  I went to a factory in Cleveland, OH, one day, and this is a \nrelatively small business. It is actually seeing its sales increase a \nlittle bit. The owner said: Rob, I would like to hire people, but I \nwant to offer health care. Everybody here has health care, which is \ngreat. Those costs embedded in adding a new employee are too high; they \nare prohibitive. So what I am doing instead is I am going to overtime, \nI am going to part time to avoid hiring a full-time worker.\n  Luckily, I was there with some members of the media, and they were \nable to hear this directly from this individual who is making a \ndecision about whether to hire somebody in Ohio during this weak \nrecovery. The health care law and the health care cost increases are \ndirectly impacting that. So it is for real.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce did a study recently, as the Senator \nknows. This was just a couple months ago. They asked small businesses \nwith fewer than 500 employees all around America: How does this impact \nyou? Seventy-four percent of them say the recent health care law makes \nit harder for their business to hire more employees. Fifty-two percent \nof them say economic uncertainty is one of the top reasons they are not \nhiring. Thirty-six percent say uncertainty about what Washington will \ndo next is one of their two top reasons they are not hiring. Thirty \npercent say they are not hiring because of the requirements in the \nhealth care bill.\n  This is not just anecdotal evidence we are picking up in our States \nas we go around and talk to employers. This is information that is out \nthere for the public to see. I hope all the activity that is \nsurrounding this 2-year anniversary of the passage of this law from the \nDemocratic side and from our side will rekindle this debate because, \nclearly, we did not get it right. We did not affect the fundamental \nproblem, which is the cost of health care rising to the point that it \nis affecting us as consumers and families. It is affecting our ability \nto get this economy moving. It is affecting our budget deficit in such \ndramatic ways.\n  Doug Holtz-Eakin, who was the former head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, testified last year. I thought it was interesting what he said. \nAs you know, the health care reform law says, if someone is an employer \nwith more than 50 employees, they have to offer full-time employees \ncoverage or pay a $2,000 penalty per worker. He made an interesting \npoint. I see this around Ohio with these small businesses that have \nmaybe 30, 40 workers, and they are hoping to be able to add more. He \nsaid--and I think he is right--this creates ``a tremendous impediment \nto expansion.'' His example was: Let's say a company does not offer \nhealth care benefits and they have under 50 employees and they want to \nadd another full-time employee. They take it up to 51 employees--a \n$2,000-per-worker penalty, after subtracting the first 30 workers. The \nfine to hire an additional worker would be $42,000, for that one worker \nto be added marginally to its workforce.\n  So businesses have to offset that lost revenue. The burden will be \nborne, as Doug Holtz-Eakin said, by whom? The workers, with lower \nwages, fewer jobs, fewer hours to be worked, less job growth.\n  The Senator talked about the many taxes in this legislation, and the \noverall burden of the taxation on the economy is one of the problems \nwith it, but there is also a very specific tax on medical device \ncompanies, and this is one that I know affects both of the Senators' \nStates. It certainly affects Ohio. We have a lot of very innovative \nmedical device companies in Ohio, and they tell me they are going to \nhave to cut back on their workforce because of this new tax that is in \nthe health care bill.\n  So think about this. At a time when we are all proposing we do more \non\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\nscience and technology and math and engineering, the STEM programs, we \nare trying to encourage more innovation in this country to be able to \ncompete globally, medical device businesses in Ohio and around our \ncountry have been able to be strong and we have been able to compete \nglobally and we should be doing all we can to encourage them and to \nhelp them. Instead, we are doing the opposite.\n  There is a 2.3-percent medical device excise tax in this legislation, \nand it is going to hit next year. They are already planning for it. It \nis not a 2.3-percent tax on profits. That is what you would expect, \nright? It is a tax on revenues. So we could have a young startup \nentrepreneur who says: I am starting this company even though it is a \nloss leader the first couple years. I am not making any money. But I \nknow I have a great idea, and I am going to continue to stretch this \nout to be able to create something of great value for our health care, \nfor the quality of health care, to be able to save lives. Yet I have no \nprofit. So I probably will not be taxed, right? Guess what. They are \ngoing to be taxed. They are going to be taxed on their revenue.\n  Established companies that do have some profit--they are looking at \nbig taxes on their revenues, particularly if they are doing well. There \nare a couple companies in Ohio and around the country that have already \ntold us what they are going to do.\n  Let me give you an example. Last year, I visited Mound Laser and \nPhotonics Center outside Dayton, OH. They provide services to the \nmedical device industry--fabrication. They do very technical work. They \nhave machinists there who are specializing in medical device \nmanufacturing. They provide machining services to the device industry.\n  The CEO is a friend of mine, Dr. Larry Dosser. He told me when I was \nthere--he said: Look, this could be devastating to our business--this \n2.3 percent excise tax--because these are our customers. Unfortunately, \nhe has just told me he is going to have to start laying off people. On \nJanuary 1, 2012--a couple months ago--they laid off people for the \nfirst time in their history. It is a 16-year-old company. It is an up-\nand-coming company. They are adding people every year. Because of this \nmedical device tax, they are having to plan for higher taxes, \ntherefore, a hit to their revenues, and they are starting to lay off \npeople already.\n  There are other examples. Meridian Bioscience is in Cincinnati. I \nvisited there. I talked to the workers, I talked to the management, and \nthey tell me flat out: This is going to cost us tens of millions of \ndollars, and this is going to result in us laying off workers. They are \nnot sure if it is 40 workers or 80 workers, but it is an up-and-coming \ncompany in our area that is doing the right things, creating jobs and \nopportunity and creating devices that will, in this case, by the way, \nalso improve the quality and lower the costs of health care. That is \nwhat they specialize in--diagnostic services that the Senator, as a \ndoctor, understands, Dr. Coburn, can be incredibly helpful in getting \nhealth care costs down.\n  There are others. Stryker Corporation just announced its intention to \nlay off 5 percent of its workforce in anticipation of the \nimplementation of this tax at the beginning of next year.\n  This is what is happening. There is a better way. There is a way to \nreduce costs and increase competition in health care to make it more \npatient centered. You all have been leaders in that. We have laid out \nalternatives. We are not saying the health care system was perfect \nbefore this legislation was drafted--not at all. Of course, it needs to \nbe improved and reformed and it can be. It can be done in a way that \nboth improves quality and improves the ability of people to have access \nby adding transparency and adding competition and adding the value of \nquality and outcomes rather than just input and volume to reduce costs \nin our system.\n  We have to do that. If we do not do that, this law will continue to \naffect our economy negatively. One reason we have the weakest recovery \nsince the Great Depression is because of the impact of health care, and \nthis law has made it worse, not better.\n  I thank the Senator for letting me come by to talk about this issue. \nI look forward to the continuing dialog.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank Senator Portman. The Senator has made so many \nexcellent points.\n  I believe if we look at the people who have spoken about this \nlegislation, before and after its passage, one would be hard-pressed to \nfind anyone who speaks with greater authority than Dr. Tom Coburn, who \nis a Member of the Senate.\n  I would ask Dr. Coburn to weigh in on this health care bill. He has \ntalked through the years so often about what this health care bill is \ndoing to medicine, the impact it is going to have on patients, the \nimpact on the economy, the impact on jobs. I would like the Senator to \ntalk to us today about what he is seeing as we are literally on the \ntime of the second anniversary and tell us how this is panning out. It \nhas been the law now for a couple of years. What is the reality of this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. COBURN. I, thank the Senator. The reality is we are committing \nmalpractice. Let me describe what I mean by that. In medicine, when a \npatient comes in, listening is a very important aspect. In fact, there \nis the axiom in medicine that if you listen to your patient, they will \ntell you what is wrong with them, completely. The more time you spend, \nthe more effective you are at gaining it. The reason that is the axiom \nin medicine is because you do not want to treat symptoms of a disease, \nyou want to treat the real disease.\n  All of America recognizes that we had some difficulties in being \ncompetitive and also with access in terms of health care. We know our \nhealth care is good, but it is too expensive. As a matter of fact, it \nis more expensive than anywhere in the world. But we do know some \nthings about that. We know one out of three dollars we spend in health \ncare in this country does not help anybody. It does not help them get \nwell. It does not keep them from getting sick.\n  The problem with the Affordable Care Act is that it almost always \ntreats the symptoms rather than the underlying disease. Let me give \nsome examples. I have practiced medicine. I have been a physician for \nalmost 30 years. When I have a contract with a private insurer, they \nare going to renew that contract in the next year on whether or not I \nam efficient and effective in taking care of people who have insurance \nwith them. There is no motivation at all in the Medicare Act.\n  The underlying problem with our $2.6 trillion is that we all think \nsomebody else is paying for our health care. So I am a practicing \nphysician. I have no motivation not to spend Medicare dollars and avoid \nthe axiom of listening to the patient because maybe the short-term \nremuneration for my services is low, so I need to see more people. So \nwe have addressed the symptoms of the disease but not the real disease.\n  The real disease is that we, on both the purchasing and providing \nside, are not responsible with the available dollars in our economy. \nWhen we always assume someone else is paying for it, we cannot get \nthere. We do not have the right incentives. Consequently, when we treat \nsymptoms we actually make it worse.\n  What are we seeing? What we are going to see is the government jump \nbetween the doctor and the patient to make the symptoms worse. We are \ngoing to have an IPAB board, which is not coming yet, but it is coming. \nWe are going to have an innovation board--not patients, not doctors--\nnot patients making these decisions but somebody in Washington making \nthe decisions. So the very capability of utilizing that one axiom of \nmedicine, having the freedom to listen to the patient and then acting \non what we heard rather than acting on the basis of rules and \nregulations coming out of an autonomous nonpersonal body in Washington \nthat is going to tell us what we are going to do.\n  Let me give a great example. In the Affordable Care Act is the money \nand the incentive to put everything online. Now, by itself that sounds \nsmart. What do the first studies show on the basis of that? The first \nstudies show that when a doctor has online available diagnostic tests \nversus the doctors who do not, they order 18 percent more tests then \nthe doctors who do not.\n  In other words, if something is easy to do, we do more of it, and so \nhere is the first--this just came out 2 weeks ago--the first set, when \npeople were looking at radiographic tests such as\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\nCTs, MRIs, CAT scans, chest x-rays, ultrasounds, they get the results. \nThey get the results faster. Without the patient being there, without \nreading them, they automatically order 18 percent more tests.\n  Well, our problem in our country was we were ordering too many tests. \nWe have all of the incentives to order tests rather than listen to the \npatient, and now we set up a system where we are going to order more \ntests. That is what the first study shows. We are going to give \nhundreds of millions of dollars to doctors to have an IT system put in \ntheir offices so we have an electronic medical record. Well, what are \nwe seeing from the first examples of that? Other than in isolated cases \nwhere it is a very refined product, such as Mayo Clinic or Cleveland \nClinic or even at the VA, what do we find? People fill out the \npaperwork, check the boxes, but they do not check it in relationship to \nthe patient. So when the next person looks at the electronic medical \nrecord, they do not look at all of the garbage that is there that does \nnot mean anything--but, oh, it might because there is too much \ninformation now in terms of the computer screen.\n  So what is happening? We are doing duplicate things that were not \ndone before. So the impact of the health care bill--just in terms of \ntaxes, does anybody think health insurance premiums are not going to \nrise enough to offset whatever the increased cost is for the medical \nloss ratio? They are going to make money. Businesses are going to make \nmoney. So if we put a medical loss ratio at 15 percent, what is going \nto happen is they are going to live within that, but the premiums are \ngoing to go up so they can do what they need to do.\n  Blue Cross-Blue Shield Oklahoma knows my practice parameters. They \nknow what I am good at, what I am efficient at, and what I am not. They \nare not going to give up that knowledge of whether or not I should be \ndoing a test by simply saying the Federal Government put in a medical \nloss ratio. They are going to raise premium prices, which we are \nalready seeing in Oklahoma.\n  So when we continue to treat symptoms instead of the underlying \ndisease, we do not solve a problem; we actually make the problem worse. \nThat is why you get sued as a physician when you miss a diagnosis of a \ndisease, and what I will tell you is Americans are at ``dis-ease'' \nabout health care in our country. But we have committed malpractice in \nour approach to it because we are treating the symptoms and not the \nunderlying disease.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Let me express my appreciation, but let me also follow \nup with a question because I think it is important. The Senator \nmentioned IPAB. This was a little-discussed provision, although the \nSenator kept pointing it out. Talk about the powers of this group and \nwhere you think it is leading.\n  Mr. COBURN. The IPAB stands for the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard. They are a group of individuals who will decide what we pay for \nand what we do not pay for in terms of health care. They will also \ndecide how much we pay.\n  Once those 15 people are in place, if they are wrong, people will \nhave no ability to challenge it in court. They have no ability to see \ntheir work product and why they decided on what they did. They have no \nability to cut off their funding. In other words, they are an \nautonomous nondemocratic function whose whole goal will be to control \ncosts.\n  Well, there are lots of ways to control cost. I call it the \n``sovietization'' of the American medical industry. They are going to \ncontrol costs. Well, we know how that works. We have already seen it. \nIt is called NICE in England, and we are seeing a revolt. As a matter \nof fact, in England today they are talking about reforming their health \ncare system and going in the opposite direction of what we are doing \nbecause what they know is the rationing of care based on a value of 1 \nyear of life per individual is the way they make that decision.\n  So if Senator Johanns is 78 years old and has a broken hip and bad \ndiabetes and bad heart disease, they look at the value of what his life \nexpectancy is with that and then the cost of fixing his hip. They say: \nYou are not worth it. So in England they do not fix your hip. Well, \nthat is called rationing.\n  The fact is it is not bad by the word; it is a loss of liberty. It \nmeans people no longer have the ability to decide themselves what will \nhappen to them, and somebody autonomously, very distant from them, \nmakes the decision for them.\n  IPAB is not the worst--the innovation council. What will not happen \nthat the innovation will not allow to happen? I have a story of a \npatient--and I will just give an example. Not IPAB, not innovation, but \nwe are also going to have the Preventive Services Task Force that is \ngoing to make recommendations on screening.\n  I want to give an example. This is a true story. I will not use her \nname, but a young lady came to me with a breast lump. I did the \nstandard protocol, best practices on her. It showed to be a simple \ncyst, and the point I am making is about the art of medicine, not the \nscience of medicine because everybody gets hung up on the science, but \nnobody ever talks about the art.\n  I had an uncomfortable feeling about this cyst. So I aspirated it. It \nwas inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. In other words, had I \nfollowed the protocols that are going to be recommended by IPAB and the \nbest practices, I would have never aspirated it.\n  Well, this patient is now dead. But she lived 12 years. A delay in \ndiagnosis on inflammatory carcinoma would have given her less than a \nyear to live. Because I did not follow what the standard protocol was \nbut followed my history and my knowledge of the patient and my feeling, \nI diagnosed her early. She got to see her kids get married; she got to \nsee a grandchild. That never would have happened.\n  So what is coming with IPAB and the Preventive Services Task Force is \npeople making decisions that are not in the room with the doctor and \nthe patient, and that is the biggest danger of the Affordable Care Act: \nthat we are going to take the ability of patients and doctors to make \nchoices and give that choice to a government bureaucrat.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. We yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 2 years ago health insurance companies \ncould deny women care due to so-called preexisting conditions, such as \npregnancy or being a victim of domestic violence. Two years ago women \nwere permitted to be legally discriminated against when it came to \ninsurance premiums and were often paying more for coverage than men. \nTwo years ago women did not have access to the full range of \nrecommended preventive care, such as mammograms or contraception and \nmore. Two years ago the insurance companies had all the leverage, and \ntoo often it was women who were paying the price.\n  Mr. President, that is why I am proud to come to the floor today, 2 \nyears after we passed the Affordable Care Act, to highlight just how \nfar we have come when it comes to making sure women across America get \nthe care they need at a cost they can afford. Because of this law, \nwomen will be treated fairly when it comes to health care costs. \nDeductibles and other expenses will be capped so a health care crisis \ndoesn't cause a family to lose their home or their life savings. \nPreventive care will be free, so women never have to delay care because \nthey can't afford to see a doctor. Because of this law women will have \nmore options. They can use health care exchanges to pick quality plans \nthat work for them and for their families. And if they change jobs or \nmove, they will be able to keep their coverage. Because of this law \nmaternity care is now covered and women won't have to skip prenatal \ncare because they can't afford it. Because of this law women are now in \ncharge of their health care, not their insurance companies. That is why \nI feel very\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\nstrongly that we cannot go back to the way things were. While we can \nnever stop working to make improvements, we owe it to the women of \nAmerica to make progress and not allow the clock to be rolled back on \ntheir health care needs.\n  I know some of my Republican colleagues are furiously working to undo \nall of the gains we have made in the health care reform law for women \nand for their families. I am disappointed but I am hardly surprised. \nRepublicans have been waging war on women's health since the moment \nthey came into power. After they campaigned across the country on a \nplatform of jobs and the economy, the first three bills they introduced \nin the House were each direct attacks on women's health care in \nAmerica. The very first bill they introduced, H.R. 1, would have \ntotally eliminated Title X funding for family planning and teenage \npregnancy prevention, and it included an amendment that would have \ncompletely defunded Planned Parenthood and cut off support for the \nmillions of women in this country who count on it. Another opening \nround of their bills would have permanently codified the Hyde amendment \nand the DC abortion ban, and the original version of their bill didn't \neven include an exception for the health of the mother. Finally, they \nintroduced a bill right away that would have rolled back every single \none of the gains I just talked about in the Affordable Care Act.\n  This law is a winner for women, it is a winner for men and for \nchildren and for our health care system overall. So I am proud to stand \nhere today with so many of my colleagues who are committed to making \nsure the benefits of this law do not get taken away from the women of \nAmerica. We will keep fighting attempts to take them away, and I am \nconfident we will win.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. President, while I am on the floor today, I also would like to \nrise to express my strong support for an amendment that will be \nconsidered today which will grow American jobs, help small businesses, \ngenerate revenue for taxpayers, and which has strong bipartisan \nbacking.\n  It is no secret that foreign countries are aggressively trying to \nseize the global market, and America needs to keep fighting back with a \nprogram that works for businesses and taxpayers and does create \nthousands of jobs. The Export-Import Bank is one of the most important \nresources America has to keep up this fight. For over 75 years the Ex-\nIm Bank has supported job-creating U.S. exports by helping American \nbusinesses sell to the world. No one knows this better than businesses \nin my home State of Washington--the largest exporter in the Nation per \ncapita--where one in three jobs in my State is tied to international \ntrade. Reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank means more than 150 Washington \nState businesses that rely on this financing to sell their products \noverseas can keep their jobs here at home.\n  At a time when our competitors in the global marketplace provide far \nmore aggressive export credit financing to companies within their \nborders, the Ex-Im Bank simply levels the playing field for U.S. \ncompanies that sell goods overseas. And the Ex-Im Bank helps create \nU.S. jobs and does not add to our deficit.\n  U.S. exports have been a bright spot in America's road to recovery, \nincreasing by about 20 percent over the last 2 years and driving about \nhalf of all of our economic growth. Given the obvious need for exports \nto power economic growth, it would be negligent to pull the plug on the \nEx-Im Bank. If we do not pass this bill by the end of this month, \nthousands of jobs will be at risk, not just from our exporters but from \nbusinesses large and small across the country.\n  Reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank would not only be a short-term \nvictory for our exporters, it would also tell our trading partners that \nthe United States is a stable place to do business and that we stand \nbehind our products and our companies. So I urge a ``yes'' vote on that \namendment when it comes to the floor later.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1822-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1822-S1823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise again today to discuss H.R. 3606, the \nso-called JOBS Act. As chair of the Subcommittee on Securities, \nInsurance, and Investment, I want all of my colleagues to know that \nthis legislation, as it is currently drafted, is fundamentally flawed. \nWe need to stop, slow down, carefully amend this legislation, and send \nsomething to the President that will not only encourage capital \nformation, but also protect investors.\n  I am not alone in my analysis. Some of the most sophisticated \nsecurity analysts, experts, and commentators in the country are telling \nthe Senate to slow down and work to improve it. We have received \nletters or testimony or comments from SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro; SEC \nCommissioner Luis Aguilar; the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation; former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt; former SEC Chief \nAccountant Lynn Turner; AARP; Americans for Financial Reform; the \nConsumer Federation of America; the Council of Institutional Investors; \nthe National Association of Consumer Advocates; Public Citizen; U.S. \nPIRG; the AFL CIO; AFSCME; the National Education Association; the \nAmerican Institute of CPAs; the CFA Institute; and the Main Street \nAlliance, just to name a few of the broad spectrum of experts who feel \nthis bill is, as they say, not ready for prime time.\n  In an op-ed in the Washington Post on March 14, two Harvard \nsecurities professors, John Coates and Robert Pozen, stated:\n\n       [T]his bill does more than trim regulatory fat; parts of it \n     cut into muscle. Small businesses will have a harder time \n     raising capital if investors do not receive sufficient \n     disclosures or other legal protections.\n\n  In his ``Motley Fool'' column on March 19, Ilan Moscovitz states that \nthere are four really problematic things about the JOBS Act. And, as we \nall recognize, ``Motley Fool'' is one of the most perceptive in its \ncolumns about the securities markets, analyzing the securities markets \nfrom many different perspectives. They point out some of the fairly \nsignificant faults in the House bill. In sum, they say the legislation \nas currently written would exempt 90 percent of current IPOs from \nimportant corporate governance and accounting requirements because it \ndefines ``small companies'' as anything valued below $700 million and \nearning less than $1 billion in annual revenues.\n  Those aren't exactly small companies, and those companies can in fact \nand should in fact be following the procedures we have laid out in \norder for a company to go public.\n  Our amendment recognizes the need to provide more streamlined \nprocesses for smaller IPOs, but we restrict these streamlined \nprocedures to companies with less than $350 million in annual revenues, \nmuch closer to the notion of a small company beginning the process of \nbecoming a publicly held entity.\n  There is also a problem in this legislation with accounting. When \ninvestors lose faith in accounting standards, they are less willing to \nbuy stocks. In fact, one of the great strengths of our security markets \nis the feeling that your money is well protected. It is scrutinized; \nthere are accountants; there are audits. If we lose that, then the \ninvesting public worldwide will say the United States is not the place \nto put their money. Our amendment does not interfere with independent \naccounting standards, and limits the number of companies that get \nexempted from accounting rules.\n  There is another big issue in the House bill. It contains a provision \nthat would increase the number of investors who could own shares in \nprivate companies, and excludes employees from the count. That has some \nmerit. But by counting shareholders of record instead of the beneficial \nshareholders--there is a legal owner on the books of the company, but \nthat legal owner may represent thousands of actual owners. The \nbeneficial owners are the ones who get the dividends, the ones who get \nthe right to vote on the shares--if we preserve this loophole going \nforward, this\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\ncould potentially create a situation where an unlimited number of \ninvestors could be involved in a company and that company would still \nbe able to remain private and not have to provide periodic reports \nunder the Exchange Act.\n  Last year, for example, Goldman Sachs planned to create a special-\npurpose vehicle, basically a fund that could pool money from its \nclients, that would count as only one holder of record in Facebook. You \ncan see how this could clearly circumvent the notion of how necessary \nit is to provide the reporting requirements for large companies, \ncompanies with a large shareholder basis. Our bill eliminates this \nloophole by clarifying that recordholders must be beneficial owners, \nwhile at the same time raising the shareholder cap from 500 to 750, to \nmake it more contemporaneous. But we exempt employees from this \nrecordholder trigger for public registration, and that will allow \nprivate companies that want to remain private, but want to reward their \nemployees with shares to stock, the ability to do so without triggering \nthe public reporting requirements.\n  Finally, the House bill sets up a new mechanism for crowdfunding. \nThis is a very interesting concept. My colleagues Senator Merkley, \nSenator Bennet, and Senator Brown of Massachusetts have worked very \nhard in developing a crowdfunding bill much superior to what is \nincluded in the House version. In fact, the House version has been \ndescribed by a noted securities expert as ``the boiler room \nlegalization act'' for its very lax approach to crowdfunding.\n  Our amendment requires crowdfunding to be conducted through regulated \nintermediaries, and provides for basic disclosure requirements, \naggregate caps, and other protections to ensure market integrity, and \nprevent abuse.\n  The House bill also removes important prohibitions against general \nsolicitation and advertising in regard to private placements that have \nbeen on the books for decades. Recognizing that in a world of Internet \nand Twitter, even private communications with accredited investors \nabout private offerings can be inadvertently broadly disseminated, our \nbill takes a much more targeted approach to this issue. In our \namendment, we allow for limited public solicitation and advertising \nthrough ways and means approved by the SEC, so they have a chance to \nupdate mechanisms for communicating with investors in this age of \nTwitter, Internet, and other new media. We believe this amendment gives \nthe SEC the tools it needs to formulate limited exemptions to the \ngeneral solicitation and advertising rules, allowing private offerings \nto still remain private.\n  There is another section of the House bill that deals with the reg A \nexemption. Reg A has been on the books of the Securities Exchange \nCommission, again, for decades. It currently allows an exemption for \ncertain registration requirements for mini-offerings of $5 million or \nless. The House bill proposes to raise the ceiling for this exemption \nto $50 million, but they do so in a way that could open it up to abuse, \nallowing companies to avoid rules and reporting requirements for public \ncompanies. We limit companies to raising no more than this $50 million \namount every 3 years, truly aiming our provisions at the small \ncompanies that are trying to raise capital without triggering all of \nthe requirements of a publicly held company. We also require that a \nbasic set of audited financial statements be filed with the offering \nstatement and require periodic disclosures of material information to \ninvestors.\n  Let me stress what the House bill is proposing. They are proposing to \nlegalize the solicitation of $50 million a year from retail investors--\nin fact, it could be $50 million every year--without requiring audited \nfinancial statements be provided to potential investors. If you go to a \nbank to get a loan for your business, they are going to require audited \nfinancials. I think, at a minimum, you need to provide audited \nfinancial statements if you are soliciting $50 million a year from the \npublic and, in fact, that $50 million could be for successive years.\n  Finally, this whole discussion about the House bill has been cast in \nterms of jobs. There is not a lot in the House bill that talks about \njobs, particularly jobs in America. There is no requirement that any of \nthese relaxations of the securities laws be correlated with job \nincreases. There is no requirement in the House bill that these jobs be \nin the United States.\n  We have just come through a series of enforcement actions in which \nthe SEC had to crack down on reverse mergers by Chinese companies that \nwere taking over American shell companies, putting their money in, and \nthen going ahead and using the benefits of access to our stock markets. \nMost of those companies' jobs were not here, nor was the intention to \ncreate those jobs here. Those are the types of risks we run in the \nHouse bill.\n  Our bill includes reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which is \nsomething that has already demonstrated its ability to support American \njobs. We have also included provisions that Senator Snowe and Senator \nLandrieu have included from the Small Business Committee that will \nincrease the SBA's ability to assist American companies--small American \nbusinesses. They have done this successfully. With these provisions, \nthey can do more. Our bill actually does help with jobs--jobs here in \nthe United States.\n  One of the premises behind this House legislation is if we \nderegulate, the jobs will come right back. Where have we heard that \nbefore? All through the 2000s: Just deregulate. Those investment banks \nsuch as Lehman don't need regulations. Just give them a lot of leverage \nand let them run. And they ran--right off the cliff. We don't want to \nrepeat that again. We don't want to repeat the mistakes of the 1990s \nand 2000s, where we allowed analysts of securities to recommend \nsecurities sold by their own investment banking firm. Those provisions \nare included in the House bill. That is going to undermine the markets.\n  We should learn from the facts. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport the Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment as a base text. We can make \nimprovements on that. We can send a bill--we hope very quickly in \ncollaboration with the House--to the President that not only stimulates \ncapital formation but also protects investors. We can send a bill that \nlearns from the lessons of the last 20 years where, in the guise of \nderegulation, in the hope for job creation, we saw the greatest \nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression. We don't want to see this \nhappen again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1823-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a defining moment for the Senate \nin a couple of ways. The Democratic Senators have an alternative to the \nHouse-passed JOBS bill that will get a vote on their alternative. That \nis good. I believe the House-passed JOBS bill had overwhelming \nbipartisan support. It is a good document. I will support that version \nover my Senate Democratic colleagues. But let me tell you what our \nSenate Democratic colleagues have done that I think is very \nconstructive.\n  Ex-Im Bank is trying to be made part of the JOBS bill in the Senate. \nThis Export-Import Bank, what does this mean? This is a financing \nability by American companies that are selling overseas in volatile or \nemerging markets. It is a financing system that has\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\nbeen available since 1934. If you are going to try to sell a product \nmade in America to a place in the world where traditional banking is \nhard to obtain, you can go to the Ex-Im Bank and they will give a \nletter of credit, they will sometimes give a direct loan to people who \nwant to buy American products. The bank itself made $3.5 billion for \nthe taxpayer I think since 2005 and 2006.\n  Here is the reality: Every country we compete with has their version \nof Ex-Im Bank. We financed $32 billion worth of American-made products \nsold overseas through our Ex-Im system last year. Canada, one-tenth our \nsize, financed $100 billion. France has three Ex-Im Banks. China has \nmore Ex-Im activity than the United States, France, and Germany \ncombined. Every country American manufacturing competes with that \nproduces products has their version of Ex-Im Bank.\n  At the end of May, our Ex-Im Bank's authorization runs out. Our loan \nlimits run out a few weeks earlier. This would be devastating. Small \ncompanies throughout this country depend on the Ex-Im Bank in order to \nsell American-made products overseas.\n  Let me give you one good example that has been the topic of \nconversation. Boeing Aircraft makes airplanes in America, the 787 \nDreamliner. It was voted the best new airplane in a long time here \nrecently, something that Boeing is proud of. They make it in Washington \nand now in South Carolina. The first airplane to be made in South \nCarolina will roll out in about a month from now. The facility is under \nbudget and ahead of schedule, and we are proud of that airplane.\n  Eight out of the 10 airplanes being made in South Carolina in the \nfirst year were Ex-Im financed. There was a deal between Boeing and Air \nIndia where a letter of credit was issued by Ex-Im Bank to allow \ntraditional financing to occur, and Boeing was able to sell a big order \nof American-made jets to Air India. That is just one example.\n  GE makes gas turbines to generate power for emerging areas such as \nAfghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East, Africa. All these distressed areas \nare going to grow and they are going to need power. One-third of the \nsales coming out of Greenville, SC, for the gas turbines made in \nAmerica and creating American jobs goes through Ex-Im financing.\n  Here is the issue. If America allows our Ex-Im financing system to go \naway in May, if that is the will of the Congress, then you have \ndestroyed the ability of many companies in this country to grow their \nbusiness. As the economy has been weak and stagnant here at home, here \nis the good news: In terms of exports, we have increased our export \nsales 20 percent.\n  Imagine an America that could not continue to increase export sales. \nImagine a Boeing manufacturer that could never sell an American-made \nairplane in a volatile or emerging market because China is now making \nairplanes and Airbus has access to three or four Ex-Im Banks. It would \nbe an ill-conceived idea. This program has been around a long time. It \nhas helped create thousands of jobs in the United States. Everybody we \ncompete with has a more aggressive form of Ex-Im financing than we do.\n  To my colleagues who want to eliminate this, I don't understand how \nAmerican business could ever successfully compete in these emerging \nmarkets if we unilaterally disarm.\n  To my Democratic colleagues, thank you for bringing up Ex-Im Bank. To \nour majority leader, Senator Reid, this is a good idea. What is a bad \nidea is to not let anybody on the Republican side offer one amendment \nto this bill. Some of the ideas to reform Ex-Im Bank I would agree to. \nI think any organization, any entity, can be made better. I want to be \nable to get back to being in a body called the United States Senate, \nwhere people with different ideas on important topics can actually \nvote.\n  To my colleagues on this side, I may vigorously oppose some of you \nwho decide the Export-Import Bank should go away because I think that \nwould be the worst thing you could do for the American economy, \nparticularly export jobs being created in this country, and it would be \nunilaterally surrendering in the world marketplace. Whether you like it \nor not, other countries are Export-Import Bank on steroids. If we just \nget out of this business, companies like Boeing will be unable to sell \ntheir airplanes, and you will shut down facilities such as those in \nSouth Carolina--not a very good idea.\n  At the end of the day, you do have a right to have your say, and we \nwill have the debate and I am looking forward to the debate about what \nwe should or should not do. But under the process we have now, not one \namendment can be offered on our side. We have to do better. We had a \ntransportation bill pass with 74 votes. We have had a good exchange \nhere lately with judges. I am very proud of what our minority and \nmajority leader worked out on judges.\n  I want to get the Senate back to being the Senate. I think Ex-Im \nreauthorization should be an integral part of any jobs bill. I want to \nput it in the Senate bill. I will gladly vote for it. There are a bunch \nof Republicans over here who will support extension of Ex-Im financing \nwith reforms, but none of us want to be put in a situation where our \ncolleagues cannot have a say where they disagree with us or that we \ncannot reform the bill. That is not the way to go.\n  I hope that between now and 4 o'clock, the minority leader and the \nmajority leader can find a way to bring up the JOBS bill, allowing it \nto be amended in an appropriate way and taking votes some of us don't \nlike, but it is part of democracy--have a robust debate on a jobs \npackage that could not come at a better time, and include in that \ndebate Ex-Im reauthorization at a time when America needs more jobs \nhere at home.\n  The economy here at home is weak. The one good thing about what is \nhappening here at home is that our export sales have gone up. The way \nto create export jobs in America is to allow American businesses to \ncompete on a level playing field throughout the world. I wish the world \nwere different. I wish we had completely free markets. Every American \nbusiness could do fine in that world, but that is not the way it is.\n  The Ex-Im Bank doesn't cost the taxpayers one dime. It makes money \nfor the Treasury, and it allows American companies to make money. It \nallows American businesses to be competitive.\n  I am urging the two leaders of the Senate to allow a jobs bill to \ncome forward, let us have our say, have our differences, let's vote, \nlet's amend, and let's create jobs in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1824-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my strong \ndisappointment with the so-called small business legislation passed by \nthe House of Representatives which is now coming before the Senate this \nafternoon for a cloture vote and to express my support for the \nsubstitute amendment offered by Senators Reed of\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\nRhode Island, Levin, Landrieu, and others, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Quite simply, there is a right way and a wrong way to address some of \nthe legitimate concerns about the ability of small businesses to access \ncapital. Unfortunately, the House bill is completely the wrong \napproach. In the name of helping small business, the bill takes a meat \nax to the very investor protection laws that have allowed our capital \nmarkets to flourish.\n  On Sunday, March 11, the New York Times published an editorial about \nthe House bill titled ``They Have Very Short Memories.'' This title \ncould not be any more appropriate because in the wake of the dot-com \nbubble, the Enron corporate accounting scandal, and the 2008 financial \ncrisis, advocates of this bill must have very short memories indeed.\n  The idea that this is the right time to further weaken regulations on \nWall Street is simply unconscionable. As we are continuing to dig out \nof the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, which has \nbrought so much pain to hard-working middle-class families, the idea \nthat the solution to what ails our economy is to further deregulate the \nfinancial sector and to open the door for fraud and abuse simply makes \nno sense.\n  According to a recent report from the Center on Retirement Security \nat Boston College, financial scams against seniors enabled by the \nInternet are already on the rise. For this reason, AARP wrote that \ntheir ``primary concern is that these bills . . . inadequately protect \nagainst the potential harmful impact on investor protections and market \nintegrity.''\n  Even more, the North American Securities Administrators Association--\nthis is the organization of State securities regulators--said of the \nHouse-passed bill:\n\n       By placing unnecessary limits on the ability of State \n     security regulators to protect retail investors from the \n     risks associated with smaller, speculative investments, \n     Congress is poised to enact policies intended to strengthen \n     the economy that will likely have precisely the opposite \n     effect.\n\n  ``Precisely the opposite effect''--that is from the North American \nSecurities Administrators Association. Who are we listening to around \nhere anyway?\n  Supporting that view, the AFL CIO wrote to Congress that ``while the \nproponents of the 'capital formation' bills claimed they would promote \njobs . . . they would actually have the perverse effect of raising the \ncost of capital for all companies by increasing the risk of fraud.''\n\n  Passing the House bill would be a terrible mistake. I remember well \nthe last time we rushed to deregulate the financial sector in the name \nof creating jobs. I was here in the Senate then. It was in the late \n1990s when we passed a bill to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act that was \nenacted during the Great Depression.\n  What happened was Glass-Steagall said: If you are an investment bank, \nyou can be an investment bank. If you are a commercial bank, you are a \ncommercial bank. If you are an insurance company, you are an insurance \ncompany. But if you are an investment bank, you can't sell insurance. \nIf you are an insurance company, you can't be an investment bank and \nyou can't be in commercial banking.\n  That worked well for over half a century in our country. During the \nboom years of the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, into the 1980s, this \nworked well for our country. All of a sudden, Wall Street got together \nand said: Wouldn't it be great if we could break down these walls and \nput this all together? And they came to Congress in the 1990s and put \ntogether a bill to get rid of this Glass-Steagall protection.\n  Then what happened? These huge financial companies, such as Citigroup \nand AIG, sort of sprung up because now they have insurance--AIG--AIG \nnow becomes a commercial bank and it becomes an investment bank. They \nget larger and larger, and they get reckless. They take irresponsible \nrisks because while they might have known about insurance, they didn't \nreally know about investment banking. Investment banking may have known \nabout investment banking, but they didn't know a heck of lot about \ninsurance or commercial banking. So we got into this huge irresponsible \nfinancial structure, and it plunged the global economy into the worst \nfinancial crisis in generations.\n  I am proud of the fact that I was one of only eight Senators to vote \nagainst the deregulation of Glass-Steagall. I tell you, this bill \nreminds me so much of that. It was ``follow the crowd.'' Everybody was \nfor it. President Clinton was for it. Secretary Rubin was for \nderegulating Glass-Steagall. Larry Summers--I don't know whether he was \nwith the national Council of Economic Advisers at that time--was for \nit. Republicans were for it. And it just went through here like greased \nlightning. Wall Street was for it. Glass-Steagall was old, don't you \nsee. That was old stuff back from the Depression. We needed something \nnew, a new regime out there. As I said, I was one of eight who voted \nagainst it, and I spoke against it here on the floor at the time. I \nsaid: We are going to regret this. And, boy, did we ever learn to \nregret what we did in deregulating Glass-Steagall.\n  I bring this up because Simon Johnson, the former Chief Economist at \nthe International Monetary Fund, the IMF, recently wrote:\n\n       With the so-called jobs bill, Congress is about to make the \n     same kind of mistake again as in the repeal of the Glass-\n     Steagall Act.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to take these words seriously. Unless we do this \nin the right way, future Members of the Senate will be standing right \nhere lamenting the fact of what we did in a hurry to follow the crowd.\n  Fortunately, there is an alternative way to make the reforms that are \nnecessary to allow small businesses to grow without jeopardizing our \nfinancial markets and hurting consumers.\n  SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro wrote in a March 13 letter to Senators \nJohnson and Shelby:\n\n       I believe there are provisions that should be added or \n     modified to improve investor protections that are worthy of \n     the Senate's consideration.\n\n  The substitute amendment offered by Senators Reed, Levin, and \nLandrieu includes these important reform provisions. Let me list a few \nof the things the substitute amendment would do.\n  First, the House bill would allow companies to advertise risky, less \nregulated, unregistered private offerings to the general public using \nbillboards along the highway, cold calls to senior living centers, or \nother mass-marketing methods.\n  Do you know what this means? Let's say an elderly person is living in \na senior living center or maybe going there for recreation. All of a \nsudden they are in a room and a lecture is given to them about how they \ncan take their 401(k) money--maybe they have $100,000--you can take \nsome of your 401(k) and put it into this small startup, and, guess \nwhat, it is going to be like the beginning of Apple Computers or it is \ngoing to be the beginning of Microsoft. This is a small company. If you \njust invested a few hundred dollars, why, you can quadruple your money, \nprobably, in 4 or 5 years.\n  That is what they can do under the House bill. They can come in with \ncold calls--anything. The Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment would allow \nfirms to advertise only to investors with appropriate resources and \nsophistication to bear the risks.\n  The House bill would tear down protections put in place after the \nlate-1990s Internet stock bubble burst that prevented conflicts of \ninterest from tainting the quality of the research about companies. We \nknow researchers were involved with the investment bankers doing the \ninitial public offering. They were given all this stuff about how great \nthis was and how much money it was going to make in a short period of \ntime.\n  What we need is a firewall to keep the investment bankers separate \nfrom the researchers. That is what Reed-Landrieu-Levin would do, so \nthere is no conflict of interest there.\n  The House bill would allow very large companies with up to $1 billion \nin revenues to offer stock to the public, yet avoid financial \ntransparency and auditing requirements designed to ensure they are not \ncooking the books.\n  The Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment would ensure that essential \ninvestor protections apply to large companies by lowering the \nexemptions to companies with less than $350 million in revenues. That \nnumber actually came from the SEC, as sort of a reasonable amount--not \n$1 billion. That would allow huge companies to not\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\nhave to have the auditing requirements, for example, that the SEC \nrequires, or the financial transparency. Think about preying on the \npublic with that. We are a big company. We have up to $1 billion in \nrevenues. You don't have to worry about this. You can invest your money \nhere, and don't worry about auditing and stuff like that, we take care \nof it ourselves. If we were doing bad things, we would not be so big, \nright? How many times have we heard that before?\n  The House bill will allow unregulated Web sites to peddle stocks to \nordinary investors without any meaningful oversight or liability, which \ncould give rise to fraud, money laundering, and other risks. That is \nwhat is called crowdfunding.\n  We keep hearing this word ``crowdfunding.'' Whenever I hear that \nword, I get a little nervous. Whenever the crowd is moving in one \ndirection, you want to ask questions: What is moving the crowd? Why is \nthe crowd moving in that direction? Crowdfunding? The Reed-Landrieu-\nLevin amendment would protect the integrity of these markets by \nensuring that the Web site intermediaries are subject to appropriate \nlevels of oversight. Think about this: Unregulated Web sites can peddle \nstocks to ordinary investors without any oversight or liability. The \nHouse bill would allow extremely large companies with tens of thousands \nof shareholders to evade the Securities and Exchange Commission \noversight. Let me repeat that. The House bill would allow extremely \nlarge companies with tens of thousands of shareholders to evade SEC \noversight. The Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment would ensure that banks \nand other large companies with lots of shareholders are subject to the \nbasic transparency, integrity, and accountability protections.\n\n  Right now, under SEC law, if you have over 500 shareholders, you have \nto go public. And when you go public, you have to be subject to \naccounting principles, oversight, and transparency by the SEC. The bill \nraises that to 2,000 shareholders. Yet they can go out there and--I \ndon't know what Facebook has right now, but I don't think they have \n2,000 shareholders; maybe, but I don't know. Let's say they have 1,000 \nor 1,200 shareholders. They can get by without having any real SEC \noversight as long as they have less than 2,000 shareholders. Should \nthat be allowed in this economy with all that we know, with what has \ngone on in the recent past?\n  In sum, the substitute amendment is vastly better than the House-\npassed legislation. It protects investors, it protects consumers, it \nprotects our capital markets that allow small businesses to grow. So \nlet's heed the lesson of the last decade; let's take a step back; let's \npause before rushing to deregulate our economy and Wall Street even \nfurther. Previous acts of Congress to deregulate our markets in the \nhope of spurring economic growth may have helped Wall Street, and a lot \nof people in the last 10 years made a lot of money on Wall Street. You \nknow what. They still have their money. They have taken that money and \nthey bought other things, and now they are sitting pretty. Yet \nhomeowners and average ordinary Americans have lost their shirts in \nthis economy in the last 10 years. But the people who engineered these \nnew devices, these new kinds of derivatives, who worked to do away with \nGlass-Steagall, made a lot of money on Wall Street.\n  I can tell you that if the bill passes without the Reed-Landrieu-\nLevin amendment, you are going to see a new flourish of activity on \nWall Street. A lot of Wall Street bankers and a lot of people will make \na lot more money. And you know what. A few years from now we are going \nto hear all kinds of stories about elderly people or people about to \nretire who have 401(k)s who got sucked into investing someplace without \nany real knowledge of what the business was, not to mention other \npeople who maybe went on their Web site and were lured into investing a \nfew dollars--$100, $200, $500. You say, well, they lost it. They didn't \nlose much. But if you add that up, it is thousands and thousands of \nAmericans. It may be a small loss to each individual person, but the \nmoney gained by this so-called startup company--that may go under in a \nyear or less--the people who started the company walk away with the \nmoney. We are going to be hearing stories about that in the next 5 to \n10 years if this bill passes.\n  Again, Wall Street made out like bandits in the last 10 years, but \nfor the rest of America it was the worst economic crisis in \ngenerations.\n  I close by saying the Senate should not follow the crowd. The House \nrushed this through without any real due diligence, but isn't the \npurpose of the Senate to cool and slow it down? Let's take a close look \nat it.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the House measure and support the \nsubstitute amendment when it comes to the floor later today for a vote. \nLet's not repeat the mistakes of the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senator Harkin \nfor his excellent statement and, as usual, his very good judgment on an \nissue that the Senate is going to be voting on at 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. \ntoday as opposed to 20 minutes from now, because this issue needs more \ndebate, and the Senator from Iowa raised some very important questions \nthat need to be answered. I want to start by thanking the Senator for \nraising the issues that are so important for us as we consider this \nHouse bill that was--in your words, and I will add--rushed over to the \nSenate.\n  I spoke to Barney Frank yesterday, a very respected Democratic \nMember, and he assured me we were actually doing the right thing by \nslowing this down.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague from Louisiana for her leadership on \nthis issue. We are all busy around here. We have our issues that we \nlook at. I have other issues in my committee that I am so focused on \nnow that I had not really paid attention to this until the Senator from \nLouisiana brought it up last week, and then I began to ask myself: What \nis this all about? The more I looked into it, the more devastating I \nfound this piece of legislation that came from the House.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for having the foresight, courage, \nand determination to make sure we are all aware of what this \nlegislation does. And, quite frankly, I commend the Senator from \nLouisiana for slowing this down. Since last week, I have talked to \nother Senators who had not really focused on it either. We have other \nresponsibilities and duties, but the Chair of the Small Business \nCommittee focused on this, and I thank the Chair for her great \nleadership on this issue. I hope we can adopt the substitute amendment \nto this bill later today.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Through the Chair, I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  I also recognize the Senator from Oregon, who is on the floor, who \nhas had such an impact on helping us to focus on the details of this \nbill that was rammed through the House and was on a fast track to get \napproved over here. As I have said many times, I am not opposed to the \nunderlying concepts of this bill, which will broaden the opportunity \nfor average people to have some excellent opportunities for investments \nto help them increase wealth. We on our side of the aisle are not \nopposed to increasing wealth. We want to make sure that basic investor \nprotections are in the bill, and they are absent from the House bill.\n  We are not talking about mom-and-pop operations when you are talking \nabout companies with revenues of $1 billion. The Senator from Iowa is \nwell aware, as is the Senator from Oregon, of mom-and-pop operations. \nWe have them in our States. We have mom-and-pop farmers, office supply \ncompanies, shoe repair companies, even substantial businesses. There \nare families who own three and four and five restaurants. We are very \nfamiliar with that. But under no circumstance would those companies \nmeet the $1 billion in sales, so we are not talking about small \nbusiness. That is why, as the Chair of Small Business, I am here to say \nthere is nothing small about this bill. This is about big business \ngetting out from underneath regulations that we spent decades trying to \nput into place for good reason.\n\n  Did we not just have a financial meltdown on Wall Street? Did I miss \na chapter in this saga? Didn't we just pull ourselves up from the brink \nof international financial collapse started not by Korea, not by Japan, \nnot by\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\nChina, but by the United States of America with our inability to \nproperly regulate our financial system? Didn't we just almost bring the \nworld economy to a halt? Did I miss this? So this little innocuous bill \nflies over here from the House with a fancy name talking about jobs, \nand because we are all desperate to create more jobs--we understand our \npeople need more jobs. We understand that government has a role in \ncreating jobs, of course, with the private sector. We know that the \npolicies we drive here, whether it is tax policy or regulatory policy \nor whether we say this is legal and this isn't, have a real impact on \njob creation. We look at the title of the bill, it says jobs, and we \ncannot wait to vote for it. But if we are not careful and we pass the \nHouse bill on this subject without an amendment, it will not create \njobs, it will kill jobs.\n  As the Chair of the Small Business Committee, I have to say I don't \nthink any Member has stood on this floor longer or spoken more directly \nto the issue of getting capital into the hands of business than I have. \nSo I hope I have developed, on both sides of the aisle, some \ncredibility to say: Yes, we want to open capital opportunities to \nbusiness, but we must have investor protections. If not, we will set \nourselves backward several decades as opposed to forward, and that is \nnot what we want to do.\n  I rise to urge Members to consider voting for the substitute that \nSenator Reed, the ranking member on banking, Senator Levin, the \nchairman of the investigative committee who has done extraordinary work \nrooting out fraud and corruption, a long-serving, well-respected member \nof this caucus--obviously the senior Senator from Michigan is more \nconcerned about jobs than any of us. He has lost more jobs--well, \nprobably per capita except potentially for the State of California. So \nwhy would he be joining us in opposing a jobs bill? Because he knows \nwhat I know, what Senator Reed knows, what Senator Merkley knows, what \nSenator Harkin knows--and those who have taken the time to review the \nbill--that on its surface it looks good, but even the Chair of the SEC \nhas cautioned us not to vote for the bill as it stands, and also says \nit can be fixed. It can be amended, but we need to oppose cloture so we \ndon't end the debate but we begin the debate and then get to a position \nwhich the leadership can most certainly get us to where appropriate \namendments could be offered.\n  I am saying: Please don't let the word ``jobs'' in the House bill--\nwhich sounds so enticing--fool you. In reality this is less about job \ncreation than it is about rolling back key protections for investors. \nUnfortunately, I have to say that I think there is a little election \nyear politics at play from both the White House's perspective and the \nRepublican caucus that saw this as a good way to position themselves \nfor the election.\n  Look, I have been guilty of doing that myself. Nobody is perfect \naround here, but there is a time when you do something like that that \nit is called to your attention and you say: I am sorry, I shouldn't \nhave done it, and this is the right way to go. And that is what we need \nto do now.\n  As Sir Francis Bacon said over 400 years ago: Knowledge is power. The \nmore knowledge we have about this bill will give us the power to \nadvocate against it.\n  I am here again to tell my colleagues the more you will learn about \nthis runaway freight train, the more red flags are being waved. Red \nflags are waving because of the unintended consequences of the House \nbill for investors, small businesses, and our economy in general. That \nis why Senator Jack Reed, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Merkley, and \nothers have been down here now for days encouraging Senators to review \nthe bill, go back and talk with your staff. Please allow us some time \nto make some serious changes.\n  Now, even if my colleagues can't believe me on these issues, I most \ncertainly hope my colleagues can believe the Bloomberg report. The \nBloomberg report comments that have been made--Bloomberg is a very \nwidely read, very reputable wire service and newspaper now, and, of \ncourse, they have other interests as well that comment daily on the \nfinancial markets of the world. It is one of the most respected \nsources. They have basically editorialized against the House bill.\n  Why would they do that? Let me read my colleagues what the Bloomberg \neditorial said a few days ago. They said:\n\n       [T]he JOBS Act simply goes too far. It would gut many of \n     the investor protections established just a decade ago in \n     Sarbanes-Oxley. A wave of accounting scandals--think Enron \n     and WorldCom--have destroyed the nest eggs of millions of \n     Americans and upended investor confidence in Wall Street. The \n     relief would extend beyond small businesses and apply to more \n     than 90 percent of companies that go public.\n\n  At a time when we are trying to build investor confidence, to build \nour economy, and to create jobs, we are about ready to exempt 90 \npercent of the companies that are going public from full disclosure? I \nam the sponsor of the amendment that tried to exempt small companies \nfrom these regulations--companies of $50 million or $100 million in \nsales. That would cover every mom and pop known to man. But the House \nbill exempts companies up to $1 billion in revenues from full public \ndisclosure. Is this what we want to do at a time when we are just \nregaining investor confidence? I don't think so.\n  Bloomberg says to put on the brakes:\n\n       At the center of the package is a new class of emerging \n     growth companies, defined as those with as much as $1 billion \n     in annual revenue, which would be exempt from a host of \n     disclosure, reporting and governance rules. These companies \n     would be able to operate up to 5 years without an independent \n     test of their internal controls--the checks and balances that \n     help companies prevent outright fraud and costly accounting \n     mistakes.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Emerging companies would also be able to promote public \n     offerings with less-than-complete information by ``testing \n     the waters'' with fancy PowerPoint slides and other pre-IPO \n     materials. Executives wouldn't be held accountable for any \n     misrepresentations.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, what are we thinking? We are not. We have to \nput on our thinking caps. Let's amend this House bill.\n  The bill from the House did not even go through our Banking \nCommittee. Had the bill gone through the Banking Committee, had it been \nunder the watchful eye of some of our Democrats and Republicans on the \nBanking Committee, and had the bill come out of the Banking Committee \nwith a Democratic and Republican vote--or even with the majority of \nRepublicans and one or two or three Democrats--this Senator would not \nbe standing here because this is not my jurisdiction. I am not on the \nBanking Committee. I am the chair of the Small Business Committee. I \nwould honor the work of the Banking Committee, and I would have simply \nsaid I don't necessarily agree with the bill; I will just vote no. But \nthe bill didn't even go through the Banking Committee. It just flew \nright here to the Senate floor because somebody wants a bumper sticker \nfor their next campaign.\n  AARP doesn't think the bumper sticker is a good one because they have \ncome out against it because many of the people who got their bank \naccounts down to zero were the elderly, the people who can least afford \nthis kind of scam and fraud on Wall Street, let alone on Main Street. \nThey are the ones who saw their 401(k)s go down from $300,000, which \ntook them their whole lives to save, to $50,000. How do we think they \nfeel? That is why AARP has come out against the House bill.\n  I am sure there are some people saying this is just Democrats wanting \nto regulate everything and not allow capitalism to thrive. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. I have spent my whole time trying to \ncreate jobs and opportunity for small businesses in America that \nrepresent 27 million businesses, and 20 million of them are independent \noperators and 7 million are classified as small businesses below 500 \nemployees. I know them pretty well. I have worked with them very \nclosely. Many of them are Main Street alliances against this bill, \nsmall business alliances, and the chamber of commerce has even \nexpressed some concern about the House bill.\n  We are creating jobs. This is what the President inherited: a \nfreefall of job loss in this Nation. This is what he inherited when he \nbecame President in the early part of 2009. He was elected in 2008, but \nhe didn't take office until January 2009. He walked to the captain's \nchair and sat down after the ship had hit the iceberg, not before. He \nhas\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\nbattled with us mightily to move these numbers to where we can see jobs \nbeing created. The last thing we need to do is to stop this, and the \nHouse bill, without investor protections, absolutely has the \npossibility of doing just that.\n  Time and time again, I have stood right here on the Senate floor \nfighting with my colleagues to increase access to capital for America's \njob creators. I support adding capital and directing it or helping it \nto be directed to better places, to make the process more democratic.\n  I understand the system has been basically set up for those who go to \nthe high and mighty Ivy League schools, who join the same clubs, whose \nfamilies socialize together for years and years. I understand the rules \nhave been written for that group. I would like to write them for \neveryone, and I am attempting to do that. But we have to write and \nexpand those rules with the right protections, and they are not present \nin the House bill.\n  I am a Democrat who used to love what President Clinton would say: \nOur job is to create more millionaires in America, not less. I am proud \nof the book ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' which says most millionaires \nin America aren't people who inherited their money but people who \nworked hard for it because of our system. I am proud of that. I have \nspent my life helping to build it. I am for people getting rich, for \npeople making money. But we have to write these rules fairly or it is \nthe poor people, it is the middle class, it is the people who didn't go \nto the Ivy League schools who don't have the right insider information \nwho are going to be led down the Primrose path.\n  So let's be careful. Let's not support the House bill as it has come \nover here. We scrambled--and I mean the word ``scrambled''--last week \nto try to put a substitute together, and that substitute has my name on \nit. It has Senator Jack Reed first, my name second, Senator Levin \nthird, and a group of others who have joined us.\n  Our substitute is not perfect either. I hope our substitute can get \n60 votes and that we can amend a few things the SEC has brought to our \nattention since we were kind of on a tight timeframe to get something \nto the leadership. I would rather be more careful with the work I \nsubmit to the Senate, but we were under a tight timeframe, and even our \nbill has to be amended.\n  I am asking my colleagues, if they can't vote for our bill, which is \nthe substitute bill, then please do not provide cloture to the House \nbill either. Let's take a few days. We are not asking for weeks. I am \nnot even trying to kill the House bill. I am simply trying to amend it \nso it works for people who can't go to Harvard and can't go to Stanford \nand can't go to some of these Ivy League schools; that it works for \npeople who are going to some community colleges and to schools in their \nStates, middle-class families who want to participate in the great \nAmerican dream and would like to invest in these new rules and \nregulations on the Internet, to invest in companies that have \npotential. But, please, let's give them, the investor, protections they \ndeserve.\n  One more thing and I will turn it over to the Senator from Oregon. I \nwish to say this to the community bankers: You may have some others who \nsupport you on this floor, but I don't think you have anybody who does \nas strongly as I support community bankers. There is a provision in \nthis bill that expands your shareholders from the cap of 500 \nshareholders that was put there in 1960. In our bill, the substitute, \nwe move it up to 750 shareholders. I am willing to go back up to the \nHouse number of 2,000 because banks are regulated. They are \noverregulated community banks, in my view. So I am willing to extend \nthat to 2,000 shareholders.\n  Barney Frank agrees with that. I have talked to Senate Democrats, and \nthey agree with that. Please don't put your political might in \nsupporting the House bill just because you have your number in there \nthat you want because you will, in my view, undermine investor \nconfidence in this new way we are trying to help people, called \ncrowdfunding on the Internet. We will take care of your issue. I have \nit in my sights. I know it is important to you, and if you give us time \nwe can try to fix that.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for joining me. He is truly an expert \non this particular subject, and he can add some more detail to what I \nhave tried to explain, and we will be happy to answer any questions our \ncolleagues have about this underlying issue which is so important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to give \nserious consideration to a major piece of legislation that is a \ncrowdfunding amendment introduced by Senator Bennet and myself and has \nthe support of Senator Landrieu, Senator Brown, and a number of others. \nI thank Senator Landrieu for the points she has been making and for her \nfierce advocacy for creating a highway for Americans to build wealth \nwithout creating avenues that essentially send people into either blind \nalleys or over a cliff.\n  That is what this conversation is all about today. We want to enable \naspiring entrepreneurs to access capital and to do so in ways that \nallow new opportunities to create, but to make sure investors have the \ninformation they need to make reasonable choices.\n  The amendment I am introducing specifically is a crowdfunding \namendment. My colleagues have probably heard this term a number of \ntimes. It enables aspiring entrepreneurs to access investment capital \nvia the Internet from small dollar investors across America. This is \nvery exciting stuff. We have seen some similar Internet models. One \nmodel, for example, enables individuals across America to look at \nprojects--projects for art and civics, projects across the country--and \nsay: Yes, I want to make a small dollar investment--which is truly, in \nthis case, a donation--to that social project, to that art project. \nSuch a site is kickstarter.com. So on the site is a list of projects, \nand then people can go in and decide what they want to support to help \nmake it happen. Whereas in the past, someone who wanted to do a \ndocumentary film might have had to seek out some substantial dollars, \nsome large dollar funders, now they can go to kickstarter.com, present \ntheir project, and possibly raise the capital they need from thousands \nof small dollar donors.\n  For instance, in 2010, a filmmaker raised $345,000 to make a \ndocumentary about jazz from a pool of 3,000 donors, most of whom \ndonated $100 or less. We also have peer-to-peer lending on the Internet \nwhere folks can say this is what they would like to borrow money for, \nand people can get on and say, yes, they will lend that money.\n  But what we do not have is a process in which companies can list \nthemselves on the Internet and say: Do you want to invest in my \ncompany? Here is my dream. I am going to make a better coffee shop. I \nam going to make a small wedding cake company. Do you want to invest in \nmy vision, in my dream? Here are the details.\n  Folks can get on and join and help create that startup capital or \ncreate the capital for a small business to expand.\n  So that is what crowdfunding is. It is parallel to these other \nefforts. What we have in the House bill is basically a provision which \nsays: No rules. Do whatever you want.\n  Now, unfortunately, that does not work. It does not work because if \nwe do not require the company to give information about their company, \nif we do not provide rules that require accountability for the accuracy \nof that information, then what we are simply doing is saying here is a \nWeb site where predators can put up a fictitious story about what they \nwant to do, make it as exciting as possible, and run away with people's \nmoney--no consequences; pay themselves a salary, dump out the money. \nThe House bill requires no information. If folks do put up information, \nit does not require that information to be accurate. It legalizes \npredatory scams. It says people can list and close in a single day.\n  So for those who say: Well, information will get out in some kind of \nmiraculous manner, there will not be the time to get it out because a \npredator can put up their false story, collect the donations, close the \ninvestment in a single day, and walk away, having scammed thousands of \nAmericans out of their hard-earned cash. So we need basic rules of the \nroad.\n  The possibility for capital formation through the Internet through\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\ncrowdfunding is enormous. In 2011, Americans had invested $17 trillion \nin retirement funds. Imagine if 1 percent of those investments went \ninto crowdfunding. The result would be $170 billion of investment in \nour startups and small businesses. That is extraordinarily powerful--\nmore powerful than loans to small businesses across this country. So it \nhas huge potential.\n  So a small business or startup company would provide basic financial \ninformation and vouch for the accuracy of this information. The company \nwould explain its vision of how it is going to invest that money. The \nprojects might range from small- to medium-sized. A small wedding cake \ncompany might want to buy an industrial oven. Another company might \nwant to seek a new manufacturing line. And the crowd--that is all of \nus--surfing the Internet would visit the portal, review the financials, \nreview the vision, and say: I want to be part of that, I am going to \ninvest, and here is the percent of the company I get in return.\n  The key to this is that the companies provide accurate information; \notherwise, as I have described, we simply pave the path for predatory \ntactics. That would destroy the reputation of crowdfunding. That would \ndestroy the ability to create a powerful capital formation market \nthrough the Internet.\n  The amendment we are presenting does three things: It streamlines the \nprocess for setting up a crowdfunding portal; it streamlines the \nprocess for companies to list themselves on that portal; and it \nprovides basic investor protections, the most important of which is to \nprovide basic information about the company and for the company's \nofficers and directors to ensure the accuracy of that information.\n  Let's examine each of the three of these in turn. First, the \nstreamlined registration for Web sites that offer crowdfunding. Our \namendment provides two pathways: The first pathway is for a portal to \nregister as a broker-dealer. The second is a streamlined funding portal \nregistration. These portals agree to provide a neutral market \nenvironment; that is, they do not solicit purchases, they do not offer \ninvestment advice, and they do not handle investor funds. They operate \na marketplace, much as the New York Stock Exchange operates a \nmarketplace without recommending particular stocks.\n  It also creates a unified national framework; otherwise, the portal \nwould have to deal with rules from 50 States. That is an untenable \nstructure. So we create a unified national structure for a portal to \nthrive in.\n  Now, turning to the second piece, which is the streamlined process \nfor companies to register, the amendment allows existing small \nbusinesses and startup companies to raise up to $1 million per year. \nThat is a substantial amount for a small business. It also provides \nflexibility in how a company would do this. A company could basically \nsay: Here is our target. If the target is met, the investment closes.\n  So if they say: I am seeking $550,000 to do X, when Americans across \nthe country have put forward enough small investments to reach that \ngoal of $550,000, the investment would close. But it also allows, if \ninvestors decide they are offering more--maybe folks sign up, and they \nare so excited about this vision, this product, this invention, this \nstrategy, that they say: I am putting up $750,000, even though you only \nasked for $550,000--it would still enable the small company to say: No, \nwe can use that extra $200,000, thank you very much, if they should \nchoose to do so.\n  It also provides a very important provision so the small investors do \nnot count against the shareholder number that drives companies to have \nto become a fully public company. That is critical and interrelates \nwith other parts of the crowd formation bill before us.\n  Then, turning to the third area, basic rules of the road to protect \ninvestors and ensure the accuracy of information companies post, \ncompanies participating in this marketplace must disclose their basic \nfinancial information: a business plan, a target offering amount, and \nthe intended use.\n  The Web sites are subject to oversight by the SEC and security \nregulators of their principal States. There are aggregate annual caps. \nThis is a key predatory protection to prevent pump-and-dump schemes. If \nyou have seen the movie ``Boiler Room,'' you will know what I am \ntalking about, where folks were set to pump up a stock, and the only \nfolks trading it were those who kind of received special information. \nThen, as soon as they invested--normally they are investing, buying the \nstock owned by the folks who are doing the pumping--the whole thing \ncollapsed afterwards and their investment was worthless.\n  So this is an essential part of making sure we establish a \nresponsible marketplace that will succeed in being a foundation for \ncapital formation.\n  Also, we get rid of this 1-day, list-and-close process. So there is a \n21-day period--a very small amount of time in the course of raising \ncapital to create a startup or to advance a small business--21 days, \nwhich allows for the opportunity for the sort of oversight that a \nportal can provide or the SEC can provide to stop known bad actors and \nfraudsters.\n  Finally, the officers and directors are accountable for the accuracy \nof the information. This is essential. Without this sort of \naccountability, every fraudster out there will spin out a story and try \nto raise money for their schemes. But by holding them accountable for \nthe accuracy of the information, it says to them: No, I cannot do that. \nI can be held accountable.\n  This is exactly the right balance because it provides a due diligence \nsafe harbor. It requires that any information in dispute be material. \nSo it does not put the officers and directors at risk. It simply says, \nwhen they provide material information they have to do appropriate due \ndiligence to make sure it is accurate.\n  Crowdfunding has enormous potential to bring more Americans than ever \ninto the exciting process of powering up startups and expanding small \nbusinesses. I hope in the course of the consideration of the capital \nformation bill before us, we will have a chance to present a variety of \namendments, including this crowdfunding amendment.\n  I certainly encourage my colleagues to listen very carefully to the \npoints Senator Landrieu has been making, Senator Jack Reed has been \nmaking, Senator Durbin has been making. The point is this: Let's take \nand make a powerful tool work. Let's not, however, take and destroy a \npowerful tool by opening it to all kinds of predatory schemes and \nscams.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to wrap up my comments in \nabout 5 minutes. I see the Senator from Delaware on the Senate floor. \nHe may choose to speak.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for his comments. I think it is \ntelling--very telling, actually--that this is a Tuesday afternoon at \n12:10, and normally when there is a bill that is popular on the Senate \nfloor, there are lots of people who come down to speak for it. I \nunderstand not one person yet has shown up this morning to speak for \nthe House bill we are going to be voting on today.\n  I caution the Democrats to raise your awareness. That is highly \nunusual. Usually, if a bill is well thought through and is popular and \ncan stand on its merit, there are any number of people on the floor \nspeaking for it. The only people who have come to the floor are those \nof us warning you to read the bill, to reconsider your position, to not \nbe lured by the title--JOBS bill, JOBS bill--but to read the bill and \nrealize there are some far-reaching regulation elimination portions of \nthis bill that are not going to be good for the small businesses \ndescribed by the Senator from Oregon or the small businesses we \nadvocate for, both Republicans and Democrats, on the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  Just at a time when investor confidence is increasing, where jobs are \nbeing created in the country, why would we go to such a far-reaching \nbill?\n  Let me start with statements that have been made just in the last 24 \nhours. I have quoted from Bloomberg, AARP, the chamber of commerce from \nlast week and over the weekend. Today is Tuesday. These are things that \nhave come in just in the last 24 hours.\n  Steve Pearlstein of the Washington Post from March 18:\n\n       What we also know from painful experience--from the \n     mortgage and credit bubble, from Enron, WorldCom and the tech \n     and telecom bubble, from the savings-and-loan\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\n     crisis and the junk bond scandal and generations of penny-\n     stock scandals--is that financial markets are incapable of \n     self-regulation. In fact, they are prone to just about every \n     type of market failure listed in the economics textbooks.\n\n  Regulation is necessary.\n  I am here to say we need to reduce regulations on community banks \nthat are now heavily regulated by the new Sarbanes-Oxley, by their own \nState regulators. I am approving and supporting reducing regulations to \nbankers in this important legislation. That is not the issue.\n  The issue is what the Senator from Oregon spoke about: the new \ndeveloping opportunities for the Internet to be used as a powerful tool \nto raise money for ideas, for businesses.\n  We can see this tremendous revolution occurring before our eyes. It \ndoes not mean that needs the same regulations as the old-fashioned \nfinancial models. But we do need some regulations. What we are saying \nis that the House bill goes too far.\n  Listen to what Floyd Norris of the New York Times said:\n\n       It gives some flavor of just how far the House bill goes \n     that one of the changes the three senators are pushing would \n     force a company trying to raise money from the public to show \n     investors an audited balance sheet.\n\n  One of our amendments is for investors to provide an audited balance \nsheet. In the House bill we are considering, they can provide their own \ndocumentation--not audited by anyone, made up. Then there are no \nconsequences. There are no safeguards--or very few safeguards--in the \nHouse bill.\n  I have quoted Bloomberg now many times. Again, the terrific Bloomberg \nNews editorial:\n\n       [T]he JOBS Act goes too far. It would gut many of the \n     investor protections established just a decade ago in the \n     2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law. A wave of accounting scandals--think \n     Enron and WorldCom--had destroyed the nest eggs of millions \n     of Americans and upended investor confidence in Wall Street. \n     The relief would extend beyond small businesses and apply to \n     more than 90 percent of companies that go public.\n\n  John P. Mello, Jr., wrote in PC World on March 18:\n\n       During the go-go days of the dot-com era, it was common for \n     analysts to promote IPOs being offered by their investment \n     bank masters, regardless of the worth of the offering.\n       The existing rules, which would be scrapped by the JOBS Act \n     now before the U.S. Senate, were designed to protect \n     investors from the conflicts of interest that damaged the IPO \n     market after the pop of the dot-com bubble, damage from which \n     it has only recently recovered.\n  Let's not jump back into the briar patch. We are just getting \nourselves untangled from it. What is the rush? This bill from the House \nhas not even gone through the Banking Committee. We have spent a decade \narguing about Sarbanes-Oxley. We had multiple hearings. We had multiple \ndebates on the floor. We had people come and testify, pro or con. \nWhether you are for it, it passed with lots of public debate. I know \nthere are some people who still think those regulations are too \nonerous.\n  Yes, we are trying to relax them where we can. But a blanket \nexception for companies up to $1 billion in revenue, I think that is \ngoing a little too far, a little too fast. We have senior citizens to \ngive some guidance and protection to. We have the middle class that is \nstruggling from this recession. They depend on us to set the rules of \nthe road.\n  This is not about Big Brother, Big Sister government. People have to \nmake their own choices. But when people make choices on the Internet \nbased on what looks like an official documentation, they assume someone \neither in their State capital or their National Capital has framed \nthese rules and regulations in a way that gives them a fighting chance.\n  We do not want to legalize fraud, and that is about what the House \nbill does. It legalizes pathways to fraud. That is not what we want to \ndo. How we get out of the mess we are in, I am not 100 percent sure. \nBecause we have a substitute on the floor, which is the Reed-Landrieu \nsubstitute--I plan to vote for it. If we can get 60 votes, then we can \nget on debating that bill which is a substitute to the House bill. \nPerhaps the leadership will allow us to amend our own substitute, which \nwe would be happy to do. I think we could come to some agreement within \nless than 2 days about what should be done in the Senate and then send \nthe bill back over to the House for their consideration and then on to \nthe President's desk, a bill we can all be proud of and confident we \nare trying to do the right thing with this new sort of frontier on \nInternet investing.\n  We want to support our entrepreneurs. We want to make this process \nmore democratic. We want to get out of the secret boardrooms and the \nprivate conversations on Wall Street. So many more people could take \nadvantage, appropriately, of exciting investments in the \nentrepreneurial spirit of America. Absolutely we want to do that, but \nthat is not what the House bill does.\n  So let's take our time. I am urging my colleagues, if they can vote \nfor the substitute and give us cloture on it, we promise we will be \nopen to amendments from both sides. If we do not get cloture--I see the \nSenator from Delaware--if we do not get cloture, please vote for the \nEx-Im Bank amendment, which is a proper amendment to the bill, and then \nvote no on cloture. We do not want to end this debate today.\n  Senators will be doing their constituents a great disservice to vote \non cloture on that House bill today. We need to fix it. We need to \namend it and we can. Then we will have a bill we can all be proud of \nand at least be confident we have established the right safeguards and \nthat we can be helpful to getting capital to Main Street and increasing \nopportunities for entrepreneurship in America today.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware. He has been so outspoken and comes \nwith such knowledge on these issues. I appreciate his thoughtfulness. I \nhope he will agree to join me in voting against the House bill and for \nhis support of a new crowdfunding proposal.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am glad this Chamber is focused on job \ncreation, on access to capital, on ways we can help strengthen the \nspeed and growth of high promise, startup companies. I am grateful for \nthe input and leadership of the Senator from Louisiana, for her hard \nwork in trying to make sure we pay attention to the matter that is \nbefore this body and making sure we strike the right balance between \ncontinuing to ensure investor protection, while also providing relief \nfrom regulations that may hold the promise of accelerating capital \nformation and job growth in this country.\n  When I go home to Delaware every night and when I attend events \nacross our State every weekend, I most frequently hear from those \ndeeply affected by our two long recessions, from which we are still \ngrowing and recovering, families who are still dealing with \nunemployment, with loss of their homes or with the threat to loss of \ntheir life savings, businesses that are facing a credit crunch and \nstruggling to expand or to retain their employment.\n  Americans, I have heard over and over, and Delawareans want us to \ncome together and find solutions in this body. The good news is that \ntoday, in a rare bipartisan spirit, that is exactly what we are doing. \nI am glad we are taking up two different versions of this legislation \nto create a positive climate for capital formation for early stage \ncompanies that have enormous potential to grow, one of which has passed \noverwhelmingly in the House--and I understand has earned the public \nsupport of President Obama--but the other of which, as we have heard a \nnumber of Democratic Senators speak to today, tries to mirror those \nsame core provisions but insists on investor protection and on ensuring \nthat we do not overreach in opening markets in ways we may regret \nlater.\n  Sometimes, as the Chair knows all too well, this body deliberates \noverly long. In fact, in my first year and a half here, I have been \nstruck at just how long we deliberate before acting and on how many \nmeasures have sat on the floor without action that should have been \ntaken up promptly and quickly.\n  In this case, I am concerned about the opposite; that we are rushing \nthrough a measure that deserves some careful consideration and review. \nIn any event, making progress in access to capital for entrepreneurs \nand startup businesses is something on which I hope we can all agree. \nIn both the versions of the bill that we will consider later today or \ntomorrow, there\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\nare great ideas. I continue to believe that ensuring investor \nprotection, market transparency, and the vibrancy of our capital \nmarkets through preventing fraud and ensuring clarity about what \ninvestors are getting is a fundamental principle that all of us should \nshare.\n  But without the right time to consider this legislation, I am worried \nabout the potential, the potential risks for investors, the potential \nburden it may place on business. I am worried about a proposal around \nbeneficial ownership in one proposal, and I am worried about concerns \nthat may overly open the market to fraudsters and those who would scam \ninvestors on the Internet.\n  There is much to like about these proposals, though, and let me \ndedicate the remainder of my time to focusing on two of them. Two of \nthe strongest proposals we will consider today or tomorrow address a \ncritical need for our business community, which is access to capital. \nCapital is what allows businesses to invest in new technology, new \nfacilities, new workers, and in growth. Credit has, as we all know, \nbeen far too hard to come by in the last 2 years. But we can and should \ntake action to make it more available to small business owners with \nhigh growth potential.\n  One option, as we have heard a number of Senators address, is to \ncontinue to expand the opportunity for financing from the Export-Import \nBank. The other is to make somewhat easier the pathway to initial \npublic offerings. Today's legislation would ease both processes. That \nis the right kind of positive movement that will help \ncreate opportunity all over the United States and for companies in my \nhome State of Delaware.\n\n  First, if I can, the Export-Import Bank has long established its \nrecord of promoting exports and job growth. It has provided essential \ncapital to help manufacturers and small businesses all over the country \nexport more American-made goods. The reauthorization measure we take \nup, hopefully later today, has passed unanimously out of the Senate \nBanking Committee and has already enjoyed broad bipartisan support.\n  Last year, financing from the Ex-Im Bank supported hundreds of jobs \nin my home State and thousands more across the country. The bank \nsupported one dozen companies in Delaware. For example, one, Air \nLiquide, has a proprietary MEDAL membrane, a selectively permeable \nmembrane that turns landfill gas into usable energy; one example of \nmany innovative, local Delaware companies creating high-quality jobs in \nour communities and able to sell these products by export through Ex-Im \nBank financing.\n  Equally important, the Ex-Im Bank has not added a single cent to the \ndeficit. It works to give American businesses a fair share in the \nglobal market. If American businesses and workers are going to be \ncompetitive, we have to ensure they have the support they need, \notherwise they will continue to lose out.\n  China already provides three to four times as much export financing \nas we do to help their exporters. Our companies, our manufacturers, our \ncommunities, simply ask for a level playing field. In my view, \nreauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank is especially vital to these companies and \nour manufacturing sector. Given the realities of the global economy, it \nis not enough for American companies to just make great products. They \nalso have to be able to sell them to the burgeoning global middle \nclass.\n  As we all know, 95 percent of current and future customers and \nconsumers live outside the United States. Reaching these consumers who \nare hungry for American products is essential to the steady growth of \nbusinesses of all types. Boosting American exports will be central to \ncreating the kind of growth that will continue to sustain this ongoing \neconomic recovery and allow our businesses to hire new workers.\n  Financing from Ex-Im can come in at a critical time for businesses in \nneed of capital, but it does not meet the needs of every company. For \nsome other early stage companies, Delaware businesses in particular, \nwhen they are in need of capital, one solution is to move toward an \ninitial public offering by becoming a publicly traded company.\n  Today's legislation also includes an onramp to ease the path to an \nIPO. By reducing the regulatory burden on highly innovative companies \npoised for significant growth, we can encourage job creation on a great \nscale. At the moment, we are simply not seeing the rate of IPOs in our \neconomy that we need to be helpful, and 92 percent of the jobs a \ncompany typically creates over its entire life cycle come after it goes \npublic. In the 1990s, nearly half of all global IPOs happened in the \nUnited States. Today, that number is less than 10 percent.\n  There are many reasons companies choose not to go public. But one of \nthem that I have recited repeatedly in Delaware and in Washington is \nregulatory compliance under Sarbanes-Oxley section 404(b). That is a \nmouthful, but it essentially requires some auditing, some disclosures, \nsome pre-IPO work, which while the spirit of the law is, in my view, \nthe right one--ensuring transparency and investor protection is the \nright direction--this particular section has proven, in practice, to be \noverly burdensome to businesses with potential to be the greatest job \ncreators.\n  After hearing about this issue many times, I got together last fall \nwith my colleague Senator Rubio to craft a solution. We found \nbipartisan agreement on this and six other issues, which we included in \nour joint legislation, the so-called AGREE Act, which we introduced \nlast November.\n  That legislation was chock-full of job-creating potential proposals \ndesigned to spur ideas and encourage more of our colleagues to come \ntogether on this sort of bipartisan jobs legislation we can and should \nmove to.\n  In the case of encouraging IPOs, that is exactly what has happened. \nSenators Schumer and Toomey have also picked up this particular \nproposal and moved further along with it. Then, on the House side, my \nlongtime friend and fellow Delawarean Congressman Carney worked with \nhis Republican colleague Congressman Fincher to write and pass \nlegislation on this exact issue which has now come to us as part of \nthis bipartisan jobs package, H.R. 3606.\n  I wish to specifically congratulate Congressman Carney, who with this \nbill became the first freshman Democrat in the House to pass a major \npiece of legislation. But as we heard Senator Landrieu speak to just a \nfew minutes ago and as several Senators have stood on this floor and \nraised today and last week, the question we have to ask is: In \nproviding this relief from Sarbanes-Oxley 404(b), what is the \nappropriate level? What is the appropriate duration? Where do we strike \nthe right balance between investor protection and accelerating capital \nformation and job growth?\n  Is it at $250 million, as we proposed in the AGREE Act, $350 million \nas the democratic alternative proposes that is on the floor today or $1 \nbillion? That is what is provided in the bill that came over from the \nHouse. In my view and the view of many Democratic Senators, we need to \ntake the time to debate this, discuss it, and ensure we are striking \nthe balance.\n  It is worth a few more hours of our time to get this matter right. \nCreating a favorable environment for businesses to create jobs can and \nshould be our top priority in Washington. Since I arrived a year and a \nhalf ago, that has not always been the case. But today it can and \nshould be the primary focus of our work. There is no reason we have to \nrush to pass this today. We can and should take some time to \ndeliberate, to work through the appropriate process. It is my hope we \nwill reauthorize and extend the reach of the Export-Import Bank and \nthat we will move to a consensus, bipartisan bill that will strengthen \naccess to capital for entrepreneurs and for early stage companies and \nthat will show all the people of the United States that the House, the \nSenate, and the President can and will stand together on the side of \njob creators in this economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1831-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1831-S1832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. COONS.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                     BUDGET CONTROL ACT RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which was \nsigned into law by the President last August, set in place budget \nenforcement measures in the Senate for budget years 2012 and 2013, as \nwell as established caps for 10 years to address discretionary spending \nand established the so-called supercommittee to address entitlement \nspending and revenues.\n  Specifically, to provide continued enforcement in the Senate for 2012 \nand budget year 2013, section 106(b)(2) requires the chairman of the \nBudget Committee to file not later than April 15, 2012: (1) allocations \nfor fiscal years 2012 and 2013 for the Committee on Appropriations; (2) \nallocations for fiscal years 2012, 2013, 2013 through 2017, and 2013 \nthrough 2022 for committees other than the Committee on Appropriations; \n(3) aggregate spending levels for fiscal years 2012 and 2013; (4) \naggregate revenue levels for fiscal years 2012, 2013, 2013 through \n2017, and 2013 through 2022; and (5) aggregate levels of outlays and \nrevenue for fiscal years 2012, 2013, 2013 through 2017, and 2013 \nthrough 2022 for Social Security.\n  In the case of the Committee on Appropriations, the allocations for \n2012 and 2013 shall be set consistent with the discretionary spending \nlimits set forth in the Budget Control Act. Consequently, the initial \nallocation matches the discretionary levels set in the Budget Control \nAct and will be revised to reflect adjustments to those levels as \nauthorized by the Budget Control Act.\n  In the case of allocations for committees other than the Committee on \nAppropriations and the revenue and Social Security aggregates, the \nlevels shall be set consistent with the Congressional Budget Office's \nMarch 2012 baseline. In the case of the spending aggregates for 2012 \nand 2013, the levels shall be set consistent with the Congressional \nBudget Office's March 2012 baseline and the discretionary spending \nlimits set forth in the Budget Control Act.\n  In addition, section 106(c)(2) requires the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee to reset the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard to zero for all \nfiscal years and to notify the Senate of this action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing \nenforcement in the Senate for budget year 2013, including new committee \nallocations, budgetary and Social Security aggregates, and pay-as-you-\ngo scorecard, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Mr. President, I wish to inform my colleagues that this \nmorning I filed the budget deeming resolution for 2013 pursuant to the \nBudget Control Act passed last year. This resolution sets forth the \nspending limits for fiscal year 2013 at the levels agreed to by \nDemocrats and Republicans in last summer's Budget Control Act. It \nallows the appropriations committees to now proceed with their work in \ndrafting bills for next year, and it ensures the Senate will have the \ntools to enforce the spending limits we agreed to on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I want to emphasize for my colleagues that we do have a budget. Those \nwho continue to claim we do not have a budget are either unaware of \nwhat they voted on last year or are seeking to deliberately mislead the \npublic. The Budget Control Act was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, it was passed by the Senate, and signed into law by \nthe President. It is the law of the land, and it established the key \ncomponents of the budget for 2012 and 2013.\n  Here is the language from the Budget Control Act itself. It is very \nclear the Budget Control Act is intended to serve as the budget for \n2012 and 2013. It states:\n\n       For the purpose of enforcing the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974 through April 15, 2012 . . . the allocations, \n     aggregates, and levels set in subsection (b)(1) shall apply \n     in the Senate in the same manner as for a concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2012.\n\n  It goes on to use that exact same language for fiscal year 2013.\n  In many ways, the Budget Control Act was even more extensive than a \ntraditional budget. It has the force of law, unlike a budget resolution \nthat is not signed by the President. I think most Members here know a \nbudget resolution is purely a congressional document. The Budget \nControl Act is actually the law.\n  No. 2, the Budget Control Act set discretionary spending caps for 10 \nyears instead of the 1 year normally set in a budget resolution.\n  No. 3, it provided enforcement mechanisms, including 2 years of \ndeeming resolutions which allow budget points of order to be enforced. \nAnd No. 4, it created a reconciliation-like supercommittee process to \naddress entitlement and tax reforms, and it backed up that process with \na $1.2 trillion sequester.\n  So these claims that we do not have a budget can now be put to rest. \nBy filing the deeming resolution provided for in the Budget Control Act \nthis morning, the budget levels have been set for next year.\n  Last week, we received CBO's updated budget estimates, which allowed \nme to complete work on the budget deeming resolution for 2013. The \nfiling of this deeming resolution was required under the Budget Control \nAct. I filed a similar resolution for 2012 back in September. The \nBudget Control Act is crystal clear that the spending limits in the \nresolution should be set at the levels agreed to in the Budget Control \nAct.\n  Again, here is the language taken directly from the law. It states:\n\n       Not later than April 15, 2012, the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget shall file . . . for the Committee on \n     Appropriations, committee allocations for fiscal years 2012 \n     and 2013 consistent with the discretionary spending limits \n     set forth in this Act.\n\n  It doesn't say at a level below the limits set forth in this Act, it \nsays at\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\na level consistent with the limits set forth in this Act.\n  Let's remember what these limits mean. Under the Budget Control Act \nspending caps, discretionary spending is cut by about $900 billion \nbelow the CBO baseline over the next 10 years, and that is not \nincluding the sequester cuts. That is just the results of the Budget \nControl Act spending limits.\n  Let me make clear, our House Republican friends now seem to be \nwalking away from these levels, even though they agreed to them last \nyear. Let's look at what they said last summer. Here is what House \nBudget Committee Chairman Ryan said on the House floor on August 1:\n\n       What the Budget Control Act has done is it has brought our \n     two parties together. So I would just like to reflect for a \n     moment that we have a bipartisan compromise here. That \n     doesn't happen all that often around here; so I think that's \n     worth noting. That's a good thing. And what are we doing? We \n     are actually cutting spending while we do this. That's \n     cultural. That's significant. That's a big step in the right \n     direction. We are getting two-thirds of the cuts we wanted in \n     our budget, and, as far as I am concerned, 66 percent in the \n     right direction is a whole lot better than going in the wrong \n     direction.\n\n  So last summer our House Republican colleagues were pleased to be \ngetting 66 percent of what they wanted. They made an agreement. They \nshook on it. They ought to keep the agreement they made.\n  It seems that our House Republican friends are on their own, because \nat least so far the Senate Republican leadership has agreed we should \nkeep to the spending limits we took on last year. Here is what Senate \nMinority Leader McConnell said on the floor last month:\n\n       We have negotiated the top line for the discretionary \n     spending for this coming fiscal year. . . . We already have \n     that number. . . . There is no good reason for this \n     institution not to move forward with an appropriations \n     process that avoids what we have done so frequently under \n     both parties for years and years: either continuing \n     resolutions or omnibus appropriations. . . . I hope we can \n     join together and do the basic work of government this year \n     and do it in a timely fashion.\n\n  I hope so too. I hope our House Republican colleagues are listening. \nWe still must come together on a budget plan that addresses the long-\nterm fiscal imbalances we confront, but the short-term budget is in \nplace and it is in law. It was included in the Budget Control Act that \neveryone agreed to last summer. It provided for about $900 billion in \ndiscretionary spending cuts.\n  The Senate is now poised to proceed with its business. I have filed \nthe budget deeming resolution for 2013, and we will be moving forward \nwith appropriations bills at the levels we all agreed to. I believe \nHouse Republicans should do the same. If they fail to do so, they will \nonce again threaten to shut down the government and needlessly imperil \nthe economic recovery.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to corporate \nwelfare. At a time when our country is borrowing over $1 trillion a \nyear, I think it makes no senses to loan money to countries we are \nborrowing from. For example, we borrowed $29 billion from Mexico, and \nyet we are sending them $8 billion of the money we borrowed from them \nto subsidize trade.\n  A lot of the subsidized trade goes to very wealthy corporations. When \n12 million people are out of work in the United States, does it make \nsense for the U.S. taxpayer to subsidize loans of major multinational \ncorporations? The President is big on saying, well, these rich \ncompanies need to pay their fair share. Well, why then is the President \nsending loans out to these very wealthy corporations? And he is \nactually giving them their fair share of our taxpayer money. Why is \nthat occurring?\n  I have often asked the question, Is government inherently stupid? \nWell, you know, I don't think government is inherently stupid, but it \nis a debatable question. Government doesn't get the same signals your \nlocal bank gets. Your local bank has to look at your creditworthiness. \nYour local bank has to make a profit. Your local bank has to meet a \npayroll. But once the government gets in charge of these things, Katy-\nbar-the-door. We don't have a good track record with government banks \nbecause they do not feel deep inside the same pain that an individual \nbanker feels when he gives a loan.\n  We have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac losing $6 billion of your money a \nquarter. And what do they want to do? They want to expand another \ngovernment bank. So get this right. The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that \nare government banks are losing $6 billion a quarter, and recently they \nwanted to give their executives multimillion dollar bonuses. They said, \nWell, you have to pay people if you want to keep good talent. My \nquestion is, How much talent does it take to lose $6 billion a quarter? \nI think there are people here today watching the Senate who would take \n$19 million a year to run one of these government banks only to have \ntheir record be that they lost $6 billion a quarter. That is \noutrageous. Then wanting to expand a new government bank and give money \nto very wealthy corporations that are making a profit? It makes no \nsense whatsoever.\n  Jefferson said government is best that governs least. What did he \nmean by that? He meant he wanted government to be small because \ngovernment is inherently inefficient. Government doesn't get the same \nsignals. That is why we should only let government do the things the \nprivate sector can't do. Banking is something the private sector can \ndo. We are not talking about starting new companies, for the most part; \nwe are mostly talking about subsidizing very wealthy multinational \ncompanies.\n  But let's look at the companies the Export-Import Bank is \nsubsidizing. One of them is called First Solar. You may have heard that \na lot of these solar companies are big contributors to President Obama. \nI wonder if that has something to do with them getting loans. But here \nis the loan First Solar gets from Export-Import. They get paid and they \nhave a loan that says they are going to make solar panels, and then who \nis going to buy the solar panels? Themselves. So they made a deal with \nanother company they own and the taxpayer is stuck financing a loan so \nFirst Solar can make solar panels and then buy them from themselves. \nThat sounds like a good deal. You get the government to subsidize a \nloan to buy your own product.\n  Who else are we subsidizing? We gave $10 million in loans to \nSolyndra. You may have heard of Solyndra. Solyndra is owned by the 20th \nrichest man in the United States, who just happens to be a big \ncontributor to President Obama. Coincidence? I don't know.\n  Guess who works for the Department of Energy. Solyndra's lawyer's \nhusband works for the Department of Energy, and he was apparently a big \nfan of these loans and a big fan of restructuring these loans. Do you \nthink people approving the loans should be related to the people \ngetting the loans?\n  Robert Kennedy, Jr., of the famous Kennedy family, got $1.8 billion. \nJust so happens they are big political supporters of the President \nalso. How did they get the loan? Somebody who used to work for Kennedy \nnow works in the loan department at the Department of Energy. Sounds as \nthough there might be a conflict of interest.\n  This is a real problem. But this is a problem that is endemic to \ngovernment banks. Once you let the government get hold of the banks, \nand once you let them make the loan decisions, they do it and they give \nthe money to their favorites. So when one party is in charge, their \nfavorites get them; when the other party is in charge, their favorites \nget them.\n  The government shouldn't be in this business. These are large \nmultinational corporations that can find loans for themselves. Guess \nwhat. Sometimes they are loaning money to other governments that then \ncompete with our industry. We are loaning money to India, to whom we \nalso owe billions of dollars, but then India subsidizes an airline that \ncompetes with U.S. airlines. It doesn't make any sense at all. But we \ncontinue to do things that are counterproductive, counterintuitive, at \ntaxpayers' expense. Then we say, well, to keep good talent, we have to \npay these guys millions of dollars to run these government banks.\n  The problem is government banks don't respond the way business does. \nThey respond in a fashion where they do not feel the pain. No one loses \ntheir job. No one loses a night's sleep over a government loan. When a \nbank loans you money, someone has to make a profit and meet a payroll. \nIt is different. You have the checks and balances of the marketplace. \nYou don't\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\nneed to have the government involved here.\n  There are a couple questions we should ask before doing what the \nother side wants to do. They want to expand the size of this corporate \nwelfare. They want more corporate welfare going out to multinational \ncorporations. In doing so, they want you, the taxpayer, to be on the \nhook for more money.\n  I would say we have to ask some questions. Should we be dispensing \nloans based on political favoritism? Should it matter if one is a big \ncontributor to the President? Should that matter in getting a loan? No. \nI think that ought to be illegal. If it is not immoral, it ought to be. \nIt is immoral. It should be illegal. We shouldn't be doing that.\n  Then the other question is, does it make sense to borrow billions of \ndollars first from China or India and then send it back to them to say: \nPlease, buy our products with it. So we borrow the money from them, and \nthen we send it back to the very same countries. It makes utterly no \nsense. I ask the Senate to consider seriously whether, at a time we are \nrunning a $1 trillion deficit, it makes sense to be subsidizing \nprofitable, large multinational corporations. I don't think so, and I \ndon't think the taxpayer thinks so.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the last several days there has been \nan immense outpouring of concern about the so-called JOBS bill the \nHouse has sent to us, and this outpouring should weigh upon us. It \nshould make us question the speed and the lack of deliberation with \nwhich we are considering this House bill and question the wisdom of \njust sending it back to the House if there is one amendment to it, \nwhich is on the Ex-Im Bank, and hoping that somehow or another \ninvestors are going to be protected in a conference instead of by the \nSenate. What we are considering should be done with great deliberation, \nand we should take the time to get this right.\n  The House majority leader suggested yesterday that those of us who \nare concerned about the House bill are ``creating phantom investor \nprotection issues.'' We did not create these issues. People who know \nfar more about capital markets than the House majority leader or myself \nor probably any of us have asked us to reconsider what we are poised to \ndo.\n  Start with the Council of Institutional Investors. This group's \nmembers invest a combined $3 trillion in our Nation's capital markets. \nThey include the Nation's largest pension funds, university endowments, \nand foundations. The Council of Institutional Investors, an outside, \nindependent, objective group whose sole purpose in life is to make sure \ninvestors are given sound opportunities and are not defrauded, is \nwarning us that rather than boosting investment in our economy, we \ncould frighten investors out of the market. They are asking us, they \nare pleading with us to reevaluate, and we should.\n  Next, take a look at the letter from the current SEC Chairman Mary \nSchapiro to the Banking Committee last week. Chairman Schapiro issues a \nlengthy list of warnings about provisions in the House bill. She sums \nup her warnings this way: ``If the balances tip to the point where \ninvestors are not confident that there are appropriate protections, \ninvestors will lose confidence in our markets and capital formation \nwill ultimately be made more difficult and expensive.''\n  That is precisely the opposite of the impact we should want.\n  We should listen to the American Institute of Certified Public \nAccountants, which warns us that the House bill ``would create \nmarketplace and investor confusion'' that dampens rather than \nstrengthens investment in growing companies.\n  We should listen to the association that represents State securities \nadministrators. What does that association do? They warn us that \n``Congress is on the verge of enacting policies that although intended \nto strengthen the economy, will in fact only make it more difficult for \nsmall businesses to access investment capital.''\n  We should listen to the editors of Bloomberg News, one of the most \ntrusted sources of commentary on the markets, who tell us that \nprovisions of the House bill ``would be dangerous for investors and \ncould harm already fragile financial markets.''\n  Can any of us who have lived through the fearful days of the \nfinancial crisis, days when we wondered if the entire economy would \ncrumble--can any of us or should any of us vote to rush through this \nbody legislation that threatens harm to fragile financial markets? Do \nwe want to live through that again?\n  We should amend this flawed House bill so we can create opportunity \nfor American workers, companies and investors and not opportunities for \nfraudsters, boiler room hucksters, and con artists. We can do that, and \nwe should do that. One way to do that is to invoke cloture on the \nalternative that Senators Jack Reed, Mary Landrieu and I have offered \nand to begin debate and amendments on that alternative so the Senate's \ndeliberative process can begin.\n  If that cloture vote fails, the only remaining prudent alternative is \nto reject the cloture motion on the underlying bill so the Senate can \nbegin to deliberate and consider amendments to a bill that has aroused \nsuch concern among so many experts whose very job it is to protect \nconsumers.\n  Some may fear that by slowing a runaway train, they risk being \nportrayed as hostile to job creation or to small businesses. After all, \nhow can we oppose legislation titled the ``JOBS Act''? It takes more \nthan a clever acronym to create jobs. As the astonishing amount of \nconcern among market experts tells us, this JOBS Act--this so-called \nJOBS Act is not a jobs act but an invitation to the kind of fraud that \ndestroys jobs.\n  The Senate is the place where care and deliberation is supposed to \nrule and is supposed to rein in the excesses of haste and incaution, \nand I urge my colleagues to undertake that responsibility today.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was a bit surprised--although one is \nnever totally surprised in this body--when my Democratic colleagues \nwere saying this morning that something bad has happened because the \nhistoric budget that would change the debt course of America, that has \nbeen announced by Congressman Paul Ryan and his House Budget Committee \ntoday, violates the Budget Control Act. It spends a few billion dollars \nless than what was capped in the Budget Control Act. The Budget Control \nAct that passed put a cap on the roughly $1 trillion of discretionary \nspending only. And from that $1 trillion-plus cap, the House would \nreduce spending by $19 billion in the proposed budget today, and this \nsomehow violates good spirit around here and is the wrong thing. But I \nwould just say that when the Budget Control Act passed in the wee hours \nof the morning at the eleventh hour and the 59th minute before a \ngovernment shutdown occurred, we knew it wasn't enough of a reduction \nin spending. It wasn't half of what experts have told us needs to be \nreduced over the next 10 years to put America on a sound debt path.\n  We are on a disastrous debt path. We are heading to the most \npredictable financial crisis this Nation has ever faced because we are \nspending 40 cents per dollar more than we have. We are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend--borrowing it--just to maintain this \nlevel of spending.\n  So the House made some changes or made a proposal to reduce the \nspending level below the Budget Control Act, and they also recognized \nthat the $1 trillion or so in spending that was covered by the Budget \nControl Act--and that is the discretionary spending--is only a little \nover 40 percent of total spending. Over half of the spending is in the \nentitlement mandatory spending category. They proposed really nothing\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\nunder the Budget Control Act to make any changes.\n  So the Ryan budget proposed to spend next year $180 billion less than \nthe President's budget proposed that he submitted earlier this year. \nAnd did the President's budget adhere to the BCA? My colleagues say, \noh, they are mostly disheartened that Republicans would take the \nspending down below the level by about $19 billion or so under the \nBudget Control Act numbers. But I didn't hear them complaining when \nPresident Obama submitted his budget.\n  Do my colleagues know what the President's budget did? It wiped out \nover half of the spending cuts in the Budget Control Act. Can my \ncolleagues imagine that? We agreed on $2.1 trillion in spending \nreductions, and $1 trillion of that was voted on explicitly, and $1.2 \ntrillion was an automatic sequester or an automatic cut in spending if \nthe committee didn't reach a long-term agreement. The committee didn't \nreach an agreement, so automatically $1.2 trillion in cuts was to be \nimposed. That is the current law. President Obama's budget wipes it \nout. Not only does he add, therefore, $1.2 trillion immediately to \nspending as a result of wiping out the sequester we agreed on just last \nAugust, he adds another $500 billion in spending. His budget he \nsubmitted just a few weeks ago calls for spending increases of $1.6 \ntrillion more than was in the Budget Control Act.\n  So my good friend Senator Conrad, who chairs the Budget Committee, \nand our Democratic leadership, who are threatening a government \nshutdown because Congressman Ryan and the responsible House Budget \nCommittee proposed actually taking a few more billion dollars out of \ndiscretionary spending, want to complain about that. I didn't hear them \ncomplaining when we had the most astounding event after the President \nsigned the Budget Control Act that passed both Houses at the eleventh \nhour: a compromise agreement--a compromise we all knew was not \nsufficient. And 5 months later, before the ink is hardly dry on it, he \nproposes to wipe it out.\n  No wonder the American people don't trust Congress. We say in August: \nWe are going to save $2.1 trillion--trust us--and we are going to raise \nthe debt ceiling so America can continue to borrow at this \nextraordinary rate, but we are going to cut spending. We are going to \nraise the debt ceiling, but don't worry, we promise to cut spending. \nAnd the President of the United States, within 5 months of that \nagreement being reached, submits to us a budget that wipes out half of \nit. I am amazed that nobody has been talking about it. I have tried to \nraise the issue. It just points out to me how silly it is that our \ncolleagues in the Senate would complain about Congressman Ryan.\n  The American people gave Republicans a majority in the House of \nRepresentatives. We are facing the most systemic debt threat this \nNation has ever faced, and they knew it, and they proposed last year \nand again this year a historic budget that would alter the debt course \nwe are on. It would take us from unsustainability to sustainability. It \nwould take us on a path that we would hope avoids a debt crisis, \nalthough we are so close to it, I am not sure we can avoid it. \nHopefully, we can avoid a debt crisis, but our debt is tremendous. Our \nindividual, per capita debt is $44,000 per man, woman, and child--\ngreater than any country in Europe and greater than Greece. We are in \nthe danger zone; clearly, we are.\n  So they proposed this budget last year and again this year, and it \nlaid out a plan. So what happened? The President of the United States \ncalls out Congressman Ryan and castigates him in a speech, and he is \nsitting right in front of him. The Senate Democrats, who haven't \nproduced a budget in 3 years because they are afraid to, because they \ndon't have the courage to lay out the tough choices that are going to \nbe necessary to save this Republic financially, attacked Congressman \nRyan and his House Members for trying to do the right thing. It is \nunbelievable to me. I am just amazed. Now we have them complaining that \nhe goes a little below the Budget Control Act numbers. Give me a break.\n  Does anybody not know what is going on here? The American people do. \nThey gave a shellacking to a lot of the big spenders in the last \nelection. Surely we would have thought Congress got the message. The \nHouse did. Apparently, the Senators have not.\n  Senator Reid, our majority leader, said it would be foolish to have a \nbudget. Foolish to have a budget? The law requires us to have a budget. \nBy April 1, we should have one in the committee. We are not going to be \nmeeting before then. We should have one pass both Houses by April 15. \nThat is the law. It is in the United States Code. Unfortunately, I \nguess, we don't go to jail as a result of not passing one because we \nhaven't passed one here for 3 consecutive years. We haven't passed a \nbudget in 3 years.\n\n  Senator Reid said it is foolish to pass a budget. Why? I think he \nmeant politically. It would be foolish for him to allow a budget to \ncome to the floor where there is free debate, an opportunity to offer \namendments in large numbers, and actually debate the challenges and \nvote on them. Senators--in public; not in secret meetings but in \npublic--actually vote on these issues that are important to America and \nheld accountable, and the American people can see how tough the choices \nare because the choices are tough. It is not going to be easy to \nbalance this budget. I am telling my colleagues, I have seen the \nnumbers. I am ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, and I have \nsat down with my staff, and I wish I could say it would be easier than \nit is. It is not going to be easy.\n  So this is a frustrating moment. I am not really surprised. Here we \nare, going into the summer, trying to deal with a financial systemic \nthreat to America that Admiral Mullen calls the greatest threat to our \nnational security--our debt. We have done nothing about it. The House \nhas. The Republican leadership in the House has done their duty. They \nproduced a courageous, thoughtful, responsible debt course change that \nwill put us on the road to prosperity, not decline. Their budget \nincludes tax simplifications and tax reductions even, while they are \ndoubling the amount of savings President Obama achieves. The House \nbudget, although it doesn't balance in 10 years--and I wish it did, but \nit doesn't balance in 10 years--adds half the debt in the next 10 years \nthat President Obama's budget proposes. It cuts it more than half. It \nputs us on a path. And in the outyears, it is even more positive in its \neffect and clearly takes us out of this disastrous course we are on. So \nthey should be congratulated for being honest and detailed.\n  Speaking of details, why don't we see the Democratic Members of this \nSenate lay out their budget plan?\n  Last year, Senator Reid called up the House budget so all could vote \nagainst it. So Senator McConnell called up the President's budget. \nEvery Democratic Member voted against that. Senator Toomey's thoughtful \nbudget----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 11 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The net result was that the President's plan was \nbrought up, and voted down 97 to nothing. All Democrats voted against \nthe Toomey plan. All of them voted against the House plan. They voted \nagainst everything. Not one plan did they produce that they voted for. \nThat is the course we are on today. I do not think that is a plan and a \npolicy you can be proud of. I think it is unworthy of a party giving \nleadership in the Senate at this critical time in history.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                            Gasoline Prices\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have returned to the Senate floor today \nto talk about what is a true crisis for many Louisianans, many \nAmericans, which is the ever-rising price of gasoline at the pump. This \nhits everybody in their tough pocketbook in a horrible economy. It is a \ntrue crisis for many American families all around the country.\n  In this debate--and it has been a significant national debate--a lot \nof Republicans say: Well, President Obama does not have a plan, does \nnot have a policy to address the price at the pump. A lot of supporters \nof President Obama say: Well, no President can have a significant \nimpact, can determine the price at the pump.\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\n  I think both of those statements are equally wrong. I think the \nPresident, this administration, does have a policy. They have made \nspecific proposals and it would, if we enact it, have a significant \nimpact on the price at the pump. It would just be the wrong sort of \nimpact. It would drive the price even higher than it is now, not help \nAmerican families by stabilizing that price.\n  I want to focus on one very specific, clearly laid out policy of \nPresident Obama, and that is to increase taxes on oil and gas and \nenergy producers--increase taxes on that product, which I think clearly \nis going to only drive up the price at the pump.\n  President Obama has advocated this very consistently for a long time. \nHe advocated it as a Senator. He laid it out as a central plank of his \nenergy policy when he was originally running for President in 2008. He \nhas fought for it ever since, including it in every budget submission \nto Congress. He has always advocated increasing taxes on domestic oil \nand gas energy producers.\n  To underscore this point, one of the President's biggest supporters \nin the Senate, Senator Menendez, has introduced this concept in the \nSenate. Yesterday, Senator Menendez introduced the Repeal Big Oil Tax \nSubsidies Act, which, again, does exactly the same thing as the \nPresident has long advocated. It increases taxes on that product. It \nincreases taxes on those domestic producers.\n  I think the American people get it. We can argue about fairness. We \ncan argue about other considerations. But in terms of the impact this \nis going to have on the price at the pump, I think the American people \nget it. It is economics 101: If you tax something more, you tend to \ndrive the price up in the market, and you decrease supply. Again, that \nis economics 101.\n  I could talk about the true facts of this with regard to energy \ncompanies--the fact that they pay an effective tax rate of about 41 \npercent, the fact that they account for enough revenue to cover 10 \npercent of our entire discretionary budget, that they are not \nundertaxed at all by any reasonable comparison. But I am not going to \nfocus on that because, quite frankly, I do not care about the direct \nimpact on the companies. I care about the direct impact on Louisianans, \non Americans, on consumers, on what so many low or middle-class \nfamilies are dealing with right now--that real crisis I talked about \nthat you face every time you go to fill up your car; that is, the \nburden of skyrocketing prices at the pump. That is what we should all \nbe concerned about. As I said, I think it is pretty obvious, it is \neconomics 101, that if you tax something more, the price at the pump, \nthe price in the market goes up, and you get less of it.\n  But even if that were not so obvious, we have history to look at. \nThere is a very clear history lesson from the Carter years, when this \nsame experiment was actually enacted. Back then, in 1979, it was called \nthe windfall profits tax. You may remember that debate. Well, that was \nactually enacted here in Congress, here in Washington--the Crude Oil \nWindfall Profits Tax Act. It was passed back then, and it went into \neffect on April 2, 1980. Again, the same arguments, the same policy: \nSomehow the tax treatment of these companies is unfair. Somehow they \nare not paying their fair share--even though the facts show otherwise--\nso we are going to increase the tax on those domestic energy producers.\n  Well, what happened? The first thing that happened was the price at \nthe pump went up. It went up significantly for several years. There was \na lot going on in the world at the same time. I know folks will point \nto developments in the Middle East and everything else. But that is \nwhat happened immediately following the enactment of that law. The \nprice went up by about 50 percent and stayed there for several years.\n  But let's look at other factors. You can argue about the impact of \npolitics and developments in the Middle East on price. What about \nthings that should not be so impacted by developments in the Middle \nEast? What about things such as domestic production and whether that \nincreased or decreased? Well, in fact, as a direct result of the \nwindfall profits tax, domestic oil and gas production, energy \nproduction, went down over that entire period from between 3 percent to \n6 percent. If you look at the entire period of the tax, it went down.\n\n  In this debate, everyone at least has paid lip service to the idea \nthat we should be producing more energy here at home. Yet in this \nhistorical example, in this experiment, increasing the tax on this \nproduct did what you would expect it to do, again from economics 101: \nIt decreased that activity here at home. It decreased domestic \nproduction.\n  What else did it do? Well, the second big impact it had was it \nincreased our dependence on foreign oil. Again, you can connect the \ndots. This is exactly what you would expect. If you increase taxes on \ndomestic production, you decrease that supply, and guess what. We are \neven more dependent on those unstable foreign sources we want to get \naway from. That is exactly what happened in the Jimmy Carter \nexperiment. He passed the windfall profits tax, and during the entire \ntenure of that tax, dependence on foreign oil increased significantly--\nbetween 8 percent and 16 percent.\n  Then something that might be a little less obvious is the impact on \nrevenue. There were enormous promises made about the revenue this \nwindfall profits tax would bring in. Well, at the beginning it did have \nthat impact, but guess what. Over time that impact declined enormously, \ndown to actually a zero net revenue increase by 1987. The tax was \neventually repealed in 1988, but this impact on revenue went down to \nzero before that repeal, not because of the repeal. It went back to \nzero in 1987.\n  This purple, as shown on this chart, is what was promised. This \npurple is the increase in revenue that was promised and projected by \nPresident Carter. This gray, as shown on the chart, is what happened. \nSure, there was an immediate spike. Then guess what. Domestic energy \nproducers reacted. They did less activity here. If you tax something \nmore, you get less of it, we are more dependent on foreign sources, we \ndrive out that activity--those jobs and that revenue. So there was a \nsteady decline, until it was actually zero net additional revenue in \n1987, leading to the repeal in 1988.\n  So I would hope, when we look at this proposal--I would hope first we \nfocus on the American people, we focus on their plight every time they \ngo to fill up their gas tank, with these ever-increasing prices, and \nour top goal is to give them relief.\n  Increasing taxes on that product, increasing taxes on domestic \nproducers of energy, is not going to give them relief. It is going to \ndo exactly the opposite. Every rule of economics says that. If you tax \nsomething more, you get less of it, you increase the price in the \nmarket. History proves that--a very clear lesson from the Carter years \nthat some folks on this Senate floor, President Obama, and others, want \nto repeat. This is not good policy if we truly want to help the \nAmerican people with their everyday struggle with the price at the \npump.\n  I think what is going on is a completely different agenda. Folks are \nso set against fossil fuel, folks want to advantage new forms of energy \nso much that they are willing to resort to actually increasing the \nprice at the pump to do it. That is exactly what Secretary of Energy \nChu advocated in late 2008 right before he was appointed to his present \nposition. Let's not do that. The American people cannot afford it. They \nneed relief. They need it now.\n  An American President can make a difference. Unfortunately, this one \nhas a policy that would make a difference in the wrong direction. \nTaxing something more increases the price, produces less of it. We need \nto be doing the opposite. We need to be increasing domestic supply, \nbringing down the price, helping the American people in their everyday \nstruggles with their family budgets, with how to manage their scant \nresources in a very tough economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1836\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Cantwell-\nJohnson-Graham-Shelby amendment that is going to be voted on shortly in \nthis series of votes we are going to be having, and to urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment that would reauthorize \nthe Ex-Im Bank for 4 years, until 2015. The current authorization is \nset to expire in May of this year, so it is very urgent we pass this\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\nauthorization. It would increase capacity for the bank because there is \ndemand.\n  The Ex-Im Bank, people may know--or maybe not know--supplies credit \nstability to foreign purchases of U.S. product, where the purchaser has \nlimited access to private sector capital due to political risk or \ninstability or limited access to capital. It is something we have had \nsince 1934. So this program has been a way for U.S. manufacturers, \nsmall businesses, a variety of U.S. companies, to make sure they get \nsales of their products in international markets. It has been an \nincredibly important tool. Somebody called it one of the most important \ntoolboxes in U.S. economic capacity to help our economy.\n  In 2011, the bank supported over $41 billion in U.S. exports from \nover 3,600 U.S. companies, and it has supported nearly 290,000 export-\nrelated jobs in America. So that is a very big impact. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the reauthorization of this program will \nhelp reduce the deficit by over $900 million over the next 5 years. \nThat is right, a program that is run by the government that actually \nhelps our deficit be reduced, and that is because of the amount of \nmoney that is made from these transactions and returned to the \nTreasury.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues: Senators Johnson, Graham, Shelby, \nWarner, Schumer, Brown, Hagan, Coons, Akaka, Murray, Landrieu, Kerry, \nKirk, Durbin, Shaheen, McCaskill, Lieberman, and Casey for all \nsponsoring this important amendment.\n  The reason we are out here is to make sure our colleagues know this \nis the 25th time this legislation has been up for extension since the \noriginal Executive order establishing it. I am looking at the record: \n1983, passed by voice vote on the reauthorization; passed by unanimous \nconsent in 1992--passed by unanimous consent many of the times.\n  Here is a program that over the last several decades has been passed \nby unanimous consent. Yet all of a sudden this legislation is being \nstalled or held up. What I want to make sure my colleagues know is what \nan important tool it is for job creation and why it is so important \nthat we not take the capital that is left over in the Ex-Im program and \ndelay it because what is going to happen if we do not get this \nreauthorization done right away is that they are going to stop the \nactivity that is actually helping job creation in the United States.\n  As we can see in 2011, the total number of jobs it helped support was \nnearly 300,000 jobs. That is a pretty good impact by basically saying, \nas a program of a financing of last resort, the United States is going \nto make sure U.S. companies can get their products sold in various \nmarketplaces. That is why the chamber of commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, many companies and organizations are \nsupporting this legislation.\n  As an added bonus, as I said, it is generating revenue to the U.S. \neconomy. In fact, it has generated a lot of money, $3.7 billion for \nU.S. taxpayers since 2005. I know some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle think the program could have more transparency. I \nwill vote for more transparency for the Ex-Im Bank. But if one of my \ncolleagues can figure out with more transparency how to get more than \n$3.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury out of a government program, I would \nlove to hear about it because this is a program that has worked \nsuccessfully.\n  Let's talk about some of the places these jobs were created; I mean, \nactually supported and helped sustain. In Pennsylvania, in 2011, $1.4 \nbillion in export products were helped to be purchased by the Ex-Im \nBank and supported over 9,000 jobs in the State. So there is help and \nsupport for those small businesses, those manufacturers in Pennsylvania \nthat want to access international markets, but there are purchasers, \njust like with the SBA program or other finance programs that needed \nhelp and support in getting the financing done.\n  Let's look at Massachusetts, another robust State: $566 million in \nexports in 2011. That was over 4,000 jobs supported through this Ex-Im \nprogram. In my State there are many jobs. We can see from looking at \nthe list of the companies that got support through this, we have--\nobviously, aviation has done very well with having this kind of \nfinancing, particularly competing in a big global market where other \ncountries have this kind of financing tool.\n  But we also have a lot of small businesses. We have clean tech, we \nhave agriculture, we have a lot of different companies. Texas, probably \nanother State that has been a huge winner in having the Ex-Im program, \n35,000 jobs supported by the Ex-Im Bank in Texas and almost $5 \nbillion--$4.9 billion in business that was the done in the State of \nTexas through this program.\n  So my colleagues can see this is a very viable and important program \nto get reauthorized. I know some people think we ought to hold it up, \nand some are saying let's stop the program altogether--stop it and get \nrid of it, even though it has been around, it has been a tool, it has \nbeen authorized many times on unanimous consent. But now all of a \nsudden some people think this program has not served the American \npublic and the American job economy very well.\n  I would differ with them. It has served us very well. Another example \nis Florida. It has, in 2011, helped support $1.1 billion of Florida \nproducts sold in international markets and helped support over 7,600 \njobs in that State--again, a big boost to that economy.\n  Let's look at North Carolina. It has helped support over 3,300 jobs \nand over $456 million in exports. What I also like about this is that \nfor the first time with this legislation, the textile industry is going \nto get a member of the Export-Import Bank. That is to further help \nexport products from places such as North Carolina and South Carolina \nget access to the marketplace and to make sure they are being \ncompetitive on an international basis.\n  The last chart, Ohio, which is over $398 million and 2,888 jobs. So \nall these are important jobs for our economy. As I said earlier, this \nprogram is expiring in May. If we fail to reauthorize it now, what we \nare going to run into is the Export Bank cutting off those types of \nbusinesses, those types of jobs in the very near future because they \nare almost at their capacity for this year. So instead of saying: \nWashington or Florida products or Ohio products or Pennsylvania \nproducts ready for sale, basically what we are going to say is: U.S. \nproducts in a warehouse waiting for opportunity.\n  We are basically going to say the door is shut on selling these \nproducts because we have not gotten our job done in making sure the \nexport program is reauthorized. I hope my colleagues will realize that \naround here very few things are getting done very efficiently. There \nare lots of things being held up, and the U.S. economy is paying the \nprice for it. If we cannot push something such as the Ex-Im Bank \nthrough this process that again has been authorized and reauthorized so \nmany times either by unanimous consent or voice vote and all of a \nsudden we are going to turn it into a political football, then the \nAmerican economy is going to pay the price for that.\n  I urge my colleagues to help us get this Cantwell-Johnson-Graham-\nShelby amendment passed out of the Senate today and on its way to the \nHouse so we can expedite the process of making sure we do not have a \nsign across America: ``U.S. products stuck in warehouse'' but instead \nwe have a sign that says: ``U.S. exports on the gain. United States \nmaking great headway and selling great products and services around the \nglobe.''\n  I know my colleagues earlier today were saying: There are some things \npeople want to change. The amendments people want to offer in this \nlegislation are from people who want to stop this program. This \nlegislation has transparency. It has improvements that have been \nrecommended on market-based rates, and it puts the United States in a \ncompetitive advantage to make sure we are competing in a world in which \nexport market opportunity has grown something like 500 times in the \nlast 25 years.\n  If we want to be in the jobs game, we have to get our products \noverseas. The Ex-Im Bank will continue to help us do that. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Cantwell-Johnson-Graham-Shelby amendment.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I wish to express deep concerns about the so-called \nJOBS Act sent to us by the House and to commend my senior Senator Jack\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\nReed and Senators Levin and Landrieu for putting forth a balanced and \nthoughtful alternative.\n  Everyone in this body agrees that Washington should be doing as much \nas it can to create jobs for middle-class Americans. But if the \nfinancial crisis of 2008 taught us anything, it is that smart \nregulation of our capital markets is a key element of sustained \neconomic growth.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation would eliminate key investor \nprotections and allow for fraud and abuse to flourish in a shadowy \nworld of unregistered securities. According to John Coates and Bob \nPozen of the Harvard Law and Business Schools, respectively, the House \nbill ``could spur more shady deals than new jobs.'' John Coffee of \nColumbia Law School has called it the ``the boiler room legalization \nact''--a reference to brokerage operations that profit from unloading \nquestionable securities on unsuspecting and inexperienced investors.\n  Over the past few days, opposition to the House bill has extended far \nbeyond economists, with investor and consumer protection groups, \nranging from the Council of Institutional Investors and the North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association to the AARP and Consumer \nFederation of America, calling for substantial changes. These groups \nhave encouraged the Senate to reexamine many of the House bill's \nprovisions, including ones that would: allow unregulated Web sites to \nsell unregistered stock to middle-class investors; permit stock brokers \nto advertise risky private offerings on billboards and in cold calls to \nseniors homes; and strip away the corporate governance and executive \ncompensation transparency requirements that we worked so hard to pass \nin the 2010 Wall Street reform bill.\n  Senators Jack Reed, Carl Levin, and Mary Landrieu have worked around \nthe clock to produce an alternative that maintains key investor \nprotections. I commend them for their work, and am proud to cosponsor \ntheir substitute amendment. I hope we can use this amendment as a \nstarting point to negotiate a compromise final bill--one which achieves \nthe goal of making capital more accessible to small start-ups, without \nmaking the markets riskier for average investors. If we do not take the \ntime to get this important bill right, I fear we will live to regret \nour haste.\n  SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro framed well the dangers of undercutting \nsecurities regulations when she warned, ``if the balance is tipped to \nthe point where investors are not confident there are appropriate \nprotections, investors will lose confidence in our markets, and capital \nformation will ultimately be made more difficult and expensive.'' Let's \npass a capital formation bill that strikes the right balance between \ncapital formation and investor protections. In my time as U.S. Attorney \nand Attorney General, I have seen the devastation that financial fraud \ncan inflict on a family, and I have seen how unscrupulous con men, \nstock jobbers, fraudsters, and boiler room operators can be. It is \nworth it to take the trouble to protect against the crooks who could \ntake advantage of the loopholes this bill leaves to exploit innocent \nvictims. I urge my colleagues to support the Reed-Levin-Landrieu \nalternative and to oppose the House-passed bill. I thank the Chair, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1839-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1839-S1840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STOP TRADING ON CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the Senate is aware, there are \ndifferences between the Senate and the House work product on the STOCK \nAct. This legislation limits insider trading by Members of Congress. It \ncertainly would have been my preference to work out these differences \nbetween the two Houses through a conference committee. I know that is \nthe preference of the Republican leader. That is the usual practice.\n  But we have been advised there would be objection to going to \nconference by consent. I have tried it and tried it and we cannot break \nthrough that. That means it would take filing and adopting three \nseparate cloture motions over the course of weeks to get to conference; \nthat is, if we can be successful on the first two. So we need to \naddress this issue more quickly because otherwise we do not address it \nat all, and we need to address it.\n  As a consequence, I am going to file cloture in the motion to concur \nwith the House bill on the STOCK Act. It is my hope we can resolve this \nmatter expeditiously, and I hope we can thereby make clear Congress's \nintent to prohibit insider trading by Members of Congress.\n  I now ask the Chair to lay before the Senate a message from the House \nwith respect to S. 2038.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reed be \nrecognized for 2 minutes and Senator Landrieu for 2 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that those two Senators be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I rise because \nin a moment we will be voting on the Reed-Landrieu-Levin substitute \namendment. This legislation corrects glaring defects in the House-\nproposed bill on a so-called jobs bill. It protects investors. It \nallows capital formation, but it does not do that at the expense of \ninvestors.\n  We have taken all the major provisions of the House bill with respect \nto the IPO onramp. We have not deleted them, we have improved them. We \nhave lowered the threshold in terms of the size of the business so \nthese IPO onramps can be designed for small businesses, not for \nbusinesses of $1 billion in annual revenue.\n  We have gone ahead and looked at the aspects of regulation A in the \nHouse, and we agree there should be an increase in the limit from $5 \nmillion to $50 million. But we have made improvements. For example, the \nHouse bill will allow people to solicit these securities under \nregulation A without audited financials. I think at a minimum the \ninvesting public should have some audited financials to rely upon.\n  We have taken provisions with respect to the ability to go dark--the \nability to stop reporting if you have 2,000 or less record owners--and \nwe have raised the limit from the existing 1 to 750 beneficial owners. \nBut we haven't opened it broadly so that large well-known companies \ncould suddenly stop reporting their financial information on a routine \nbasis.\n  We have looked at the reg D offerings in terms of a private offering \nversus a public offering, and we have given the Securities and Exchange \nCommission the ability, in this age of the Internet and of Twitter, to \nmake adjustments so that a private offering under reg D would not be \ncompromised because it gets into the media through Twitter, et cetera. \nBut we haven't opened it to general solicitation, as the House bill \ndoes.\n  By the way, our bill actually tries to create jobs, not just \nopportunities to raise funds through Wall Street. With Senator \nLandrieu's help, we have strong small business provisions in there. We \ninclude the Ex-Im Bank provisions of Senator Cantwell. We worked very \nclosely with Senators Merkley, Bennet, and Brown of Massachusetts to \ninclude a crowdfunding provision which is much superior.\n  If we do not achieve cloture, we will see, by default, a bad House \nbill on its way to becoming law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Following up on the leadership of the good Senator from \nRhode Island, let me say there are many reasons--many reasons--to vote \nagainst cloture on the House bill, and I will get to that in a minute. \nBut I am urging my colleagues to vote yes on cloture for the Reed-\nLandrieu-Levin substitute.\n  We have tried to address the many concerns raised by the House bill \nin our substitute. If we vote yes on cloture for our substitute, we can \nthen go into some more meaningful debate on the Senate floor, and this \nbill needs some additional debate.\n  Mary Schapiro from the SEC said, clearly, the House bill goes too \nfar. The Chamber of Commerce even says there are concerns in the House \nbill. AARP is opposed to the House bill. Securities and Exchange \nCommissioner Mary Schapiro wrote last week:\n\n       H.R. 3606 would remove certain important measures put in \n     place to enforce separation between the research analysts and \n     investment bankers who work for the same firms. These careful \n     principles were put in after the scandals that ensued on Wall \n     Street.\n\n  This bill has flown out of the House. Even Barney Frank said what we \nare doing in the Senate, by slowing it down and amending it, is the \nright thing. So I urge my colleagues to give our substitute a chance. \nThey can vote yes on Senator Cantwell's amendment, and vote no on \ncloture to the House bill so we can continue this important debate in \nthe Senate.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we need order in the Senate. People should \ntake their seats. The Republican leader has some words he wants to \nshare with the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on my leader time, briefly, there is \nsubstantial support on this side of the aisle for the Ex-Im Bank. \nHowever, it is important that we get this bipartisan JOBS bill that \npassed the House overwhelmingly and that the President supports on down \nto the President. So it is going to be my recommendation to my Members, \nwhich I hope they will follow, that we oppose cloture on adding the Ex-\nIm to this bill.\n  I say to my friend the majority leader, I have discussed this with \nvirtually all my Members. We believe that if you turn to the Ex-Im \nmatter, we can pass it in a relatively short time with very few \namendments related to the subject matter. But I think it is important \nthat we get this JOBS bill down to the President.\n  I urge my colleagues at this particular point on this particular bill \nto oppose cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, at a meeting very recently with people \nfrom the Pentagon, their No. 1 issue is not Afghanistan, it is not \nIraq, it is not Pakistan, it is not North Korea, it is not Iran, it is \ncybersecurity. We have to move to that legislation. The post office is \ngoing broke as we speak. We have to move to that bill as quickly as we \ncan. The Violence Against Women Act has expired. We have to move \nforward on that. We have so much to do in such a short period of time.\n  The Export-Import Bank is a powerful piece of legislation--300,000 \njobs this year alone. It saves $1 billion. And my Republican \ncolleagues, as has been standard procedure around here, even on a bill \nthat is as supported as this by the country, want to have a fight. The \nfight is on a procedural matter, that they want offered amendments--\nplural.\n  As my friend the Republican leader said, we could pass this bill in a \nrelatively short period of time. Think about that. Right now, we could \npass that, it would be part of this IPO bill we got from the House, and \nwe could go on about our business. So I think this is a huge mistake by \nmy Republican colleagues.\n  Everyone, listen. Ex-Im is, for the foreseeable future, not going to \nbe able to be moved forward. I cannot move it to the front of \neverything else when we have all these things due. I have only talked \nabout a few of the things we have to do, and we have to do them very \nsoon.\n  So go ahead, my friends. You picked a fight where it is not a \nnecessary fight, but you may be surprised how this winds up. I will say \nno more. I know what the rules of the Senate are, and I am going to \nfollow them. So have at it, vote no on the Ex-Im Bank.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This JOBS bill passed overwhelmingly in the House, \nwith only 23 votes against it, supported by the President of the United \nStates. It is ready to go down to him for signature. If we add the Ex-\nIm Bank to it, we only delay the passage of this bipartisan JOBS bill, \nand we send it back to the House, and we don't know how they feel about \nthe Ex-Im extension. We do know that here in the Senate, as I just \nindicated, there is a significant majority in favor of passing this \nlegislation, which we ought to be able to do very quickly.\n  I do not think there is any particular reason for delaying a jobs \nbill that is overwhelmingly supported on a bipartisan basis; therefore, \nI say to my friends on this side who are in favor of the Ex-Im Bank, I \nam in favor of moving to that rapidly. I can say to the majority \nleader, as I said before, we would be willing to agree to very few \namendments related to the subject matter. I encourage him to turn to \nthat soon, even though it doesn't expire, I believe, until sometime in \nMay.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say go ahead and vote against a bill you \nfavor. It is very clear. The only way to ensure that this program, the \nEx-Im Bank, advances is to see that it is attached to the House \nmeasure. Clearly, that is it.\n  I am very, very tired of this bill, the IPO bill, being referred to \nas a jobs bill. That takes a lot of gall, to talk about that as a jobs \nbill. We have a jobs bill that we, on a bipartisan basis, passed after \n5 weeks on the Senate floor. Have I heard one word from my Republican \ncolleagues about a real jobs bill, saying, why is the Speaker driving a \nnail in this bill that we worked on for 5 weeks?\n  Understand that the surface transportation bill is a jobs bill. The \nIPO bill is a nice thing to do, if it were done in the right manner and \nwe had some amendments that got rid of some of the bad provisions. \nBefore this is all over, that may be just what happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican Leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may say to those who are watching and those \ninterested in the Ex-Im Bank, if I had my good friend Harry Reid's job \nand I were the majority leader, we would be turning to the Ex-Im Bank \nnext, right after this, and we would be doing it with very few \namendments because the advantage to being the majority leader, \nobviously, is you have the ability to schedule. I want everybody who is \nfollowing this issue to understand that if I were setting the agenda, \nthe next item up, right after this bipartisan jobs bill, would be the \nEx-Im Bank.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, remember, anyone who can read--we can all \ndo that--the morning press accounts. Cantor of the House leadership has \nsaid he doesn't support the Ex-Im Bank; that my amendment--my \namendment, sponsored by Democrats and Republicans--was a partisan \nmaneuver.

Over his 8 years as superintendent, he has \nhelped lead several statewide educational initiatives and has worked \nhard to ensure that Nevada students are prepared to compete in the \nglobal economy.\n  Most recently, Nevada was one of only six States to be awarded a $71 \nmillion, 5-year competitive grant through the Striving Readers \nComprehensive Literacy Program to improve the literacy skills of Nevada \nstudents, including students with disabilities and limited English \nproficiency. In addition, Dr. Rheault oversaw the Nevada Pathway to \n21st Century Learning, a statewide professional development program \ndedicated to helping Nevada teachers successfully integrate and utilize \ntechnology in their classrooms.\n  Nevadans are fortunate to have had the educational leadership of Dr. \nRheault.

I am moved today to talk about Frances Herbert and Takako \nUeda of Dummerston, VT. This loving couple is legally married under the \nlaws of Vermont. Yet, like many Americans, they are being hurt by the \nDefense of Marriage Act despite the protections provided them under the \nlaws of the State in which they live. Ms. Ueda is a Japanese citizen. \nRecently, her petition to become a lawful permanent resident of the \nUnited States, as the lawful spouse of a United States citizen, was \ndenied for the sole reason that she and her lawful spouse happen to be \nof the same gender. This case underscores not only the harm that \ncurrent Federal law causes to same sex couples, but the additional \nhardship placed upon same sex binational couples whose marriages are \nnot recognized as the foundation of a spousal-based green card \npetition.\n  Last summer, I chaired a hearing before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to examine the impact of the Defense of Marriage Act. We \nheard from many different witnesses about how this Federal law has \nsingled them and their families out and made them less secure than \nother families protected under State law. That historic hearing \nreflected steady progress toward a better understanding of the way in \nwhich that law hurts Americans and their loved ones. I have experienced \nprofound change in my own views. I voted for the Defense of Marriage \nAct in 1996. And today I will not hesitate to acknowledge that my views \nhave changed for the better. My own transformation came in part from \nthe State of Vermont's drive towards greater equality for Vermonters. \nThe Vermont Supreme Court's opinion in the landmark case of Baker v. \nState first gave rise to legislatively-enacted civil unions in Vermont. \nIn Baker v. State, then-Chief Justice Jeffery Amestoy wrote that the \ncourt's decision was grounded in Vermont's constitution and was ``a \nrecognition of our common humanity.'' A few years later, the Vermont \nlegislature voted to provide full marriage equality. And other States \nhave now followed this march toward equality for all committed couples.\n  Our common humanity is what my friend Congressman John Lewis was \ndescribing when he spoke in opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act \non the floor of the House of Representatives in 1996, and what he has \ncontinued to fight for and protect for so many years. Congressman Lewis \nsaw this law for what it was with a clarity and conviction that I \ngreatly admire. Congressman Lewis wrote in 2003 that we must have ``not \njust civil rights for some but civil rights for all.'' He was speaking \nof the rights of gay and lesbian Americans. I could not agree more.\n  Our common humanity is what binds us together. It is what moves \nneighbors to help neighbors without regard to politics or ideology, and \nwithout judgment. It is what inspired the extraordinary generosity and \ngiving spirit of Vermonters who helped each other following the \ndevastation of Hurricane Irene, and which I and my family witnessed all \nover Vermont. I can think of few things more worthy of protection and \nrespect than the universal bond that human beings form with each other.\n  Despite Vermont's exercise of its sovereignty and the legislature's \nexpression of the will of the people of Vermont, the Defense of \nMarriage Act stands as an obstacle to the full realization of the \npromise Vermont made to its citizens--just as it does to the\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\ncitizens of every other State that has taken these steps toward justice \nand fairness.\n  Frances Herbert and Takako Ueda are two Vermonters who know first \nhand the harm caused by this discriminatory Federal policy. For them, \nthe issue is not ideological or political, it is deeply personal. They \nare legally married in the State of Vermont and have been formally \ncommitted to one another for more than a decade. Despite the fact that \nVermont considers them to be a married couple, the Federal government \ndoes not. After many years of lawful presence in the United States, Ms. \nUeda was faced with the impossible decision of choosing between her \nspouse and leaving the United States. Our Federal laws may split their \nfamily apart. This is unfair and it is wrong.\n  Not only does the Defense of Marriage Act infringe upon the States' \ntraditional and historic right to define marriage, it denies many \nAmericans equal treatment under the law. What good is a Federal law \nthat dictates such a result? Ideological purity alone is not sufficient \nto overcome the harm that is caused. As I just acknowledged, my own \nthinking has evolved over the years as I have learned from my \nconstituents and fellow Americans. Yet, repealing the Defense of \nMarriage Act would not force any State or individual to recognize a \nmarriage they didn't agree with. Instead, it would restore the role \nthat States have historically played in determining who can be married \nunder its laws.\n  I am confident that justice and fairness will prevail in the end. Our \nNation is too noble and our sense of liberty too strong to tolerate \ninjustice without end. I am heartened by the progress that we are \nseeing across the country. Public consciousness is evolving, and will \nreach the point at which discrimination based on sexual orientation \nbecomes another sad relic of our past. I believe we will look back at \nthese prejudices with disappointment and regret, just as we have at \nother points in our history. But the capacity of our Nation to evolve \nand progress is a defining characteristic of the American spirit. And \nthe American people ultimately come to reject that which is \nfundamentally unfair and unjust.\n  Just as Frances Herbert and Takako Ueda are living examples of just \nhow devastating the Defense of Marriage Act is for so many Americans, \nthere are others in Vermont who are facing and have faced the same \nstruggles. Gordon Stewart, who testified before the Judiciary Committee \nin 2009, was compelled to sell his family's farm in Vermont and move \nabroad in order to live lawfully with his partner. Nancy Wasserman was \ncompelled to leave Vermont and move to Canada to be able to live with \nher spouse. She can now legally enjoy the benefits of marriage that \nwould otherwise be denied to her wife in the United States. Michael \nUpton, a doctor and native of Vermont is forced to live apart from his \nloved one. No Vermonter, and no American, should be forced to make this \nchoice.\n  In addition to my strong support for the repeal of the Defense of \nMarriage Act, I introduced the Uniting American Families Act to help \nright a part of this wrong. My legislation would grant same-sex \nbinational couples the same immigration benefits provided to \nheterosexual couples. Passage of this important legislation would help \nput our country on par with over 25 other developed countries that \nvalue and respect human rights.\n  In the United States, 10 states and the District of Columbia have \nmarriage equality laws. The tide continues to swell in favor of same-\nsex equality with the New Jersey Legislature passing a marriage \nequality bill this year, which was vetoed by Governor Christie. It is \nclear that Americans are increasingly accepting of same-sex loving \nrelationships and marriages, and that more and more Americans are \nputting aside tired stereotypes and their personal preferences to \nsupport individual freedom and the basic rights of all Americans. Now, \nthe Federal Government must respect the sovereignty of these States and \nthe protections those States have provided its citizens.\n  Having worked over many months to support Takako Ueda and Frances \nHerbert, it is clear to me that the love and devotion that they have \nfor one another is no different or less sacred than that which I share \nwith my wife, Marcelle. It is no less real, or important, or worthy of \nprotection and recognition. I have been blessed to be married for \nnearly 50 years. Marcelle and I have been able to enjoy the family \nunity and the benefits that legal recognition provides, and which I \nhope all Americans would agree is fundamental.\n  As the Senate moves through the second session of the 112th Congress, \nI will keep fighting for Takako Ueda and Frances Herbert, for Gordon \nStewart, Nancy Wasserman, and Michael Upton, and for all Americans who \nface discrimination as the result of the Defense of Marriage Act. I \nknow that justice is on our side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1843-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1843-S1844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HEALTH REFORM\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, during this second anniversary of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, I wish to discuss some of \nthe benefits this law has already brought to consumers.\n  Millions of Americans nationwide and in California have already \nbenefited from this law. For the first time, insurance companies are \nheld accountable they cannot drop coverage just because someone gets \nsick, they cannot deny coverage because of a preexisting condition, and \nthey cannot impose limits on the amount of care provided in a lifetime.\n  This law helps women, children, young adults, seniors, families, and \nindividuals living with disabilities and chronic medical conditions.\n  In California, because of the law, over 12 million people no longer \nhave a lifetime limit on their health insurance plan. This includes \nalmost 4.5 million women and 3.26 million children.\n  Now, individuals and families with medical expenses do not have to \nworry that they will reach a point where insurance will no longer \nprovide coverage. Eliminating lifetime caps on coverage and phasing out \nannual caps will reassure Californians that their health coverage will \nbe there when they need it.\n  The health reform law is taking great strides to ensure affordable \nprescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Before health reform, Medicare beneficiaries were faced with a \nprescription drug coverage gap that was unaffordable for many. This so-\ncalled doughnut hole forced beneficiaries to pay 100 percent of their \ndrug costs after they exceeded an initial coverage limit. As many as \none in four seniors went without a prescription every year because they \nsimply could not afford it.\n  Now, the law is closing this coverage gap, and already, an estimated \n320,000 Medicare beneficiaries in California have saved almost $172 \nmillion on prescription drugs.\n  Under the health reform law, insurance companies are already banned \nfrom denying coverage to children because of a preexisting condition, \nsuch as a heart defect, autism, or juvenile diabetes.\n  Parents no longer have to spend away college funds to cover children \nwith medical conditions.\n  Beginning in 2014, health insurers are prohibited from denying anyone \nhealth insurance coverage because of a preexisting medical condition. \nThis means that being pregnant can no longer be considered a \npreexisting condition. It means that individuals will no longer be \nprevented from purchasing affordable insurance simply because they had \nan accident, are sick, or got cancer.\n  Under the law, insurance companies have to pay more of the premium \ndollars they collect on actual medical care, not on profits.\n  In California, because of this provision, almost 9 million people are \ngetting better value for their premium dollars. Furthermore, California \nhas received over $5 million in grants from the law to fight \nunreasonable premium increases and to bolster scrutiny of rates.\n  Because of the health reform law, young adults can now stay on their \nfamily insurance plan up to age 26. Previously, insurance companies \ncould drop coverage for young adults, many times at age 19. Now the law \nmakes it easier and more affordable for young adults to get health \ninsurance.\n  Already over 350,000 young adults in California have benefited from \nthis provision.\n  This law takes great strides to equalize insurance coverage for women \nand\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nto rid the system of discriminatory practices based on gender.\n  The practice of ``gender-rating,'' or charging more for insurance \nsimply because of gender, is outlawed in the health reform law. This \nmeans that women can no longer be charged higher premiums.\n  Over a recent 3-year period, 7.3 million women 38 percent of women \nwho tried to buy coverage on the individual market were either rejected \naltogether, charged a higher premium, or sold policies that excluded \ncertain benefit coverage because of a ``preexisting condition'' like \ncancer or having been pregnant.\n  Now, women will be guaranteed coverage at a similar rate to men.\n  Already, almost 2.3 million Californian women with private insurance \nhave access to no-cost preventive services because of the law. This \nincludes necessary cancer screenings, such as mammograms, annual \nwellness exams, and contraception.\n  Additionally, over 1.6 million women in California who are on \nMedicare now have access to free preventive services because of the \nlaw.\n  These are just a few critical consumer protections that are now in \nplay because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed \ninto law 2 years ago.\n  We have a long ways to go to improve our health care system and to \nensure affordable quality care for all Americans, but these essential \nconsumer protections take great strides to get us there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1844-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING RxIMPACT DAY\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the fourth \nannual RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill. This is a day to recognize the \ncontribution of pharmacies to the American healthcare system. Hundreds \nof pharmacists, pharmacy school faculty and students, State pharmacy \nleaders and pharmacy company executives will visit the Capitol to share \nwith Congress the importance of supporting legislation that protects \naccess to neighborhood pharmacies and utilizes pharmacists to improve \nquality and reduce the costs of health care.\n  Over 260 advocates from 41 States have traveled to Washington to talk \nabout their contributions in over 50,000 community pharmacies operating \nnationwide. These important health care providers are here to urge \nCongress to recognize the value of pharmacists and protect access to \nthese medication experts as a part of our valued health care delivery \nsystem.\n  Pharmacists are some of the Nation's most accessible and trusted \nhealth care providers. Most Americans live within 5 miles of a \ncommunity retail pharmacy. They are the ultimate do-it-all providers. \nPharmacists prepare, bill, and dispense prescriptions. They offer \npatient counseling. With their specialized education, they also play a \nmajor role in medication therapy management, disease management, \nimmunizations, and health care screenings.\n  Eighty-six percent of rural Americans reside within a 10-mile radius \nof a sole community pharmacy. As the face of community health care, \npharmacies across the Nation offer these and other cost-saving programs \nand services to help patients take medicines appropriately to achieve \npositive results. For more than a century, pharmacies and pharmacists \nhave supported folks in Montana and throughout America with these \nimportant patient care services. It is critical we work to support \ntheir unique contributions.\n  As we continue to make health care better and more affordable, we \nshould adopt policies that recognize the health and financial benefits \nfrom helping patients adhere to their medications. This helps to \nimprove health outcomes and reduces the risks of adverse events and \nunnecessary costly hospital readmissions and emergency room visits. \nUnfortunately, only half of Americans living with chronic diseases \nadhere to their drug regimens. Patient nonadherence costs the Nation's \neconomy an estimated $290 billion each year, not to mention the \navoidable loss of quality of life for patients and their loved ones.\n  Congress recognized the important role of local pharmacists when it \nincluded a medication therapy management, MTM, benefit in the Medicare \nPart D Program. By improving patient health outcomes, we have seen \nbetter efficiency and savings in the prescription drug program. That is \nwhy I support community pharmacys' efforts to strengthen the MTM \nbenefit so it is available for seniors and others struggling with \nchronic conditions and other illnesses.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries also deserve access to the most cost-effective \nmedications. The Affordable Care Act made important changes to pharmacy \nreimbursement for generic drugs in the Medicaid program. The Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services recently issued a proposed rule to \nimplement these important changes, and it will be critical for Congress \nto monitor this rulemaking to ensure it is consistent with \ncongressional intent.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the vital role pharmacies play \nin the field of public health. All 50 States recognize the role \npharmacists play by supporting their ability to administer \nimmunizations and other important preventative services in Medicare, \nboth Part B and Part D, and other Federal health programs.\n  Today, as the cochair of the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus, I \ncelebrate the value of pharmacists and support efforts to protect \naccess to neighborhood and community pharmacies. I appreciate how \npharmacies improve the quality and reduce the costs of health care.\n  In recognition of the fourth annual NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol \nHill, I would like to congratulate pharmacy leaders, pharmacists, \nstudents, and executives, and the pharmacy community for their \ncontributions to the good health of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1844-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        COLORADO VETERANS RESOURCE COALITION AND CRAWFORD HOUSE\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to express my support \nand appreciation for the Colorado Veterans Resource Coalition, CVRC, \nand Crawford House, which has offered our veterans in Colorado Springs \na decade of support and recovery services.\n  CVRC was first formed on March 9, 2000, operating in a small, three-\nbedroom house on Cucharrus Street with a live-in house manager and two \nresidents. Its first dormitory was later named in honor of WWII Medal \nof Honor recipient and proud native son of Colorado, William J. \nCrawford, with his family's permission.\n  On February 14, 2012, Crawford House marked its 10th anniversary, \ncompleting its first decade of successful veteran recovery services to \nhomeless and disabled veterans in Colorado Springs. In that decade, \nmore than 1,100 veterans successfully completed Veterans Administration \nprograms, and 80 percent of these alumni remain successfully in the \ncommunity. Many of these veterans reestablished relationships with \ntheir spouses, families, and friends; completed secondary and advanced \neducation; and entered in to the workforce as self-sustaining citizens.\n  On December 1, 2003, the Colorado Veterans Resource Coalition and \nCrawford House added additional services, and on January 14, 2004, CVRC \nbegan purchasing two adjacent houses on Weber Street for graduating \nveterans to live in inexpensively while restarting their lives. These \nnew facilities freed Crawford House beds to treat more homeless and \ndisabled veterans. Today, both of these houses are fully paid for, \nwhich helps lower our future veteran treatment costs. It was my \nprivilege to tour Crawford House and to meet with the staff and \nresidents. The passion and commitment of those who work there, as well \nas their unending commitment to serving those who have served our \nNation, is an inspiration and example to all Coloradans.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I want the Record to show my deep \nappreciation and gratitude--along with that of all Coloradans--for the \ncontributions of volunteers, organizations, and individuals who \ncreated, expanded, and continually improved the Colorado Veterans \nResource Coalition and Crawford House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1844-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1844-S1845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WOODY HARRELL\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on the occasion of his upcoming \nretirement, I\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\nwant to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Woody Harrell, \nSuperintendent of Shiloh National Military Park, and a true scholar of \nthe Civil War. On April 6th and 7th, Shiloh National Military Park will \ncommemorate the 150th anniversary of the first major Civil War battle \nin the western theater. Shortly after the conclusion of these \nsesquicentennial activities, Woody Harrell will step down as Park \nSuperintendent. His contributions to the State of Mississippi and his \nleadership within the National Park Service Civil War community will \nhave a significant and long-lasting positive impact on this Nation.\n  A North Carolina native, Superintendent Harrell began his career at \nMoores Creek National Military Park in the summer of 1968. After \nservice in the United States Army, he worked at the three parks of the \nCape Hatteras group, most famously presenting a ``living history'' \nportrayal of aviation pioneer Orville Wright. He later served as \nDirector of Visitor Services under the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, and \nas an instructor at the Horace Albright Training Center. However, the \nmajority of his career has been spent working on Civil War sites, known \nby many in the National Park Service as the ``Cannonball Circuit.'' In \naddition to his time at Shiloh Battlefield, Superintendent Harrell's \nprevious assignments include Historian at Chickamauga and Chattanooga \nNational Military Park for 6 years and for 3 years at Manassas National \nBattlefield Park. Recently, he represented the National Service as an \nadvisor to several Civil War Sesquicentennial planning groups.\n  Serving in his current capacity since August 28, 1990, Superintendent \nHarrell has the distinct honor of having the longest tenure of any \nmanager in Shiloh Park's 117-year history. During a time of budget \nconstraints and limited resources, Superintendent Harrell has not only \nmaintained Shiloh's status as America's best preserved battlefield, he \nhas overseen a major expansion of the park into Mississippi with the \ncreation of a new Corinth Unit. By bringing together local, State, and \nnational stakeholders to identify and prioritize key surviving Civil \nWar resources, Harrell was able to build a consensus for a \ncomprehensive plan to preserve and interpret 18 nationally significant \nsites in northern Mississippi and southwest Tennessee. This broad \nsupport resulted in over 1,000 acres of battlefields, fortifications, \nand campsites being added to the Corinth Unit.\n  Superintendent Harrell is credited as the visionary force in planning \nand constructing the flagship of this addition, the award-winning \nCorinth Civil War Interpretive Center. While National Park Service \nInterpretation at Shiloh had formerly concentrated only on the 2-day, \n1862 battle, the Corinth facility now allows visitors to fully explore \nthe whole story of the Civil War, from the causes and coming of the \nwar, to the impact of multiple military occupations of Corinth on the \ncivilian population, and especially to the important first steps \ntowards full citizenship taken by over 6,000 formerly enslaved people \nat the Corinth Contraband Camp site.\n  Seeking to establish a natural buffer around historic Shiloh Hill, \nthus preventing future encroachment and inappropriate development, \nSuperintendent Harrell has partnered with the Civil War Trust on Shiloh \nBattlefield's most ambitious land acquisition program in over 75 years. \nOver 300 additional acres within Shiloh's original 1894 authorized \nboundary are now under National Park Service protection.\n  Stressing preservation, commemoration, and education, Superintendent \nHarrell for over 2 decades has partnered with neighboring communities \nto promote resource protection and heritage tourism. At Corinth, he has \nworked with the local business community to create an annual Heritage \nFestival that includes 12,000 luminaries: one for each American soldier \nkilled, wounded, or missing at the Siege and Battle of Corinth.\n  Even before the advent of the Internet, Superintendent Harrell \nconceived the Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System, an idea that has \ngrown into a searchable electronic database with 6.2 million records on \nCivil War veterans. This innovative and ambitious Park Service project \nallows visitors to access information on relatives and the units in \nwhich they fought, enabling families to trace an ancestor's service \nthroughout the war. All of the data entry for this project was done by \nvolunteers, with support groups ranging from the Mormon Church to the \nUnited Daughters of the Confederacy.\n  During the 1990s, Harrell partnered with the Corps of Engineers and \nthe Federal Highway Administration to halt riverbank erosion at the \nShiloh Indian Mounds National Historic Landmark, a problem that had \nplagued the park for over 20 years. During the mitigation archeology \nphase of this project, Superintendent Harrell worked closely with the \nChickasaw Nation to insure the tribe's involvement in preserving key \ncultural resources in the Shiloh portion of their original homeland.\n  One of Superintendent Harrell's final duties will be to premier a new \nShiloh documentary film as part of the battle's sesquicentennial \nevents. Entitled ``Shiloh: Fiery Trial,'' this new movie replaces \n``Shiloh: Portrait of a Battle,'' which has been shown continuously at \nthe park since 1956. Filmed with the participation of over 350 Civil \nWar re-enactors, ``Shiloh: Fiery Trial'' will soon be shown for the \nfirst time and then broadcast on many PBS stations on the eve of \nShiloh's 150th anniversary. It is fitting that Harrell not only served \nas executive producer for the project, but also makes a brief cameo \nappearance handing a message to General Grant.\n  Since March 2007, Woody has maintained a record of visiting every \nunit of the National Park System. In the past year, he added Martin \nLuther King, Jr., Memorial, Paterson Great Falls National Historical \nPark, and Fort Monroe National Monument to his list, which now stands \nat 397 parks. I know Superintendent Harrell and his family will enjoy \nthe new opportunities that come with retirement, as I understand his \nwife Cynthia and he have already made plans to hike the entire length \nof the Appalachian Trail.\n  Superintendent Harrell's career with the National Park Service has \nbeen marked with unprecedented accomplishments and is a superb legacy. \nHis exceptional leadership qualities and cultural preservation eminence \nare in the best tradition of the Park Service. He is a consummate \nprofessional whose performance in over 43 years of service has \npersonified those traits of competency and integrity that our Nation \nhas come to expect of its senior civilian leaders. On the occasion of \nhis upcoming retirement, I wish the Harrell family all the very best in \nthe years to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1845-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1845-S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING HORTON'S BOOKS & GIFTS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Wylie, Endicott College's fifth and current president. \nThrough this post and a variety of other positions in higher education, \nDr. Wylie has fully devoted himself to academic excellence.\n  Before assuming his role as president of Endicott College in Beverly, \nMA, Dr. Wylie served as a professor and administrator at a variety of \nother institutions, including the University of Connecticut, Temple \nUniversity, and Lesley College, and served on the board of New England \nAssociation of Schools and Colleges and the board at the Association of \nIndependent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts. Outside of the \nclassroom, he has written articles on higher education, authored a \nmonograph on bilingual and multicultural education, and published a \nvariety of children's books.\n  Most recently, Dr. Richard Wylie has overseen the tremendous growth \nand transformation of Endicott College. When he assumed his role in \n1987, Endicott was a small, two-year women's college; through his \nefforts, the College earned four-year status, became coeducational, \ntripled its enrollment, and greatly expanded its academic offerings. \nToday, Endicott College is recognized for its variety of degree \nprograms, including its brand new doctoral program.\n  Some of our country's greatest assets are educators like Dr. Wylie \nwho go above and beyond the call of duty every single day to instill a \nlove of knowledge in our country's citizens. His commitment to \neducation will inspire his students well beyond graduation and will \nimprove the sense of community and citizenship that is vital to any \neducational institution, and to this Nation.\n  I congratulate Dr. Richard E. Wylie on the occasion of his 25th \nAnniversary Scholarship Gala, thank him for his service in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, and salute all that he's \naccomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1846-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GLADE SANDERS\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Mr. Glade \nSanders, a fine Utah resident who was recently honored with the \nprestigious Outstanding Eagle Scout Award. Only 150 such awards have \nbeen bestowed upon individual scouts in the entire country.\n  Sanders also deserves congratulations for reaching the age of 100. He \nhas spent many of those years working tirelessly in his community, \nincluding the period during the Great Depression when he led his local \nBoy Scouts in Troop 133 as scoutmaster. Troop 133 recently celebrated \nSanders and his accomplishments during a Court of Honor.\n  Sanders joined the scouting program at 17 years of age. Once there, \nhowever, he spent 29 years as an active scouter. In those days, \nscoutmasters could become Eagles, and Sanders became the first Eagle \nScout in Nephi, UT, in 1934. He also received Scouting's Silver Beaver \nAward. Sanders would serve as scoutmaster for 9 years, toughing out the \nhard times of the Great Depression and helping his scouts do the same \nin whatever way he could.\n  Today, Sanders' name is engraved at the top of a plaque recognizing \nall of the Eagle Scouts of Troop 133. He has dedicated his life to \nhelping others and has earned his reward many times over by seeing \nyoung men attain the rank of Eagle. As a fellow scout, I deeply thank \nhim for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1846-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 473.

A bill to clarify the exception to foreign sovereign \nimmunity set forth in section 1605(a)(3) title 28, United States Code; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my \ncolleague and good friend Senator Hatch to introduce this bill, which \nwill resolve an unsettled issue that is making it difficult for museums \nand universities to obtain works of art for temporary exhibition from \nforeign countries.\n  Cultural exchange with foreign nations enables the sharing of ideas \nand history across the globe. When foreign works are shown at American \nmuseums, they expose our people to the richness of world history and \nculture.\n  In 2011, the San Diego Museum of Art hosted an exhibition of 64 works \nof famous Spanish artists, such as El Greco, Pablo Picasso, Francisco \nGoya, and Salvador Dali.\n  Also in 2011, the De Young Museum in San Francisco hosted an \nexhibition of more than 100 Picasso masterpieces from Paris, as well as \nmore than 100 objects from the Olmec civilization in Mexico.\n  In 2009, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art hosted an exhibit \ncontaining artifacts from the Ancient Roman city of Pompeii, which was \nburied by a volcanic eruption and rediscovered in the 18th Century.\n  In 2007, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art hosted an exhibit with \napproximately 250 works of art created in more than seven different \nLatin American countries between 1492 and 1820.\n  Without these exhibitions coming to American museums, many Americans \nsimply would not have the chance to see such important cultural and \nhistorical works in person. Exhibitions of such works also draw \ncountless visitors each year, helping museums--which are vital to the \npreservation of our own culture and heritage--survive and thrive in \ndifficult economic times.\n  For decades, American law has offered legal protection for these \nexhibitions. Passed in 1965, a law called the Immunity from Seizure \nAct, 22 U.S.C. 2459, is designed to provide the legal certainty \nnecessary for American museums to organize such exhibitions with their \nforeign counterparts.\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\n  This law empowers the President or his designee to approve a foreign \nwork for temporary exhibition or display in the United States, a \nprocess now handled by the State Department. If approval is granted, \nthen the work of art is essentially protected from judicial process--\nsuch as a court-ordered seizure--while it is in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, this important law has been undermined by a decision \nof the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia in a case called \nMalewicz v. City of Amsterdam.\n  In this case, the City of Amsterdam had made a temporary loan of \nworks of art for educational and cultural purposes to the Guggenheim \nMuseum in New York and the Menil Collection in Houston Texas.\n  Even though the State Department's approval was sought and received \nfor the temporary loan, the court held that the City of Amsterdam's \ntemporary loan nevertheless subjected the City to Federal court \njurisdiction in a lawsuit over the work of art.\n  The reason was that--even though the loan was for educational and \ncultural purposes, for works to be shown at museums--the City's \nactivities nevertheless qualified as ``commercial activity'' under a \nprovision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. \n1605(a)(3).\n  The result of this decision, unsurprisingly, is that foreign museums \nhave been more reluctant to lend their art works to our museums in the \nUnited States.\n  The Executive Branch during the Bush administration recognized this \nproblem and tried to correct it. It urged the D.C. Circuit to reverse \nthe decision, saying in an amicus brief that the District Court's \nruling was wrong, that it ``substantially undermine[d] the purposes'' \nof the Immunity from Seizure Act, and that it would ``discourage \nforeign states and other lenders from providing their artwork for \ntemporary exhibit in the United States.'' Unfortunately the appeal was \ndismissed before the D.C. Circuit had a chance to correct this problem. \nThat is why this bill is necessary.\n  Several museums in my home state--including the San Francisco Museum \nof Modern Art, the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, the Los Angeles \nCounty Museum of Art, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford \nUniversity, and the Santa Barbara Museum of Art--have asked me to help \nrestore the legal certainty that existed prior to the Malewicz \ndecision. I know that institutions in Senator Hatch's home State of \nUtah have sought his help in this regard as well.\n  I am very pleased to say that Senator Hatch and I have worked \ntogether--along with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, \nRanking Member John Conyers, and Representatives Steve Chabot and Steve \nCohen--to draft a narrow bill that we hope can be enacted quickly this \nyear.\n  This bill is simple. It relies on the State Department's approval \nprocess. If the State Department approves a loan of a foreign art \nwork--essentially immunizing the work from judicial seizure under \nexisting law--then the foreign state's activities associated with the \nwork's exhibition cannot be used to assert jurisdiction over the \nforeign state under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. \n1605(a)(3).\n  This narrow approach does only what is necessary to fix the problem \ncreated by the Malewicz decision--nothing more, nothing less.\n  It is important to note that this bill would not apply if the foreign \nstate does not seek or receive the State Department's approval. The \nState Department requires detailed certifications and independent \ninvestigations about an art work's provenance before it grants \napproval. The bill also expressly would not apply to any work taken in \nEurope by the Nazis or their collaborators.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Hatch and my colleagues in the House for \nworking with me on this important legislation, which has already passed \nthe House of Representatives by voice vote. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I join the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, in introducing legislation to clarify the legal protections \nfor art that is loaned from overseas for exhibition in the United \nStates. This bill passed the House yesterday by voice vote and I hope \nit can soon become law.\n  We are blessed in this country to have so many fine institutions that \nprovide exposure to the art, culture, and history of other lands. Both \npublic and private art museums can be found all over America, including \nat many of our fine universities. We must ensure that the exhibitions \nhosted by these museums continue to benefit all Americans.\n  A major exhibition can take years to develop and potential overseas \nlenders must be assured that their art will be legally protected while \nit is in the United States. Many exhibitions simply will not be \npossible without that assurance. We have had laws in place for decades \nthat did just that, and they worked exactly the way they were supposed \nto. Specifically, the Protection from Seizure Act guaranteed that once \nthe State Department reviewed and certified an exhibition as being in \nthe national interest, the art was immune from legal judgments or court \norders while in this country.\n  This legal protection was thrown into doubt by a Federal court \ndecision several years ago. The U.S. District Court here in the \nWashington considered a case involving the Foreign Sovereign Immunities \nAct, which allows certain kinds of lawsuits against foreign countries \nin American courts. One of those categories is when art allegedly taken \nin violation of international law is present in this country in \nconnection with a commercial activity. The court construed that \ncondition of being present ``in connection with a commercial activity'' \nin a way that could include art that is here for exhibition under the \nProtection from Seizure Act.\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\n  The dilemma here is easy to see. These statutes are not supposed to \nbe in conflict. Bringing art here under the protection of one statute \nis not supposed to create jurisdiction for a lawsuit against the lender \nunder another statute.\n  The solution is also easy to see. The bill we introduce today is very \nshort and very simple. It clarifies that the presence in this country \nof art under the Protection from Seizure Act does not create \njurisdiction for a lawsuit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. \nIt simply returns these two statutes to the harmony they were intended \nto have all along and to lift the cloud of doubt that has hung over the \nart exhibition process for the last several years.\n  I want to thank the Brigham Young University Museum of Art for \nbringing this issue to my attention. The BYU museum is the premier art \nmuseum in the Mountain West and the most attended university art museum \nin North America. BYU is the organizing institution for a major \nexhibition titled Beauty and Belief: Crossing Bridges with the Art of \nIslamic Cultures. This amazing event, which will be at BYU through \nSeptember and is free to the public, includes art from a dozen foreign \ncountries. As this project was in development, the museum director \nraised with me the need to clarify the law protecting art loaned for \nexhibition. Thankfully, the BYU exhibition was not hindered, but the \nAssociation of Art Museum Directors has documented that this is a \nproblem elsewhere.\n  This is a problem that is easy to fix. It is not a partisan or an \nideological issue. It is not a spending program. It involves neither \nregulations nor taxes. Each of our States has institutions that can \nbenefit from this clarification. As my colleagues will see, we did put \na caveat in the bill so that it will not apply to the ongoing efforts \nto identify and recover art and cultural objects seized by the Nazis \nduring the World War II era.\n  Again, I want to applaud the BYU Museum of Art for its triumphant \nexhibition and for bringing this issue to my attention so that \nAmericans can continue to enjoy this enriching and educational \nexperience. I thank my colleague from California for introducing this \nbill, and for working to refine its language so that we can solve this \nspecific problem. This short bill proves that good things can come in \nsmall packages and I hope the Senate will follow the House and quickly \npass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/20/senate-section/article/S1850-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 400--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF PROFESSIONAL \n              SOCIAL WORK MONTH AND WORLD SOCIAL WORK DAY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Levin, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Ms. Cantwell, and Ms. \nLandrieu) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
