Madam President, today the chairman of the House \nBudget Committee, Congressman Paul Ryan, is releasing a serious and \ndetailed plan for getting our Nation's fiscal house in order. \nCongressman Ryan's plan would put us on a path to reducing the national \ndebt, it would strengthen the social safety net so we can keep the \npromises made to the Nation's seniors, it proposes a way for Washington \nto start living within its means, and it will repeal last year's health \ncare law which will raise health care costs, lead to fewer jobs, and \nwhich Americans have rejected. Congressman Ryan is presenting a plan, \nin other words, to address our most pressing problems head-on at a \nmoment when the President and other Democratic leaders simply refuse to \ndo so themselves. He is doing what his constituents have sent him here \nto do.\n  Anybody can say our Nation's problems need to be addressed, but \nhistory will show that Chairman Ryan is one of those who actually \nstepped up to do\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nit. He should be applauded for that by people of good will on both \nsides. Unfortunately, we already know how many Democrats intend to \nrespond to this plan. We have heard their spin already. In the absence \nof any solutions of their own to a looming entitlement fiasco and the \ntestimony of countless experts on the fiscal perils we face, Democrats \nintend to use Congressman Ryan's plan against anyone who supports it--\ndespite the facts. They will try to scare the public by claiming it \nsays things that it does not. They will squander the golden opportunity \nwe have right now to tackle the biggest problems we face in a \nbipartisan way, the way our predecessors did when the two parties \nshared power in Washington, all in the name of having an edge in the \nnext election. Frankly, it is shameful.\n  Americans elect their President and Senators and Congressmen to lead. \nThey don't expect us to agree on everything, but they expect us to work \ntogether when a problem becomes so pressing that cooperation across \nparty lines is required. Now is such a moment. The debt is at crisis \nlevels, posing a threat not just to businesses and families planning \nfor the future but to our national security.\n  Since the President has taken office, nearly 3 million Americans have \nlost their jobs. As a result of the ongoing housing crisis, millions of \nhomeowners are currently underwater on their mortgages. The only \nindustry that seems to be growing is government, and the only city that \nseems to be isolated from problems most Americans face right now is \nWashington--all at taxpayers' expense.\n  The budget debate in which we have been engaged in the past several \nweeks is the direct result of the fact that Democrats in Congress \nfailed to pass one of their own for the current fiscal year. \nRepublicans had to step in and do it for them. Now, 6 months into the \ncurrent fiscal year, the President and current Members of Congress \nstill have yet to produce a plan of their own. House Republicans have \nproduced multiple plans, including one they will offer today which \nfunds our troops through the end of the year, keeps the government \nrunning, and gets us one step closer to the level of spending cuts that \neven the senior Senator from New York has described as reasonable. \nUnfortunately, Democrats would rather take potshots at these proposals \nfrom the side lines, hoping they become unpopular with the public so \nthey can benefit politically. They have completely and totally \nabdicated their responsibility.\n\n  I would like to applaud Congressman Ryan not only for the energy and \ncreativity and seriousness which he has brought to these issues but \nalso for his courage in doing so at a time when Democrats in Washington \nwould rather sit on their hands. By stepping forward, he has forced a \nmuch needed debate about the many crises of the moment. It is my hope \nthat our friends on the other side recognize this effort for what it \nis--a serious, good-will effort to do something good and necessary for \nthe future of our Nation--and that for the good of the Nation, they \nwill join this effort at some point before it is too late.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2096-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             1099 PROVISION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as I have traveled across Kentucky \nover the past year, I have heard from countless small business owners \nwho told me how burdensome the so-called 1099 provision in the \nDemocrats' health care bill would be to implement and how it could \nhamper their ability to create good private sector jobs. I hope they \nare tuning in to the Senate floor today so they can watch the vote on \nits repeal.\n  This has been a hard-fought effort, and all of the credit should go \nto the junior Senator from Nebraska, my good friend Senator Mike \nJohanns. He has led this fight on behalf of the countless entrepreneurs \nand small business owners across the country who raised the alarm on \nthis issue.\n  This is a big win for small business. Importantly, it is also the \nfirst of what I hope are many successful repeal votes related to the \ndisastrous health spending bill the Democrats passed last year. The \nmore Americans learn about this bill, the less they like it. We hope we \ncan respond to their concerns with many repeal votes like the one we \nare going to have this morning right here in Congress. Then we will \nreplace it with the kind of commonsense reforms that will actually \nlower costs and encourage job creation.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Johanns for his leadership and hard work \non repealing this onerous provision. This is a classic example of a \nSenator who listened to his constituents, developed a solution, won the \nsupport of his colleagues, and doggedly pursued a course of action that \nled to today's vote. America's small businesses can thank Senator \nJohanns for pushing this initiative across the finish line.

Madam President, we hear a lot about the disaster and \nthings that are taking place and the loss of lives in Libya as well as \nmany other places, particularly in the last few months. But going \nseemingly unnoticed is probably just as great a disaster that is \nhappening in Cote D'Ivoire right now as we speak.\n  I came to the floor yesterday, and I talked about the fact that \nelections took place in Cote D'Ivoire last November. The President, the \nincumbent President, Laurent Gbagbo, was challenged by Alassane \nOuattara. They claim Ouattara won the election. Ouattara comes from the \nnorth, the Muslim area up there.\n  We found so much voter fraud that we identified, and we specifically \ntalked about on the Senate floor, that I have asked Secretary Clinton, \nby letter twice, to intervene and demand a new election.\n  When I say ``voter fraud,'' I entered this in the Record yesterday, \nso I will not do it again today. But this shows how they miscalculated \nall those votes in the north. In just one precinct, 100,000 votes--\nwell, actually 94,873. Obviously, if we have 100,000 or so votes in \nthat one precinct, it can happen that way.\n  But use logic. If all else fails, stop and think about this. How \ncould it be possible that in the northern part of Cote D'Ivoire, when \nthey had the election, what we would call the primary election, \nPresident Gbagbo got thousands, thousands of votes in each one of the \nprecincts. Yet when the runoff came, he got zero. That is a statistical \nimpossibility. I think for those of us--certainly, the United States \nthought the U.N. and perhaps France was accurate in their initial \nresponse to this thing that we were going to have to get something \ndone.\n  Let me go ahead and finish what happened. I mentioned yesterday in \nthe town of Duekoue, Ouattara's forces, along with the French, went in \nthere, murdered about--we think something over 1,000 people. We get the \nreports from the Red Cross and from other sources.\n  But Ouattara has tried to deny his involvement in this slaughter. His \nforces took the town earlier, and this was the week after the Gbagbo \nforces had gone. I think we can just look at Guillaume Ngefa, who is \nthe deputy head of the U.N. mission in Cote D'Ivoire.\n  He said Ouattara's forces had carried out the killings in Duekoue. \n``We have evidence. We have pictures. This was retaliation.''\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\n  So we have all this evidence I mentioned yesterday which was part of \nit. I read yesterday from the Guardian, the British Guardian. The U.N. \nmission said traditional hunters, known as Dozos, fought alongside \nOuattara's forces and took part in killing 330 people in the western \ntown of Duekoue, which we now know is over 1,000 people. The \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross said at least 800 people. It \ngoes on and on, which I made a part of the Record yesterday.\n  In addition to that, we have a statement that was made on the BBC \nyesterday. Keep in mind, they have, in Duekoue--they murdered all those \npeople. They have mass graves. People are charred and burned. I am \ngoing to quote right now, so hold your stomach.\n\n       I spot four pigs eating something dark in a charred \n     courtyard. Standing by a newly dug mass grave, a U.N. soldier \n     from Morocco is choking with rage and grief. I ask him if the \n     dead are children. He nods and begins to sob quietly into his \n     face mask.\n\n  So we know of this disaster that has taken place there, and we do \nnothing. We know about it. I just will say: America, wake up. The \nmassacre could have been avoided if Ouattara had accepted the mediation \neffort from the African Union. President Gbagbo did accept, Ouattara \ndid not. He rejected it, and I think we know why he rejected it--\nbecause he wants that power. He wants that job.\n  Anyway, where we are now--and I am going to try to get this all in--\nthe United States should call for a ceasefire and for a new election. I \nhave also been told, within the last day, that the U.N. helicopters, \nU.S. peacekeeping helicopters are firing upon Gbagbo's military camp.\n  Lastly, I have sent a letter to the Foreign Relations Committee \nChairman John Kerry. Let me applaud John Kerry. He has agreed to hold a \nhearing to look at this. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate it \nbecause it takes courage to stand up against the United Nations and \nFrance and our State Department and admit that we have to look into \nthis. So that is exactly what we are going to do.\n  But that was yesterday on the floor. What has happened? What happened \nlast night? Last night, the job was finished. They went in, and they \nmassacred I do not know how many people.\n  President Gbagbo had young children who were surrounding his palace \nand his residence. They are willing to sacrifice their lives to save \ntheir country from the French influence they are getting with Ouattara.\n  They were armed with baseball bats and 2 by 4s. I do not know, there \nare hundreds of them out there. Last night, Sarkozy had gone to \nSecretary General Moon and said: Use my forces to end this, and they \ndid. We know what happened last night.\n  Maybe you do not know what happened last night. They went in with \nhelicopters and with rockets, and they destroyed most of a major city, \nAbidjan, the capital of Cote D'Ivoire. We have evidence. I hope people \nwill take advantage of this, particularly those people--I know there \nare a lot of people out there who are opposed to any intervention we \nhave. They do not truly care about Sub-Saharan Africa. No one cares \nabout Sub-Saharan Africa.\n  I have stood on this floor time and time again, back when we were \nsending troops into Bosnia, and the excuse was ethnic cleansing. I \nsaid: For every 1 day in any town in any country in Sub-Saharan Africa, \nthere are more people ethnically cleansed than in any day in Bosnia.\n  But nobody seemed to care. So we have hundreds of kids around there, \nand last night they were mowed down. If anyone questions this, you can \naccess on my Internet, inhofe.senate.gov, and get the YouTube that \nshows graphically what they are doing. I do not know how many hundreds, \nhow many thousands of people were brutally murdered last night by the \nFrench, supporting Ouattara. It is something we need to get involved \nin.\n  When I look at President Obiang, who is from Equatorial Guinea, he is \nthe chairman of the African Union. He says he condemned the foreign \nintervention in the Ivory Coast. We stand by idly, and we don't do \nanything about it.\n\n  I renew my request to Secretary Clinton and to the State Department \nand to others who care about the loss of innocent life in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, specifically in Abidjan and Cote d'Ivoire, to come forward and \nhelp us find justice. I hope President Gbabgo and his wife Simone are \nnot dead today. They might be dying as we speak. They are raiding their \nresidence, raiding the palace. It is a brutal mess. I don't think I \nhave ever seen in the years I have been here, particularly coming from \nFrance, supported by Sarkozy, the raid on innocent lives in sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  If no one else comes in, I will talk longer. I ask unanimous consent \nto speak until someone comes in to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I guess you might wonder why I am \nconcerned. I have had an interest in sub-Saharan Africa for quite some \ntime. After 9/11, finally the United States decided they would do \nsomething of concern in sub-Saharan Africa. So what we have had since \nthat time is an interest in helping them to build African brigades, as \nthe terrorists come down through the Horn of Africa and Djibouti and \ninto the continent. We need to help the Africans build brigades so they \ncan resist, not doing it for them, not doing it in place of the \nAfricans, but to help them so they can defend themselves. That is \nexactly what we have been doing.\n  I have been honored to be the point man on the Armed Services \nCommittee to go over and work with these guys. These countries in \nAfrica are our friends. They participate in programs such as the IMET \nprogram that allows us to train their officers in the United States, \nsuch as the Train and Equip Program that allows us to work with them \nand train these individuals. When we see an atrocity such as this take \nplace, when we visualize the young kids out there being brutally \nmurdered, we should do something about it.\n  I praise someone who philosophically I have not agreed with most of \nthe time, Senator John Kerry, Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I am on his committee as well as Armed Services. He is \nsympathetic to what is going on and has agreed to having a hearing. \nThere is a man named Meltheodore. He was the mayor, when I first met \nhim, mayor of Abidjan in Cote d'Ivoire. He is currently a member of \nParliament in Cote d'Ivoire. He is the head of an opposing political \nparty to President Gbagbo. He was a candidate against President Gbagbo \nwhen he ran successfully for President. Here is a guy who would have \nevery reason to be opposed to President Gbagbo. Yet he is willing to \ntestify before Senator Kerry's committee that not only did they rig the \nelection, but he showed the documentation on rigging the election, and \nwe should be in a position where we could strongly recommend another \nelection.\n  I have nothing against Alassane Ouattara except I do know that he has \nbeen an enemy of the Gbagbos since long before 2002, when he was \nopposed to him. This is, I guess, the final kill. But at what expense \nis this coming? It is coming at a high expense in terms of a number we \ncan't quantify today. If colleagues don't believe it, look it up. They \ncan get the YouTube site. They can watch what happened last night. They \ncan get that off of my Web site, inhofe.senate.gov.\n  I see my friend Senator Manchin from West Virginia. Before yielding \nthe floor, I wish to applaud him for his being courageous and standing \nup for doing something about the EPA taking over the regulation of \ngreenhouse gases that would put coal and oil and gas out of our reach. \nI applaud Senator Manchin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank my good friend for his hard work. We are working \nin a bipartisan manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2097-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2097-S2099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WEST VIRGINIA COAL MINERS\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN.

I rise to honor\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\ntheir courage, sacrifice, and the extraordinary strength of their \nfamilies.\n  I want to say a few words about the proud men and women today who go \nunderground and go unrecognized and make sure that our great Nation can \nkeep the lights on. When some people see a coal miner walk out from \nunderground, they see some someone who is tired, wearing dust-covered \noveralls, steel boots, carrying a hard hat and a dinner bucket, and \nthey make a few flawed assumptions about the amount of education they \nmay or may not have or that they had nowhere else to turn, that was the \nonly job available. I wish everyone to know that those assumptions are \ndead wrong.\n  West Virginia coal miners are the backbone of this country, providing \nthe power for the lights in this Chamber, the steel and the machinery \nthat built our country, the greatest industrial power in the world, the \nmilitary that keeps us safe and free, and the energy for homes and \nbusinesses all over the country. West Virginia miners understand \ngeology, mathematics and physics, the way a seam runs through the Earth \nand how to safely extract its bounty to make our country stronger. \nAbove all, West Virginia miners are the salt of the Earth--patriotic, \nGod-fearing, family loving and family oriented, and proud of their hard \nwork. In our State we have always done the heavy lifting. We are very \nproud of what we have contributed to this country time and again--in \ntimes of war, times of peace, in times of prosperity, and in times of \nneed. At a time when our Nation's attention and misplaced pity will \nagain focus on coal miners because of the first anniversary of the \nworst mining disaster in the last 40 years, we West Virginians want the \nworld to know we are proud of our coal mining heritage and our future.\n  As West Virginia's former Governor, now U.S. Senator, I want to tell \nAmericans not only about our sacrifice but also our dedication to our \nshared future. The miners of West Virginia and their families are the \nheart and soul of West Virginia and an inspiration for me and my \nfamily. We should all draw strength from the courage they have shown \nus.\n  Allow me to turn to the terrible day a year ago. In remembering the \nUpper Big Branch disaster, my thoughts turn first to the families of \nthe 29 miners who went to work that day on April 5, 2010, and didn't \ncome home. In the days following the violent explosion, which remains \nunder investigation today, I spent all day and every day for 5 days \nwaiting to find out with the families if their loved ones were alive or \ndead. Those families and I stayed together at midnight and dawn, \nthrough moments of hope and despair, on pins and needles in the early \ndays and in shared grief when the full scope of the devastation hit us \nas the rescuers didn't find any more survivors. We prayed together \nbefore and after each briefing. We recited the Pledge of Allegiance. We \nheld each other and cried together. Restaurant owners donated food. Our \nown WVU coach Bob Huggins visited. And one young man, Nick Helms, whom \nI remember so well, whose father was killed in the Sago mining disaster \nin 2006, came down personally and offered his moral support from his \nfirsthand experiences.\n\n  In those days the unbreakable bonds of family became clear. One \nfamily alone lost three good men. I first told Charles and Linda Davis, \nthe parents of Timmy and the grandparents of Cory and Josh. I told \nTommy--and Tommy was another brother who had worked in the mine and \njust came off the shift. Tommy was the father of Cory. I also told \nPatty--large families--and Patty is the daughter of Linda and Charles, \nand she was Josh's mother. So in the mine we had Timmy, the uncle, and \nwe had Josh and Cory. All three men had been found, but they perished. \nThe first question I got from Tommy after I told his parents was: Were \nthey all together?\n  I said: Yes, they were.\n  Tommy replied: I knew my brother Timmy would be taking care of the \nboys.\n  That was not my State's first mining disaster or mine. When I was a \nyoung man, my only family went through the tragedy of the Farmington \nNo. 9 explosion in 1968. Seventy-eight miners were killed that day. It \nleft a searing impression on me. Of course, we didn't know right away \nhow bad it would get. Everyone camped out at the company store. We were \nall waiting for any word before the authorities finally came and told \nus all that the decision had been made to seal the mine which \nessentially meant entombing all of them. In that disaster I lost my \nuncle, my next-door neighbor, some of my high school classmates. One of \nmy strongest lessons that has stayed with me to this day is that \nwaiting families should be systematically updated on the progress of \nthe rescue operation. I know firsthand that a minute seems like an \nhour, an hour seems like a day, and a day seems like eternity. With \nconsistent updates, waiting becomes a little more bearable.\n  During my term as Governor, in the three tragedies we went through--\nSago and Aracoma in 2006, and last year at Upper Big Branch--we briefed \nthe families every 2 hours. It was a cycle. We received a briefing from \nour authorities, then we briefed the families, then we told the media. \nIt was a cycle we continued until the fate of all miners was known.\n  We have learned a lot in West Virginia. After disasters at Sago and \nAracoma, we enacted more safety measures in my term as Governor than in \nthe 30 years before. We have become a leader in safety, and what we are \nimplementing is being used across all types of mining, all over the \ncountry and around the world. The bottom line is that in our State, we \nwon't tolerate intimidation from any person or company that puts \nprofits ahead of safety. I truly believe that the single most important \nelement in any mining operation is the men and women who work there \nevery day. Under my watch, we empowered those individual miners and \ntheir families to take more ownership and control over their own safety \nwithout fear of retribution, with a 24-hour anonymous hotline to report \nunsafe conditions. Since May of last year we have had 86 calls. We \nresponded.\n  At the end of the day, though, the families, the people of West \nVirginia and all Americans need to know how this tragedy happened and \nwhat we must do to prevent anything this terrible from ever happening \nagain. We are still waiting for the results of the Federal and State \ninvestigations as well as an independent report from my special \nappointed investigator J. Davitt McAteer, a West Virginia native and \nassistant secretary for the Mine Safety and Health Administration under \nPresident Bill Clinton. We will look at the results of their \ninvestigation to determine what happened, make certain it doesn't \nhappen again, and determine whether anyone, through intimidation or \notherwise, put profits ahead of safety and that the people responsible \nare held accountable.\n  In the meantime I am cosponsoring a piece of legislation with Senator \nJay Rockefeller, the Robert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety and \nHealth Act of 2011. It is designed to improve compliance with existing \nmine and occupational safety and health laws, empowering workers to \nraise safety concerns, prevent future mine and other workplace \ntragedies, and establish the rights of the families of victims of \nworkplace accidents. Last week I spoke again to Tommy Davis, the man \nwho lost his brother, his nephew, and his son at the Upper Big Branch \nmine. When I asked him what he was doing these days, Tommy gave me a \nsimple answer: Joe, I am back in the mines. Tommy is proud to be a \nminer. And while he and all of us have much to mourn today, we also \nhave the chance to honor the memories of the 29 dedicated men who died \na year ago and their colleagues who continue their work with respect \nand dignity.\n  Finally, Gayle and I and all West Virginians pray for continued \nstrength and courage for the families who lost loved ones on this sad \nday a year ago. May God bless each one of them. May God bless the great \nState of West Virginia, and may God continue to bless the United States \nof America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2099-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 60 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled between \nthe two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Madam President. I understand Senator Baucus \nis on his way from a meeting, and in the interim I will start off and \nrecognize myself.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of middle-class families and on \nbehalf of small businesses. I support repealing the 1099 reporting \nrequirement and have, in fact, voted no less than six times on this \nfloor to repeal 1099 in this body. However, I strongly believe we must \ndo so in a manner that does not increase the burden on our small \nbusinesses and their employees, and that is exactly what I fear H.R. 4 \ndoes.\n  The broad bipartisan support for 1099 repeal comes from the fact that \nit provides relief to small businesses, but the only problem with this \nversion of the repeal is that while it provides relief on the one hand, \nit may very well take it away with the other. It repeals the 1099 \nreporting requirements but, at the same time, I am concerned it \nincreases the health care burden on the very same people to whom we are \nseeking to provide relief.\n  Some have argued we have already used this very same offset before. \nWe have. Therefore, there is no reason to be concerned now.\n  The difference is, however, H.R. 4 is very different than what we did \n4 months ago, and it risks driving up health insurance costs and \ncutting health insurance coverage for small businesses and middle-class \nfamilies. It increases tax penalties--tax penalties. As we approach \nApril 15, I know we are all very tax sensitive. It increases tax \npenalties on middle-class families, leaving some with a potential tax \nburden of $10,000 or more.\n  How would most middle-class families deal with a tax bill of $10,000 \nor more just because their income may have increased $1 above the \neligibility limit during the year for which they got a subsidy?\n  Some have also argued my amendment will block implementation of the \n1099 repeal. That is just factually incorrect. It is an outright \nmisstatement of the facts. My amendment simply directs the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services after--emphasize ``after''--the 1099 repeal \npasses into law to study the offset in H.R. 4 and determine its effect \non small businesses. If the study finds the offset increases health \ncare costs or decreases coverage for small businesses, then current law \non the repayment remains in effect. If the study says, no, it didn't do \nany of those things, then there is no harm.\n  Let me be clear. We all want 1099 repeal. My amendment does not in \nany way affect the repeal of 1099. My colleagues can vote for this \namendment and for H.R. 4 because this would repeal 1099. The only \npotential change my amendment makes would be to the risky offset in the \nunderlying amendment, and only if the study finds that it hurts small \nbusinesses after the repeal has taken place.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to frame this \ndebate as either for or against small business, but they are, in my \nmind, both helping and harming them at the same time under H.R. 4. With \nthis amendment, we can have not only the ability to help small \nbusinesses and repeal the 1099 provision, but we can also ensure that \nsmall businesses and their employees will not get hurt at the end of \nthe day.\n  For those who may consider opposing my amendment, think of this: On \nthe one hand, if you do not believe this offset will hurt small \nbusinesses and their employees, there is no harm in voting for it \nbecause you are saying the study will not show an impact and the offset \nwill remain in place.\n  However, if you believe my amendment would have a revenue score, you \nare assuming that the offset hurts small businesses and their \nemployees. Either option would argue for supporting my amendment. \nEither it has no impact, in which case there should be no problem \nsupporting it, or it provides protections for small businesses and \ntheir workers, in which case you should want to support it.\n  I realize what I am concerned about is the harmful effect of this \noffset provision won't hit small businesses until 2015, and I know the \nvoices for 1099 repeal are much louder than those against the payback \ntax. But I also know this is an issue that we will hear about when our \nconstituents get those tax bills at that time, when this provision goes \ninto effect and taxpayers get that first big $10,000, or more, surprise \non their tax bill.\n  Do you want to be on the record as having given them the tax bill or \ndo you want to be on the record as trying to have saved them from it \nand saved rising costs for small businesses in their health insurance? \nI think you want to be on the side of this amendment and having saved \nthem from it.\n  In closing, I ask, why in the world--especially during these fragile \neconomic times--would we want to do anything that could raise the costs \non small businesses? That is why my amendment is supported by entities \nsuch as the Main Street Alliance, a probusiness organization; Families \nUSA; the American Cancer Society; Cancer Action Network; Health Care \nfor America Now, to mention a few.\n  With my amendment, we can protect those who earn a living making our \nNation's small businesses run and repeal 1099 without delay. To me, \nthat is the ultimate show of support for small business.\n  Madam President, I urge support of my amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am going to defer my remarks until \nafter\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\nthe Senator from Nebraska speaks. I want to defer to this wonderful \nSenator because he has done more than any other person in trying to \nrepeal this awful tax provision, this 1099 tax increase provision, and \nhe deserves the credit. I want him to lead off in our debate. Then I \nwill probably speak after that. I yield for the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I wish to start today by thanking the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah for his courtesy. I appreciate it \nimmensely. It has been a bit of a long and tortured process to get here \ntoday. I appreciate the opportunity to speak first.\n  All of us work across our States. In communities such as Kearney and \nScottsbluff, NE--and I walk those streets often, whether it is in a \nparade or calling on people--I am struck by the number of small \nbusinesses that fill the storefronts.\n  These businesses are the heart and soul of the community. They \ncontribute to the Little League, they give high school students their \nfirst jobs, and they ask ``how are the kids doing'' when you stop in to \nsee them. They symbolize what it truly means to be a community. They \nalso symbolize the single most powerful job creating force in our \nNation.\n  Sixty-four percent of the new jobs in our Nation are created by small \nbusinesses as they expand and grow. So when their livelihood is \nthreatened by an ill-advised policy, we all in the Senate agree that \nsomething must be done.\n  Shortly after the health care bill was passed, I, like my colleagues, \nbegan hearing from small business owners who were very concerned about \na provision that was put into the health care bill on page 737. As the \nnumber of concerned job creators continued to mount, I knew, and others \nin the Senate knew, we had to do something about it.\n  Passing 1099 repeal exemplifies why I came to the Senate--taking an \nissue that is important to our State and our country and literally \nbuilding support in this body to do the right thing.\n  I won't deny there have been some frustrations along the way. I \ncertainly didn't expect to have to present the legislation seven times \nto get to the finish line. But it has been well worth the effort. I \ncould not be more pleased by the bipartisan support that has built this \neffort.\n  Today presents an opportunity for Members of both parties to unite \nbehind doing the right thing for our job creators.\n  If we pass H.R. 4 and send it on to the President's desk today, it \nwon't be a victory for Republicans or Democrats. I certainly won't \nreport it that way. It is not going to be a victory for a single \nSenator. It will be a victory for millions of small business owners who \nhave been begging us to do something about this provision for a long \ntime now, and it will be a victory for common sense.\n  That is why today is such an important day in the Senate. In a few \nshort minutes, we will have an opportunity to put to an end the looming \n1099 paperwork mandate once and for all. Small businesses in my State \nand all across the country are depending upon us today to act.\n  One real-life example came from a Nebraska company called Hayneedle. \nIt is an online retailer of home furnishings and other home products. \nWith the new 1099 requirement, Hayneedle estimates that the annual cost \nof compliance is literally going to exceed $100,000 for them--$100,000. \nThat would go a long way to hiring more people.\n  Adding insult to injury, the 1099 reporting requirement creates a \nperverse incentive to consolidate suppliers. Fewer suppliers means less \n1099 paperwork. This leaves Main Street small suppliers--those \nbusinesses I was talking about--out in the cold as big suppliers win \nmore and more business.\n  Dale Black, a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise owner from Grand \nIsland, told me:\n\n     . . . want to be a good corporate citizen in the communities \n     I have restaurants, but the 1099 forces me not to hire local \n     venders and tradesmen in my community, instead giving work to \n     a single regional contractor.\n\n  With 40 million businesses, nonprofits, churches, and local \ngovernments bracing for the 1099 avalanche of paperwork, every Senator \ncould come to the floor today and tell similar stories.\n  With all these Main Street businesses and their workers hanging in \nthe balance, there is just one clear choice for our businesses: We must \nadvance the House-passed version and, in all due respect to my \ncolleague from New Jersey, reject the Menendez alternative, the \nMenendez amendment.\n  You see, only the House-passed version will quickly reach the \nPresident's desk and provide immediate relief to our job creators. \nAdding anything on, passing anything else will cause our job creators \nto wait on the sidelines yet again, because then, of course, we will \nhave different versions--the House version and the Senate version--and \nI fear we will go off into never-never land. But you see, time has run \nout on our job creators.\n  When this debate began, the mandate seemed a long way away. It was \nout there on the horizon. We had a long time to work through these \nissues. But now 8 months has passed. We voted over and over again, and \nwe never could quite get to the finish line.\n  It is decision time for businesses. They are feeling the pressure to \nset up the accounting systems they will need to comply with this \ntangled mess of tax forms that even the IRS doesn't support.\n  This mandate forces many to set aside money for software that could \ninstead be spent on those new workers, and that is why it is so \nimportant that the Senate pass the House bill today.\n  Put simply, a vote for the House bill is a vote to actually solve the \nproblem. Again, in all due respect to my colleague from New Jersey, the \namendment tells our small businesses that they will have to wait \nlonger. Our path actually gives our job creators some certainty they \nneed to grow their businesses. But the other path, as I said, is a \nguaranteed sidetrack back into never-never land.\n  While one approach tells small businesses we are with them, the other \nsays we are going to continue to work through this and wrangle back and \nforth, instead of enacting a bipartisan solution today.\n  The House of Representatives has already led by example. It is \nimportant to recognize that. They passed their 1099 repeal on March 3--\nmore than a month ago--and it got great bipartisan support--314 to 112, \nand 76 Democrats voted for that repeal.\n  Not only does this legislation pay for the repeal of the 1099 \nmandate, it actually reduces the deficit by $166 million over the next \n10 years.\n  It requires repayment of improper health exchange subsidies--a \nconcept the Senate passed unanimously in December to pay for the doc \nfix legislation.\n  If we fail to pass the House version today, well, the job creators \nare being told that they have to divert more of their resources to \nmanaging unnecessary paperwork.\n  Let's not vote for another alternative that is going to stall this \nout again. Let's cast a vote today that sends a clear message. Let's \ndefeat the pending Menendez amendment, and then let's pass the bill so \nwe can get it to the President and get it signed. I am hoping this gets \nstrong bipartisan support. I want to say again that the victory today \nis not for either party or for a single Senator; it is for the job \ncreators who are depending upon our action today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my colleague from New Jersey proposed what \nI think is a very reasonable amendment to the revenue provision of the \nrepeal of this 1099 provision. I plan to support that. It is a good \namendment.\n  One of the key provisions in the Affordable Care Act is the tax \ncredit that will be available to millions of low- and middle-income \nAmericans to purchase health insurance if their employer doesn't make \ncoverage available. That is a credit. It goes to middle- and low-income \nAmericans. The provision that will pay for 1099 repeal will increase \nthe amount that many Americans will have to pay at the end of the year \nif they receive a credit to purchase their health insurance and their \nincome ends up being higher than the income on which their credit was \nbased.\n  I share Senator Menendez's concern that this will cause an undue \nburden.\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\nThis could increase premiums that people pay under health insurance, or \nreduce the benefits of their health insurance coverage, especially in \nthe small business community, and he believes his amendment would \nreverse the provision--and it does in fact do that--if the HHS \nSecretary determines it will increase premiums or if it will reduce \ncoverage, that is on health insurance coverage for small businesses.\n  The 1099 repeal is all about small businesses. That is primarily why \nwe are going to repeal 1099. We don't want to turn around and hurt \nsmall businesses in the same bill. There is a real possibility that \nthat would happen with a straight repeal, without the Menendez \nperfecting amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Menendez amendment. \nIn effect, that amendment would repeal 1099, which virtually every \nMember of the body wants to do, but also will make sure the \nconsequences do not hurt small businesses, which will otherwise find \ntheir premiums increased or their coverage diminished.\n  Senator Menendez very wisely anticipates that potential problem with \nhis amendment by essentially providing that the increase would not \noccur as a premium--that is, the 1099 repeal would not occur if the HHS \nSecretary determines that it will increase premiums or also reduce \ncoverage for small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support the \nMenendez amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we will vote on the Menendez \namendment and then on Senator Johanns' amendment to repeal the 1099 tax \nincrease provisions of the health spending law and the small business \nlaw. As you know, the health spending law was enacted a little over a \nyear ago, and we are already here trying to undo some of the damage \nthat this massive law has imposed on small businesses. We have heard \nfrom small business owner after small business owner who was shocked \nand frustrated to learn the 1099 provision in the health spending law \nwould require small businesses to send out a much larger number of IRS \nForm 1099s.\n  This provision was a counterproductive assault on businesses, and it \nwas unleashed for one reason: to provide the dollars to pay for \nObamaCare's $2.6 trillion in new spending; in other words, to try and \nback up that spending.\n  Just to be clear, this is what this provision requires: Starting on \nJanuary 1, 2012, if a business pays at least $600 in total in 1 year to \na single payee, that business must send an IRS Form 1099 to the IRS as \nwell as to that payee. Since businesses frequently pay at least $600 in \n1 year to all kinds of different payees, this means the health spending \nlaw has created an enormous paperwork burden on our businesses, \nincluding many small businesses. This is exactly the kind of burden \nsmall businesses do not need to face at this time, when we are still \nfacing unemployment at 8.8 percent, and small businesses create 70 \npercent of new jobs in this country.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, whose membership is \nmade up of small businesses, hit the nail on the head in its April 4, \n2011, letter about this provision. This is what they had to say:\n\n       We are writing to urge you to support H.R. 4, the \n     Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection repayment of Exchange \n     Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011, and to oppose the Menendez \n     amendment. Passing H.R. 4 without any amendments is the best \n     way to finally repeal the expanded Form 1099 requirements \n     included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \n     Tax paperwork and compliance are already major expenses for \n     small businesses, and the new reporting requirements included \n     in PPACA will substantially increase these costs.\n\n  The new paperwork mandate will require businesses to track and report \nto the IRS most business-to-business transactions above $600 in a \ncalendar year. For many businesses this could amount to hundreds of new \nreportable transactions, which involves sending a 1099 to both the IRS \nand the reportable business.\n  That is a pretty strong statement, and the message is clear. This \nprovision will impose considerable hardship on American businesses. The \nresult of this provision will be much more paperwork and much less job \ncreation. I spoke this morning to the Tax Executives Institute, which \nis one of the most prestigious institutes in our country, especially on \ntaxes. What I announced to them was that I think we are going to get \nrid of this provision, and I almost got a standing ovation. They went \nwild down there this morning.\n  This provision will impose considerable hardship on American \nbusinesses, especially small businesses. The result of this provision \nwill be much more paperwork but a lot less job creation.\n  In addition, Monday, April 4, 2011, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nweighed in on this provision with a similar diagnosis. This is how the \nchamber put it:\n\n       The 1099 reporting mandate, if not repealed, will force \n     more than 40 million entities, including governments, \n     nonprofits, and small and large businesses, to comply with \n     onerous data collection and IRS information filing burdens on \n     virtually all non-credit card purchases totaling $600 or more \n     with any vendor in a tax year. At a time when they can least \n     afford it, entities will have to institute new, complex \n     recordkeeping, data collection, and reporting requirements to \n     track every purchase by vendor and payment method. This \n     provision will dramatically increase accounting costs and \n     could expose businesses to costly and unjustified audits by \n     the IRS. The Chamber strongly supports H.R. 4, which would \n     repeal the 1099 mandate, and strongly opposes the Menendez \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letters from both the NFIB, the representative of small businesses \nin this country, and the Chamber of Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2011.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, strongly supports H.R. 4, the ``Comprehensive 1099 \n     Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy \n     Overpayments Act of 2011'' and strongly opposes an amendment \n     by Sen. Menendez, which could leave intact the 1099 \n     requirement.\n       The 1099 reporting mandate, if not repealed, will force \n     more than 40 million entities, including governments, \n     nonprofits, and small and large businesses, to comply with \n     onerous data collection and IRS information filing burdens on \n     virtually all noncredit card purchases totaling $600 or more \n     with any vendor in a tax year. At a time when they can least \n     afford it, entities will have to institute new complex \n     record-keeping, data collection and reporting requirements to \n     track every purchase by vendor and payment method. This \n     provision will dramatically increase accounting costs and \n     could expose businesses to costly and unjustified audits by \n     the IRS.\n       The Chamber strongly supports H.R. 4, which would repeal \n     the 1099 mandate, and strongly opposes the Menendez \n     amendment. The Chamber may consider including votes on, or in \n     relation to, these issues in our annual How They Voted \n     scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    April 4, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, \n     we are writing to urge you to support H.R. 4, the \n     ``Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of \n     Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011,'' and to oppose \n     the Menendez Amendment. Passing H.R. 4, without any \n     amendments, is the best way to finally repeal the expanded \n     Form 1099 requirements included in the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (PPACA).\n       Tax paperwork and compliance are already major expenses for \n     small businesses and the new reporting requirements included \n     in PPACA will substantially increase these costs. The new \n     paperwork mandate will require businesses to track and report \n     to the IRS most business-to-business transactions above $600 \n     in a calendar year. For many businesses, this could amount to \n     hundreds of new reportable transactions, which involves \n     sending a 1099 to both the IRS and the reportable business.\n       According to an SBA study, the cost of complying with the \n     tax code is 66 percent higher for small business as compared \n     to a large business. Small businesses lack the compliance \n     capabilities to track and report each new transaction, and in \n     order to comply with this new requirement they will have to \n     pull capital out of the business that could be better used to \n     reinvest in the business and create jobs.\n       Passage of H.R. 4, without amendments, is the best way to \n     remove the costly impact the 1099 requirement would have on \n     millions of businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n         Aeronautical Repair Station Association;

Mr. President, President Obama and congressional Democrats \ntried to sell the American people on their clunker of a health care law \nby saying it would bring down Federal health care spending. That would \nhave been a miracle if it were true. But even the Obama \nadministration's own actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices has confirmed that claim was false and that Federal spending \non health care would actually increase as the result of the health \nspending law. Some estimate as much as $2,100 per policy.\n  The Cash for Clunkers Program was bad enough, but Democrats managed \nto outdo themselves spending $2.6 trillion in cash for this clunker of \na health care law. This reminds me of a scene from the movie \n``Vacation.'' At the beginning of that film, Clark Griswold goes into a \ndealership to buy a new car before setting off with his family for a \ncross-country trip to Wally World. Yet instead of getting the new car \nhe had ordered as part of a trade-in, the dealer gave him a pea green \nFamily Truckster, as we can see in this beautiful photograph. Chevy \nChase was, of course, Griswold. One only had to look at the Family \nTruckster to know that it was a lemon.\n  Clark told the dealer he wanted his old car back. Unfortunately for \nClark--or the actor, in this case--his old car was crushed before he \ncould get it back. You can imagine the consternation Chevy Chase faced. \nYou can see the Family Truckster in this picture behind me. There it \nis, with Chevy standing on top as Clark Griswold.\n  Clark's experience with the Family Truckster is a metaphor for \nAmericans' experience with ObamaCare. Our Nation's health care system \nmight have needed some work--there is no question about that--but the \nvast majority of Americans were satisfied with their health care. Yet \nDemocrats gave Americans ObamaCare which, like the Family Truckster, is \na true jalopy, and they did their best to crush our former health care \nsystem before we could stop them.\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\n  I also add that Americans, such as Clark Griswold, eventually reached \ntheir wits' end. The tea party, the gubernatorial elections in New \nJersey and Virginia, the election of my colleague, the junior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts--all of these actions were the result of Americans \nstanding up and letting it be known that they were sick and tired of \nWashington recklessly spending their money and recklessly regulating, \nand they were not going to take it anymore.\n  To borrow from Robert Daltrey, Americans made it clear that they are \nnot going to get fooled again, but that did not stop the Democrats from \ntrying.\n  At the time the health spending bill was being enacted, President \nObama and congressional Democrats were raising taxes to make it appear \nthey were partially paying for the $2.6 trillion in new spending \ncontained in the partisan health spending law. When the Democrats say \nthis health law saved money, ask yourself this: If the law was actually \ngoing to reduce Federal spending on health care, would these massive \ntax increases have been necessary?\n  In the end, ObamaCare was more of the same--a tax-and-spend law that \nvastly increased the size of an already-bloated Federal Government.\n  President Obama and congressional Democrats should not have raised \ntaxes and cut Medicare to fund a new entitlement program--an \nunsustainable entitlement program. After all, the three largest \nentitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--are \nalready headed for a fiscal crisis. To create a fourth massive \nentitlement program when these three entitlement programs were already \ngoing broke was fiscal insanity. That is one reason we need to repeal \nthe health spending bill in its entirety and start over.\n  Senator Johanns' amendment to repeal the 1099 provisions in the \nhealth spending law and small business law is a good first step in \ngetting rid of the partisan health spending bill entirely.\n  I think a lot of people, including Members of Congress who voted for \nthe small business bill last year, were surprised to learn that \nCongress enacted a second 1099 provision last year. This is separate \nand apart from the 1099 provision enacted in the partisan health \nspending law. This new 1099 provision was enacted as part of the small \nbusiness law last year. I voted against it. By the way, this provision \nis already in effect since it applies to payments made on or after \nJanuary 1 of this year.\n  This 1099 provision causes landlords who are not even actively \nengaged in the rental real estate business to send in a Form 1099 to \nthe IRS. It is required when they pay more than $600 in 1 year to a \nvendor for goods or services. For example, suppose a landlord spends \nmore than $600 over the course of a year at a home improvement store. \nThat landlord must send out a Form 1099 and send it to the IRS, as well \nas the provider of goods or services. In addition, that landlord must \ntrack down the vendor's taxpayer identification number, which is not \nnecessarily an easy task to do.\n  This law creates a large and unexpected paperwork burden on these \nlandlords. With the real estate market struggling, we should not impose \nnew paperwork burdens on landlords which only hurt the real estate \nindustry even more.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Senator Johanns' amendment \nand vote no on the Menendez amendment. As I said, Senator Johanns' \namendment is a downpayment on a total repeal of the onerous health care \nlaw that over time will wreck our Nation's health care system and lead \nto an explosion of new Federal spending.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote no on Senator Menendez's amendment.\n  I personally wish to pay tribute to my colleague from Nebraska for \nhis indefatigable efforts in trying to repeal these terrible paperwork \nburdens that nobody is going to look at anyway, that really are not \ngoing to make any difference and are just going to cost an arm and a \nleg over time. I thank him for the hard work he has done. He deserves \ncredit for continuing to fight these battles.\n  I hope all of us on the Senate floor will get rid of this monstrosity \ntoday and hopefully work together to try and straighten out what is a \nvery bad bill in ObamaCare.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 19\\1/2\\ minutes; the \nminority controls 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first wish to correct the record. I \nstated earlier that if the Menendez provision is triggered, the 1099 \nrepeal will not go into effect. That is not correct. What I meant to \nsay is if the Menendez provision is triggered, then the new true-up \nrules in H.R. 4 will not go into effect. That is an important \ndistinction. No matter what the result, 1099 will, in fact, be \nrepealed. That is the main point.\n  I commend all Senators, including Senator Johanns and others, who \nwant to repeal 1099. It is very much the view of this body--I, myself, \nwant to repeal 1099, but I also think the provision offered by Senator \nMenendez is an improvement on repeal, even though repeal will actually \ngo into effect.\n  I will also say that there are a lot of statistics bandied about \nregarding health care reform. The Fidelity company does an analysis of \nhow much it costs people age 65 and older to pay for their health care. \nThat is their premium cost as well as their insurance costs or out-of-\npocket costs. Fidelity company has just concluded in the last week or \nso that as a consequence of health care reform, the number of dollars \nthat seniors will have to pay for health care will actually be lower--\nnot higher, but lower--than what it otherwise would be on account of \npassage of that bill.\n\n\n                            Budget Proposal\n\n  I want to say a couple words about the budget proposal offered by the \nHouse, the Ryan budget proposal. It is important for people to know \nwhat is in that budget. What is in it basically? Let me tell you. That \nbudget cuts $2.2 trillion in health care costs over 10 years--$2.2 \ntrillion in cuts in health care costs over 2 years. It repeals health \ncare reform. That is what the Ryan resolution does. His budget \nresolution repeals health care reform.\n\n  What else does it do? It dismantles Medicare. It dismantles Medicare \nas we know it. Health care reform extends the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund by another 12 years. The Ryan House Republican budget \nproposal repeals Medicare as we know it. It turns into a voucher \nprogram. Basically, it says this: There have been reports that it costs \nabout $15,000 to pay for seniors under Medicare for 1 year. There are \nreports that the Ryan proposal says we are just going to give people \n$6,000 and give it to a health insurance company. First, that is a big \ncut, 15 down to 6 and, second, it is to a health insurance company. So \nthe net effect of the Ryan proposal is very simple. It transfers wealth \nfrom seniors, from children--because of Medicaid and people in nursing \nhomes--it transfers wealth from them to whom? Health insurance \ncompanies. The Medicare proposal is a transfer of wealth from seniors \nto health insurance companies.\n  Health care reform did the opposite. We extended the life of \nMedicare. How did we do it? In part, by cutting health insurance \npayments. So we helped seniors in health care reform and we cut health \ninsurance companies. The Ryan House Republican budget proposal does the \nopposite; it cuts benefits to seniors by a whopping amount and it takes \nthat wealth and transfers it over to health insurance companies that \nwill get higher premiums, higher bonus payments, their stock returns \nwill go up, and their administrative expenses will go up. I don't think \nthat is what we want to do. But make no mistake, that is the effect of \nthe Ryan proposal.\n  Also, I might say, it reduces income taxes by about $1.2 trillion. So \nthe real net of the effect of the Ryan proposal is, take money away \nfrom people and give it to the health insurance companies and the \nwealthy. That is what the Ryan proposal does. That is exactly what it \ndoes. The Ryan proposal takes money, about $5.8 trillion roughly, over \n10 years--takes it away from people, especially seniors and kids on \nMedicaid, elderly who happen to be on Medicaid--there are big \nreductions further in discretionary spending--and lowers income taxes \nby about $1.2 trillion. It lowers them. That is how it achieves budget \nsavings of $5.8 trillion. He cuts,\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\ncuts to the bone, and then cuts about $1.2 trillion more than he has to \nbecause $1.2 trillion is reductions in income tax.\n  I want the public to know what is in the Ryan budget. That is what it \nis. Let me say it one more time, clearly, simply. It is a transfer of \nmoney away from seniors and from kids on Medicaid and elderly on \nMedicaid over to health insurance companies--higher bonuses, higher \nsalaries, stock goes up, and in addition it transfers money away from \npeople to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy--not tax cuts for the \nunwealthy but tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  How did he do that? He lowers the top rate to 25 percent so the \nwealthy pay less taxes. He lowers the corporate down to 25 percent, so \nthe bigger companies pay less taxes. That is how he does it. While we \nare talking about a short-term CR around here, and we are talking about \na longer term CR around here, when we start talking about budgets, \nlet's look closely at what is actually in that Ryan proposal.\n  Of course, we have to lower our budget deficits. Of course, we have \nto significantly lower our budget deficits. But, of course, we have to \ndo it fairly, so all Americans are part of the solution, so health \ninsurance companies are also part of the solution, so the most wealthy \nare also part of the solution. All Americans have to be part of the \nsolution. The Ryan budget does not do that. It says only the seniors--\nwe get the budget deficit reduction on the backs of seniors, on the \nbacks of people who otherwise receive medical care under Medicaid and \nsome other things, but also we shift income to the most wealthy by \nlowering their taxes.\n  I hope when we are voting on the Menendez amendment, which is \nimportant to do, also in the background we understand what is going on \nin the other body. They may bring this up and try to pass it this week. \nThey may try to pass it on the floor next week--I don't know. But we \nshould recognize it for what it is and come up with a deficit reduction \nproposal that is fair, fair to all Americans, not on the backs of the \nseniors for the benefit of health insurance and not on the backs of \naverage Americans for the benefit of the most wealthy, by lowering \ntheir income taxes by $1.2 trillion over 10 years. That is not fair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are headed toward $20 trillion in \nspending. The President's program, the Democrat's program, is maybe \none-half of 1 percent, which is almost nothing. This is their program, \na blank sheet of paper. That is what it is. At least Congressman Ryan, \nthe Budget Committee chairman over in the House, is trying to do \nsomething that is worthwhile. By the way, just so everybody knows, the \nrich are not going to be treated tremendously respectfully in this \nmatter. They are going to lose, on the top level, on entitlement \nprograms. There is a cutback for those who reach a certain level of \nincome. This is not as simple as it sounds, nor is it a desire to take \nanything away from senior citizens. It is trying to get our country's \nbudget under control and it is out of control.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, if I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 4, to repeal the \nmandate on small businesses throughout this country. The failure to \nrepeal this onerous mandate of the 1099 requirement would have a \nprofound impact on millions of businesses across this country and on \nthe already stressed job market, as employers have to grapple with the \nenormity of this cost, not to mention the compliance with this \nregulation.\n  I certainly commend the author of this legislation, the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Johanns, for his tenacity, his perseverance, his \nrelentlessness in bringing this to the forefront not only of the Senate \nbut to the Congress and to the country. I hope we can join with our \ncounterparts in the House of Representatives in an impressive, \nbipartisan vote because we do need to bring this to a conclusion.\n  I also appreciate that the Senator from Nebraska included in this \nrepeal the provision I recommended, which was to repeal the provision \nthat the mandate would be extended to rental property owners. This was \na requirement that was included in the Small Business Jobs Tax Relief \nAct that became law last fall--inexplicably, given the fact that the \n1099 quagmire was already well known to everyone. Yet it was included \nin that legislation that became law--so those who are rental property \nowners will have to comply with this mandate as well. The big \ndifference is, this requirement takes effect in January of this year so \nunsuspecting owners will already be subject to the burden of reporting \nto the Internal Revenue Service any business expenditures for goods and \nservices that exceed $600 per vendor, similar to all the other \nrequirements under the law that will begin for 2012 for all small \nbusiness owners.\n  As we all know, this new mandate on small businesses was imposed in \nthe health care reform law. Yet it had nothing to do with reforming the \nhealth insurance industry. It had everything to do with raising \nrevenues and placing inordinate burdens on small businesses. The rental \nreal estate was added to this paperwork morass, and what is \ndisconcerting is the fact that it directly affects those States that \ndepend on tourism, such as my State of Maine, with respect to rental \nproperty.\n  I think it is going to be very important to make sure people \nunderstand this requirement will be repealed as part of this \nlegislation. Failure to repeal this mandate will raise the compliance \ncosts for small businesses astronomically. Already, as estimated by the \nNFIB, the major voice for small businesses in this country--they have \nestimated that small business compliance costs with respect to tax \ncompliance alone is $74 an hour. Tax compliance is the most expensive \nform of paperwork. So the burden on small businesses will be strenuous \nand inordinate. It is already disproportionate. Their costs are 67 \npercent higher than larger firms.\n  There is no question, given the ubiquitous nature of this \nrequirement, that small businesses all across this country will come \nunder the weight of these very stringent regulations, having to submit \n1099 forms. In fact, I was talking to an individual the other day who \nheads up an organization which has 1,650 members and what did he say? \nHe said every one of these members will have to file anywhere from 200 \nto 600 forms every day. That is 200 to 600 forms on a daily basis.\n  They didn't want to talk about taxes. They didn't want to talk about \nanything else. They wanted to talk about whether we were going to \nrepeal the 1099 requirement. That is why there is so much support for \nthis repeal. It is so important, during these difficult economic times, \nthat we avoid imposing any tough regulations on our small business \nowners.\n  The other point to be made is, this 1099 requirement is vastly \ndifferent from what is familiar to most Americans. For most Americans, \n1099 forms generally come from their financial institutions to report \nthe interest they have earned on their savings accounts or to report \nthe interest they pay on their mortgage to their lenders. That \nrequirement is specific, to make sure they report directly their tax \nliability on the income earned in that specific tax year. Now we are \nreverting to a very different form by requiring businesses to report in \nthe aggregate all their expenditures for goods and services to any \nvendor. That is a very different requirement.\n  My concern is one that has not been widely discussed. The fact is, by \ndoing so, by making this conversion how we use the 1099 form, it is \nessentially putting in place an infrastructure, a system for a value-\nadded tax, by requiring businesses to report all this information. So \nwe could essentially have a system in place, where we could have a \nfunctioning value-added tax by taking the next step based on the \ninformation that is already required to be submitted by this \nrequirement.\n  It is urgent we repeal this mandate. It is important to send that \nmessage. It is important to repeal this mandate in its entirety.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we vote on a bill that would repeal \nthe 1099 reporting expansion that was made\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\ninto law under the Affordable Care Act. This reporting requirement was \ndesigned to improve tax compliance. However, many businesses fear this \nexpansion could end up burdening not those who seek to evade their \ntaxes, but those who innocently do business with those who do. This is \nwhy I support the repeal of this reporting requirement in the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Unfortunately, I do not agree with how this bill would pay for this \nrepeal. This bill would hurt individuals who receive modest pay \nincreases or bonuses during the course of a year. The Affordable Care \nAct subsidizes insurance coverage for middle-class families making \nunder 400 percent of the Federal poverty level who don't have access to \nemployer provided coverage. Under current law, people close to 400 \npercent line are protected from substantial tax penalties if they \nreceive a modest raise or bonus that bumps them into a higher income \nbracket. This bill would eliminate that protection and impose a \nretroactive penalty on those families that could amount to thousands of \ndollars. Those families, even if they end up over the line by $1, would \nhave to pay back the entire amount of their subsidies. For a family of \nfour, for instance, this could mean owing more than $5,900 on their \ntaxes because of an unexpected increase in income from $89,000 a year--\n398 percent of the FPL--to $89,500--$100 above the 400 percent FPL.\n  I support the amendment offered by Senator Menendez that directs the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to study the \nimpact of this bill on health care premiums and coverage for small \nbusinesses and their employees. If the HHS Secretary finds that the \nchanges in repayment amounts under this bill would increase health \ninsurance premiums for small businesses or their employees or increase \nthe number of uninsured, the repayment amounts would revert to current \nlaw.\n  I look forward to continuing to improve the Affordable Care Act and \nwill continue to fight for affordable and available health care for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to raise serious concerns \nabout the offset proposed for H.R. 4.\n  I am very supportive of the underlying intent of H.R. 4--repeal of \nthe 1099 reporting requirements, which were created in Affordable Care \nAct. In fact, I have voted to repeal these requirements over the last \nfew months.\n  However, I have deep concerns about the offset proposed in H.R. 4. \nThe offset represents harmful policy and has been strongly objected to \nby President Obama in a Statement of Administrative Policy or ``SAP'' \nissued on March 1.\n  Specifically, H.R. 4 would increase the tax burden on American \nfamilies seeking health insurance coverage in the new health insurance \nexchanges. The legislation does so by increasing the amount of \nrepayment that must be made by families who receive health insurance \npremium subsidies. Note that these taxpayers could be reporting their \nincome correctly to the exchange throughout the year but still owe \nsubstantial payment or ``true-up'' when they file their taxes simply \nbecause the look-back period for subsidy eligibility encompasses an \nentire year. For example, under H.R. 4, families that have no income \nfor part of the year--for example because of the loss of a job--could \nowe $12,000 in true-up payments because they secure employment midway \nthrough the year.\n  I am strongly supportive of ensuring that taxpayers receive accurate \nsubsidies to help offset the cost of health insurance in the new State \nexchanges. Many experts throughout the Nation have told us, however, \nthat it is critical to provide reasonable hold harmless levels for \ntaxpayers given that subsidies are paid on a monthly basis and the look \nback period to determine income eligibility encompasses a year. These \nexperts tell us that without such a hold harmless, taxpayers' \nwillingness to participate in the new exchanges will be chilled \nresulting in only sicker, more costly populations coming to the \nexchange. This in turn, will drive up costs for individuals, families, \nand businesses purchasing coverage in the exchange. In fact, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has confirmed to me that they project hundreds of \nthousands of Americans will forgo the receipt of health insurance as a \nresult of H.R. 4 and that a majority of the offsetting revenue from the \namendment is generated by forgone health insurance coverage and \nsubsidies, not the recouping of overpayments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that President Obama's March 1 SAP be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n    h.r. 4--comprehensive 1099 taxpayer protection and repayment of \n               exchange subsidy overpayments act of 2011\n\n       The Administration strongly supports efforts to repeal the \n     provision in the Affordable Care Act that established \n     information reporting requirements for tax purposes that \n     place an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses. \n     The Administration is committed to reducing the gap between \n     taxes legally owed and taxes paid, but believes that the \n     burden created on businesses by the new information reporting \n     requirement on purchases of goods that exceed $600, as \n     included in Section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code as \n     modified by Section 9006 of the Affordable Care Act, is too \n     great.\n       However, the Administration has serious concerns about the \n     approach the Congress has taken to paying for the repeal. The \n     Administration strongly opposes the House's offset to pay for \n     this repeal in H.R. 4, which would undo an improvement \n     enacted with nearly unanimous support in the Medicare and \n     Medicaid Extenders Act that eliminated an egregious ``cliff'' \n     in the tax system affecting middle income taxpayers. \n     Specifically, H.R. 4 would result in tax increases on certain \n     middle-class families that incur unexpected tax liabilities, \n     in many cases totaling thousands of dollars, notwithstanding \n     that they followed the rules. The Administration also notes \n     that a provision repealing the same information reporting \n     requirements in the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and \n     Safety Improvement Act would pay for the repeal with an \n     unspecified rescission of $44 billion that, in combination \n     with other proposals currently under consideration in \n     Congress, could cause serious disruption in a wide range of \n     services provided by the Federal government.\n       The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with \n     the Congress on the repeal of the information reporting \n     requirements in the course of the legislative process, \n     including finding an acceptable offset for the cost of the \n     repeal.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains to both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 1 minute 20 seconds, \nthe majority has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I know we often read that Democrats and \nRepublicans cannot agree. Here is a news flash: We agree on repealing \n1099. I have listened to my three distinguished colleagues spend a lot \nof their time talking about repeal of 1099. We absolutely agree. I have \nvoted six times to do that. That is not an issue.\n  What is an issue, and my distinguished colleague from Nebraska--with \nwhom I have worked with before in passing some important legislation, \nand I have a great deal of respect for him--talked about a victory for \nsmall business. I agree. But I want a total victory for small business, \nand a total victory for small business is not repealing 1099 and then \ngiving them a bigger tax bill for their employees or raising the cost \nof insurance for that small business. A real victory is an opportunity \nto make sure we repeal 1099--my amendment clearly has 1099 repeal going \nforward--but then does a study that says if small businesses are going \nto face higher costs or their employees are going to face a $10,000 tax \nbill, then that part of it should not proceed.\n  If I am wrong, nothing will happen. The study will come. They will \nsay: No, small business is not going to have an increase; no, taxpayers \nare not going get a surprise tax bill. Then the repeal will have \nalready gone through and there is no foul, no harm. But if I am right, \nthen voting against my amendment is voting for a tax bill for middle-\nclass families, voting to increase insurance on small businesses.\n  The issue about going quickly to the President, first of all, is a \npriority. So if we pass this, this is not, as has been suggested, an \nalternative; it is just a single amendment to the existing bill on a \nprovision that allows for the repeal to go through but makes sure small \nbusinesses and individuals do not get higher costs. That can go to the\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\nHouse. The House can pass it and send it to the President--away we go; \nwe do not have a problem. Helping small businesses by reducing their \npaperwork while at the same time driving up health care costs and \nforcing coverage cuts for small businesses is simply not good policy.\n  In all fairness, I did not hear voices rise up when this bill was \nbeing delayed over the last week by some of my Republican colleagues \ntrying to get their amendments considered, and those amendments were \nextraneous to small business. So we either have a double standard here \nor a desperate attempt to defeat what I think is a good amendment.\n  The House could have taken up the amendment, H.R. 4, and passed it \ninto law by now. So I think it is somewhat disingenuous to have an \nargument that says we can't afford one amendment to proceed on this \nbill when our colleagues, at the beginning of this Congress, made a big \nproduction about a full debate and an open amendment process on all \nthings considered on the Senate floor, but when there is one amendment \nthat is meant to protect taxpayers and small businesses, oh, no, that \nis going to create an inordinate delay, after we had well over a week \nof delays by Republican colleagues seeking extraneous amendments to a \nsmall business bill. Please.\n  Now, I love Senator Hatch's jalopy. I remember that movie, took my \nfamily to see it. But the worst jalopy would be taking away 1099 and \nthen going ahead and giving small businesses higher costs and a higher \ntax bill for individuals. That is a real jalopy. That is a lemon.\n  So we have an opportunity to take away and undo and repeal the 1099. \nMy amendment permits that to go forward but at the same time makes sure \nsmall businesses do not get hurt.\n  How will they get hurt? How may they get hurt? Well, a lot of States, \nfor example, are considering whether to combine their small business \nand individual pools. For States that combine their pools, small \nbusinesses could see an increase in premium costs. The healthiest \npeople with little to no health care costs will have the most \nflexibility to decide whether to purchase coverage, and they may simply \npay the mandate penalty versus the potential for a $10,000 to $12,000 \ntax bill. With more healthy people opting out of buying insurance, the \npool of people who ultimately enroll in the exchanges that would \nconsist of, on average, less healthy individuals--that is going to push \nup the premiums for everybody else buying insurance in the exchanges, \nincluding small businesses and employees. That is only one example.\n  The other problem is, when you are facing your constituents, I hope \nyou are ready to tell them that through no fault of their own--when \nthey had a job, they lost their job, you know, 6 months into the year, \nand they face the fact that they are still over the amount, and now \nthey are going to get a $10,000 tax bill or, on the contrary, they \ndidn't have a job when they got the subsidy, and then they got a job in \nthe middle of the year and they are a dollar over the amount, and they \nare going to face a $10,000 tax bill. Is that what we want to do, send \nthat type of bill to families?\n  Finally, I appreciate hearing Senator Hatch say this is a downpayment \non total repeal of the health care law. Well, you know, if we are going \nto do that, if that is what this is really all about, this is not \nhelping small businesses. Helping small businesses means we repeal 1099 \nand don't increase their costs and don't send their employees a $10,000 \nor higher tax bill.\n  So this is about, in my mind, making sure there is a win-win for \nsmall businesses because if we want to repeal the health care law, then \nthat is about making sure we go back to preexisting conditions where a \nhusband who had a heart attack on the job can no longer get insurance; \nwhere a child born at birth with a defect cannot get insurance; where a \nwoman was facing 150-percent higher premiums than a man simply because \nshe was a woman; where, in fact, you couldn't keep your child, up to \nage 26, on your insurance as they are going through school; where, in \nfact, we could close the prescription drug coverage for seniors. If \nthat is what we are talking about, that is a different subject, and we \ncan have that debate. But this debate is about making sure we repeal \n1099 and making sure small businesses do not get higher costs and their \nemployees do not get a tax penalty. I think everybody should want to be \nfor that. We can send it straight to the House. The House can pass this \nversion and send it to the President. That is ultimately the \nopportunity here.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. That is why the Main \nStreet Alliance, which also supports businesses, says: Our small \nbusiness owners are very supportive of efforts to remove the imposition \nof the new 1099 reporting requirements. We cannot, however, accept a \npay-for that undermines other important provisions of the law that \nhelps small businesses and contains costs.\n  My amendment ensures that we do both--repeal 1099 and not put the \nburden on small businesses in terms of higher health insurance costs, \nand their employees. I urge passage of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 20 seconds, and the majority has \n3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I give a minute to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska and then, if there is not enough \ntime remaining, that I be given sufficient time, up to 2 minutes, with \nan equivalent amount of time given to the other side, to make my \nclosing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, again with all due respect to my \ncolleague from New Jersey, there have been over 200 business groups \nthat have expressed opposition to the Menendez amendment, and that \nwould include the NFIB, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nFranchise Association, and the chamber of commerce. You see, requiring \npeople to pay back what they should not have received in the first \nplace is regarded as good government, not bad policy. That is what \nshould be happening.\n  The second thing I would say about this is that this becomes a \nroadblock because we end up with a different House bill and a different \nSenate bill. If this is such a great idea, attach the amendment to some \nother bill that is coming along, and we can get the study done.\n  So, again, I appreciate the opportunity to work with Senator \nMenendez, but I do believe very strongly that we need to defeat this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if you say you are for fiscal \nresponsibility, you need to oppose the amendment of my friend from New \nJersey. Here is why. The nonpartisan scorekeeper for tax legislation, \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, tells us that the Menendez amendment \nputs the savings on the House bill in doubt. That means that if the \nMenendez amendment is adopted, the House bill will add to the deficit \nby perhaps as much as $25 billion. The Menendez amendment would \nmaintain the risk of payment of billions in fraudulent, improper, or \nexcessive health insurance exchange subsidies. What is more, the Senate \nunanimously agreed to a similar offset on the doc fix bill.\n  My friends, if you were against fraudulent, improper, or excessive \nhealth insurance payments before, stick to your guns--oppose the \nMenendez amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I am prepared to yield back any time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am compelled to answer because now I \nhear about fraud and $25 billion. You cannot have it both ways. You \ncannot say this amendment costs money--what the Joint Committee on \nTaxation said is it could not determine a revenue score. And it is \nimportant to point out that this amendment does not spend an additional \ndime. And the only reason--the only reason--this amendment would have a \nrevenue effect would be if the offset increases health insurance costs \nor cuts coverage for small businesses. Otherwise, there is no issue. So \nyou can't have it both ways. Either\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\nthere is an admission that it is going to cost small businesses more, \ncost taxpayers more, or it is not. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, this is not about fraud. This is not about someone seeking \nsomething they did not have the right to receive. Fraud is individuals \nwho are deliberately underreporting their income or fraudulently trying \nto get extra support. That is not what we do. Those enforcement \nprovisions in the law to combat fraud and abuse are untouched by my \namendment. This is simply about someone who honestly got a subsidy. And \nwe have a provision in the law that deals with how they pay back, but \nit doesn't throw them over the cliff and send them a surprise $10,000 \ntax bill. So that is simply not exactly quite the same thing.\n  Yes, the doc fix--we did use a provision to deal with the SGR with \nthe doc fix, but we did not put small businesses and families at harm, \nas H.R. 4 does.\n  So the reality is that this amendment permits repeal to move forward. \nAfter the repeal, a study is done. If there is no harm, if it \nsupposedly does not cost small businesses any more money, does not \ndrive up insurance costs, does not cost the taxpayer maybe $10,000 or \n$12,000, fine. But if it does, then we would ultimately not have that \nharm come upon small businesses, come upon individual taxpayers with a \nsurprise bill. And we could, of course, if that is the end result, \nwhich we don't know--that is why the Joint Tax Committee could not come \nup with a determination. We will not know until the study is done. \nInstead of having a risky venture, let's have the actual facts. Repeal \nwill have gone through. We can protect small businesses and those \ntaxpayers, and, if necessary, we can find a different offset. If they \nare wrong and I am right, that this concern about taxpayers getting a \nsurprise bill and small businesses having greater insurance costs is \ntrue, then we will protect them and we can look for a different offset \nat the time. Repeal will have taken place no matter what.\n  Why would you not want to protect small businesses and taxpayers from \ngetting a surprise bill? That is all my amendment does, and that is why \nI urge its passage.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to briefly respond to my \nfriend from New Jersey's comments about the Joint Committee on \nTaxation's analysis of his amendment.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation corresponded with Senator \nMcConnnell's office on Senator Menendez's amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record relevant portions of that e-mail \ndiscussion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Correspondence to Staff of Senator McConnell From Tom Barthold, Chief \n       of Staff, Joint Committee on Taxation, Dated April 5, 2011\n\n       You requested an estimate of the Menendez amendment \n     (FRA11028).\n       The Johanns amendment (which is essentially H.R. 4) \n     increases maximum repayment caps for overpayment of health \n     insurance exchange subsidies for taxpayers in certain income \n     categories below 400 percent of the federal poverty level \n     (``FPL''), and removes the caps for taxpayers above 400 \n     percent FPL. We estimate that this portion of H.R. 4 raises \n     $24.9 billion relative to present law. The Menendez amendment \n     (FRA11028) would amend this amendment to require that the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services conduct a study to \n     determine if the new repayment caps in H.R. 4 will (A) \n     increase health insurance premiums within Exchanges for \n     employees or owners of small business, or (B) result in an \n     increase in the number of individuals who do not have health \n     insurance, a disproportionate share of which are employees or \n     owners of small businesses. If the study determines that one \n     or both of (A) or (B) would occur, the changes to the caps in \n     H.R. 4 would not be implemented.\n       We do not project an increase in health insurance premiums \n     in the Exchanges for employees or owners of small businesses \n     as a result of H.R. 4. We project that there would be an \n     increase in the number of people who are uninsured as a \n     result of the new caps in H.R. 4, because some people would \n     avoid purchasing insurance through the Exchanges in order to \n     avoid possible future increases in tax liability.\n       We would expect that about 1/3 of the adults who fail to \n     enroll in the exchanges for this reason would be unemployed. \n     Of those who are employed, we would expect that they would be \n     roughly equally divided between being employees or owners of \n     firms less than 50, and employees or owners of firms greater \n     than 50. Thus, a larger share of small business employees \n     would be affected than of large business employees, although \n     small business employees and owners would comprise less than \n     half of the newly uninsured.\n       Because it is unclear how the Secretary will interpret the \n     terms ``disproportionate share'' and ``small business,'' we \n     cannot predict the findings of this study. If the study \n     conducted by the Secretary reaches a similar conclusion to \n     our estimate, and the Secretary deems that this would meet \n     the criteria of a disproportionate share of employees or \n     owners of small businesses among the newly uninsured, this \n     amendment would result in failure to implement the new caps \n     under H.R. 4, thus losing $24.9 billion relative to the \n     Johanns amendment.\n                                                     Tom Barthold.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.

Mr. President, I want to speak on two or three topics, \nthe first of which is the statutory debt limit.\n  We heard the Treasury Secretary today say that essentially early, \nlate July would be the last time at which we could manipulate things to \nnot surpass our debt limit. I wanted to ask the rhetorical question: \nWhat does the statutory debt limit mean? What it means is we put into \nlaw a limitation on ourselves on the amount of money we can borrow.\n  President Bush--I believe my facts are correct--asked for the debt \nlimit to be extended seven times. This will be the second under \nPresident Obama's leadership. It has been extended multitudes of times \nprior to that. As a physician I am querying myself to ask the question: \nWhy do we put a limit on our debt when every time it comes up, we raise \nthe limit again? The answer to that question is the limit does not mean \nanything because we continue to disregard the difficulty we are in. If \na debt limit meant something, we would make changes and take actions to \nlimit the amount of money we are spending so we would not break the \ndebt limit or have to raise the debt limit.\n  As a physician, when I think about the debt limit, the debt limit is \na symptom of simply another problem. That other problem is that we in \nCongress--this Congress, the Congress before this, and the 10, 20 \nCongresses before that--have not taken seriously the idea that this \ncountry has to live within its means. In fact, we are not living within \nour means. We were not living within our means before the housing \ncrisis of 2008. We were not living within our means except one short \nperiod of time when we had a true net surplus of about $36 billion, \nthanks to the tech bubble and the fact that in 1995, the 104th Congress \ndid a rescission package of a significant amount, under $30 billion, \nbut the accumulated benefit of that allowed us to run those surpluses.\n  The question before our country today is: Is the Congress going to \npass another debt limit? Are we going to raise the debt limit again and \nnot do what every other family, every other business, and every other \norganization in this country has to do and, in fact, the rest of the \nworld? And that is, they do not have the liberty of spending money they \ndo not have on things they do not absolutely need.\n  I believe the question the American people ought to be asking of \nCongress and this President is: How dare you even consider raising the \ndebt limit until you have done a thorough job of finding out whether \nthe programs--the multitudes, hundreds of thousands of programs--we \nhave actually function efficiently, actually do their intended purpose \nand, in fact, are a legitimate role for the Federal Government to be \ndoing in the first place?\n  We are always going to have the partisan debate on whether taxes are \nnot high enough or spending is not low enough. But all of those belie \nthe real problem, which is this country cannot continue to live beyond \nits means.\n  In point of fact that this Congress does not want to do that, we have \na small business bill on the floor about which we are all tied up in \nknots because we do not want to make votes that actually will cut $20 \nbillion worth of spending this year. We do not want to have those \nvotes. We have had all these shenanigans to try to keep from coming to \nthe floor amendments that actually do something.\n  The American people ought to look at us and say: What is going on? Do \nyou not get it? Do you not understand that the country as a whole is \nnow experiencing what a large number of our families did over the last \n2 years, that the amount coming in is less than the amount going out \nand adjustments in how we spend and what we spend have to be made?\n  We have an ethanol amendment that I understand is controversial. The \nfact is, it will be voted on after cloture is filed on this bill. But \nit is an amendment that will save a true $4.9 billion this year alone. \nThe money for that tax credit that goes to the international and \nnational oil companies in this country to blend ethanol with fuel--they \nsent a letter and said they do not want the money. How does one justify \nvoting to send money, $4.9 billion, to ExxonMobil and Chevron and \nConocoPhillips and all the rest of the big ones that are going to show \ntremendous profits with oil prices where they are today? When they say \nthey do not want it, how does one justify continuing to send money to \nthem? How does one vote against not sending that money back to the \nTreasury, not borrowing the money from the Chinese to pay the large oil \ncompanies to blend ethanol?\n  It is not a justification. The reason we are not having a vote is \nbecause they know it will be adopted. That amendment will be adopted. \nThat is why we are not having a vote.\n  America ought to look at the Senate and say: You are not having a \nvote on something that will save America almost $5 billion this year, \nbefore the end of this year that the people who are getting that money \ndo not want and have written to the Congress and said, We do not want \nthe money, and yet we are not going to be allowed to take that \namendment up in regular order and not be able to have a vote on it \nbecause a small special interest group does not want that to happen?\n  Talk about dysfunctional. Talk about having our heads in the sand. \nTalk about not addressing the real problem with the debt limit when we \ncannot even do something that simple, of saving the American people $5 \nbillion on one amendment and we will not do it? Some real change has to \nhappen, and not enough change has happened yet.\n  The Government Accountability Office issued a report a month ago \noutlining massive duplication throughout our government, the first \nthird of it with massive amounts of duplication. The question on the \nother side is: Are these legitimate roles for the Federal Government? \nWe are not even going to debate that issue. The fact is, they showed \nmassive amounts of duplication in large areas across the government in \nwhich we have multiple programs to do the exact same thing.\n  We have an amendment that will save $5 billion this year if we will \nvote on the amendment and say, Let's cut $5 billion out of at least $50 \nbillion to $100\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\nbillion we know is there, and let's do it this year, and let's have the \nadministration mandate they have to do it.\n  That is another $5 billion. In two amendments, we would have covered \neverything we would have cut with the CRs. They are common sense. They \nmatch what the American people want us to do. If we had true world \nbankers, they would be telling us to do it as well. And yet we have not \nbeen able to achieve a vote on that amendment.\n  Then we have the fact that we have unemployed millionaires to the \ntune of taking, I believe the number is, $20 million in unemployment \nchecks--people earning $1 million a year taking $20 million from the \ntaxpayers of this country for unemployment. We should not let that go \non one second longer. Unemployment is for people who desperately need \nit. It is not for those who do not.\n  What we have also found is the tremendous cost, as we researched the \ndata on the unemployment for millionaires, that we are spending almost \n$5 billion a year to manage the unemployment program in this country at \nthe Federal level, when 85 to 90 percent of the work is done at the \nState level. We did not even offer that amendment to downsize that \nactivity.\n  The suggestion I have for my colleagues is let's go back to the debt \nextension, the statutory debt limit. I am of a mind--and I think the \naverage American, regardless of what the consequences are and all the \nfear mongering we hear about, oh, you have to do this, you have to do \nthis--I do not think we should do it until we have followed some of the \ncommonsense prescriptions that the average family does in this country \nbefore we extend the debt limit. My knowledge of the functioning of \nthis town says it is doubtful we will ever do that.\n  I call on my colleagues to start thinking about what the real disease \nis in Washington. The real disease is we do not have the courage to \nmake the very hard choices that are in front of our country today and \nthen live with the results of that in terms of how it is going to \nimpact our political careers.\n  Everybody has a program they want to protect. The message for America \ntoday is every program is going to get hit. The Defense Department is \ngoing to get hit. Every program is going to get hit. My taxes are going \nto go up. Sorry, they are going to go up. This country cannot get out \nof this mess with the behavior we are exhibiting in this body. And if \nwe fail to do what is necessary for our country at this critical time \nin our juncture, history will deem us absolutely incompetent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague has talked about the \ndisease in Washington, but I want to talk about another disease that \nseems to be running rampant in the House Republican caucus, and that is \nhypocrisy. Hypocrisy. The reason I say that is they say one thing and \nthey mean another. They say one thing and they deceive the American \npublic.\n  Ordinarily, I would not comment on the behavior or the tribal mores \nof the House Republican caucus, but they have had a field day on TV \nridiculing the Senate, ridiculing the Democratic Senate, essentially \ndoing a lot of name calling. I am not doing name calling. I am going to \ndo fact describing.\n  The reason I call it hypocrisy is this: What they say they want to \ndo, which is reduce government spending, they do not. They only do it \non particular groups of people.\n  The other is something called the consequences of the shutdown. Let \nme say this: They want to cut spending, but they are unwilling to cut \ntheir own pay. Sure, I am for a government that is more frugal. I am \nfor cuts. But I am not for their cuts. What they propose is reckless \nand radical, and when they do not get their own way, they say: Cut it \nor shut it.\n  However, I take this position: If there is a government shutdown, I \ndo not think Members of Congress should be paid. If there is a \ngovernment shutdown and we tell dedicated Federal employees that they \nare not going to get paid, that they are nonessential, the fact that we \ncould not stop a shutdown shows we are not essential. I believe if \nthere is a shutdown, Members of Congress should not get paid. I not \nonly want to express that as a sentiment, I did that backing Senator \nBarbara Boxer's bill which passed the Senate that said if there is a \nshutdown, Members of Congress do not get paid.\n\n  What did the House Republicans do? They passed a bill, I will not go \nthrough the details, but on this relevant section they said Members of \nCongress and the President do not get paid. But guess what. They allow \nfor retroactive payment. The Senate bill does not do that. So they \nwould be the only ones in a shutdown who can come back and pick up that \nlittle paycheck they have stuck in a corner. Talk about hypocrisy. That \nis called bait and switch. It ought to be under some kind of consumer \nprotection law.\n  Even the title of their bill is wrong. Their bill is called the \nGovernment Shutdown Prevention Act. Their bill doesn't stop a shutdown. \nIt doesn't even help with the sitdown. What is a sitdown? We would come \nto the table as grownup Americans, and we would try to arrive at how to \npass a continuing resolution to fund the government that recognizes not \nonly debt but that there are certain aspects of the government programs \nwe need to be able to fund.\n  My constituents were outraged when Wall Street executives got \nhundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses. They should be outraged \nwhen, as Members of Congress, we are going to get paid when they do \nnot.\n  Here is what I don't get. My home State is the home of the National \nInstitutes of Health. Right now I have thousands of people working as a \nteam to find the cure for Alzheimer's, for AIDS, for autism, for \ncancer. We race for the cure, and we should, but we are going to tell \nthose researchers they are nonessential.\n  Right now there are thousands of Federal employees processing the \nclaims of Social Security, making sure someone who is disabled \nqualifies for their benefit. They are going to be told they are \nnonessential.\n  Let me tell you, on any given day, if somebody, in whatever town they \nlive, goes to their Social Security office and finds it shuttered and \nthey cannot apply for a benefit for which they believe they are \neligible, I think they would rather shut us down than that Social \nSecurity office be shut down.\n  Ask anybody in the United States of America who they think is more \nessential, Members of Congress or the researchers working on a cure for \ncancer or those people working to defend our borders. I could give \nexample after example; you know where they are.\n  It is very clear people know they depend, for the functioning of the \nFederal Government, on a civil service that is honest, that has \nintegrity, counseling us to make sure we keep government doors open \nwhile we negotiate the numbers. Numbers do matter. I am ready to come \nto the table. I believe all Democrats are ready to come to the table. \nBut we will not come to the table to engage in meaningless discussions \nand pursuing a way that is reckless.\n  I will discuss about the recklessness more, but I want everybody to \nunderstand Democrats in the Senate passed a bill that said if there is \na shutdown, we don't get paid, no way, no day, and no backpay. So no \nway, no backpay. The House, in the meantime, did this sham scam that \nsays: Yes, we will pretend we are not getting paid, but we are going to \npick up a backpayment.\n  I don't get these guys. They want to take away Medicare and turn it \ninto a voucher program, but they are sure happy picking up government \nhealth care. They love getting federally subsidized health care. They \nwant to take away other people's pensions, but they sure like getting \ntheir Federal employee pensions. I am going to put an end to the \nhypocrisy, and I am going to put an end to the CR dangling.\n  I think we need to come to the table and pass a responsible budget \nthat recognizes we are in a frugal era and we need to make sure the \nAmerican people know we are on their side. At the same time, the \nAmerican people need to know that many of us are willing to say if a \nshutdown comes and Federal employees get no pay and contractors get no \npay, we get no pay and no backpay.\n  I will have more to say about this as this week unfolds, but before I \nsit down, please, lets sit down rather than shut down.\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I very much thank the majority leader for \nallowing this important debate to occur.\n  During his campaign, Candidate Barrack Obama said no President should \nunilaterally initiate military conflict without Congressional \nauthority. I agree with that statement. It is a very important \nconstitutional principle and something that I think deserves debate.\n  I think the most important thing we do as representatives is voting \non whether to go to war. If Congress does not vote to go to war or does \nnot vote on the notion of going to war, we would have an unlimited \nPresidency, and this is a very dangerous notion.\n  I would take this position no matter what the party affiliation were \nof the President because I believe very strongly in the constitutional \nchecks and balances. We will vote today on the President's own words \nverbatim. During the election, the President said: ``The President does \nnot have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a \nmilitary attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual \nor imminent threat to the Nation.''\n  Clearly, the circumstances in Libya do not rise to this, and I think \nthis vote is incredibly important. Madison wrote that:\n\n       The Constitution supposes what history demonstrates. That \n     the executive is the branch most interested in war and most \n     prone to it. Therefore, the Constitution has with studied \n     care given that power to the legislature.\n\n  ``Don't tread on me'' was a motto and a rallying cry for our Founding \nFathers. The motto of Congress appears to be: ``Tread on me, please \ntread on me.'' The Congress has become not just a rubber stamp for an \nunlimited Presidency, but, worse, Congress has become a doormat to be \nstepped upon, to be ignored, and basically to be treated as irrelevant.\n  Some would say: We had no time. We had to go to war. There was no \ntime for debate. When we were attacked in World War II on December 7, \nPearl Harbor, within 24 hours this body came together and voted to \ndeclare war on Japan. There is no excuse for the Senate not to vote on \ngoing to war before we go to war.\n  The President had time to go to the United Nations, have a \ndiscussion, and a vote. The President had time to go to the Arab \nLeague, have a discussion, and a vote. The President had the time to go \nto NATO. But the President had no time to come to the people's house, \nto the Congress, and ask, as the Constitution dictates, for the \napproval of the American people and for the approval of Congress.\n  Why is this important? It is important because when our Nation was \nfounded, we were founded as a constitutional Republic. We placed \nlimitations not only on the President but on the Congress. We are \nsupposed to obey the Constitution. These are important principles and \nwe have gone beyond that. We have gotten to the point where my question \nis, Are we even obeying the Constitution in this body?\n  This is a sad day. This is a sad day for America. The thing is, we \nneed to have checks and balances. Do we want an unlimited Presidency, a \nPresidency that could take us to war anywhere, anytime, without the \napproval of Congress?\n  Some have said: We are going to have a vote sometime, sometime in the \nnext couple weeks. When we get around to it, we may have a debate about \nLibya. Had the President shown true leadership, the President would \nhave, when he called the United Nations, when he called the Arab \nLeague, when he called NATO, the President would have called the \nleadership of the Senate and the leadership of the House, and we would \nhave been here within 24 hours, having what should be the most \nmomentous debate this body ever has on sending our young brave men and \nwomen to war.\n  We are currently engaged in two wars, and we are now going to be \nengaged in a third war. The interesting point is, when we went into \nIraq and Afghanistan, we had votes in this body. President Bush came to \nCongress and there were votes.\n  The War Powers Act--some on the other side say: This is no big deal. \nThe President can do whatever he wants as long as he notifies Congress \nwithin a certain period of time.\n  This is not a correct interpretation of the War Powers Act. The War \nPowers Act does say he needs to notify Congress. But the War Powers Act \nalso says the President must meet three hurdles before taking our \ntroops into harm's way.\n  No. 1, there should be a declaration of war or there should be an \nauthorization of force from this body or there should be imminent \ndanger to the Nation. None of those were adhered to. The law was not \nadhered to.\n  Some will say: The War Powers Act, no President recognizes it. Well, \nThe War Powers Act is the law of the land, and the President needs to \nrespect not only the statutory law of the land but the Constitution. I \ndo not think these are trivial questions. But I am bemused, I am \nconfused, I do not understand why your representatives are not down \nhere debating such a momentous event as going to war.\n  I can think of no vote and no debate more important than sending our \nyoung men and women to war. It should be done reluctantly. We should go \nto war only when threatened as a nation. When engaged in two wars, we \nshould debate the prudence of being involved in a third war. These are \nnot trivial questions. I am amazed this body does not take the time to \ndebate whether we should be in Libya.\n  Some have said: We will debate it next week. The problem is, the \ndebate should occur before we go to war. At this point, we will have a \nvote. We will have a vote on the President's own words.\n  I will yield for a minute or two for a question, if that is OK. I \nyield to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, what we have with the situation with Libya \npresents us with a fundamental question, one we have wrestled with for \na couple centuries as a nation. The founding era was a time that was \nfraught with wars. It was a time when we learned that executives \nsometimes abuse their power. Sometimes they will take us into wars in \nfaraway nations without the support of the people, knowing full well it \nis the sons and the daughters of the people on the ground who are asked \nto make the ultimate sacrifice in those battles.\n  We channeled the war power in the Constitution so as to make sure \nthese debates would always come to the forefront, that they would \nalways be brought up by the elected representatives of the people in \nCongress. For that reason, although we give power to the President to \nbe the Commander in Chief in article II of the Constitution, in article \nI of the Constitution, we reserve that power, the power to declare war, \nto Congress.\n  This is how we guarantee that the people's voice will be heard and \nthat people's sons and their daughters will not be sent off to war \nwithout some public debate and discussion by those\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\nwho have been duly elected by the people and stand accountable to the \npeople.\n  We have, over time, clarified the intent. We have made clear there \nare certain steps that have to be taken. We have also made clear that \nalthough there is, to be sure, a certain unknown continuum, a continuum \nthat can be hard to define in every circumstance, between the \nPresident's plenary authority as Commander in Chief, on the one hand, \nand Congress's power to declare war on the other, there does come a \npoint at which we can recognize that we are at war and that some \nauthorization is required by Congress.\n  This very body, Congress, has, through the war powers resolution, \nattempted to distill some of these principles. In section 1541 of the \nWar Powers Act--it is found at 50 United States Code section 1541--we \nare told there are circumstances, three circumstances to be precise--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Paul amendment on the \nPresident's constitutional authority to order the use of military \nforce. This amendment is flawed because it doesn't allow the President \nto respond militarily to a completed attack and only allows action to \nstop an actual or imminent threat to the Nation.\n  The amendment would in effect make it illegal for the President to \nunilaterally order the use of military force to protect U.S. interests \nexcept only in situations that involve preventing an actual threat to \nthe United States or an imminent threat to the United States.\n  Numerous Presidential decisions to order the use of military force \nover the last 30 years would not meet the standard of the Paul \namendment.\n  For example, under the Paul amendment President Ronald Reagan would \nhave acted illegally in 1983 when he unilaterally ordered the invasion \nof Grenada, which did not involve an ``actual'' or ``imminent'' threat \nagainst the United States from Grenada.\n  Similarly President George H.W. Bush would have acted illegally under \nthe Paul amendment when he ordered the 1989 invasion of Panama. \nPresident Bush justified the Panama invasion based on protecting the \nlives of U.S. citizens, defending democracy and human rights in Panama, \nand countering drug trafficking, not on an ``actual or imminent threat \nto the nation.''\n  Also, President Reagan's ordering airstrikes against Libya in 1986, \n11 days after Libyan terrorist agents bombed the LaBelle discotheque \nand killed or wounded over 100 U.S. soldiers, might have been illegal \nunder the Paul amendment. The President's response to Libya's \nsponsorship of terrorism arguably would not have met the standard of \n``stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation'' because the \ntragic act of terrorism had already happened days earlier.\n  Finally, according to this amendment, President Obama acted beyond \nhis constitutional authority when he authorized the use of deadly force \nby Navy SEALs to rescue Captain Richard Phillips from Somali pirates on \nApril 10, 2010.\n  There are numerous other examples over the past decades when \nPresidents have ordered the use of military force to protect U.S. \ninterests, but where such actions would not have met the standards of \nthe Paul amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to table this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Paul \namendment is the pending business; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The motion to commit by Senator \nPaul is pending.\n  Mr. REID. I move to table that and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 90, nays 10, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 50 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--90\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--10\n\n     Collins\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Lee\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Sessions\n     Snowe\n     Toomey\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the responsible leaders in Washington are \nworking hard to find a compromise to fund the government through the \nend of the year. Regrettably, however, many Republicans in the House--\nspurred on by tea party radicals--are still threatening to throw a \ntemper tantrum and shut down the government if they don't get all of \ntheir demands. This morning, the Washington Post reports that Speaker \nJohn Boehner received an ovation from the Republican caucus when he \ntold them he had directed the House Administration Committee to prepare \nfor a shutdown, as Congressman Mike Pence, former head of the \nRepublican Policy Committee, shouted at a tea party rally last week, \n``Shut it down!''\n  So it seems what we are confronting is kind of a monolithic House \ndriven by the tea party vigilantes, as I refer to them, to brook no \ncompromise. They want it all their way or they are going to shut down \nthe government.\n  Republicans are seizing on the budget crisis as a pretext for ramming \nthrough their longstanding ideological wishes. In Iowa, Wisconsin, \nOhio, and elsewhere Republicans are using the budget crisis as the \npretext for an assault on public sector unions and their hard-working \nteachers, firefighters, prison guards, and others. On Capitol Hill \nRepublicans are using this crisis to try to defund health care reform, \nto gut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, and, yes, to cut tax \nrates even more deeply for the wealthiest in our society. This tea \nparty budget is an unprecedented assault on the middle-class and \nworking Americans. It would drive down our American standard of living, \nshred the economic safety net, reduce access to health care and higher \neducation, and do grave damage to our public schools and our ability to \nprepare the next generation for the jobs of the future.\n  Let's be clear. This is not about reducing budget deficits. \nRepublican Governors and Republicans in Congress are demanding budget \ncuts for the middle class. At the same time, they continue to push for \ntax cuts for large corporations and the wealthy. So call it what it is. \nRepublicans are waging a class warfare in America. Republican Governors \nhave the gall to attack teachers and firefighters, police officers, and \nother public employees.\n  In the words of Indiana Governor Daniels, he called them ``the \nprivileged elite.'' Think about that. Our teachers, our firefighters, \nprison guards, and others who are public union members are the \nprivileged elite in our society according to Governor Daniels.\n  Why are they the privileged elite? Well, I guess because they \nactually have pensions. They actually have access to decent health \ncare, and they are making decent wages with decent working conditions. \nThat is the privileged elite. I guess now the middle class are people \nwho are working for minimum wage at McDonald's, with no health care, no \npensions, no retirement, and not enough to support their families. I \nguess that is the new middle class in America, but the privileged elite \nare those who have pensions, access to health care, and decent wages.\n  This is the worst kind of demagoguery against loyal and hard-working \npublic servants, our friends, and our neighbors. We shouldn't be \ndragging people down because they have a middle-class life. We should \nbe working every day to give every American that opportunity.\n  Meanwhile, as the Republicans at the State and national level go \nafter the health care, retirement, and security of middle-class \nAmericans, they are going all out to pass more tax cuts for the \nwealthy. The Republican Governor in Michigan called for a $1.8 billion \ncut in corporate taxes. Wisconsin Governor Walker has called for $200 \nmillion in cuts. In Congress, just a few months ago, in December, \nRepublicans demanded and got hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax \ncuts largely, again, for the wealthy.\n  Now, House Republicans--the tea party-driven House Republicans--are \ndemanding we reduce the top tax rate for high earners. Get this, reduce \nthe top tax rate for high earners from 35 percent down to 25 percent, \npreserving every penny of the tax breaks given to the wealthy back in \n2001. All of these tax cut proposals will make deficits far worse. So, \nagain, this whole battle we are talking about is not about deficits. \nIndeed, the tax cuts congressional Republicans secured in December will \nadd, according to CBO, $354 billion to the deficit just this year and \neven more next year.\n  Early this year House Republicans voted to repeal the health reform \nlaw which would add $210 billion to the deficit over the next decade \nand over $1 trillion in the decade to follow. Now, again, that is the \nsavings CBO said would come about because of the health reform bill we \npassed. Yet these same Republican politicians in the House and around \nthe country are claiming to be worried about the deficit.\n  Well, I think this demagoguery is not fooling anyone any longer. It \nis not about deficit reduction; it is about ideology. Republicans are \ntaking a meat ax to programs for the middle class--everything from \ncancer research to Pell grants to health care. They are gutting the \nsafety net started and built up over generations, starting with \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt. It is the same old Republican game plan: \ngive huge, unaffordable tax cuts to the wealthy and give budget cuts to \nthe middle class and the most vulnerable in our society, including \nseniors and people with disabilities.\n  This new tea party Republican budget proposal gives new meaning to \nthe word ``extreme.''\n  Look at what they have proposed. The new budget that has just come \nout on the House side would basically eliminate Medicare as we know it. \nIt would create a new voucher program with seniors in the future paying \nout of pocket for many lifesaving health care costs. Estimates are that \nthis would raise premiums and cut benefits of over 25 million seniors.\n  It is a massive giveaway to private insurers, a system that CBO--the \nCongressional Budget Office--tells us is much more expensive and, we \nknow, less efficient than Medicare. By design these vouchers would not \nkeep up with rising health care costs, so they would lose value every \nyear with seniors paying the difference or ending up uninsured. Again, \nthe assault on Medicare is a transfer of wealth from the middle class \nto insurance companies and their shareholders, their stockholders.\n  The House budget would reopen the prescription drug doughnut hole \nrequiring seniors to pay $3,600 a year more for prescription drugs. \nThey propose to block grant Medicaid and cut $1 trillion in health care \nservices which would end vital services that seniors and disabled \nAmericans depend on such as coverage for nursing homes or home health \nagencies by shifting the cost to the States. This would worsen State \nbudget deficits and lead to higher property taxes. Seventeen Governors \nsent a letter to congressional leaders opposing this, saying it would \nshift costs and risks to States. States would be forced to bear all \ncosts after hitting the annual cap just as the baby boom generation is \nentering the retirement years with likely steep increases in their\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\nhealth care and long-term care costs. The ensuing funding shortfall \nwould leave States with an untenable choice between increasing taxes, \ncutting other State programs or cutting eligibility, benefits or \nprovider payments.\n\n  That is a letter 17 Governors sent to the President.\n  I remind my colleagues that Republicans complained bitterly in the \nlast Congress when we approved support for the States to maintain \nhealth programs for the poor in the recent recession--a level of \nsupport the Republicans are now trying to slash in the States. The \nHouse budget would put future seniors in the same budget fight, and the \nRepublican budget proposal doesn't stop at dismantling the safety net \nand programs that the seniors rely on for a secure retirement. It makes \nprofound and destructive cuts to the entire range of programs that \nunderpin the American middle-class standard of living--everything from \neducation, student grants, loans, law enforcement, clean air and clean \nwater, food safety, biomedical research, highways, bridges, and other \ninfrastructure--in short, all the programs and services Americans rely \non for a decent way of life.\n  The Republican assault on the middle class is breathtaking, both in \nthe scope and in its depth. It cannot come at a worse time for working \nAmericans, who are already under enormous strain and fear that the \nAmerican dream is slipping away.\n  It is no secret people are working longer and harder than ever \nbefore, but they still can't meet the cost of basic, everyday needs \nsuch as education, transportation, housing, and health care, let alone \nput away enough money to support themselves in old age.\n  Even before the great recession, during boom times, working people \nweren't sharing in our Nation's prosperity. Real wages peaked in the \n1970s, and they have not moved since. Think about this. Real wages, \naccounting for inflation, are about where they were in 1979. Think \nabout that. The middle class in America has not made any headway since \n1979. We wonder why people are upset. They see the middle class way of \nlife slipping away from them and their children.\n  I don't think we can say the wealthiest 400 or 500 people in America \nare at the same place they were in 1979--not at all. In fact, in the \nmid-1970s, the top 1 percent of Americans, in terms of wealth, had \nabout $8 trillion in assets. Today, that same 1 percent has over $40 \ntrillion in assets. It is not the same as where they were in 1979.\n  The top 1 percent has seen their income soar. Last Friday, our \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, was on the floor, and \nhe had some very startling statistics. He pointed out that the 400 \nhighest income earners in America earn an average of $344 million a \nyear. Got that? They earn an average of $344 million a year, and they \npaid an effective tax of 16.7 percent. The average person working \naround here--the police we see here, the janitors, the food service \nworkers, and others in the Capitol--do you know what they pay? They are \nprobably paying 29, 30 percent of their income in taxes. But the 400 \nhighest income earners only paid 16.7 percent. We wonder why people \nthink things aren't quite on the up and up or quite fair.\n  Do you detect people who are just kind of feeling uneasy about where \nthis country is headed? People are profoundly anxious about the future, \nbut look at what the House Republicans are doing. They are going to \nmake it worse on the middle class. People are worried they will not be \nable to have a decent house or enough food for their families or pay \nfor their kids' college education. People are working harder, and they \ndon't even take vacations any longer because they can't afford it.\n  If we learned anything from the great recession, it is that most \nfamilies, even though solidly in the middle class, are one pink slip \naway from economic catastrophe. Everybody keeps talking about a \nrecovery. Many of our friends and neighbors aren't seeing that. \nCorporate America is sitting on over $1 trillion in cash, while 14 \nmillion Americans are out of work. That is just the official number. \nThat is not counting another 15 million who are underemployed or who \nhave quit looking for jobs because they have been shut out of the job \nmarket.\n  This doesn't look like a real recovery to me. It is a repeat of the \nlast recession, when the recovery went to the wealthiest and the \nworking people were left behind. Republicans have proposed a budget \nthat will destroy the middle class in this country. That is what the \nRepublican budget is about.\n  Many Republicans apparently believe that as public sector workers and \nothers lose their jobs, it will be somehow good for the economy. Two \nweeks ago, the Republican staff on the Joint Economic Committee \nreleased a report arguing that widespread layoffs would actually \nincrease jobs. How about that for funny reasoning?\n  As Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman pointed out, this is a \nthrowback to the thinking of Depression-era Treasury Secretary Andrew \nMellon, the idea that by driving down wages and benefits, we will \nincrease employment. This is now ``the official doctrine of the GOP,'' \nhe points out. If we drive down wages and benefits, we will somehow \nincrease employment. I suppose we could. I suppose if we got everybody \ndown to working for $1 an hour, there might be a lot of jobs out there.\n  The idea is not a job. It is not just having someone work. The idea \nis to have a good job. I have pointed out in speeches in the past that, \nwhen we think about it, in our sordid history of America, every slave \nhad a job. Think about that. Every slave had a job. Were they free? \nWere they happy? Did they keep their families together? Were they able \nto build up a middle-class nest egg? Did they have decent retirement \nand health care? No. But they had a job. Is that all we are after is \njust a job? It seems to me that we are after jobs that pay decent \nwages, with decent working conditions, and allow people to have time \nwith their kids and their families.\n  What is wrong with having a job that has a decent wage and decent \nworking conditions and you get to take a decent vacation and you have \nhealth care coverage and you have a pension for your old age? What is \nwrong with that kind of a job? These are the kinds of jobs we want for \nAmericans--not just a job. But the Republican philosophy seems to be \njust a job. Forget about the pension and your standard of living, just \nbe thankful that you have a minimum-wage job. That is where this \nRepublican budget is driving us.\n  I could not help but think about this in terms of what is happening \nin the world--in Libya and what happened in Egypt and in Syria and in \nYemen and what is happening in other places around the globe. When \nstripped away from all of it, it seems to me that in all these \ncountries, people are saying we have had enough of a system where a few \nat the top get everything and nobody else gets anything and we are all \nat the bottom. In so many of these countries, these revolutions are \ngoing on so people can have a more decent life, a better share, if you \nwill, of the products of their own society. So they are going in the \ndirection of trying to establish a better middle class, a stronger \nmiddle class.\n  What are we doing in America, the bastion of middle-class virtues. We \nare going in the other direction. We are destroying the middle class, \ntaking away the kinds of livelihoods that built the middle class. That \nis what this is about. The future of our Nation depends on our ability \nto ensure that the benefits from economic growth are widely shared. \nThat means putting policies into place that build a strong and vibrant \nmiddle class, with good jobs, fair wages, and good benefits. That is \nthe America I want to see, one where people who work hard and play by \nthe rules can have a decent life.\n  Tragically, the tea party budget plan would take us in exactly the \nopposite direction. It would gut the whole range of programs that \nsupport the middle class in our country. It would dismantle the safety \nnet that has been built for seniors, those with disabilities and the \nlow income--a safety net created under President Roosevelt and has been \nstrengthened since.\n  The Republican tea party budget is built on bad priorities, bad \npolicies, and just plain bad values.\n  As columnist E.J. Dionne points out, Americans can now see ``how \nradical the new conservatives in Washington are, and the extent to \nwhich some politicians would transfer even more resources from the \nhave-nots and the have-a-littles to the have-a-lots.''\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\n  I don't believe the American people will stand for this unwise, \nunbalanced, unfair assault on their economic security and their way of \nlife. We must stand strong and oppose these grossly misguided proposals \nin every way we possibly can. This is a battle that is joined and we \ncannot be faint of heart or weak in spirit. We must stand strong for \nmiddle-class values and what allowed America to become a strong middle-\nclass nation. I believe the American people are definitely on our side \nin this battle.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is there any time limit on Senators?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about the \npossibility of a government shutdown and to say that such an \nalternative will be very hurtful for the people of this country. I was \nhere when the government was shut down before by another Republican \nSpeaker, and I can tell you that my small businesspeople around \nYosemite National Park, for example, who count on tourism still \nremember the sting of losing over $200 million because people had to \ncancel their trips. That is one example.\n  I know Superfund site cleanups were halted in their tracks. We had \nissues at the borders. We had a whole series of problems. It seems to \nme it is a reckless way to go, but it also seems to me the House \nRepublicans want us to have a government shutdown.\n  Why do I say that? I say that because Republicans gave the Speaker of \nthe House an ovation when he informed them ``to begin preparing for a \npossible shutdown.'' An ovation. I would hope we would reserve our \novations for our leaders when they tell us that because of our work in \nfunding the National Institutes of Health, we now have a cure for \ncancer. I would like to have an ovation about that.\n  I would like to have an ovation for our firefighters and our first \nresponders who are brave every single day. I would like to have an \novation for them.\n  I do not think having an ovation because we might have a government \nshutdown is appropriate, but it was an honest response. That is what \nthey want. One has to ask why. Why do they want this? Because they want \nto cut $100 billion from the President's budget, when Democrats have \nalready agreed to meet them with $73 billion in cuts?\n  There are three parties to these negotiations: the President, who is \na Democrat; the Senate, which is Democratic; and the House, which is \nRepublican. Since when does one-third represent a majority? Since when \nis one-third allowed to say: My way or the highway? Apparently, that is \nwhat they are doing.\n  They put H.R. 1 before the House that has all these cuts--but not \njust cuts, political vendettas attached, such as zeroing out funds for \nPlanned Parenthood. Nothing to do with abortion funding because we \ncannot use Federal funds for that, but the other work of Planned \nParenthood in preventing unwanted pregnancies, the work they do to \nensure people can have contraception, the work they do to make sure \nthere is not a spread of communicable diseases sexually transmitted. \nThe work they do--and, yes, no matter what the rightwing says, to do \nbreast cancer screenings.\n  There was a big article in the paper: Senator Boxer is spreading a \nbig lie that Planned Parenthood does breast cancer screenings. They do \nbreast cancer screenings. Although, I understand, one of their clinics \ndoes mammograms, they definitely say to someone, if they find a \nsuspicious lump in that breast cancer screening, they will help people \nget the help they need.\n  They do Pap smears. They make sure they talk about the dangerous \nspread of HIV/AIDS. Five million people go to those clinics. They want \nto shut them down.\n  They want to shut down title X--the whole program--which is family \nplanning. On the one side, they do not want abortions. Nobody does. On \nthe other side, they turn their backs on family planning. This does not \nmake sense. That is what was in H.R. 1.\n  Also, in my State, $700 million would have been cut in Pell grants, \nwhich meant 1 million California students who rely on these grants \ncould no longer rely on them and, therefore, would have to drop out of \ncollege. That is what was in H.R. 1. That is what they want us to \naccept.\n  Head Start--everybody knows Head Start. It is a success story. The \nfact is, H.R. 1 would slash it by $1.1 billion and would lay off 55,000 \nteachers and staff and more than 218,000 low-income children would be \ncut from the program. In my State, 24,000 low-income kids would lose \naccess to Head Start. They are doing all this while they are giving \nhuge tax breaks to the billionaires. It is wrong.\n  They would cut community health care centers--457,000 Californians. \nThat is a big number. There are some States that have fewer than that. \nBut 457,000 Californians would lose their health care if they went to \ncommunity health care centers. Twelve centers would close. Why on Earth \nwould anyone want to do it? They want to do it. We can figure out other \nways to get to those cuts. There are other ways to do it.\n  What amazes me is that Democrats are the ones who balanced the budget \nwith Bill Clinton. We took deficits as far as the eye could see and \nturned them around, balanced the budget, and created surpluses. Now we \nare being lectured that if we do not do it the exact way our friends \nwant, which is to hurt children and education and environmental \nprotection and, by the way, safety issues, such as making sure our \nairplanes do not develop holes in them, an important point, they go \nafter all of this.\n  There are cuts to afterschool programs. That breaks my heart because \nI know 11,000 kids in California would be shut out. We all know kids \nneed help after school. If they are alone, they get in trouble. If they \nget in trouble, it costs us money. These cuts are ridiculous.\n  We can sit together and work together and do it in a much more fair \nway, if people pay their fair share. If everybody takes a little bit of \na nick, we can get there. We have shown them how to get to $73 billion \nworth of cuts. That is just for the next 6 months. They are demanding \n$100 billion, their way or the highway. This is a ridiculous situation \nto be in.\n  I am going to say again, if you control one-third of the power in \nthis trio where you have the President is a third, the Senate is a \nthird, and the House is a third, and you are in the House and you are \nthe only one run by the Republicans, by what measure do you have the \nright to say my way or the highway? I don't think the American people \nwould think that is right. They want us to work together and that is \nthe message of the President.\n  I have to tell you, this budget by the Republicans, H.R. 1, that we \nvoted down here, would lead to nearly 900 fewer Border Patrol agents \nnationwide. Everyone wants to make sure our border is safe. Nine \nhundred would be gone. How about a $1.3 billion cut in the National \nInstitutes of Health, working as they are to develop new treatments and \ncures for cancer and Alzheimer's? If you ask the average family what \nthey fear, they will mention we fear that somebody in our family is \ngoing to suffer from one of these diseases.\n  It is outrageous. They are going to kill an Energy Department loan \nprogram when we know we cannot be dependent on foreign oil. We need to \nfind those alternatives. Energy research and development is slashed by \nalmost $2 billion. Transportation infrastructure is slashed. There are \nDraconian cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  And then all these riders. There are a whole bunch of them, as I know \nyou\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\nare aware, on the Environmental Protection site. Here is the irony. The \nRepublicans want to destroy the EPA, which was created by Richard \nNixon, a Republican President. Former Administrators of the EPA \nRuckelshaus and Whitman wrote a beautiful op-ed in the Washington \nPost--I believe it was the Washington Post, or the Times, I am not sure \nwhich--in which they clearly say this is a bipartisan matter. Yet the \nRepublicans, in H.R. 1, want to stop the EPA from enforcing the clean \nair law, which will make our skies dirtier. Our kids will get asthma, \npremature deaths, and all the rest. Big surprise, we voted it down \nhere. It only got 44 votes. It is radical. We can meet them way more \nthan halfway--we already have--without hurting our people and still \ngetting the budget cuts we need.\n  I am here to say it has now been 35 days, 35 days since the Senate \npassed S. 388. What is S. 388? S. 388 says, if there is a shutdown, \nMembers of Congress and the President will not receive their pay. Why \ndo I think this is important? Because most people do not know that, \nalthough our staffs will not get paid, although many Federal employees \nwill not get paid, Members of Congress have a special protection built \nin because we are paid under a statute and so is the President. So 35 \ndays ago we sent over to the House a very simple bill. It said if there \nis a shutdown, basically that means failure on our part to keep the \nGovernment going--what could be more basic than that--we should not get \npaid and we should not get paid retroactively. Our colleagues over \nthere have taken no action.\n  If you ask them, they will say: Yes, we did, we put that in another \nbill and passed it. You know what the other bill is? The other bill is \nan illegal bill. The other bill would make our Founders roll over in \ntheir graves. This is what the bill they embedded ``no budget, no pay'' \nin says. Follow me--and I especially hope the young people listening to \nthis debate will follow me because you have learned how a bill becomes \na law.\n  It goes through a committee usually. It doesn't have to. It goes to \none House, they pass it; the other House passes it; so you get the \nHouse and the Senate, and then it goes to the President. He either \nsigns it or vetoes it. If he signs it, it is law. If it is vetoed, two-\nthirds can override it.\n  Guess what, they put ``no budget, no pay'' into a bill that says the \nfollowing: If the Senate has not acted by a date certain on H.R. 1, \nthis horrible bill that I talked to you about, that bill will have been \ndeemed to be the law. It is a new deal: ``we deem.'' In other words: I \nhave 20 bills that I have introduced, today I deem them law. I have \nsome great bills. One is a Violence Against Children Act, very \nimportant. Another would help many of my transportation folks. I deem \nthem all law.\n  How is that legal? It is illegal. They are saying if we do not act on \nH.R. 1, again, it is deemed the law. It doesn't even pass the smell \ntest, the laugh test, and they have embedded in it ``no budget, no \npay.'' So, big surprise, we are not going to pass it over here in that \nform.\n  I am saying this is a maneuver, and a little dance by Speaker Boehner \nand Eric Cantor, who is the leader over there, to make it look as \nthough they are not for them getting their pay but to do nothing about \nit.\n  Let me tell you what I have done. I have written a letter. It has \nmany colleagues on it. I will read the letter. We are sending it by the \nend of business tonight.\n\n       Dear Speaker Boehner:\n       We write to discuss a meeting with you to discuss House \n     passage of S. 388, legislation to prohibit Members of \n     Congress and the President to prevent any Members of Congress \n     from receiving pay. Over 1 month has passed since the Senate \n     unanimously passed our bill. Despite written requests for \n     immediate House consideration, you have failed to schedule a \n     vote on stand-alone legislation that would treat Members of \n     Congress and the President no differently from other Federal \n     employees during a shutdown. Our bill is simple. If we cannot \n     do our work and keep the Government functioning, we should \n     not receive a paycheck. If we can't compromise and meet each \n     other halfway, then we should not get paid.\n\n  As we noted in a previous letter, while appearing on the CNN program \n``Crossfire'' in 1995, Mr. Boehner offered his support for a bill \nidentical to S. 388, so it is unclear why he has not scheduled a vote \non stand-alone legislation. Embedding ``no budget, no pay'' in a bill \nthat has no chance of passage isn't fooling anybody. We request a \nmeeting with Speaker Boehner as soon as possible, whether in person or \nvia conference call, to discuss how we can work together to immediately \nsend this legislation to the President.\n  Here is a bill that passed here without a dissenting vote. It is \nbasically 100 to nothing. In a time when we cannot agree on the color \nof that wall, we agreed to pass this ``no budget, no pay'' legislation. \nBut Speaker Boehner, who got a standing ovation--maybe it was a sitting \novation; it didn't say standing ovation--but he got an ovation for \ntalking about preparing for a shutdown, has not done one thing to make \nsure his Members and he do not get paid in case of a shutdown.\n  I think it is appalling. It is embarrassing. I am stunned. The reason \nI am pressing this is I believe that people should be treated equally. \nI believe that if they are cavalierly applauding and giving an ovation \nto Speaker Boehner when he talks about planning for a shutdown, I \nbelieve they want a shutdown and they have no skin in the game. They \npay no price. They get paid.\n  We had one of them over there complaining he didn't get paid enough \nmoney. He gets paid over $170,000. It wasn't enough money. Sorry, boo-\nhoo. There are people in this government who get paid $60,000, $40,000, \n$30,000, and they are not going to get paid. Sorry.\n  I am going to keep coming to this floor, 36 days, 37, 38, 39, 40--\nthis is just plain wrong.\n  I want to say who has signed our letter. You can see it is a good \nselection of the caucus, from liberal to conservative: Joe Manchin, \nClaire McCaskill, Michael Bennet, Ben Nelson, Bob Menendez, Debbie \nStabenow, Jay Rockefeller, Kay Hagan, Jeff Merkley, Ron Wyden, Mark \nWarner, Sherrod Brown, Tom Harkin, Chris Coons, Jon Tester, Sheldon \nWhitehouse, and Senator Mikulski and Senator Begich. Myself and Senator \nCasey are the first two names because it happens to be our bill. It is \nthe Boxer-Casey bill.\n  In closing, I want to spread the word from here over to the House \nside that we are serious, those of us who signed this letter. We are \nkeeping this issue in front of the American people because I assure \nyou, if you walked out and asked anyone who happened to be walking down \nthe street who was not involved here, who didn't work for the Federal \nGovernment, and you said this: In case of a shutdown because the two \nsides fail to negotiate an agreement, the only people who are assured \nof their pay would be Members of Congress and the President, what do \nyou think? I think the average person would say that is wrong; they \nshould pay a price. This is a basic function of theirs, to keep this \ngovernment running, to keep this country going.\n  I could tell, because I remember the last one, the pain and the hurt \nfrom people who wanted to get on Social Security, to veterans who \ntrying to figure out their disability payments, frankly to everyone who \ncalls your office or my office in deep trouble because they are having \nproblems with a Federal agency, they need the help of a Federal agency, \nthey want to make sure to get their Medicare taken care of, their \nSocial Security taken care of, or they are contractors who have private \nemployees and they are fixing the road or fixing a bridge. This is \nwrong.\n  We are trying to find out exactly who would be affected, but I can \ntell you right now is not the time to lose, for example, inspectors who \nare inspecting the safety of our aircraft. I hope they would stay on, \nbut we do not know.\n  What about those who are inspecting our nuclear powerplants? You \nknow, we have 23 reactors that are the same exact reactor as the ones \nthat have these problems in Japan. We don't want to stop those \ninspections; they have to move forward. We don't want to have the USGS; \nthat is, the U.S. Geological Survey, close down in the middle of making \nnew earthquake maps. I care about this a lot. I have two nuclear \npowerplants that are on or near earthquake faults.\n  I say to my friends on the other side, I know my message is not \npretty to you. It is not pretty to say you don't deserve to get paid in \ncase of a shutdown, but that is my message. Once the American people \nwake up to this,\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\nthat we are getting paid but our staffs are not getting paid, I think \nthere is going to be an outcry. So I ask the Speaker on behalf of all \nthose colleagues whose names I read to take up S. 388 without delay. It \nis sitting at the desk. What does it say? Members of Congress and the \nPresident should not be paid in case of a shutdown.\n  That is pretty simple.\n  I know my colleagues are on the Senate floor. Let me guess, Senator \nBlumenthal and Senator Lieberman, might you be here to discuss what \nhappened last night? And I am going to--since my remarks were not \nhappy, I am happy to give up the floor at this time and listen to their \nremarks. I congratulate both of them on a great victory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2116-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2116-S2119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT BASKETBALL TEAMS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my \nfriend from California. One might say, in the context of the debates \ngoing on in Congress now, that Senator Blumenthal and I have come to \nthe floor of the Senate to talk about a governmental program that \nreally works, that has inspired an entire State, perhaps a nation. I \nspeak, of course, of the University of Connecticut baseball program.\n  It is with great joy that I come to the floor of the Senate today to \ncongratulate the University of Connecticut men's basketball team and \ntheir great coach, Jim Calhoun, on winning the NCAA championship last \nnight. This has been a remarkable season. A team that started unranked, \na young team in a year that was supposed to be a rebuilding year came \ntogether in a magical way. They had their ups early in the season, they \nhad their downs as time went on, but the run that began with the Big \nEast tournament a few weeks ago has, for our State and I think anybody \nwho follows and loves college basketball, really been inspirational.\n  I do want to say, in terms of inspiration and I suppose I might say \nin the spirit of bipartisanship or at least good sportsmanship, that I \noffer congratulations to the Butler Bulldogs on their great run in the \ntournament, which also was inspirational. I thank my Indiana colleagues \nfor their good sportsmanship and for what they described as the best \npopcorn in America, made in Indiana--that is part of a friendly wager \nthey made, Senators Lugar and Coats, with Senator Blumenthal and me--\nwhich we will be pleased to accept and devour.\n  This has been quite a year. Led by their floor leader, Kemba Walker, \nand assisted by an extraordinary group of young athletes, this group of \nstudent athletes demonstrated to all of us what a combination of hard \nwork, dedication, commitment, and teamwork can achieve. Honestly, I tip \nmy hat to these ``top dogs'' today of college basketball.\n  Of course, in my opinion, no matter how good and how much potential \nthe players on this UConn men's basketball team had, they simply could \nnot have done it without their great coach and a great man, Jim \nCalhoun. This is not the first time I have had the honor to come to the \nSenate floor to commend the performance of Coach Calhoun and the UConn \nHuskies. In fact, with last night's victory, Jim has etched his name in \nbasketball glory by winning his third national title. He becomes only \nthe fifth coach in history to win three national championships, and he \njoins the ranks of other greats such as John Wooden and Coach K, Mike \nKrzyzewski. He is only one of 8 coaches to run up over 800 career wins.\n  Over the years, I have watched Jim build upon the athletic program at \nUConn, transforming it from an occasionally regional contender to a \nregular national powerhouse. His three national championships and seven \nBig East championships have put our team, the State team of a \nrelatively small State, on the college basketball map and set a high \nstandard of excellence. I think none of this would have happened \nwithout Coach Calhoun's vision, his drive, his caring for players, and \nhis extraordinary basketball brains.\n  There is a larger lesson, as there often is in sports. But this was a \nteam that came into the Big East tournament with most people thinking \nthe season would end quickly for them. They had will, which is a word \nCoach Calhoun uses a lot. They always had the potential and the \nability, but they had the will. I am looking at the Senate pages now, \nyoung people.\n  There are a lot of people who read these UConn Huskies out at \ndifferent times of the season, but they didn't read themselves out of \nthe competition, and their coach never did. He kept telling them they \nhad what it took to be champions. They pulled together. They worked \ntogether. They developed their potential to the fullest. They played \nand lived like a family. And you might say Coach Calhoun is the loving \nfather who employs a lot of tough love but draws greatness out of these \nplayers and gives all of us in Connecticut a tremendous sense of pride.\n  I do not want to finish my statement without also telling Coach Geno \nAuriemma and the great players on the UConn women's basketball team how \nproud we are of them and how much we thank them for another remarkable \nseason that was also filled with historic accomplishments, including an \nimpressive run to the Final Four and a recordbreaking 90-consecutive-\nwins streak. The Lady Huskies were led by the all-impressive Maya \nMoore, who achieved AP All American honors in each of her 4 seasons at \nUConn and scored over 3,000 career points. So I give my congratulations \nto Coach Geno Auriemma and to the players on the UConn Lady Huskies, \nwho also made us proud.\n  I am going to yield the floor in a minute to my colleague, Senator \nBlumenthal. It strikes me that this is the first time I have had the \nchance to celebrate here when my former colleague, Senator Chris Dodd, \nis not here. The first time we celebrated together on the floor, I \nended my remarks with the UConn cheer. Afterward, Senator Dodd, then \nthe senior Senator, gave me a hard time as to whether I would make a \ngood cheerleader and whether it was a decorous thing to do on the floor \nof the Senate. I told him at the time that it could have been worse--I \ncould have just done the UConn Huskies' ``woof.''\n  But now I am the senior Senator, and may I conclude by simply saying \nU-C-O-N-N, UConn, UConn, UConn. National champs. I know my ending needs \na little work, and I will be working on that from now until next year \nwhen we hopefully secure another championship.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Blumenthal.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut for that \nvery eloquent tribute to our team. I am not going to try to match the \ncheer this year but perhaps next. And I thank him for providing such a \nmodel of support for the University of Connecticut, truly a government \nprogram that works but also, obviously, one that is completely \nnonpolitical, bipartisan--perhaps providing another lesson for us here.\n  I am very honored to rise in celebrating this remarkable \naccomplishment. This majestic and momentous victory culminates a kind \nof magical journey for this team. They defied the odds. They disproved \nthe doubt and the doubters, and they stared down adversity with real \ngrit and grace. Remember that they rallied after losing 4 out of 5 of \ntheir last regular season games and then had an extraordinary streak of \n11 straight wins to win the Big East and then the NCAA championship. \nThey were relentless and courageous in believing in themselves \nthroughout that very tough battle. At some point, as someone said, this \nteam forgot how to lose--again, a life lesson for many of us.\n  As in every remarkable triumph, this one had a team effort and it had \nstars. Kemba Walker was perhaps the most notable among them, and he won \nawards that recognized his remarkable individual effort, but there were \nalso freshmen who were important--I say that as a freshman Senator--\nJeremy Lamb and Roscoe Smith.\n  As important as any player, as my colleague has recognized, was Coach \nCalhoun, who really demonstrated again the reason he is a champion and \na hero to Huskies fans throughout the State of Connecticut and the \nNation.\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\nHe gave his team strength at the critical time, and he drew that \nstrength from his own life experiences. Just last Sunday, he recalled \nhis day, shortly after his father's death, when he was pumping gas and \ncutting stone and collecting metal in a shipyard in Massachusetts. He \nis a fighter, he is a leader, and the UConn basketball program has come \na long way under his leadership.\n  Many recall the days when they had no championships and certainly no \nwinning teams. The program began in 1901, with a season that consisted \nof a single game against Windham High School, and it was 98 years until \nCoach Calhoun won them their first championship and now their third. He \nwon that championship because of the great playing of those teams and \nthe players who have gone on to performances that are remarkable in \nother leagues.\n  I also wish to join in paying tribute to Geno Auriemma and the Lady \nHuskies. They came very close, heartbreakingly close, to another \nchampionship. Maya Moore and every member of that team deserves our \ngratitude and admiration.\n  There is no doubt that both teams--both of them--have a bright \nfuture. I look forward to being here again next year and celebrating \nanother Huskies victory, hopefully by both the women's and the men's \nteams.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Paul Ryan is a Congressman from \nJanesville, WI. I know it because it is right across the border from \nIllinois. I have relatives and friends who live in the area. I like \nPaul. I served with him on the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission. We \nspent a lot of time together. He is a very bright person, and he has \nbeen given a big assignment in the House of Representatives as chairman \nof the Budget Committee. He and I have different views of the world and \nof politics, but I respect him very much for his intelligence.\n  He has laid out a budget plan for House Republicans that is very \nspecific in the goals he has set for America. There are some aspects on \nwhich Paul and I agree. We agree on the fact that we are facing a \ndeficit crisis. We cannot continue to borrow 40 cents for every dollar \nwe spend. It is unsustainable. We borrow the money from countries such \nas China. China is a nation that is hard charging and competing with \nthe United States, and they are one of our major creditors. That is a \ndelicate position to be in, when a country that one is competing with \nfor jobs and economic growth also happens to be its banker, its \ncreditor. That is the case. We can't sustain that. As we watch our \nnational debt increase, we understand we have to take serious measures \nto deal with it.\n  This morning, in a bipartisan meeting of Senators with the President, \nwe had the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, \ndescribe our current situation. At this point in time, about 14 percent \nof our gross domestic product is coming into the government in revenue, \nwhich is the lowest percentage in 60 years, and expenditures represent \nabout 24 percent of our gross domestic product. That 10 percent \ndifference between revenue and expenditure equals deficit. We have to \nreach a point where we are prepared to cut spending and make changes \nthat will lead to a more stable economy and deal with our deficit \nhonestly.\n  There were two State legislators who wrote a letter to the New York \nTimes several weeks ago that caught my attention, a Democrat and \nRepublican. They were talking about their State challenge, and they \nsaid: We have come to the conclusion that we can't cut our way out of \nit, and we can't tax our way out of it. We have to think our way out of \nit. We have to focus on changes in State government policy that reduce \nwaste and inefficiency and move us toward a more solid position.\n  I think the same lesson applies in Washington. We have to be thinking \nabout what we need to do to move forward so our children and \ngrandchildren don't inherit the deficit we now face, a deficit which, \nof course, is growing by the day.\n  I always like to give a little historical perspective so people \nunderstand where we are and how we arrived. I ask people to think back \nto the year 2000, if they can. In the year 2000, President William \nJefferson Clinton was leaving office, and President George W. Bush was \ncoming into office. Snapshot: What was the state of America then? The \nsnapshot would tell us that we had a national debt in the year 2000 of \n$5 trillion. The accumulated net national debt of America when \nPresident Clinton left office was $5 trillion. We were in our third \nyear of generating a surplus; that is, more money coming into the \ngovernment than being spent. The surplus was being put into the Social \nSecurity trust fund and buying more years of solvency for the trust \nfund.\n  President Clinton, as he left office, handed the keys to the White \nHouse to President Bush and said: This coming fiscal year, 2001, you \nwill have a $120 billion surplus. Welcome to Washington.\n  Now, fast-forward 8 years later. The year is 2008. President George \nW. Bush is leaving office, handing the keys to the White House to \nPresident Barack Obama. What was the national debt? It was $5 trillion \nwhen President Bush came into office, and as he left the projected debt \nfor the next year was $11 trillion. In 8 years President Bush had more \nthan doubled the national debt, and we were witnessing record deficits. \nHe said to President Obama: Here is next year's budget. Incidentally, \nit is $1.2 trillion in deficit.\n  How did this reversal occur in only 8 years? It occurred because the \npolicies of the Bush administration called for waging two wars and not \npaying for them and doing something that had never been done in U.S. \nhistory by any President: tax cuts in the middle of a war. A war is \nover and above the ordinary expenses of government. If we cut revenues \nat the same time, it makes it impossible to balance the budget. In \nfact, it drove us to record-high deficits. That is what President Obama \ninherited, an $11 trillion national debt and a deficit for the first \nyear in office of $1.2 trillion and losing hundreds of thousands of \njobs to unemployment as he was being sworn in.\n  Fortunately, the recession we face has slowed down and started to \nstabilize. As of last Friday, we are seeing the lowest unemployment \nrate in 2 years. We are coming out of this slowly, but we are coming \nout of it. We are making a recovery.\n  The point we made in the deficit commission--and it needs to be \nrepeated--is, as we chart a glidepath to bring us out of deficit, let's \nget the recession behind us. Let's get the 14 million unemployed \nAmericans back to work. We will not balance the budget with 14 million \nAmericans unemployed. These are people who need the basic necessities \nof life and are not working and paying taxes. That creates a drain on \nthe Treasury. We need to move toward restoring jobs, creating good-\npaying jobs as part of our overall agenda.\n  That is the lead-in to Congressman Paul Ryan proposing a budget \nresolution on his side of the rotunda. He released it today. As we take \na look at this resolution, where it leads, we see that Congressman Ryan \nclaims that he will reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 \nyears compared to the President's budget, but he achieves this solely \nthrough spending cuts. His cuts are focused. Instead of looking at all \nof the spending of government, he takes a small amount out of the \nPentagon spending, some $78 billion. In light of the Pentagon budget, \nthat is a nick, a fractional amount. I want America to be safe. I want \nour security to never be in question, but we waste a lot of money at \nthe Pentagon with contracting out and with things we should not buy. We \ncould save a lot of money there.\n  Congressman Ryan's budget does not address that. He leaves, \nunfortunately, that aspect of the budget untouched, largely; $78 \nbillion over 5 years is hardly an effort to try to reduce waste and \nefficiency in the Department of Defense.\n  Then he turns to the domestic discretionary budget. That represents \n12 percent of the overall budget. That has health care, education, \nmedical research, things of that nature, in it. That is where he makes \nthe biggest cuts in the coming 5 and 10 years.\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\n  When it comes to the revenue side of the equation, should, for \nexample, those who are well off, millionaires, pay higher taxes? No. \nThe budget proposed by Congressman Ryan reduces the top marginal rate \nfor individuals and corporations to 25 percent, from 39.6 percent, \nproducing an enormous windfall with that reduction to the wealthiest \nindividuals and corporations, even as spending for programs that \nbenefit low-income families, such as Pell grants for students and low-\nincome families to go to college, are being slashed under his budget. \nBecause the tax plan is revenue neutral, the plan must by definition \ninclude tax increases for lower income Americans to pay for the tax \ncuts which Congressman Ryan's budget gives to the wealthiest 2 percent.\n  Is that the key to our future? Cutting taxes for the wealthiest \npeople, raising taxes for lower and middle-income families? I don't \nthink that is fair. Those of us who love this country and feel blessed \nthat we were given a chance to live here and do well should accept the \nreality that we pay back something to this great country and keep it \nsafe and growing in the right direction. Congressman Ryan's budget \nresolution goes in the opposite direction, cutting taxes for those who \nhave been well off, those who are well-to-do.\n  What troubles me the most about the Ryan budget resolution is what it \ndoes to health care. We cannot seriously address the deficit and debt \nwithout addressing the cost of health care. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, we spent a lot of time debating that over the previous 2 years. \nWe came up with a plan to try to at least reduce the rate of growth in \nhealth care costs. I think we achieved some good things. We tried to \nbring more people into coverage when it came to health care and fewer \npeople showing up at hospitals with no insurance, no payment, actually \nhaving their medical bills transferred to everyone else.\n  Chairman Ryan released a budget proposal for fiscal year 2012 that \nwould repeal the health reform law which we passed and was signed by \nthe President. It would end the Medicare and Medicaid Programs as we \nknow them today. His proposal balances the budget, unfortunately, at \nthe expense of those who can least afford it: low-income families, \nseniors, and people with disabilities.\n  First, Chairman Ryan proposes repealing the entire Affordable Care \nAct. That means all the consumer protections and benefits put in place \nby that law would disappear. What does it mean to the average family? \nRight now we changed the law so young Americans can stay on their \nparents' health insurance policies until age 27. Having lived through \nthis experience of putting kids through college, it is a real worry. \nOne's son or daughter graduates from college, they no longer have \nhealth insurance through the ordinary means, either through college or \nthrough the family, and now they are on their own looking for a job. If \nyou are like most parents, you worry. They are one diagnosis, one \naccident away from serious medical bills. You want them to have the \nbest care.\n  I can't tell my colleagues how many times I asked my son and \ndaughter: Do you have health insurance now that you are finished with \ncollege?\n  Dad, I feel great. I am healthy.\n  I wish we could all be so confident. We changed the law so that young \npeople could stay under their parents' health insurance plans until age \n27. That is reasonable.\n  The Ryan Republican budget resolution would repeal that. I don't \nthink that is helpful.\n  We also have what is called the doughnut hole in Medicare where \nseniors receive payments for prescription drugs. There is a gap in \ncoverage called the doughnut hole. We start filling that in so seniors \nhave seamless coverage so they can have the prescriptions they need to \nstay healthy, independent, and strong, out of the hospital, out of the \nnursing home, in the life they want to lead. Unfortunately, that effort \nwould be repealed by the Ryan Republican budget resolution.\n  In addition, we put in the law a provision that people with \npreexisting conditions wouldn't be denied health insurance. Initially, \nwe protect children. If you have a child who is diabetic, has a history \nof cancer or some other disease, it might be next to impossible to buy \nhealth insurance. We protect that family and say children under the age \nof 18 cannot be discriminated against because of a preexisting \ncondition. The Ryan proposal would eliminate that protection as well.\n  It also means that health care delivery system reforms put in place \nby the law, things such as bundling payments to medical providers and \nreducing reimbursements to hospitals with high rates of infection would \ngo away.\n  These changes are designed to lower health care costs, but the Ryan \nproposal would eliminate them. His plan is simply cost-shifting, not \ncost saving, because we had scored by the Congressional Budget Office--\na bipartisan agency--a savings of $120 billion in the first 10 years \nfrom our health care reform. So instead of reducing the deficit, \nChairman Ryan's proposal will increase the deficit by at least $210 \nbillion by repealing health care reform.\n  Next, Chairman Ryan proposes converting Medicaid into a block grant \nprogram. He says this will help the States rein in costs with more \nflexibility. In fact, it just shifts the costs to States, low-income \nbeneficiaries, and medical providers. When we look at the dollar \namounts, he would be reducing Medicaid reimbursement back to the States \nby 28 percent.\n  Who are some of the beneficiaries of Medicaid in Illinois, in \nPennsylvania, and New Hampshire? Well, the beneficiaries include a lot \nof elderly people living in nursing homes. These are folks who no \nlonger have a savings account to turn to. They have a Medicare payment \nand a Medicaid payment, and that is it. If we reduce the reimbursement \nunder Medicaid, unfortunately, many of them cannot stay in the nursing \nhomes and convalescent centers in which they now live. So we have to \nthink carefully about the way we deal with Medicaid.\n  By my estimation, my staff's estimation, the $770 billion cut in \nMedicaid with the Ryan budget proposal is about a 28-percent cut in \nreimbursement for Medicaid in the years to come.\n  That is not the worst part. The worst part, I am afraid, is Chairman \nRyan proposes ending Medicare as we know it. Back in the 1960s, the \ncreation of Medicare was the answer to the prayers of many senior \ncitizens. They had Social Security, which provided them with a basic \nmonthly payment that might help them maintain their independence and \ncontinue on if their pension or savings did not cover life's expenses, \nbut then came medical expenses. With Medicare we said: If you will pay \nin through payroll taxes through a lifetime, when you retire you will \nbe covered with Medicare insurance.\n  Story after story has been told in my family and others of people who \nfound themselves not Medicare eligible but without health insurance. I \nhad a brother--a late brother--who had heart issues. He retired as a \nmember of management from Boeing aircraft and then had a massive heart \nattack and surgery, and then his health insurance was canceled before \nhe reached age 65. He was worried, worried he would have to dip into \nsavings if he ever had to go back to the hospital. Fortunately for him, \nhe did not have another problem until he reached Medicare eligibility.\n  So Medicare ends up being a lifeline for many seniors; otherwise, \nthey would see their savings exhausted which they planned to use for \nthe rest of their lives and their security.\n  Chairman Ryan proposes ending Medicare as we know it and, instead, \ngiving seniors subsidies to enroll in private health insurance plans. \nThis might save some Federal funds, but that is because the Federal \nsubsidy would not cover the full cost of private plans that are as good \nas Medicare.\n  I am glad to see Senator Bill Nelson of Florida on the Senate floor. \nMy guess is, Medicare is a pretty important issue in Florida, and I \nthink he probably has some strong feelings about this issue.\n  But what Chairman Ryan has proposed in the House budget resolution \nwould mean seniors would lose the guaranteed benefits they have today. \nHow much of a cut in benefits? Well, he is very explicit: 60 percent, a \n60-percent cut in Medicare benefits for senior citizens. How is that \ngoing to work? How are we going to find ourselves in a situation where \nprivate health insurance companies are somehow going to provide 60 \npercent more in services for the\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\ncurrent cost? It is not likely to happen. This will not bring down \noverall health spending, incidentally. It just pushes the costs on to \nseniors and makes them sicker when they finally show up at the \nhospital.\n  In fact, Medicare provides health care for seniors at a price less \nthan the same benefits cost in the private market. It is a popular \nprogram because it works.\n  The point I would like to make--and I see my colleague here; and I \nwill yield the floor to him--is, I share Chairman Ryan's concern about \nthe deficit and concern about health costs. But if we are going to be \nhonest and deal with this, as I said at the outset, we cannot cut our \nway out of this problem. We cannot tax our way out of this problem. We \nhave to think our way out of this problem. We have to find approaches \nthat more effectively use the wonderful medical resources in this \ncountry at a savings.\n  We have to reward value when it comes to health care as opposed to \nvolume. We have to make certain those who are ripping off current \nprograms see that activity come to an end. If we work together on a \nbipartisan basis, we can achieve that. I hope we can do it on a \nbipartisan basis because it is the only way that will work. Trying to \nimpose this by one party, whether it is in the continuing resolution or \nin the long-term budget resolution, is not likely to achieve the goals \nmost Americans hope we achieve as Members of the Senate and Congress.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator has pointed out very accurately \nthe analysis of this most recent proposal by the chairman in the House \nof Representatives. If I recall, did we not address cutting some $400 \nbillion out of Medicare over the next decade in the health care reform \nbill that was passed last year?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right, I say to the Senator from Florida, \nand there were people who were critical of us and said we were, \nunfortunately, cutting Medicare benefits, which we were not. The \nSenator may recall that one of the first amendments on the floor--it \nmay have been from Senator Bennet of Colorado, if I am not mistaken--\nsaid we are going to protect Medicare benefits, but we are going to try \nto cut the waste out of the current Medicare Program--the duplication \nand the overcharging that is going on--so seniors will not pay in terms \nof health care, but the taxpayers will not be held responsible for \nsomething that is not serving them well.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator respond to another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Is it true that in the proposal from the \nchairman in the House of Representatives, he would take the Medicaid \nProgram--which, generally, is a split, something like 55 percent \nFederal money, with 45 percent State money, for the health care for the \npoor and the disabled--that his proposal is he would give this as a \nblock grant to the States for the Governors and the State legislatures \nto decide how they were going to distribute it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I say to the Senator from Florida, that is my \nunderstanding. But it also includes a 28-percent reduction in the \namount of money the Federal Government is going to pay into this. So in \nyour State, and mine, too, a lot of elderly people live in nursing \nhomes and depend on Medicaid. Without Medicare and Medicaid, they could \nnot stay there. If you cut by 28 percent the reimbursement under \nMedicaid, I wonder what is going to happen to those people.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator believe the experience of \nthe State of Florida: When they tried to put all Medicaid into \ninsurance companies--otherwise known as HMOs, health maintenance \norganizations--those organizations pulled out of serving the poor in \nrural counties, and yet that is a proposal in front of the State \nlegislature of Florida at this very moment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Florida, representing a \nState as diverse as his, with rural areas and major urban centers, \nthere are some areas where private health insurance companies are not \ngoing to do business because it is not profitable. So when Chairman \nRyan says we will just try to shift all of this responsibility to the \nprivate health insurance market, I am afraid many Americans--those in \nrural areas, maybe some with preexisting conditions because he is \nrepealing the Affordable Health Care Act too--are going to find \nthemselves without health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And a further question to the Senator from \nIllinois: Would he characterize the proposal by the chairman in the \nHouse of Representatives on Medicare as not only cutting the payments \nto Medicare but the way Medicare is being delivered by altering that \ninto the private sector?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in response--and this will be my last response \nbecause I have to run to a meeting--but the interesting point about \nChairman Ryan's proposal is the money does not go to the senior \ncitizens under Medicare; the money goes to the insurance company. Think \nabout that: a voucher to an insurance company, and the hope is they \nwould provide the coverage you need.\n  Medicare, I want to tell you, is like Social Security, one of those \nprograms that people have confidence in. They know the coverage and \nthey know what has happened. Since the 1960s, under President Johnson, \nwhen we initiated Medicare, seniors live longer, they are healthier, \nthey are strong, and they are independent. That is what you get with \ngood quality health care. When you start making 60 percent cuts in \nMedicare benefits, such as Chairman Ryan's House Republican budget \nproposal, you run the risk that a lot of people will not get the good \ncoverage they have today in Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I say in conclusion--and I thank the Senator \nfor yielding--all you have to do is ask a senior citizen do they like \ntheir Medicare or would they prefer to have it done by an insurance \ncompany, and I think you will get a resounding answer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2119-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2119-S2122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           USE IT OR LOSE IT\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to perhaps switch the discussion from what my colleagues were \nreferring to earlier in terms of the budget and speak a little bit \nabout the issue of energy--obviously, a topic of great concern.\n  The President has addressed it as recently as last week in a major \naddress at Georgetown. There have been a lot of discussions about what \nit is we need to do to respond to the higher prices families are paying \nat the pump and just how we deal with the issue of energy in general. \nThere has been much discussion about this concept of ``use it or lose \nit.'' I want to speak to that proposal a little bit this afternoon.\n  It is a rather strange proposal that claims to address the rising \ncost of oil and gas for America's working families. The premise of this \nis, even with oil at more than $100 a barrel, and even though lease \nterms are already limited by law to 5 to 10 years, energy companies \nsomehow are hording Federal lands and refusing to produce the resources \nthat are beneath them.\n  ``Use it or lose it'' has been presented by this administration and \nothers as a way to increase our Nation's energy production. But even a \ncursory review will show this is fundamentally flawed in its premise. \nThis proposal will not increase American production. It will not \nincrease jobs or create jobs. It will not raise government revenues or \nbolster our security. Instead, I believe it is a diversion from our \nmore critical need to produce more of our own resources and to \nstreamline our burdensome regulatory processes.\n  Now, the idea behind ``use it or lose it'' is to simply punish \ncompanies for not drilling on lands they have leased, so they either \ndrill or they give back the acreage to the government which can then \nresell it to someone else. But, interestingly, this proposal has drawn \nsome support from a number of Senators and from the President himself \nwho, until recently, have claimed: Well, we can't drill our way out of \nthis. We can't drill our way to lower gas prices. America's oil--and we \nhave been repeatedly told this--has minimal impact on global prices and \ntakes too long to bring online.\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\n  So I do not know, maybe this is a change of heart. If that is so, I \nam glad to see it. I do hope--I do hope--their proposal is a signal \nthat, indeed, they would like to see drilling on every leased Federal \nacre onshore, offshore. That is certainly the premise of the proposal, \neven though it is perhaps a pretty major departure from the previous \npositions.\n  Now, the advocates of ``use it or lose it'' have pointed out \ncorrectly that there are millions of acres leased in this country that \nare not currently producing oil and gas, but they have misidentified \nthe reason why. Chances are maybe there is just no oil present on that \nland. Perhaps exploration is ongoing or, in many cases, the Federal \nGovernment has simply blocked the drilling. To add a new penalty to \nthis process and to add a new layer to existing bureaucracy will only \nbackfire.\n  From the outset, I think it is important to understand what is \ninvolved in oil and gas production. This is an incredibly capital-\nintensive, labor-intensive business, and from a technological \nperspective, the process is extraordinarily complex. I think we saw, \nafter the Deepwater Horizon, cameras trained a mile below the surface \nof the ocean, and it was described by many as, this is akin to how we \ndeal with putting a man on the Moon. This is complicated stuff, and \nthere is no ``X marks the spot'' as to where that oil is actually going \nto be found.\n  It can take years, not to mention tremendous amounts of money, to \nfinally locate these commercial deposits. When there is resource \npresent, it takes some teams of some pretty highly skilled and trained \nengineers to figure out how we are going to bring it to market. There \nare the entire legal departments that have to wade through the \nmultitude of permits, the analysis, the plans that are required by our \nFederal Government. This process takes a considerable amount of \npatience and for lots of good reasons, but the government is certainly \nnot in a hurry to provide leaseholders the approval they need to move \nforward.\n\n  Last week, the Interior Department had an opportunity to explain what \ngoes on within the exploration process and show why not all Federal \nleases immediately produce oil and gas. Instead, the Interior \nDepartment issued a report that attempts to portray many Federal leases \nas idle or unused. What could have been a very helpful and instructive \nprocess was instead hopelessly politicized, and that is unfortunate.\n  The findings of the Interior Department's report I believe defy \ncommon sense, general business principles, and what we know to be true \nabout the Federal regulatory process. The definition of ``inactive'' \npurposely excludes many important development activities, and there is \nno acknowledgment that oftentimes it is the government itself that is \ncausing the delays in drilling.\n  I guess one of the more telling examples of what is wrong with the \nInterior Department's new report is its depiction of what is happening \nin Alaska right now. Companies have been trying for years--trying for \nyears--to bring their Federal leases in this State of Alaska into \nproduction. These efforts have been blocked. They have been delayed by \nthe Federal Government, especially this administration, and they have \nbeen blocked at every turn. Despite this, the Interior Department's \nreport claims that just 1 percent--1 percent--of Alaska's leases are \nproducing and puts the blame on industry. But when I talk to folks back \nhome, when I talk to those who are trying every single day, getting up \nand trying their hardest to advance so we can get to levels of \nproduction, they only find that there is yet one more hurdle, one more \nroadblock that is thrown up and thrown up by the government. It causes \nincredible frustration. It is hard to pick what would be described as \nthe best example of companies trying to produce from their leases--\nwhich, I might add, they purchased at the invitation of the Federal \nGovernment--yet they are being forbidden by the administration from \npursuing their exploratory operations. It is happening in the National \nPetroleum Reserve Alaska. Think about the name. This is the National \nPetroleum Reserve Alaska. That is pretty ironic. We can't get started \nthere, and one of the biggest reasons we can't is we are being \nblocked--the producers are being blocked--from getting a permit to \nbuild a bridge over a river to get started.\n  As regrettable and as ironic as that example is, there is an even \nhigher profile example that we see up North, and that is what Shell is \nattempting to do. They have set a record--and a record that is \ncertainly not enviable but a record nonetheless--for both dollars \ninvested and frustration experienced in return. This is a situation \nwhere a company has spent a little over $4 billion--this is billion \nwith a B--they spent $4 billion to buy Federal acreage in Alaska's \nOuter Continental Shelf nearly 7 years ago. Since that time, Shell has \ndone nothing but slog through an incredibly long and incredibly arduous \npermitting process. Air permits that take 6 weeks to acquire in the \nGulf of Mexico have now been delayed for over 5 years.\n  I ask my colleagues to put that in context. A company, at the \ninvitation of the Federal Government, purchased leases over 7 years \nago, has put more than $4 billion into trying to get to exploration, \nhas spent 5 years waiting on permits, where in other parts of the \ncountry permits can be turned around in 6 weeks, and they have yet the \nopportunity to even start. So can anyone honestly suggest we ought to \npunish Shell or any company that is going through this for the Federal \nGovernment's failure to allow even exploratory drilling to proceed? Is \nit fair that we demand Shell pay the price because the government has \nfailed to issue a permit that even the EPA and even the Administrator \nof the EPA has acknowledged poses no human health risk? This is where \nwe are sitting right now.\n  I was incredulous. I had an opportunity to ask the Secretary of the \nInterior, who is a friend of mine--most certainly a friend who I \nacknowledge has a very difficult job, a very challenging job--but he \ncould not assure me that the so-called ``use it or lose it'' fee would \nnot apply to the millions of acres of leased land in Alaska, both \nonshore and offshore, where the Federal Government has sold the leases \nbut is not allowing drilling activity. It is similar to a commercial \nreal estate company offering to rent some office space to you. We go \nahead. You pay the rent. I never give you the key, so you can't access \nyour commercial office space. Then I am going to go ahead and assess a \nfine. We are going to penalize you when you failed to open your doors \nfor business. That is kind of what is happening up North. It is not a \n``use it or lose it'' policy, it is ``heads we win, tails you lose.'' \nMy colleagues have to imagine: What would such a policy say about the \nway our government conducts its businesses and manages its resources?\n  ``Use it or lose it'' is drawn from a desire to do the right thing, \nwhich is to increase our domestic production, but I also believe it \nreveals a fundamental lack of understanding about how energy resources \nare developed and how they are brought to market. It risks very real \nconsequences for our energy production here in America. Because instead \nof encouraging producers to find energy faster, it would actually \ndiscourage them from discovering it in the first place. Instead of \ncreating jobs, it would likely end jobs. Instead of raising new \nrevenues for the Federal Government, it would likely diminish \ntaxpayers' returns from leasing and production.\n  It seems as though every time oil prices are on the rise, we come \ntogether and we debate how we are going to respond to them and every \ntime someone points out we should be producing far more of our own--\nfrankly, very tremendous resource base--someone steps forward with the \npotential scapegoat, perhaps to distract attention from our need to be \nleasing more new lands. It is like clockwork around here. Instead of \nmaking the hard choices about what we can do to better insulate \nourselves from higher crude prices and geopolitical instability, we see \nproposals to impose windfall profit taxes, to pour unprecedented sums \nof money in unproven alternative technologies, to rein in speculators, \nto sue OPEC, to raise taxes and fees on production, and now to force \ncompanies to act faster or to face greater penalties.\n  Until we see some evidence that companies are refusing to develop \ntheir leases, I have to call it like I see it. ``Use it or lose it'' is \na ploy to claim\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\nthat we support increased domestic production, without doing anything \nto ensure that domestic production is the actual result of our Federal \nenergy policies.\n  There has been a lot of discussion, when we are talking about energy, \nabout Brazil and their potential--how that nation is set to \nsignificantly ramp up its oil production, and we commend the \nBrazilians. They have been able to make a number of very important \ndiscoveries, estimated at about 50 billion barrels of oil equivalent. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Brazil's oil production rose by \n876 percent over the past 20 years--876 percent over the past 20 years. \nThey are now planning to double their current production in less than \n10 years. So there are pretty remarkable things going on there. Even \nwhile Brazil is developing their current resource base, they are \nactively looking for more. They are working aggressively. They are \npursuing that objective while expanding their production and their use \nof alternative energy sources. They are kind of pursuing the ``all of \nthe above'' we talk about so often.\n  In the United States, we have technically recoverable oil resources \nestimated at 157 billion barrels, more than three times--more than \nthree times--what Brazil has recently found. I don't understand. I \ndon't understand why we refuse to set the same ambitious goals for \nincreasing our production that Brazil has, even as we continue to \npursue alternative energies that will diversify our supplies equally. \nWhen it comes to energy, we should strive to be our own best customer, \nnot Brazil's.\n  As Federal policymakers, we need to think carefully about what we \ndemand of any industry, including oil and gas. When we tax something, \nthe fact is, we get less of it. I don't think we want to make ourselves \neven more dependent on foreign oil right now. We don't want to \ndiscourage domestic production, especially under the guise of promoting \nit, and we have no reason to add yet another layer to an already \ndaunting regulatory system.\n  I strongly urge us in the Senate, in the Congress, to recognize ``use \nit or lose it'' for what it is. It is an attempt to extract more money \nfrom the companies, not to extract more energy from the ground. It is \nnot the right approach for America, and it will not move our energy \npolicy in the right direction.\n  I do take comfort in one fact, and that is this: At least the debate \nis now about how to produce more oil and not whether to produce more \noil. My work on the Energy Committee and certainly what goes on in the \nState of Alaska has taught me much about how and how not to achieve \ngreater oil production if we want more domestic production--and I think \nwe all recognize the President's verbal commitment to this and the \nchange of heart amongst some of my colleagues--it is time to eliminate \nthe needless redtape and allow access to America's huge resources that \nare still off-limits.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time and the opportunity to \nspeak this afternoon on yet another aspect of our country's much needed \nenergy policy and how we can continue to find ways that will move us \ntoward a future where we do engage in energy sources that are clean and \nrenewable while also harvesting our bountiful supply in this country as \nwe find ways to produce more domestically.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to say to \nthe Senator from Alaska that she knows of my respect for her and my \npersonal friendship with her and my personal opinion that she is one of \nthe finest Senators we have.\n  I do want to ask the Senator a question, and it is a circumstance \nthat I happen to be here next in line to speak about a different \nsubject than the Senator spoke about. This Senator is one of those \nsponsors of the ``use it or lose it'' legislation. I certainly will \ndefer to the Senator from Alaska with regard to Alaska and the drilling \noffshore there.\n  My question is about the drilling of the Gulf of Mexico, which this \nSenator has some familiarity with, and that there are 37 million acres \nin the Gulf of Mexico under lease, where the oil is. But of the 37 \nmillion acres, there are only 7 million that are drilled. Thirty \nmillion acres are not drilled, and it has been that way for years and \nyears. The Senator makes a compelling argument with regard to Alaska, \nbut how can that argument apply to the 30 million acres in the Gulf of \nMexico that are not drilled but, as the Senator has said, ought to be \ndrilled?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the question of my \ncolleague from Florida, as we recognize that coming from different \nparts of the country, where we have access in close proximity to the \noil and gas resource, but we recognize that there are differences \nbetween where we are in our geography and perhaps the approach.\n  In the Gulf of Mexico, I think your climate allows for exploration \nand production probably 365 days out of the year, which is a little bit \ndifferent than in our arctic environment. We respect that. To the \nSenator's question, which is a very legitimate and fair question--this \nis why we had hoped so much that with this report from the Department \nof the Interior, it would have allowed for a breakdown so we could \nunderstand what is happening with these many thousands of leases that \nare out there and existing. What is the true status? To put it in idle \nor unuse is not very clear, quite honestly. What does that mean? Are we \nin the exploratory phase and so we are not in production? And what \ncategory is that? Is this an older lease about which perhaps they have \ndetermined there simply is not the--for instance, if you are drilling \nin some deep waters, it is extraordinarily costly. As I mentioned, \nthese are complex, and the technologies are quite considerable. If you \nhave done some exploration but you find very limited or perhaps \nnothing--as I mentioned, we don't have that magic X that leads us right \ndown to what we call in the north the ``elephant find.''\n  So I think it is important to understand what it is that we have and \nthe status of these leases. This information is critical to us, because \nif they are in the exploratory phase, and it is taking longer because, \nquite honestly, we have higher standards with the environmental \npermits, which are taking more time, and I think we realize after the \nDeepwater Horizon situation and a great deal of scrutiny on MMS, quite \nhonestly, we didn't have sufficient numbers issuing permits within that \nagency to keep up. So we need to understand where the issue is, where \nthe problem is. There may, in fact--and I will concede on the floor \nthat there may be some leases that are in existence where the producers \nhave said: You know what, we only have so much ability to move forward \nwith the financing of all of this, so we are going to explore and \nproduce in wells 1, 2, and 3, but on 4 and 5 we are not prepared to \nadvance on them as quickly. We think they may have potential, but we \ndon't know that. How can we help to facilitate that? Do we need more \npeople within MMS to help expedite the permits? What does it mean to be \nan idle lease?\n  I will digress for a moment, if I may, because I think it is \nimportant for people to recognize that when we are talking about \nexploration in the Arctic, a 5-year or 10-year time period is simply \nnot sufficient, because we cannot explore 365 days a year. Most times, \nthe season is limited to about 60 days during the coldest, darkest, \nmost difficult time of the year. But that is when the ground is frozen, \nwhen the permits are issued for exploration. So it takes multiple \nseasons to even get through the exploration phase.\n  I think it is important to recognize that not all leases are equal. \nNot every lease that a producer purchases from the government actually \nhas anything worth developing. We need to know and understand a little \nbit more. We hoped to have learned that from the Department of the \nInterior report. Unfortunately, it didn't give the detail we had hoped \nfor. I appreciate my colleague's question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as the Senator from Alaska is \nleaving the floor, I will say to her that I appreciate her point of \nview and what she has expressed. There is certainly an opportunity for \nworking something out.\n  As I stated in my question to her at the outset, this Senator doesn't \nknow a lot about the leases in Alaska, but I certainly do know a lot \nabout the\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\nleases in the Gulf of Mexico. For 30 million acres in the Gulf of \nMexico to go undrilled for years and years, where out of a total of 37 \nmillion acres are leased but only 7 million acres are actually drilled \nand produced, it seems to me there is a wonderful opportunity for a lot \nmore production, not just in 7 million acres but 30 million acres \nadditionally. And if the company that holds that lease, and has held \nthe lease for years, is not going to drill it and produce, then let \nsomebody else do it. That was the theory behind this Senator's \nsponsorship of that legislation.\n  As the Senator from Alaska has pointed out some differences in her \nState, it seems to me that this is, as the Good Book says, a place \nwhere people of good intentions can come and reason together.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak on another subject. I will tell my \ncolleague that I am not going to be speaking very long. This will be \nshort. I want to bring this to the attention of the Senate.\n  This is the Wall Street Journal from last weekend. Here is an article \nwith the headline ``Transocean Cites Safety in Bonuses.''\n  This is worth this Senator reading for the Record and calling to the \nattention of the Senate:\n\n       Transocean Ltd. had its ``best year in safety performance'' \n     despite the explosion of its Deepwater Horizon rig that left \n     11 dead and oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico, the world's \n     largest offshore-rig company said in a securities filing on \n     Friday.\n       Accordingly, Transocean's executives received two-thirds of \n     their target safety bonus. Safety accounts for 25 percent of \n     the equation that determines the yearly cash bonuses, along \n     with financial factors including new rig contracts.\n\n  It is hard for me to believe that. Even if it were to meet some \nmathematical formula of awarding bonuses to executives at oil \ncompanies, why in the world that company would not have been sensitive \nenough to the families of 11 people who lost their lives as a result of \nwhat the President's task force investigating the Deepwater Horizon oil \nexplosion and spill--the task force cochaired by our former colleague \nfrom Florida, Bob Graham--which said that the main responsibility for \nthat explosion was the fact that the blowout preventer did not work as \nit was designed to. Who was the owner and operator of that? Transocean. \nWe know there are lawsuits that are going on between BP, which had the \nlease, and Transocean, its subcontractor, which had the equipment that \nwas supposed to work to prevent the spill that malfunctioned. Those \nlawsuits are going to be going on for some period of time, sorting it \nout. But the investigation, done by a highly respected investigative \ntask force, came to that conclusion. And here that very same company, \nwhose blowout preventer deep on the floor of the ocean malfunctioned, \ncausing the explosion--11 lives were lost, and untold billions of \ndollars of damage was done to the economies of the Gulf States, and who \nknows how many billions of dollars of damage to the marine life and the \necology of the Gulf of Mexico, and safety is cited by this company as a \nreason for giving bonuses to its executives.\n  That defies common sense. It defies reason. I am sufficiently \nagitated about this--even with the company coming out and issuing some \nkind of retraction--that this Senator intends to ask the Secretary of \nthe Interior, Secretary Salazar, what authority he has to regulate not \nonly the leases of oil and gas tracts, such as BP, which held the \nlease, but also what authority he has to regulate the rig owners, such \nas Transocean and other subcontractors, which actually had the \nresponsibility for the safety of the drilling operation, and that \nsafety did not work.\n  I am going to ask our Committee on the Environment, chaired by \nSenator Boxer--I have already talked to her and her staff director--to \nhold hearings on the questionable response, the cleanup, the \nenvironmental and financial practices not only of Transocean but its \ncontractor, BP. What in the world is going on?\n  Why do I bring BP into this? Well, it is not only that they held the \nlease. It was interesting. Last week, the head of the Washington office \nof BP came in to give me an update. We had a very good, amiable chat, \nand I asked a simple series of questions. One of the questions I asked \nwas: With all of our people down there, many of them losing their \nbusinesses, losing their homes to foreclosure, because they don't have \nincome as a result of the tourism trade that was affected by the BP \nbill, what was all this about?\n  The first full payment was a $10 million payment paid in full from \nthe Gulf Coast Claims Facility to a BP partner. The head of BP in \nWashington said he did not know. It has been in the newspaper over and \nover. I have asked the question over and over. I have written to the \nDepartment of the Interior, as well as to BP, and I have written to the \nGulf Coast Claims Facility and have received no answer to the question, \nwhy was the first payment paid in full in damages done to a business \npartner of BP? The representative of BP could not answer the question.\n  I think the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ought to \nget into that issue. I am going to also ask the Finance Committee in \nthe Senate to hold hearings on the financial practices of BP and \nTransocean and other corporations such as those--a corporation such as \nTransocean that I think is domiciled in Switzerland and that holds a \nlot of its assets and earnings abroad, earnings that come as a result \nof doing business in the United States but of which those earnings are \nheld abroad and taxes are not paid for the privilege of doing that \nbusiness and earning profits in its business that is conducted in the \nUnited States.\n  We owe this to our taxpayers. This Senator certainly owes it to his \nconstituents who have suffered mightily as a result of this BP \noilspill, along with the malfunctions that went along in the procedures \nand in the equipment of that tremendous disaster that so many have \nsuffered so long.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2122-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2122-S2127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this Friday we run out of the current--\nwhich is now the sixth continuing resolution--short-term continuing \nresolution which we have been operating under since the end of the \nfiscal year, which was September 30 of last year. We started a new \nfiscal year October 1. Judging by some of the rhetoric we have been \nhearing around here, one would think somehow it is these big, bad, evil \nRepublicans who are trying to shut the government down by trying to get \na bill passed that actually would reduce spending for the remainder of \nthis fiscal year, which ends on September 30.\n  I remind my colleagues--and I know sometimes it gets a bit \nredundant--it is a fact that the reason we are here is because last \nyear the Democrats in the Congress failed to pass a budget and did not \npass a single appropriations bill. There was no budget passed last year \nfor this fiscal year and not a single appropriations bill passed before \nthe fiscal year ended September 30. Beyond that, we had a lameduck \nsession where we were here, we were here after November's election \nuntil the Christmas holiday, and never did we have a budget considered \non the floor, nor did we consider a single appropriations bill. The \nreason we are here is to finish the unfinished business of last year. \nThis is last year's mess we are now cleaning up.\n  We think the voters in the election spoke pretty clearly and sent an \nimperative to the Congress: We want you to reduce spending.\n  We have been trying, as we have attempted to fund the government \nthrough the end of this fiscal year--September 30--to achieve some \nlevel of spending reductions. It started in the House of \nRepresentatives. They passed a bill that reduced spending by $61 \nbillion over the previous year. It came over to the Senate. We had a \nvote on that bill to reduce and trim $61 billion, and it failed. The \nDemocrats put a bill on the floor which would trim $4.7 billion from \nlast year's spending level and which seemed to be completely divorced \nfrom reality as to how to seriously and meaningfully address the issue \nof spending and the debt and how to address the concern the American \npeople have voiced this year over the $1.5 trillion deficits we are \nseeing and now we are going to see even longer since the President \nsubmitted his 2012 budget.\n  The reason we are here is to do last year's unfinished business; that \nis, getting runaway spending in Washington\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nunder control, starting to live within our means--something every \nfamily in America has to do, something every small business in America \nhas to do.\n  Here we are again coming up against this Friday deadline because \nthere is resistance to reducing by $61 billion the amount Congress \nspent the previous year. The $61 billion, if one looks at the total \nbudget, represents a little under 10 percent. Even if one looks at it \nin terms of discretionary spending, that amount we are actually \nappropriating annually that is the smaller part of the budget in \nWashington, it is a small percentage. We are not talking about, \nrelatively speaking, a lot of money. I think it is reasonable. I think \nthe American people believe it is reasonable. Yet we are having this \nhuge meltdown around here because we do not have the political courage \nto do what the American people have asked us to do.\n  Frankly, if we were to reduce spending by the amount the Democrats \npropose and we had a vote in the Senate, it would be about the \nequivalent of 1 day of the debt. In other words, in this year, the \namount of debt we are going to rack up--the amount they were talking \nabout trimming from the budget was the equivalent of 1 single day of \nthe Federal debt--a little over $4 billion. It was not serious. Nobody \ncan take it seriously by any objective measurement.\n  To put it in perspective, in the last 2 years, spending has increased \nby about 24 percent. This is non-national security discretionary \nspending. It increased 24 percent at a time when inflation was only 2 \npercent in this country. Discretionary spending was growing at more \nthan 10 times the rate of inflation. It seems reasonable that we could \ngo back to those 2008 levels, indexed for inflation, which is what the \nproposal passed by the House that was defeated in the Senate would do.\n  We have had lots of testimony from the former Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Alan Greenspan, who said he expected we could face a debt \ncrisis in the next 2 to 3 years. He said there is a 50-percent \nprobability of that, in his opinion. We had the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, say that the biggest threat to \nAmerica's national security is our national debt, which I think is a \nstunning statement coming from the highest ranking military official in \nthis country. We have people saying there is the potential for a debt \ncrisis, a 50-percent probability. We have this national security issue \nthat is impacted by the level of spending and the level of debt. Then \nwe have what I think, too, is an even more compelling argument because \neverybody talks about the need to grow the economy and create jobs, and \nyet this amount of spending and debt, according to most of the research \nthat has been done, suggests we are costing ourselves as an economy \nabout 1 percentage point of economic growth every year, which \ntranslates into about 1 million lost jobs. That is a significant, as I \nsaid, body of research that has been done that studied economies over \nthe past half century or so and concluded there is a correlation \nbetween debt and economic growth when your debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 90 \npercent. We are there in the United States. We are well past 90 \npercent, and it is going to grow significantly more under the \nPresident's budget.\n  We cannot wait until tomorrow to do this. We have to attack this \nproblem at every opportunity. Getting a vote on a continuing resolution \nthat funds the government through the end of the year but does it at a \nreduced level of spending makes a lot of sense.\n  I do not know anybody who wants to see a government shutdown. We are \nhere because there is unfinished business from last year. We have to \nget this budget passed, and we ought to do it in a way that is \nmeaningful and serious and, I might add, reduces spending.\n  The President's budget, which he came out with a couple months ago \nand which starts the 2012 budget discussion, failed on every level to \naddress the major challenges facing the country. Not only does he not \ndeal with this issue of discretionary spending--and, frankly, he has \nbeen missing in action in that debate entirely--we have not heard from \nthe administration about this issue. More important, his budget does \nnothing to address the big part of the budget--Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid--which constitutes today 55 percent of the \nFederal budget and will grow dramatically over time as the 80,000 baby \nboomers begin to retire. What he proposed in his budget is increased \nspending, increases in taxes, and about a $12 trillion increase in the \nFederal debt over the next 10 years. Nothing serious is done in terms \nof addressing spending, debt, or taxes.\n\n  It is a colossal failure of leadership not to take on what is the \nmost compelling and profound issue that faces this country right now; \nthat is, this huge cloud of debt that hangs over our economy and over \nour children's future. The President said recently he did not want to \ntake a machete to this; he thought we needed to use a scalpel. What he \nis talking about doing I suggest does not even constitute using a \ntoothpick. There is not anything in here that does anything to reduce \nspending or get serious about trimming the size of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  What happened today? The House Republicans came out with a budget. Lo \nand behold, it is a budget that actually reduces spending by $6.2 \ntrillion over what the President's budget proposed or $5.8 trillion \nover what the Congressional Budget Office baseline suggests we spend \nover the next decade. It reduces debt by $4.4 trillion below the \nPresident's number, and it does it without raising taxes.\n  The first argument we heard from people coming to the floor of the \nSenate--and I heard some of my colleagues earlier talking about, oh, \nthis is going to be so awful; just think of the senior citizens. I say \nto my colleagues, according to the House budget proposal, senior \ncitizens are not impacted. Senior citizens are protected from any \nchanges in Social Security or Medicare, as are people age 55 and older. \nIf you are a senior citizen today or you are someone nearing retirement \nage, you are not impacted by this budget. What it does is it makes \nreforms in these programs so that future generations of Americans will \nhave those programs available to them when it comes time for them to \nretire. The fact is--we all know this--if we do not deal with these \nparts of the Federal budget, we are not serious about dealing with the \nfuture.\n  This is a serious issue, it requires a serious solution, and it \nrequires serious leadership. We have seen none of the above from the \nPresident or his administration or the Democratic leadership in \nCongress. So far, the only effort that has been made to address the \nissue of spending and debt and jobs and the economy is being done by \nthe Republicans in the Congress.\n  Considering the fact there is only one body of the Congress that is \ncontrolled by the Republicans--the House of Representatives; the \nDemocrats control the Senate and set the agenda, and we have a \nDemocratic administration, a Democratic White House--one would think \nthat to do something of this consequence and magnitude, it would take a \nbipartisan effort. One would assume this would be a bilateral \ndiscussion that would be occurring between the White House and the \nCongress and not just the Democrats in Congress but the Republicans. \nBut none of that seems to be occurring, and there does not seem to be \nany interest on the part of the President in stepping forward and \nputting a plan forward that actually does reduce spending, that \nactually does deal with this massive debt, and that actually gets \nserious about putting people back to work, growing the economy, and \ncreating jobs. His budget, as I said, increases spending by $400 \nbillion, increases taxes by $1.5 trillion, and adds somewhere on the \norder of over $12 trillion to the Federal debt. That is the President's \nbudget.\n  The Republican budget that was put forward today--and I am sure we \nare not going to agree with every aspect of it, but at lease it is a \nserious, meaningful effort--reduces spending by $6.2 trillion over the \nPresident's number and $5.8 trillion below what the Congressional \nBudget Office says it will spend over the next decade. It reduces debt \n$4.4 trillion more than what the President has put forward, and it \nactually gets government spending as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct under 20 percent, which is where our historical average has \nbeen for the last 40 years. That is what we have been looking at. It \ntakes on these issues.\n  Whether one likes the approach or not, please at least let's have a \ndiscussion about it. Let's have a debate and\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\nlet's have a proposal put forward so that we have something we can \nactually have a discussion about because so far all we have is a one-\nsided discussion. The Republicans have led the debate about how to deal \nwith the discretionary part of the budget we are dealing with in this \ncontinuing resolution, and the Republicans have the only proposal that \nhas been put forward that deals with the long-term issues of Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and tax reform, which, by the way, is an \nimportant issue to our competitiveness and our ability to grow the \neconomy and create jobs. All those issues are addressed in the budget \nput forward by the House.\n  What has been put forth by the administration is not serious. These \nare serious times that require serious leadership and serious solutions \nby the President of this country, and we are not getting that out of \nthe White House, nor are we getting it out of the Democratic leadership \nin the Senate. I hope that will change. I hope my colleagues here in \nthe Senate will recognize and the President will recognize we can't \nafford to wait any longer.\n\n  We have added over $3 trillion to the Federal debt in the first 2 \nyears of this President's administration, and that number, as I said, \nwill grow by about $12 trillion over the next decade. The interest \nalone that we will pay by the year 2015 will exceed what we spend on \nnational security. We will spend more on interest on the debt than we \nactually spend on the defense of this country. That is the trajectory \nwe are on. We cannot afford for the future of our children and \ngrandchildren to stay on that trajectory. We have to change the \ndirection we are headed in this country and it starts now.\n  So I give great credit to our House colleagues. I hope we will be \nable to get to a meaningful discussion here in the Senate about how to \nget spending and debt under control, how to grow the economy and create \njobs, and how to rein in the size of the Federal Government. It seems \nthat, here at least, a lot of my colleagues must be very comfortable \nwith spending over 25 percent of our GDP on the Federal Government \nbecause that is where we are today. As I said before, the 40-year \naverage is down in the 20- to 21-percent range, which is where the \nHouse Republican budget would take us. I think it is a good starting \npoint. It should trigger, I hope, a discussion in this country.\n  But I certainly hope as well that the other side, the Democrats here \nin the Congress and White House, would engage the debate, would enter \nthis discussion. Please, put forward an alternative, instead of coming \nout here and attacking, and particularly attacking in a way that is \nmisleading and misinforming. Senior citizens are not impacted by this \nproposal that was put forward today. If you are 55 years or older, you \nare not affected by this. You keep the programs you have today. What \nthis does, in a meaningful way, is to reform those programs so that \nthey are available to future generations of Americans. We have a moral \nobligation to them to take the steps necessary to provide a future that \ndoesn't saddle them with a mountain of debt.\n  By the way, that debt has grown from about $1,900 per person in 1970 \nto $44,000 per person today. Under the President's budget, 10 years \nfrom now, it will be $88,000 per person. That is what we are doing to \nthe future of our children and grandchildren unless we take steps to \nchange our direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Coats pertaining to the introduction of S. \n727 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COATS. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to join together to prevent an irresponsible \ngovernment shutdown.\n  The American people did not elect us to shut down the government.\n  Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate must \ntighten the Federal Government's belt, just like Americans are doing \nevery day at their kitchen tables.\n  As we all know, our escalating national debt is our country's most \npressing problem. Our country's current fiscal course is simply \nunsustainable.\n  In just the last 10 years, our Federal debt has risen from roughly a \nthird of our gross domestic product to nearly two-thirds of GDP in \n2010.\n  Based on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates, \nwithout proactive action by Congress, that percentage will continue to \nincrease over the next 10 years, with public debt expected to reach 90 \npercent of GDP in 2020.\n  Meanwhile, nearly half of our current debt is owned by China and \nother foreign creditors.\n  It is time for Congress to work together to chart a new bipartisan \ncourse that puts our fiscal house in order.\n  Before coming to the United States Senate I served for 10 years as a \nState senator in the North Carolina General Assembly.\n  I served as the cochair of the Budget Committee, and I can tell you \nthat crafting a budget is never easy. There are always difficult \nchoices, and both sides have to make sacrifices.\n  As a Budget cochair, I worked for 5 consecutive years to ensure that \nNorth Carolina's budget was balanced, that we still made critical \ninvestments in our communities while eliminating unnecessary spending.\n  It takes cooperation across party lines to meet fiscal challenges and \nto ensure government is both leaner and more effective.\n  We need bipartisan cooperation this week to prevent a Federal \nGovernment shutdown, which is an irresponsible outcome.\n  Keeping the government functioning for the American people is \nCongress's core responsibility.\n  We must come together to cut spending and support critical \npriorities, such as education, that strengthen our economy and support \neconomic development in North Carolina communities and in communities \nacross America.\n  And while I believe we all share the common goal of reducing our \nNation's deficit, we should remember that our most troubling economic \nchallenges cannot be solved in 1 year alone.\n  That is why I am concerned by some of the cuts passed by the House.\n  The House proposal would result in the loss of some 21,000 North \nCarolina jobs and decimate important education priorities, like \nHeadstart and investments in historically Black colleges and \nuniversities.\n  Nearly one in five African Americans who earn an undergraduate degree \nhas a diploma from a historically Black college or university. North \nCarolina has 10 4-year HBCUs, more than any other state in the country.\n  Funding through the Department of Education allows these institutions \nto strengthen programs and provide critical services for students who \nare often among the first in their families to attend college.\n  The House would cut funding for HBCUs by nearly a quarter below last \nyear's level, a cut that would have a disastrous impact on these \ninstitutions and their students, while not even scratching the surface \nof our current deficit.\n  In addition, by insisting on dozens of divisive policy riders, House \nRepublicans are disrupting our ability to chart a pragmatic and \nresponsible fiscal course for the country. We cannot take our eyes off \nthe ball.\n  The President's bipartisan fiscal commission, cochaired by North \nCarolina's own Erskine Bowles and former Senator Alan Simpson, made \nimportant progress in beginning to diagnose and attack the root causes \nof our Nation's fiscal crisis.\n  The bipartisan work of the fiscal commission is evidence that common \nground is possible.\n  Reducing spending will absolutely be a part of any comprehensive \nsolution, but we must begin to have a broader discussion to create \nmeaningful deficit reduction.\n  For that reason, I am supporting S. 211, the Biennial Budgeting and \nAppropriations Act, which was introduced by my colleagues Senator \nIsakson and Senator Shaheen.\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\n  This bill would take the Washington-as-usual politics out of the \nbudgeting process.\n  The bill changes the budget process from the current, annual spending \ndebate to a 2-year, deliberative process that allows us to work \ntogether on commonsense cuts coupled with sensible investments, similar \nto what North Carolina, which balances its budget every year, already \ndoes.\n  Right now, Congress rarely passes the 12 government funding bills by \nthe end of the fiscal year, and this year we have been operating on \nshort-term fix after short-term fix. A biennial budgeting process is \npart of the long-term solution we need to remove partisanship from the \nbudget. The status quo is unacceptable.\n  I hope we can continue to work across party lines, this week and \nmoving forward, on a bipartisan, comprehensive plan for the Nation's \nbudget that tackles, head on, our mounting debt.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I had the chance to sit in the chair this \nevening, before you came, and listened to people on both sides of the \naisle talk a little bit about our debt and our deficit situation, the \npending shutdown of the Federal Government. I shudder to think we might \nactually do that. But it may happen. I thought I might keep my senior \nSenator a little bit of company--the hour is late and the floor is \nempty--to have the chance to talk a little bit about how we see this \nfrom Colorado.\n  Like the Presiding Officer, I have had the chance to travel in one of \nthe most beautiful States in the country over the last 2 years, 40,000 \nmiles across the State of Colorado, having townhall meetings in red \nparts of the State and blue parts of the State and, believe it or not--\nand I know the Presiding Officer would believe it because he is talking \nto the same people I am talking to and, maybe more important than that, \nlistening to the same people I am listening to--I think a fairly \nsubstantial consensus emerged out of those meetings.\n  By the way, in not a single one of those townhall meetings--not one \nin 2 years--no matter what part of the State I was in, would any self-\nrespecting cable television producer want to put on cable TV at night. \nBecause we do not scream at each other in Colorado. We have our \ndifferences. We have our disagreements. We have a lot of shared values, \nthough, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, tea party members, \nIndependents. We are about a third Republican, a third Democratic, a \nthird Independent. That consensus that emerged from these meetings on \nour debt and our deficit is straightforward.\n  It is a three-part test for people in Colorado. The first is, they \nwant us to come up with a comprehensive solution that materially \naddresses the fiscal challenges this country faces. They do not want a \nbunch of gimmicks. They do not want a bunch of talking points. And they \ndo not want people in this Chamber or the Chamber on the other side of \nthe Capitol spending their time scoring political points at the expense \nof the American people.\n  So the question they are going to ask, first, when the Presiding \nOfficer and I go back there, I think, is, did you get to a \ncomprehensive solution--not, by the way, did you fix it overnight? \nBecause they know it cannot be fixed overnight. But can we be secure in \nthe idea that we are not going to leave our kids and our grandkids what \nis today $15 trillion in debt and a $1.5 trillion budget deficit. \nBecause all things being equal, we wish to allow our kids and our \ngrandkids to not have their choices constrained by our inability to get \nanything done here in Washington. So that is the first test for people \nin Colorado.\n  The second test is, they want to know that any solution we come up \nwith is one where we are all in it together, that everybody in America \nhas the chance to make a contribution to solving this fiscal nightmare \nwe face. They are not interested in pitting one group of people against \nanother group of people. In fact, that makes them feel suspicious about \nwhat we are doing. They want to know we are all in it together, which \nbrings me to the third commonsense Colorado point of view on this \nissue, which is they would like this--in fact, they will insist--the \nsolution be a bipartisan solution. Because they do not have confidence \nin one party's ideas on this question. That is a lucky thing because we \nhave a Republican-controlled House and we have a Democratic-controlled \nSenate, and the President is a Democrat. We cannot solve this problem \nin these times without it being a bipartisan solution. That is it.\n  If I can go home and say, we materially addressed the problem, we are \nall in it together, and it was a bipartisan solution, I think people \nwould say: You guys have finally done something. We feel patriotic, as \nif we have done something useful for our kids.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, there are people all over our State--\nlocal government officials--who are Republicans and Democrats who are \nmaking tough decisions about their budgets. I have an incredible amount \nof sympathy for what they are dealing with.\n  I had the great fortune, earlier in my career, to serve as the Chief \nof Staff for our now Governor, John Hickenlooper, when he was mayor of \nDenver. When John went into that office, and I went in as his Chief of \nStaff, we faced a huge budget deficit by Denver standards and we had to \ncut 11 percent of our expenditures. We met with people living all \nthroughout the city and county of Denver. We sought their advice. We \nestablished a set of priorities. We passed it through a city council. \nAnd do you know what. Denver lived to fight another day. Our economy \ngrew, and things were pretty good there for a while, until this current \nrecession.\n  When I became superintendent of the Denver Public Schools--as the \nPresiding Officer knows, a district that year after year after year, \nfor almost a decade, maybe even longer than that, was the poster child \nfor cutting every single year; every year, people at other school \ndistricts would say: Thank God we are not the Denver Public Schools--\nevery year, the Denver Public Schools would lose teachers to other \ndistricts that could afford to pay them more, and every year we cut and \nwe cut and we cut as a district. When I became superintendent, one of \nthe cases I made to the school board was: We have profound structural \nproblems in our budget, and instead of approaching the budget in a way \nthat diminishes the academic environment for kids, what we ought to be \nfiguring out how to do is establish a set of priorities and build a \npublic case to deal with the structural problems that exist in our \nbudget.\n  Because of the good work of the school board--I should say, the \ncourageous work of the school board--we were able to get that done. We \nwere able to close schools for the first time in a long time. That is \nhard work. Those meetings were harder than health care townhall \nmeetings, I can tell you that. We were able to deal with the pension \nliability that our district had. And we were able, year after year, to \ninvest more money, not less, in our schools and in our classrooms. And \nnow, under the current leadership there--which I think is doing an \nexceptional job--the district no longer is the poster child for \nanything except fighting hard on behalf of the children in the Denver \nPublic Schools.\n  Here is the thing that drives me crazy about what is going on in the \nconversation we are having now about this shutdown. There is no way any \nsuperintendent of schools in Colorado or any school board in Colorado \nor any city council or any mayor--from the biggest city to the smallest \ntown--would show up to work and say: We might close the government 2 \nweeks from now. It is an option for us that we will not pick up your \ntrash 2 weeks from now or plow the streets--we still get snow in \nColorado at this time of year--or plow the streets 2 weeks from now. We \nare going to close down.\n  It would not occur to anybody working in a local government in our \nState to say they were going to do that. Do you know why? Because \npeople would become unglued, unhinged. They would say: We hired you to \ndo a job. Work it out. We are doing our jobs--or we are\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\nlooking for jobs--we don't have time to solve these problems. You were \nhired to do this job. Work it out. Come to an agreement. Don't come \nhome and tell us you are shutting the government down, you are not \ngoing to pick up the trash, you are not going to plow the snow, you are \nnot going to educate our kids.\n  The idea that as a superintendent--I got in trouble when I closed \nschool for snow once--once. It turned out to be a great decision \nbecause it was one of the worst blizzards we ever had, but it could \nhave gone the other way, because people rely on us to do the work we \nare supposed to do. They have plans. The idea that at a time when we \nare fighting wars all across this globe, at a time when there are \ngovernments and countries that are trying to seek an economic advantage \nover the United States of America in a global economy that has shrunk \nthe way ours has shrunk, that we would say to ourselves: We are going \nto pause, we can't even keep the government open in this democracy, I \nthink would reflect terribly not on the American people and not on our \ndemocracy, but on this institution of government.\n  There is a reason why we are in the basement as an institution in \nterms of polling. Why should people have confidence in an institution \nthat cannot actually even keep running in the short term? I think it is \nimportant, based on the conversation I heard tonight here on both sides \nof the aisle, for the American people to understand this debate about \nthis government shutdown is not a debate about our deficit and our \ndebt, not really. It has been about scoring political points.\n  What I want to say is I hope and I would encourage the leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle here, the leadership in the House, and our \nPresident to find a way to work it out and to make sure we keep this \ngovernment open. I think closing it sends entirely the wrong message. I \nknow there are people on both sides of the aisle here who believe that. \nI hope people do absolutely everything they can do between now and the \nend of this week to make sure we send a message that we are not as \ndysfunctional as we appear to be. Because I think this place ought to \nmeet the standard that people at the local level of government are held \nto in our State.\n  No business would say: I don't know, maybe we will close for 2 weeks \nor close for a month. They are figuring out how to invest and grow even \nin this challenging economy. We should be doing the same.\n  Mr. President, you and I were in a meeting this morning. We started \ntoday at 8 o'clock in the morning, with 33 Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who came together to hear some very thoughtful observations \nabout how important it is we come to a comprehensive solution to deal \nwith our deficit and to deal with our debt. We heard an important \npresentation about how there is no silver bullet here. There is no easy \nway to solve any of this. But perhaps the least painful way to think \nabout it is with the most comprehensive plan--which, by the way, is the \nintuition of people in Colorado, as I said earlier today. It gave me \ngreat confidence that there were a bunch of Republicans and a bunch of \nDemocrats in a room listening to this message and willing to work \ntogether in a bipartisan way.\n\n  I was very fortunate to draft a letter that Mike Johanns from \nNebraska, a Republican, cosigned with me that called on the President \nto engage--after this period we are having a discussion about right now \nwith closing the government or keeping it open or whatever it is we are \ngoing to do--asking the President to engage in a conversation that is \ncomprehensive that says: You know what. We know this is going to \ninvolve cuts to discretionary spending, both domestic and military. We \nknow this is going to involve reform of our entitlements. We know it is \ngoing to involve reform of our Tax Code as well.\n  Senator Coats from Indiana was out here today with a lot of \ncommonsense ideas around how our Tax Code doesn't drive innovation, \ncompetition and growth and he is right about that. There is a lot of \nwork to be done, and I have every confidence it can happen. That letter \nwe wrote turned out to have 64 signatures on it. Sixty-four people \nsigned that letter. That is more than the 60 required to pass a piece \nof legislation. That is a majority of the Democrats in the Senate. It \nis a majority of the Republicans in the Senate. I know it is just a \nletter, but it reflects what I believe to be true about what people in \nthis body believe, which is that we can solve this issue. We can solve \nthis problem, but we are only going to be able to do it if we do it \ntogether. We are only going to be able to do it if we get to a place \nwhere we are no longer as concerned about winning political points as \nwe are about actually addressing the problem. I have confidence we can \ndo it.\n  Someone said to me today: You seem to be a guy who feels as though \nthe Senate is dysfunctional. You have a reputation for believing the \nSenate is dysfunctional. I will confess there are days when I wonder, \nand there are days when I feel as though it is dysfunctional. But on \nthis set of issues, I think the Senate can shine. On this set of \nissues, I think this is the place where leadership can take hold and \nwhere we can create a bipartisan solution. The people of Colorado, and \nI think the American people, expect us to do everything we can to get \nthis done.\n  There are two conversations going on simultaneously, and I thought it \nwas important to point out that one is about the very short-term \nissue--what we are going to do with this continuing budget. By the way, \nno one in Colorado would stand for the idea that you don't pass a \nbudget in the year you are in, but that is another Washington cultural \nartifact we ought to get rid of. But that is distinct from the \ncomprehensive discussion we need to have around here on our deficit and \nour debt. At the end of the 2-year discussion I was having, and the \nbeginning of a new discussion now with Colorado, it became pretty \nstraightforward what people want, not just on the debt and deficit but \nother things they are concerned about, that we ought to be turning our \nattention to, instead of having this back and forth about whether we \nare going to keep the government open. It ought to be assumed we are \ngoing to keep the government open.\n  We just came off the first decade in the country's history when \nmedian family income fell. It was lower at the end of the decade than \nit was at the beginning of the decade. It has never been true before in \nthe United States. For families in Colorado, that means they are \nactually earning less at the end of the decade than they were at the \nbeginning. But their cost of higher education has gone up by more than \n40 percent. Their cost of health care has gone up by more than 100 \npercent over that period of time. We have created no net new jobs in \nthe United States or in Colorado since 1998. People would like to see \nthat turned around.\n  People would like to see us working together on a Tax Code that \ndrives innovation to make sure we don't have regulations that \nunnecessarily stifle economic growth. They would like to see that.\n  They would like us to break our reliance on foreign oil from the \nPersian Gulf. Even before what has happened in the Middle East and in \nLibya occurred in the last month or so--even before that--people were \nsaying to me: Michael, we don't think it makes much sense for us to be \nbuying oil from the Persian Gulf. We don't understand why we have an \nenergy policy that requires us to ship billions of dollars a week to \nthe Persian Gulf to buy oil when we could be investing that money \ndeveloping our energy resources here in the United States. That is work \nwe could be doing together in a bipartisan way.\n  As the President knows, I have a passion for public education, as do \nthe people who are living in Colorado, and they know we are not getting \nthe job done there either. We have before us the reauthorization of No \nChild Left Behind, but somehow we can't move that forward. Teachers and \nkids and principals and moms and dads all over our State are expecting \nus to get that work done. We have to find a way to educate our kids for \nthe 21st century economy that hopefully we will build for them, and we \nare not getting the job done.\n  As I said on the floor the other day, if we look at this question \nfrom the perspective of poor children living in our home State of \nColorado or all across the United States of America, and if we think \nabout this room we are in right now and the fact that there are\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n100 desks that don't belong to 100 Senators because they belong to the \nAmerican people but where 100 Senators sit and work, if these desks \nreflected the odds of poor children living in our country succeeding \neducationally, things would look pretty grim in here. Forty-two out of \nthe one hundred chairs in this place would be occupied by a child \nliving in poverty--42. By the time our children in poverty got to the \neighth grade, only 16 kids would be reading at grade level. That is \nfour and four, four--that is about 16 desks. The rest of this Senate \nChamber would be full of children who couldn't read at grade level in \nthe eighth grade today in the 21st century in the United States of \nAmerica. By the time our poor children would be graduating from \ncollege, only nine would be graduating from college--these two rows and \nthat chair right there. The rest of this Chamber would have no college \ndegree. In a global economy requiring that as a pathway to the middle \nclass, to meaningful participation in the democracy, to meaningful \nparticipation in this global economy, 91 people in this place would be \nshut out because they were born into a ZIP Code that is poor. Those \nodds look pretty wrong to the kids who are living in those \nneighborhoods.\n  I have spent a lot of time with our kids in those neighborhoods, not \njust in Colorado but all across the United States of America. They \nthink we have already made a promise to them, that they live in a land \nof opportunity that is going to reward their hard work, and if they \nstick with it, they are going to end up with a college degree. That is \nwhat they believe. We may have made that promise, but we certainly \nhaven't followed through on that commitment.\n  Why should that matter to us? Some people look at that and say: Well, \nit is someone else's problem. I don't need to worry about it. McKinsey \nhas done a study that shows us that the effect of those outcomes is to \ncreate a permanent recession in the United States. The effect of that \ndropout rate creates a permanent recession in the United States. That \nactually is about the same as the recession we just went through, which \nmeans if we are concerned with economic growth in the United States, we \nneed to concern ourselves with the educational outcomes our kids in \npoverty are facing. If we are concerned with income inequality in the \nUnited States, we need to be concerned with the outcomes I just \ndescribed.\n  Last year, the top 1 percent of income earners in this country earned \n23 percent of the income--almost one-quarter of the income. The last \ntime that was true was 1928. That doesn't lead me to conclude that \nsomehow we should redistribute it, but it does lead me to conclude that \nwe ought to fix our education system so more people have the chance to \nput themselves and their families into the middle class.\n  We can't afford in this country to repeat the decade we just went \nthrough. We can't afford to have an economy where median income is \nfalling. We can't afford to have an economy that is not creating jobs. \nWe can't afford to carry a debt and deficit burden that at some point \nthe capital markets are going to look at and say: We are not financing \nyou anymore. We can't afford to fail to educate children in this \ncountry just because they are poor. I also think we can't afford to \nhave an energy policy that commits us to a dependence on oil in the \nPersian Gulf. I think the people of Colorado and across this country \nare expecting us to do our jobs, just as they are doing their jobs.\n  I say again, I hope the leadership of both parties, working in good \nfaith, can keep this government open, and I hope we can move on to a \nbroader and more comprehensive conversation around debt, around \ndeficit, around our economy, and around the education of our kids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2127-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2127-S2128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly address the \nintelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2011, which has now \nbeen reported by the Intelligence Committee. I filed additional views \nto the committee report accompanying the bill, and my remarks today \nwill include a brief summary of those views.\n  I have now been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee for \nover a decade--Senator Feinstein, Senator Rockefeller and I all began \nserving on the committee at the beginning of 2001, which I believe \nmakes us the committee's longest-serving current members. In my time on \nthe committee, I have become quite familiar with the intelligence \nauthorization process.\n  It has now been almost 7 years since an intelligence authorization \nbill was signed into law during the fiscal year it was intended to \ncover, and although the 2011 fiscal year is now over halfway over, \nCongress still has an opportunity to provide useful guidance and \ndirection regarding intelligence spending for this fiscal year. The \nfiscal year 2011 intelligence authorization bill is the product of \nsubstantial labor by both Chairman Feinstein and Vice Chairman \nChambliss, as well as their respective staff, and I commend them both \nfor their efforts and for the bipartisan manner in which they have \nworked to put it together.\n  Unfortunately, I have very serious concerns about one provision of \nthis bill, and that is why I voted against it during the committee \nmarkup last month.\n  Section 403 of this bill would authorize the Director of National \nIntelligence, DNI, to establish an administrative process under which \nthe DNI and the heads of the various intelligence agencies would have \nthe authority to take away the pension benefits of an intelligence \nagency employee, or a former employee, if they ``determine'' that the \nemployee has knowingly violated his or her nondisclosure agreement and \ndisclosed classified information.\n  I share my colleagues' frustration regarding unauthorized \ndisclosures, or ``leaks,'' of classified information. Leaks are a \nproblem that has plagued intelligence agencies throughout modern \nhistory--they can undermine intelligence operations, jeopardize \nintelligence sources and methods, and have a terrible impact on the \nlives of covert agents who are publicly exposed. Every Member of \nCongress, myself included, wants to find new ways to identify and \nappropriately punish individuals who illegally disclose classified \ninformation. I personally spent 4 years working on legislation to \nincrease the criminal penalty for people who are convicted of \ndeliberately exposing covert agents. And I am proud to say that with \nhelp from a number of my Republican and Democratic colleagues, this \nlegislation was finally signed into law last year. So I don't take a \nbackseat to anybody when it comes to getting tough on leaks.\n  I agree that increasing penalties for particular offenses can \nsometimes have a deterrent effect on those who might otherwise be \ntempted to leak, so I support the creation of new consequences for \nindividuals who have been convicted of illegally divulging classified \ninformation. But when it comes to leakers, the biggest challenge is not \ndetermining how to punish them as much as it is identifying who they \nare.\n  Given these challenges, my concern is that giving intelligence agency \nheads the authority to take away the pensions of individuals who \nhaven't been formally convicted of any wrongdoing could pose serious \nproblems for the due process rights of intelligence professionals, and \nparticularly the rights of whistleblowers who report waste, fraud and \nabuse to Congress or inspectors general.\n  Section 403--as approved by the Select Committee on Intelligence--\ngives intelligence agency heads the power to take pension benefits away \nfrom any employee that an agency head ``determines'' has knowingly \nviolated their nondisclosure agreement. But as I pointed out to my \ncolleagues during the committee markup of this bill, neither the DNI \nnor any of the intelligence agency heads have asked Congress for this \nauthority. Moreover, as of today none of the intelligence agencies have \nofficially told Congress how they would interpret this language.\n  It is entirely unclear to me what standard agency heads would use to \n``determine'' that a particular employee was guilty of disclosing \ninformation. It seems clear that section 403 gives agency heads the \npower to make this determination themselves, without going to a court \nof law, but the language of the provision provides virtually no \nguidance about what standard should be used, or even whether this \nstandard could vary from one agency to the next. And no agency\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\nheads have yet told Congress what standard they believe they would be \ninclined or required to use. This means that if an agency head \n``determines'' that a particular individual is responsible for a \nparticular anonymous publication, he or she could conceivably take \naction to revoke that individual's pension benefits even if the agency \ndoes not have enough proof to convict the employee in court.\n  Section 403 states that agency heads must act ``in a manner \nconsistent with the due process and appeal rights otherwise available \nto an individual who is subject to the same or similar disciplinary \naction under other law.'' But federal agencies do not normally take \naway the pension benefits of former employees unless they are convicted \nof a crime or begin openly working for a foreign government. I do not \nbelieve that this ``otherwise available'' language is intended to \nrequire the government to get a criminal conviction, but beyond that I \nam not at all sure what impact this language is supposed to have and I \nam not sure that the various intelligence agency heads will know what \nit means either. This only increases my concern that this provision \ncould be used to undermine or violate the due process rights of \nintelligence agency employees, with a corresponding impact on their \nfamily members and dependents.\n  I am also especially troubled that section 403 is silent regarding \ndisclosures to Congress and inspectors general. Everyone hopes that \nintelligence agency managers and supervisors will act honorably and \nprotect whistleblowers who come forward and go through proper channels \nto report waste, fraud and abuse in national security agencies, but \nthis is unfortunately not always the reality. There are existing laws \nin place that are intended to protect whistleblowers who provide \ninformation to Congress and inspectors general--and I believe that \nthese laws should be strengthened--but section 403 does not specify \nwhether it would supersede these existing statutes or not. I know that \nnone of my colleagues would deliberately do anything to undermine \nprotections for legitimate whistleblowers, but I think it was a mistake \nfor the Intelligence Committee to report this bill without hearing the \nintelligence agencies' views on whether or not they believe that \nsection 403 would impact existing whistleblower protections.\n  It is unfortunately entirely plausible to me that a given \nintelligence agency could conclude that a written submission to the \ncongressional intelligence committees or an agency inspector general is \nan ``unauthorized publication,'' and that the whistleblower who \nsubmitted it is thereby subject to punishment under section 403, \nespecially since there is no explicit language in the bill that \ncontradicts this conclusion. Withholding pension benefits from a \nlegitimate whistleblower would be highly inappropriate, but overzealous \nand even unscrupulous individuals have served in senior government \npositions in the past, and will undoubtedly do so again in the future. \nThis is why it is essential to have strong protections for \nwhistleblowers enshrined in law, and this is particularly true for \nintelligence whistleblowers, since, given the covert nature of \nintelligence operations and activities, there are limited opportunities \nfor public oversight. But reporting fraud and abuse by one's own \ncolleagues takes courage, and no whistleblowers will come forward if \nthey do not believe that they will be protected from retaliation.\n  Finally, I am somewhat perplexed by the fact that section 403 creates \na special avenue of punishment that only applies to accused leakers who \nhave worked directly for an intelligence agency at some point in their \ncareers. There are literally thousands of employees at the Departments \nof Defense, State and Justice, as well as the White House, who have \naccess to sensitive information. Some of the most serious leaks of the \npast few decades have undoubtedly been made by individuals working for \nthese organizations. I do not see an obvious justification for singling \nout intelligence community employees, particularly in the absence of \nevidence that these employees are responsible for a disproportionate \nnumber of leaks. And I am concerned that it will be harder to attract \nqualified individuals to work for intelligence agencies if Congress \ncreates the perception that intelligence officers have fewer due \nprocess rights than other government employees.\n  Withholding pension benefits from individuals who are convicted of \ndisclosing classified information will often be an appropriate \npunishment. This punishment is already established in existing laws, \nand I would be inclined to support efforts to clarify or strengthen \nthese laws. But I am not inclined to give agency heads broad authority \nto take away the pensions of individuals who have not been convicted of \nwrongdoing, particularly when the agency heads themselves have not even \ntold Congress how they would interpret and implement this authority. \nThis is why I voted against this authorization bill. All of my \ncolleagues and I agree that illegal leaks are a serious problem, but \nthis does not mean that anything at all that is done in the name of \nstopping leaks is necessarily wise policy.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to amend this bill, and \nI am hopeful that they will be willing to modify or remove section 403 \nto address the concerns I have raised. In the meantime, I should be \nclear that it is my intention to object to any request to pass the \ncurrent version of the bill by unanimous consent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2128-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOLLECTIONS OF PRESIDENT RICHARD W. LARIVIERE, UNIVERSITY OF OREGON\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, recently, the president of the University \nof Oregon, Richard Lariviere, came to meet with me in my office. The \nUniversity of Oregon is my law school alma mater, and I was \ncommiserating with President Lariviere about the Ducks' narrow loss in \nthe BCS national championship football game. President Lariviere told \nme about a wonderful speech that Coach Chip Kelly gave to his players \nafter the game. I asked President Lariviere to share the story with me \nin writing; and with his permission and that of Coach Kelly, I would \nlike now to share that story with my colleagues:\n\n       Recollections of President Lariviere:\n       On January 10, 2011 when the final whistle ended the BCS \n     national championship football championship game, the \n     University of Oregon was behind by three points--three points \n     scored by our friends from Auburn in the final two seconds of \n     the game.\n       The UO players made their way to the locker room, \n     disappointed needless-to-say. Coach Chip Kelly talked to his \n     players, and his remarks were just what any university \n     president would want to hear from a head coach, made more \n     remarkable and emotional because of the magnitude and \n     unprecedented nature of the moment.\n       With the team gathered around him, Coach Kelly told these \n     student athletes that they had played a great game, that he \n     was proud of them, and that he could not have asked for more. \n     Then he said this:\n       ``In ten minutes the media will come in here and they're \n     going to ask you how you feel. They're going to tell you that \n     this is a defining moment in your lives. I want you to know \n     that this is not a defining moment in your lives. You are \n     young men who play football, but football does not define \n     you. A defining moment will be when you graduate, when you \n     marry, when you have children. Those are the moments that \n     define your lives.''\n       Then Coach Kelly turned to each of the seniors and reminded \n     them of the promise they made to him that they would \n     graduate.\n       In that locker room with a team that accomplished what no \n     other Oregon football team had ever done, Coach Chip Kelly \n     represented the very best values that have come to be \n     associated with the University of Oregon: bold and audacious, \n     hard working and high achieving, and a focus on what really \n     matters.\n       March 2011\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2128-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2128-S2129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. REED.

A bill to amend section 301 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act to clarify those classes of individuals born in the \nUnited States who are nationals and citizens of the United\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\nStates at birth; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, America's illegal immigration problem is \nclearly way out of control. We can all agree that we desperately need \nto better protect our borders, ensure that only citizens and legal \nresidents can be hired for jobs in this country, and reverse misguided \npolicies that serve as a magnet for further illegal immigration.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill that falls into that third category, \nto get rid of these magnets that encourage further illegal activity. \nThe bill would amend the Immigration and Nationalization Act in order \nto change our current practice of granting automatic citizenship to the \nchildren of illegal aliens born on American soil. When it comes to U.S. \ncitizenship, it is not just where an individual is born that matters, \nat least it should not be. The circumstances of the person's birth and \nthe nationality of his or her parents are of at least equal importance. \nI simply do not believe our Constitution confers citizenship on \nchildren who happen to be born on U.S. soil when both of their parents \nare foreign tourists or illegal aliens. The Constitution does not \nmandate or require that. Yet that is our policy.\n  Each year, 300,000 to 400,000 children are born in the United States \nto at least one parent who is an illegal alien or a foreign tourist. A \nsignificant subset of that number includes children born to two parents \nwho are not U.S. citizens--the category my bill attacks. Despite the \nillegal status and foreign citizenship of the parent, the executive \nbranch of our government now automatically recognizes these children as \nU.S. citizens upon birth. This practice is not mandated by Federal law \nor the Constitution. It is based on what I believe is a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the 14th amendment of the Constitution. As such, \nthis policy is incompatible with both the text and legislative history \nof the citizenship clause. I don't think the 14th amendment grants this \nbirthright citizenship to children of illegal aliens. In fact, all we \nhave to do is look at history and the actual text of the Constitution \nas our guide.\n  The 14th amendment does not say all persons born in the United States \nare citizens, period, end of story. It states that citizenship extends \nto ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject \nto the jurisdiction thereof.''\n  This latter phrase is important. It is conveniently ignored or \nmisconstrued by advocates of birthright citizenship. But, of course, a \nfundamental rule in terms of constitutional interpretation is that \nwords are assumed to be there for a purpose. If those words had no \nmeaning, had no impact, then the Founders would not have written them \ninto that part of the Constitution.\n  Its original meaning refers to the political allegiance of an \nindividual and the jurisdiction a foreign government has over that \nperson. That is why American Indians and their children did not become \ncitizens until Congress actually passed the Indian Citizenship Act of \n1924.\n  I am introducing today's legislation because it is apparent that \nCongress must reassert its plenary authority over naturalization and \nmake clear that ``subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' does not \ninclude children born in this country to illegal aliens or foreign \ntourists. Those parents are clearly subject to the jurisdiction of \nforeign governments.\n  My bill limits birthright citizenship to individuals born in the \nUnited States to at least one parent who is a legal citizen, a green \ncard holder, or an active member of the U.S. Armed Forces. Congress \nclearly has the power to determine that children born in the United \nStates to illegal aliens are not subject to American jurisdiction.\n  As Judge Richard Posner, of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, \nheld in a 2003 case: ``Congress would not be flouting the Constitution \nif it amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to put an end to this \nnonsense.'' That is exactly what my bill would do, put an end to this \nnonsense.\n  Closing this loophole will not prevent anyone from becoming a \nnaturalized citizen. Instead, it will ensure that he or she has to go \nthrough the same process as anyone else born of foreign national \nparents who wants to become a U.S. citizen.\n  Our practice of birthright citizenship is clearly an incentive to \nillegal immigration. It does a disservice to every would-be citizen who \nis actually following the rules, applying to be naturalized, standing \nin line, often for a very long time.\n  This misguided policy of birthright citizenship not only undermines \nthe stability of our immigration system, but it has severe fiscal \nconsequences as well as serious national security implications. Recent \nnews reports have highlighted the growing popularity of what is known \nas birth tourism.\n  Web sites actually advertise birth packages for foreign visitors so \npregnant women can give birth in the United States and ensure automatic \ncitizenship, under current practice, for their newborn children. Of \ncourse, with that automatic citizenship comes the full benefits \nthereof, including unlimited travel to the United States, educational \nbenefits, and the ability to settle here as an adult and eventually, \ndown the line, the ability to grab back the parents and get them into \nU.S. citizenship.\n  One such agency that appeals to foreign mothers to be by describing \nthe benefits of American-born children, pointing out that a one-time \ninvestment in a birth package will result in a lifetime of benefits for \ntheir family was in the news recently. Specifically, it says: Your \nchildren will be able to attend U.S. public elementary schools and they \nmay apply for scholarships designated for U.S. citizens and they are \nentitled to welfare benefits--all of this explicitly spelled out in the \nadvertising for this agency.\n  Just last month, authorities in California shut down a makeshift \nmaternity clinic after discovering 10 newborns and one dozen Chinese \nwomen who paid as much as $35,000 to travel to this country to give \nbirth to children who would automatically be recognized as U.S. \ncitizens.\n  Birth tourism, as amazing as this is, is not a new phenomenon, as \nwomen from other countries have long traveled to the United States \nlegally, on tourist or student visas, and given birth while here. \nHowever, recent reports indicate that the practice is escalating. A new \nreport by the Center for Immigration Studies finds that every year \n200,000 children are born to women who were lawfully admitted to the \nUnited States on a temporary basis.\n  Each of these children receive U.S. citizenship, despite their \nmother's allegiance to a different country and even if the father is \nnot a U.S. citizen. Birth tourism is certainly a reprehensible \npractice, but it is not an illegal one. It is astounding that the U.S. \nGovernment allows individuals to exploit the loopholes of our \nimmigration system in this manner. It is obvious that Congress has the \nauthority and the obligation to put an end to it.\n  In addition to this birth tourism--and by that I refer to focusing on \ntourists here legally under a tourist visa. Of course, there are tens \nor hundreds of thousands of children born in this country to two \nillegal immigrant parents, and those children, under the same practice, \nautomatically become U.S. citizens.\n  This, too, is a very dangerous practice, a magnet to attract more and \nmore illegal activity across the border, when we say we want to do \neverything to stop that. Certainly, if we truly want to do everything \nwe can to stop that, we need to unplug those magnets, stop that policy \nfrom attracting more and more illegal crossings across the border.\n  So I introduce this important legislation today, and I thank Senators \nPaul and Lee and Moran for joining me in addressing this critical \nissue. I invite all the Members of the Senate to join me in doing this.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Coats, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 727.

He laid out what I think most Americans are now realizing, and \nthat is we have to get a grip on our current fiscal situation in this \ncountry if we are going to provide any kind of opportunity for the \nfuture--for prosperity, for opportunity for our young people to get \ngood jobs, buy homes, raise a family, and send their kids to college. \nAnd even in a more current sense, we need to get our economy moving \nagain to the point where we can get people back to work and become a \nprosperous leading nation in the world. We are gradually, and \naccelerating all the time, losing that position because of our fiscal \nsituation.\n  This morning, a number of us met--both Republicans and Democrats--in \none of a series of meetings we have been having with outside experts. \nDr. Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff spoke to us this morning, both \ndistinguished and respected economists, and others who have studied the \nsituation, and they laid out the current status of our fiscal situation \nand the economic plight it is putting our country into. One of the \nthings they said--and I think the reason I am on the floor this \nevening--is that unless we address all the aspects in dealing with our \nfiscal crisis, both in terms of excessive spending that is taking \nplace, and has taken place over the last several years, as well as \ncomponents for growth, we are not going to successfully address this.\n  We not only have to look at the spending which has accelerated \ndramatically in the last few years, and the amount of deficit we are \naccumulating every year, and the amount of debt we are rolling up, but \nwe also have to look at ways of addressing that by cutting spending and \nalso spurring the economy to growth. The component for growth pretty \nmuch falls along the lines of tax reform.\n  Senator Wyden had worked for 2 years with former Senator Gregg. They \nspent a great deal of time putting together a very comprehensive plan. \nSenator Gregg, as everyone here knows, retired after many years of \ndistinguished service. He was recognized as one of the, if not the, \nleading proponent of budget stability, of economic growth, and of all \nthe aspects that go into dealing with economic situations. He is \ngreatly missed. I had the privilege of being his friend, serving with \nhim, and then having him encourage me to take his place in moving this \nlegislation forward.\n  I have spent the last 3 months working with Senator Wyden, who is \ncoauthor of that legislation, along with Senator Gregg. We have made \nsome refinements to this and we are introducing it today. We will be \ndoing a formal introduction of it together in the coming days, but the \nagreement and the growing consensus we hear from everyone is that \ncomprehensive tax reform has to be a component of addressing our fiscal \nplight and getting us back into a period of sustained growth.\n  S. 727 is the bill that will be available for people to look at--the \nBipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2011. It simplifies \nour current tax system, it holds down rates for individuals and \nfamilies, it provides tax relief to the middle class, and creates \nincentives for businesses to grow and invest in the United States.\n  As we know, with any structure that is built, the first thing you do \nis build a solid foundation. What we are trying to do in our tax reform \npackage is to build that foundation based on several basic principles. \nWe believe that to bring forward legislation on a bipartisan basis we \nhave to have a tax package that is revenue neutral, that is not \nstereotyped or characterized as a backdoor means of raising taxes or of \ncutting spending. Revenue neutrality means we can go forward knowing it \nis not used for that purpose but for the purpose of putting in place a \ntax system that will stimulate growth, provide for better \ncompetitiveness for our industries and businesses, and make us a more \nprosperous nation.\n  Simplification is a key foundational principle, as well as protection \nfor the middle class and families--fairness across the board. And as I \nsaid earlier, economic growth. I want to address each of those.\n  First of all, achieving a revenue-neutral bill. This has been \nanalyzed by the Joint Tax Committee, and basically we have information \nback that it is revenue neutral. This analysis is based on a static \nbasis. As we all know, if you put in place policies that will encourage \ngrowth and stimulate growth, it becomes a dynamic scoring. But CBO \ndoesn't do dynamic scoring, nor does the JTC--the Joint Tax Committee. \nBut nevertheless, even at the static analysis of this bill, it achieves \nrevenue neutrality. It is our goal to maintain that throughout, as \nadjustments might be made.\n  Simplifying the Tax Code has to be one of the very first things we \ndo. Today, the U.S. Tax Code is 71,684 pages in length, and it includes \na tangled web of over 10,000 exemptions, deductions, credits, and other \npreferences. I took three tax courses in law school, and I don't begin \nto understand the 10,000-plus exemptions and deductions and preferences \nthat are in there. I turn it over to an accountant, who spends every \nworking hour of his week, every day of the year trying to stay up with \nthe complexity of this Tax Code.\n  It is no secret that Americans spend 6.1 billion hours each year \nfilling out tax forms, and roughly $163 billion a year is spent on tax \ncompliance. It is a great benefit for accountants and tax lawyers, but \nthe average person simply cannot begin to comprehend the complexity of \nthis code, and we pay a significant price for that.\n  Along that line, people feel a real sense of unfairness in this. They \nare always wondering if their neighbor has a better accountant or a \nbetter tax attorney or has figured out a way to take advantage of a \ndeduction or exclusion or a tax preference that they may not be aware \nof. You know: You are having coffee on April 16 and talking about \nfiling your taxes yesterday and saying: Well, you did take the \ndeduction for X, Y or Z, didn't you? Or how about that extra room in \nyour house you use for business? Or did you know you can deduct the \ncost of pencils, but also driving down to pick up a latte, or whatever, \nif you are meeting somebody for business? This stuff goes on and on \nforever. And you think: Gosh, I didn't know that. He got a better deal \nthan I did.\n\n  We lose our sense of confidence in terms of the fairness of the tax \nsystem. So simplification is absolutely essential. And for a 71,000-\nplus page Tax Code, I think it is an absolute necessity.\n  We reduced the number of tax brackets for individuals, first of all, \nfrom six to three. We also eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which \nmeans you have to calculate your taxes twice, in many instances, to see \nwhich one is the higher and which one you pay. That doubles the amount \nof time, or it adds a lot to the amount of time.\n  I want to point to this chart here on my right, the Wyden-Coats Tax \nReform Act of 2010. This is what a simplified U.S. individual tax \nreturn form will look like if this bill is passed. It is one page. It \nincorporates, obviously, the information about who you are and whether \nyou are married, your spouse's Social Security number and yours, et \ncetera, et cetera; whether you are head of household, these very simple \nprovisions here that are on the tax form now. We can all figure out how \nto work through to here.\n  Right here, you list your dependents and their relationship to you, \nand you get their Social Security numbers and then to see whether you \nqualify for a dependent's deduction, and then you check those off.\n  You list your capital gains and your dividends here. Your total \nincome is added together, and then you adjust that by some very simple \nretained exemptions that we have not taken out, and deductions, and tax \ncredits, all still on one page. You come down to the payment, and you \neither get a refund or you owe the government a little more money. And \nthat is it. Then you send it in.\n  We also have a provision in there if you don't want to do this \nyourself or you have some confusion. It is basic enough. You can do it \nelectronically or by telephone or whatever, and ask the IRS to do it \nfor you. They will calculate it for you, send it to you, so you can \nreview it and then certify that it is correct or that you have \nquestions that can be answered.\n  Point No. 1: Simplification is absolutely necessary. It can be done, \nand we have structured it so with three\n\n[[Page S2134]]\n\nbrackets that allow us and allow individuals to fill out their taxes on \nthe basis of this simple form.\n  Thirdly, after revenue neutrality and simplification, we are talking \nabout how do we use this to grow the economy. Clearly, with the fiscal \nsituation we are in today, we are not going to solve our problem just \nby cutting or by raising taxes. We need to have a growth component so \nwe can achieve more revenue through the prosperity and growth of \ncorporations and income levels of individuals and so forth. So we are \nreforming our code in a way to help us get out of this fiscal situation \nby improving the prosperity and growth of the country.\n  Our current tax system places the employers and businesses at a \ndisadvantage in the global marketplace. If you look at this chart on my \nleft, the United States, out of the 36 most competitive countries \ncompeting for global business around the world, is 35th. We are 35th \nout of 36 in the highest rate of taxes paid by our corporations, and \nthey are competing against countries such as Germany, France, Austria, \nTurkey, Chile, and all these that are listed here--Asian nations and so \nforth--that have much lower combined tax rates than the United States.\n  We want to lower this level of payment of taxes in the United States \nby U.S. businesses to 24 percent from the current rate of 35 percent. \nIf we go by a combined rate, it ends up with numbers a little different \nthan that, but we want to move the United States down here into the \ncompetitive area where we are competitive with all those countries that \nwe compete with to sell products overseas in this global economy. We do \nthat and pay for it by eliminating a lot of the credits, special \npreferences, exemptions, and deductions that are available in those \n71,000 pages, resulting in 10,000 or more special exemptions. We \neliminate a lot of those in return for a lower corporate rate.\n  I talked with a number of businesses--small, large, and medium--that \nwere saying if we can just get the rate down where we are competitive, \nwe do not need to dig into the Tax Code to try to find all these \nspecial exemptions. It has been called corporate welfare. It doesn't \nalways fall into that category. Some of this is legitimate, but it is \nnot across the board. While it addresses problems of a specific \nindustry or a specific company, it does not address it across-the-board \nin a way for their competitors to be treated in the same way.\n  Under Wyden-Coats, we try to level the playing field and make \ninvesting in the United States more attractive to businesses of all \nsizes. We have a repatriation provision in there which at another time \nwe will explain in more detail. But a number of organizations, \nincluding Heritage and the Manufacturers Alliance, have done studies \nand produced information that shows that a lowering of this rate is a \njob creator. It is a growth component. The Heritage Foundation found \nthat the legislation could create up to 2.3 million new jobs a year, \nwhile cutting the Federal deficit by an average of $61 billion, just \nthrough the changes we have made in the corporate structure of \ntaxation. The Manufacturers Alliance published a paper that concluded \nsuch an approach would ``create nearly 2 million jobs on a net basis \nand add an extra $500 billion to GDP by 2015.'' The alliance also \nestimated that the increase of economic activity from this legislation \ncould reduce the debt by $1.2 trillion over the coming decade.\n\n  I wish to repeat that. While CBO or the Joint Tax might score this on \na static basis--meaning that from lowering tax rates they do not \ncalculate in what the potential growth from that might be in a fluid \nway, a dynamic way--history shows us that every time taxes are lowered, \nthere is an uptick in economic activity and more important an uptick in \nthe hiring and a drop in the unemployment rate. Getting us more \ncompetitive with our competitors around the world will clearly bring a \nyet undetermined number of more revenue coming into the Government \nbased on higher profits by our companies and resulting in more \nemployment. That is a key component of this tax reform.\n  Protecting the middle class and families is also another key \ncomponent of our tax reform and of the Wyden-Coats plan. Today a family \nof four in Indiana making $90,000 and filing jointly would owe nearly \n$13,000 in personal income taxes. Under Wyden-Coats that family would \nkeep more of their hard-earned money and save approximately $5,000 in \npersonal income taxes.\n  We protect and extend important tax deductions for families. We do \nnot eliminate all deductions to reach our simplified Tax Code with only \nthree levels of taxation. Without increases, we retain the rates. We \ndon't raise any of the rates that are currently in place. We keep the \ndependent tax credit, which is set to drop to $2,400 in 2 years. Under \nthe Wyden-Coats plan, we permanently set that credit at $3,000, a \nbenefit to families. The child tax credit is scheduled to revert to \n$500 in 2013. Wyden-Coats eases the tax burden on families by \npermanently setting the child tax credit at $1,000.\n  We promote personal saving and investment. We think it is important \nthat we encourage saving and investment. Today we have three separate \nIRA or Individual Retirement Account plans for savings and investments \navailable to individuals in the United States. Wyden-Coats promotes \nthis by expanding tax-free saving opportunities and consolidating these \nthree new accounts into one account that would allow a married couple \nto contribute up to $14,000 a year to tax-favored retirement and \nsavings accounts.\n  We take the three current plans in existence, we consolidate them \ninto one. We increase the amount per year that can be, tax-free, \ndonated to those savings and retirement accounts as another way of \nlooking out for families and their need to save for the future.\n  We are making the Tax Code fairer. Today our current tax system picks \nwinners and losers, with hundreds of specialized tax rates that benefit \nsome but not all. These credits, specialized earmarks within this Tax \nCode that we are working with today, total $1.1 trillion. We want to \neliminate, under Wyden-Coats, a number of those exemptions and end a \nnumber of specialized tax breaks that favor one sector of the economy \nor special interest group over another. We want to level this out.\n  I recognize and Senator Wyden also recognizes that there will be \nissues with this bill, especially from groups that benefit from these \nspecial exemptions, but those special exemptions and tax earmarks often \nput other companies at a disadvantage, and it is time, as I said, to \nmake our system fairer and more simple. Ronald Reagan once said: To put \nit simply, our tax system is unfair, it is inequitable, it is \ncounterproductive and all but incomprehensible. Reagan went on to say \nthat were he living at this time, even Albert Einstein would have to \nwrite to the IRS to help him fill out his 1040 form each year.\n  It is 25 years since we had any meaningful tax reform; 1986 was the \nlast time. During that time, our Government has vastly expanded Tax \nCode reform into a complicated, tangled web of deductions and loopholes \nfor tax lawyers to decipher. But if we can reform this Tax Code and \nencourage job investment here at home and, through doing this, create \nmore American jobs and make our country more competitive in a global \nmarket, we will have taken a major step to moving forward in terms of \naddressing the fiscal plight we are currently in.\n  Senator Wyden and I are open to suggestion. This is not set in \nconcrete. This is not a be-all, end-all plan. We don't have all the \nanswers to this complex problem. But we think this is an essential \nstart to a debate that is necessary to be accompanied by other \nsolutions that we have to bring to our current fiscal situation. We \nwant to put this in as a starter, as a way of saying 2 years-plus of \nhard work by two people who are knowledgeable about this topic--and I \ndo not begin to bring myself up to the speed Senator Wyden and Senator \nGregg achieved in the 2-plus years of very hard effort, but I am trying \nto learn as fast as I can. We want to bring forward a bipartisan, \nDemocratic-Republican plan which we think is based on principles that \nare necessary to stimulate our growth and provide fairness and \nsimplification of our Tax Code. We want to provide it. We are asking \neverybody to look at it, examine it, come to us with your questions. \nThere will be a lot of things to like. There will be some constituents \nwho will find some things they do not like because it takes away a \nspecial exemption that they perhaps depended\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\non. But we want to explain the basis on which we have made these \ndecisions. We are open to suggestions, as long as those suggestions \nallow us to retain those basic principles and maintain us at revenue \nneutrality level and a fairness across-the-board to families and \nbusinesses and individuals throughout this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look, to work with us. The door is \nopen for us to sit down and talk, whether to colleagues in the Senate \nor families or businesses across the country who want to bring their \nspecial input to this particular effort. We look forward to working \nwith them and, over time, incorporating this in the plan to make us a \nfiscally healthier country and a country that is growing and dynamic \nand can retain its place as a place of prosperity and opportunity for \nnot only those of us today but for our future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 730. A bill to provide for the settlement of certain claims under \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Tlingit and Haida people, the first \npeople of Southeast Alaska, were perhaps the first group of Alaska \nNatives to organize for the purpose of asserting their aboriginal land \nclaims. The Native land claims movement in the rest of Alaska did not \ngain momentum until the 1960s when aboriginal land titles were \nthreatened by the impending construction of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. \nIn Southeast Alaska, the taking of Native lands for the Tongass \nNational Forest and Glacier Bay National Monument spurred the Tlingit \nand Haida people to fight to recover their lands in the early part of \nthe 20th century.\n  One of the first steps in this battle came with the formation of the \nAlaska Native Brotherhood in 1912. In 1935, the Jurisdictional Act, \nwhich allowed the Tlingit and Haida Indians to pursue their land claims \nin the U.S. Court of Claims, was enacted by Congress. After decades of \nlitigation, the Native people of Southeast Alaska received a cash \nsettlement in 1968 from the Court of Claims for the land previously \ntaken to create the Tongass National Forest and the Glacier Bay \nNational Monument. Yes there was a cash settlement of $7.5 million, but \nthe Native people of Southeast Alaska have long believed that it did \nnot adequately compensate them for the loss of their lands and \nresources.\n  When the Native people of Southeast Alaska chose to pursue their land \nclaims in court they could not have foreseen that Congress would \nultimately settle the land claims of all of Alaska's Native people \nthrough the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, ANCSA, of 1971. Nor \ncould they have foreseen that they would be disadvantaged in obtaining \nthe return of their aboriginal lands because of their early, and \nultimately successful, effort to litigate their land claims.\n  The Claims Settlement Act imposed a series of highly prescriptive \nlimitations on the lands that Sealaska Corporation, the regional Alaska \nNative Corporation formed for Southeast Alaska, could select in \nsatisfaction of the Tlingit and Haida land claims. None of the other 11 \nAlaska-based regional Native corporations were subject to these \nlimitations. Today, I join with my Alaska colleague, Sen. Mark Begich, \nto reintroduce legislation to right this wrong.\n  For the most part, Sealaska Corporation has agreed to live within the \nconstraints imposed by the 1971 legislation. It has taken conveyance of \nroughly 290,000 acres from the pool of lands it was allowed to select \nunder the 1971 act. As Sealaska moves to finalize its land selections, \nit has asked the Congress for flexibility to receive title to slightly \ndifferent lands that it was not permitted to select under the 1971 \nlegislation.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will allow Sealaska to \nselect its remaining entitlement from outside of the withdrawal areas \npermitted in the 1971 legislation. It\n  The legislation we are introducing today will allow Sealaska to \nselect its remaining entitlement from outside of the withdrawal areas \npermitted in the 1971 legislation. It allows the Native Corporation to \nselect up to 3,600 acres of its remaining land entitlement from lands \nwith sacred, cultural, traditional or historical significance \nthroughout the Alaska Panhandle. Substantial restrictions will be \nplaced on the use of these lands.\n  Up to 5,000 acres of land could be selected for non-timber or mineral \nrelated economic development. These lands are called ``Futures'' sites \nin the bill. Other lands referred to as ``economic development lands'' \nin the bill could be used for timber related and non-timber related \neconomic development. These lands are on Prince of Wales Island, on \nnearby Kosciusko Island.\n  Sealaska observes that if it were required to take title to lands \nwithin the constraints prescribed by the 1971 legislation it would take \ntitle to large swaths of roadless acres in pristine portions of the \nTongass National Forest, the original selection areas containing \n112,000 acres of old-growth timber. The lands it proposes to take for \neconomic uses under this legislation are predominantly in roaded and \nless sensitive areas of the Tongass National Forest, meaning that under \nthis bill Sealaska likely will select roughly 39,000 fewer acres of \nold-growth than otherwise might be the case. In the process it will at \nmost select 9 percent of the second-growth, leaving the U.S. Forest \nService hundreds of thousands of the 428,972 acres of second-growth in \nthe forest. It will be selecting about 28,570 acres of second-growth, \nleaving the Forest Service more than 88 percent of the second-growth in \nthe forest for it to use to promote a ``young''-growth strategy in our \nNation's largest national forest.\n  The pools of lands that would be available to Sealaska under this \nlegislation are depicted on a series of maps referred to in the bill. \nIt must be emphasized that not all of the lands depicted on these maps \nwill necessarily end up in Sealaska's ownership. Sealaska by this \nlegislation will not receive title to lands in excess of its remaining \nacreage entitlement under the 1971 legislation and this legislation \ndoes not change that entitlement total, still to be finalized by the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  Now this legislation has traveled a long path, one that has seen it \nchange substantially to meet a variety of concerns. Early in the 110th \nCongress, Alaska Congressman Don Young in 2007 introduced H.R. 3560 to \naddress these issues. Later in September 2008 I introduced legislation \nsimilar to, but somewhat different from that bill to give all parties \ntime to thoroughly review the measure. In 2009, I reintroduced the bill \nafter Sealaska and the communities of Southeast Alaska worked \ncollaboratively in good faith to identify issues that may arise from \nthe transfer of lands on which those communities have relied on for \nsubsistence and recreation out of the Tongass National Forest and into \nNative corporation ownership. Throughout 2009 and into 2010, I and my \nstaff held 12 town meetings in Alaska to collect comments on the bill, \nand made modifications to it in response to the comments we received. \nWhen the bill did not advance in 2010, my staff again held two town \nmeetings and other briefings this winter to gain additional comments \nand suggested changes in the bill. It is after these comments, and \nfollowing email and letter suggestions from a variety of sources, that \nI and Senator Begich now move to reintroduce a new version of this \nbill. It will be somewhat different than a new bill also being \nintroduced today by Congressman Young in the House, a bill more similar \nto his original bill from 2007.\n  The legislation we are introducing today in the 112th Congress is \ndifferent from the original bill in numerous respects. In some cases, \nthe lands open to Sealaska selection have changed from those that were \navailable in the first House bill to accommodate community concerns. \nFor example, this bill reduces the selection pool to about 79,000 \nacres. It allows for timber land selections in North Election Creek, \nPolk Inlet-McKenzie Inlet, near Keete, at 12 Mile Arm, at Calder, all \non Prince of Wales Island, at several sites on Koscuisko Island and on \nnorthern Kuiu Island. These sites are far different than in 2009 since \nfollowing comments, all of the areas on northern Prince of Wales \ninvolving Red Bay, Buster Creek and Labouchere Bay have been deleted\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\nfrom the bill to meet the concerns of Port Protection and Point Baker \nresidents. Also a large 12,462-acre parcel in the Keete area also was \nremoved to accommodate environmentalist concerns. This bill also makes \na series of map changes in these parcels, removing 745 acres at Karheen \nLakes on Tuxekan Island to protect fisheries, and removes timber lands \naround Halibut Harbor and Cape Pole on Koscuisko Islands to also \nprotect fishermen and boaters.\n  Concerning Future sites, this bill keeps 30 sites, specifically \ndropping the 30-acre Dog Cove site, near Naha, north of Ketchikan, as a \nresult of State and community concerns and imposing a restriction \nagainst development for 15 years of a proposed geothermal site at \nPegmatite Mountain, 25 miles north of Tenakee on Chichagof Island. That \nrestriction allows the possibility of a renewable energy site to serve \nHoonah and Pelican and perhaps Tenakee, if other projects can't first \nbe completed to provide lower-cost power to those communities. The bill \nalready has removed several dozen Future sites that had been proposed \nsince 2007.\n  The bill in a change from the 2009 version includes a number of \nconservation areas, totaling 151,650 acres, to help protect fisheries \nand karst formations on Prince of Wales, Kupreanof, Kuiu and Sukkwan \nand Goat Islands. The conservation areas, first proposed after public \ncomment in spring 2010, remove no timber lands from the current timber \nbase, but do provide added protections to key fishery habitats such as \nthose around Sarkar Lakes, Eek Lake, Bay of Pillars and Lovelace \nCreeks. Further to protect fisheries, this bill, as sought by many \nfishermen, imposes an 100-foot setback requirement for any timber lands \nconveyed to Sealaska from timber operations around class 1-A fish \nstreams for 5 years--plenty of time for the State of Alaska to consider \nwhether it needs to make any changes in its current State Forest \nPractices Act setback requirements.\n  The bill retains a series of changes made in the bill in the past to \nsolve concerns over any unintended consequences that the bill might \ncause concerning the definition of Indian country in Alaska. It removes \nall sites from possible conveyance in Glacier Bay National Park and \nPreserve. It removes any presumption that any site qualifies as a \nsacred, cultural, traditional or educational site in Southeast, \nreturning the nomination process for all such selections to the \nregulations that covered such selections immediately following the 1971 \nact's passage. And the bill incorporates a host of changes sought by \ngovernments, the state and a wide variety of groups and individuals to \nclarify language and solve concerns over everything from public access \nguarantees to access rights by bear guides. The bill maintains public \naccess rights to all 17(b) easements and guarantees public access to \nall timber lands.\n  Sealaska also has offered a series of commitments to ensure that the \nbenefits of this legislation flow to the broader Southeast Alaska \neconomy and not just to the Corporation and its Native shareholders. \nThe biggest is that all revenues will need to be shared under Section \n7(i) of ANCSA with all other Native shareholders statewide.\n  We all hope that after 40 years that this measure can advance to \npassage this Congress and resolve the last land entitlement that \nSoutheast Alaska's more than 20,000 Native shareholders have long had a \nright to receive. It is impossible to expect Alaska's Native \ncorporations to provide meaningful assistance to Alaska's Native \ncommunity if they continue to be denied the lands that Congress \nintended them to receive to utilize to provide economic benefits for \nthe Native peoples of the State. I hope this measure can pass and \nbecome law before the 40th anniversary of the claims settlement act in \nDecember of this year. Justice delayed truly is justice denied.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 730\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve billing disclosures to cellular telephone \nconsumers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, cell phones today are \nbecoming ubiquitous and more essential to our everyday lives. Americans \ntoday have over 300 million wireless phones.\n  We use these phones in new and innovative ways. Consumers today \nincreasingly use their cell phones for much more than just talking. \nMobile broadband services now allow us to surf the Internet, search for \nnearby shops or restaurants, and watch videos right on our wireless \nhandsets.\n  Since we now use these devices in new ways, it can be more difficult \nfor consumers to realize they have exceeded their monthly subscriptions \nfor cell phone service. This can have dramatic consequences for \nconsumers.\n  Consider the case of a Navy ROTC midshipman who mistakenly left his \nsmartphone's roaming function turned on while he was abroad. His phone \ndownloaded e-mail messages, and he was sent a bill for almost $1,300. \nNews outlets have highlighted other cases from across the country, \nincluding cases where children on family subscription plans racked up \nthousands of dollars in extra charges. A 13-year-old's cell phone data \nusage led to a bill for almost $22,000.\n  Bob St. Germain of Massachusetts was billed $18,000 for a 6-week \nperiod when his son used a cell phone to connect a computer to the \nInternet. I am proud to have Mr. St. Germain's support for the \nlegislation I am introducing today. Unfortunately, these stories we \nhear about in the media are certainly not isolated cases, just the most \negregious.\n  In fact, a recent Federal Communications Commission, FCC, survey \nfound that 30 million Americans, or 1 in 6 adult cell phone users, have \nexperienced cases of ``bill shock.'' Cell phone bill shock occurs when \na consumer's monthly bill increases when they have not changed their \nplan. In about one in four cases, the consumer's bill increased by more \nthan $100. According to a survey by Consumers Union, the publishers of \nConsumer Reports magazine, the median bill shock amount was $83.\n  With new, advanced developments in technology, bill shock is a \ngrowing problem. The introduction of faster ``4G'' networks will make \nit easier than ever for customers to burn through data limits. \nAmericans who have cell phone ``family plans'' with multiple phone \nlines may face even greater difficulty monitoring their usage. More and \nmore cell phone companies are dropping their unlimited data plans, and \nthe risk of bill shock only stands to get worse.\n  Although consumers can already access their phone usage by requesting \nthis information from their cell phone provider, the FCC survey found \nthat almost 85 percent of American consumers who suffered bill shock \nwere not alerted that they were about to exceed their allowed voice \nminutes, text messages, or data downloads.\n  In many cases, a simple alert message would help consumers avoid bill \nshock. That is why today I am pleased to introduce the Cell Phone Bill \nShock Act of 2011.\n  This legislation is similar to what I proposed in the last Congress. \nIt would require that cell phone companies do two things: first, that \nthey notify cell phone customers when they have used 80 percent of \ntheir limit of voice minutes, text messages, or data usage. This \nnotification could be in the form of a text message or email, and \nshould be free of charge. Second, this legislation would require cell \nphone companies to obtain a customer's consent before charging for \nservices in excess of their limit of voice, text, or data usage. \nCustomers could give such consent by calling or sending a free text \nmessage or email to their phone company.\n  In the European Union, wireless phone companies already provide \nsimilar notifications when wireless consumers are roaming and when they \nreach 80 percent of their monthly data roaming services.\n  Congress already approved legislation to help consumers avoid bank \noverdraft fees from debit card and ATM transactions. Banks must now \nobtain their customer's permission before allowing debit card \ntransactions which would incur overdraft fees. My legislation extends \nthat same concept to cell phone customers, who should benefit from \nsimilar protections against ``bill shock.''\n  The texting and Internet capabilities that make today's cell phones \nmore useful than ever should be applied to help consumers avoid bill \nshock. Sending an automatic text notification to one's phone or an \nemail alert should not place a burden on cell phone companies. Passing \nmy commonsense legislation will help prevent consumers from facing \n``bill shock'' problems in the future.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 732\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cell Phone Bill Shock Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A recent survey conducted by the Federal Communications \n     Commission found that 1 out of 6 consumers who subscribe to \n     commercial mobile service has experienced ``bill shock'', \n     which is the sudden increase in the monthly bill of a \n     subscriber even though the subscriber has not made changes to \n     their monthly service plan.\n       (2) Most consumers who experience bill shock do not receive \n     notification from their provider of commercial mobile service \n     when the consumer is about to exceed the monthly limit of \n     voice minutes, text message, or data megabytes.\n       (3) Most consumers who experience bill shock do not receive \n     notification from their provider of commercial mobile service \n     that their bill has suddenly increased.\n       (4) Prior to the enactment of this Act, a provider of \n     commercial mobile service was under no obligation to notify a \n     consumer of such services of a pending or sudden increase in \n     their bill for the use of such service.\n       (5) Section 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 332) requires that all commercial mobile service \n     provider charges, practices, classifications, and regulations \n     ``for or in connection with'' interstate communications \n     service be just and reasonable, and authorizes the Federal \n     Communications Commission to promulgate rules to implement \n     this requirement.\n\n     SEC. 3. NOTIFICATION OF CELL PHONE USAGE LIMITS; SUBSCRIBER \n                   CONSENT.\n\n       (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``commercial \n     mobile service'' has the same meaning as in section 332(d)(1) \n     of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1)).\n       (b) Notification of Cell Phone Usage Limits.--The Federal \n     Communications Commission shall promulgate regulations to \n     require that a provider of commercial mobile service shall--\n       (1) notify a subscriber when the subscriber has used 80 \n     percent of the monthly limit of voice minutes, text messages, \n     or data megabytes agreed to in the commercial mobile service \n     contract of the subscriber;\n       (2) send, at no charge to the subscriber, the notification \n     described in paragraph (1) in the form of a voice message, \n     text message, or email; and\n       (3) ensure that such text message or email is not counted \n     against the monthly limit for voice minutes, text messages, \n     or data megabytes of the commercial mobile service contract \n     of the subscriber.\n       (c) Subscriber Consent.--The Federal Communications \n     Commission shall promulgate regulations to require a provider \n     of commercial mobile service shall--\n       (1) obtain the consent of a subscriber who received a \n     notification under subsection (b) to use voice, text, or data \n     services in excess of the monthly limit of the commercial \n     mobile service contract of the subscriber before the provider \n     may allow the subscriber to use such excess services; and\n       (2) allow a subscriber to, at no cost, provide the consent \n     required under paragraph (1) in the form of a voice message, \n     text message, or email that is not counted against the \n     monthly limit for voice minutes, text messages, or data \n     megabytes of the commercial mobile service contract of the \n     subscriber.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 733. A bill to amend part B of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to exclude customary prompt pay discounts from manufacturers to \nwholesalers from the average sales price for drugs and biologicals \nunder Medicare; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to address a health care \nconcern that impacts all of us--access to health care.\n  When you or your loved one is sick--the most important thing on earth \nis\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\nto fight for the very best medical care possible. And when the \ndiagnosis is cancer--a disease far too many of our friends and family \nhave faced--it becomes all the more important and all the more time \nsensitive.\n  Unfortunately, in some cases, access to care--as well as the life-\nsaving drugs needed to treat a variety of forms of this disease--are \nbeing negatively impacted by the current reimbursement structure for \nMedicare Part B drugs and biologicals. In layman's terms, it's one more \nhurdle that doctors have to fight for their patients.\n  That is why I am introducing today legislation that would end the \nhurdle. My bill would exclude customary prompt pay discounts from the \nmanufacturer's average sales price for purposes of Medicare Part B \ndrugs and biologicals.\n  In Hillsboro, Kansas we have already seen cancer clinics begin to \nclose as a direct result of the current reimbursement structure which \nlimits patient access to care that they desperately need. Currently the \nprompt pay discounts artificially reduce Medicare Part B drug \nreimbursement rates for community oncology clinics, jeopardizing the \nviability of these providers. The closing of the clinic in Hillsboro \ncan be directly attributed to this reimbursement structure. \nAdditionally, prompt pay discounts also reduce the payment rates of \nprivate payers that use Average Sales Price. My legislation is a step \nforward in addressing problems with Medicare reimbursement for cancer \ndrugs.\n  Primary Healthcare Distributors, PHDs, act as a middle man between \nproviders and drug and product manufacturers. Most healthcare providers \nmust receive daily deliveries of products from many different \nmanufacturers. PHDs streamline the system and provide efficiencies by \naggregating the ordering and shipping logistics. Some 80 percent of \nprescription medicines in the U.S. are stored, managed and delivered by \nPHDs. These PHDs receive prompt pay discounts from drug manufacturers \nin recognition of the efficiencies they provide.\n  However, these efficiencies are threatened by the Medicare \nModernization Act's, MMA's, inappropriate inclusion of these prompt pay \ndiscounts in the calculation of the Average Sales Price for Medicare \nPart B drugs, those administered in a doctor's office. The inclusion of \nthese discounts ultimately reduces reimbursements to providers, who are \nnot the actual beneficiaries of the discounts. It provides a perverse \nincentive for manufacturers to go around the PHD to offer prompt pay \ndiscounts directly to the providers, thereby eliminating the \nefficiencies of the current system and potentially creating another \nburden for providers.\n  Congress has recognized the importance of excluding prompt pay \ndiscounts from providers' payment formulas in the Medicaid program. \nThis bill would extend that exclusion to Medicare Part B.\n  I believe that the policy is right; that is why today I, along with \nSenator Stabenow, am introducing legislation to amend Part B of Title \nXVII of the Social Security Act to exclude customary prompt pay \ndiscounts from manufacturers to wholesalers from the average sales \nprice for drugs and biologicals under Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 131, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 131) designating April 2011 as \n     ``Tsunami Awareness Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr President, today I rise in support of my resolution \ndesignating April 2011 as Tsunami Awareness Month.\n  The recent events in Japan serve as a reminder of the importance of \ntsunami preparedness and mitigation. As we recently saw, tsunamis can \nstrike at any time, continue for hours, wash away homes, buildings, and \nroads, and claim thousands of lives. Deadly tsunamis have struck \nHawaii, Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, Puerto \nRico, and the United States Virgin Islands within the last 150 years. \nAll coastline communities in the United States are at risk of being \nimpacted by tsunamis.\n  Sixty-five years ago, my home State of Hawaii experienced the most \ndevastating and destructive tsunami in its history, which claimed the \nlives of 159 individuals. Hawaii's geographic location in the middle of \nthe Pacific Ocean makes us extremely vulnerable to tsunamis because 80 \npercent of all tsunamis occur in the Pacific.\n  To encourage citizens to educate themselves on tsunami preparedness, \nPresident Obama has designated March 20-26, 2011, as Tsunami Awareness \nWeek. For the month of April, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration's (NOAA) National Weather Service in Hawaii will conduct \nactivities to raise public awareness of the dangers of tsunamis and \ncommemorate the lives lost to the April 1, 1946 tsunami. Additionally, \nHawaii State and local officials have partnered with NOAA to develop a \nTsunami Safety Booklet to educate school-aged children about the \ndangers of tsunamis, and they plan to distribute the booklets and other \npreparedness materials at sponsored events.\n  I encourage all citizens to observe Tsunami Awareness Month and \nprepare for tsunamis by finding out if their homes, schools, and \nworkplaces are in areas likely to flood should a tsunami occur; \nidentifying evacuation routes; and preparing portable disaster supply \nkits. Additional information about tsunami preparedness can be found at \nTsunamiReady (www.tsunamiready.noaa.gov).\n  As Congress continues debates about cuts to the Federal budget, I \nremind my colleagues of the importance of federal funding for tsunami \nprograms.\n  Funding for NOAA tsunami program supports warning, mitigation, and \nresearch activities that are critical to our Nation's safety and \nsecurity. The NOAA operates two tsunami warning centers, the Pacific \nTsunami Warning Center at Ewa Beach, Hawaii, and the West Coast and \nAlaska Tsunami Warning Center at Palmer, Alaska. Through Deep-Ocean \nAssessment and Reporting of Tsunamis stations, these Centers monitor an \nextensive network of deep\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nsea buoys providing real-time information needed to detect and issue \nwarnings for tsunamis generated in the Pacific Ocean.\n  Furthermore, NOAA, in coordination with the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency and the United States Geological Survey, partners \nwith all 29 coastal States, Territories and Commonwealths in the United \nStates to reduce the impact of tsunamis through the National Tsunami \nHazard Mitigation Program.\n  These programs save lives. The House-passed continuing resolution \nwould decrease funding for NOAA by approximately $450 million. Funding \nincreases in recent years have allowed NOAA to strengthen our Nation's \ntsunami warning capabilities by expanding the operating hours and \ngeographic areas of responsibility for both tsunami warning centers. \nMaking drastic cuts to the NOAA's budget would severely impair our \nNation's ability to warn citizens of potential disasters. Maintaining \nthis funding is critical.\n  As Japan recovers from the deadly earthquake and tsunami of March 11, \n2011, I continue to pledge my support for the people of Japan and keep \nall those affected by this tragedy in my thoughts and prayers.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the matter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 131) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 131\n\n       Whereas a tsunami is a series of ocean or sea waves \n     generated by a sea floor disturbance, such as an earthquake, \n     landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite;\n       Whereas a tsunami could occur during any season and at any \n     time;\n       Whereas a tsunami is a threat to life and property for all \n     coastal communities, and tsunamis have caused serious \n     injuries and millions of dollars in property damage in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the danger posed by a tsunami cannot be eliminated, \n     but the impact of a tsunami can be mitigated through \n     community preparedness, timely warnings, and effective \n     response;\n       Whereas tsunamis historically have posed the greatest \n     hazard to Hawaii, Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington, \n     American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the \n     Virgin Islands, tsunamis also pose risks to all ocean coasts \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local officials have partnered \n     to coordinate a national effort to reduce the impact of \n     tsunamis through the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation \n     Program;\n       Whereas the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration's National Weather Service operates 2 tsunami \n     warning centers, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the \n     West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center, that detect \n     potential tsunamis and issue warnings;\n       Whereas Tsunami Awareness Month provides an opportunity to \n     highlight the importance of tsunami preparedness and to \n     encourage the people of the United States to take steps to be \n     better prepared for tsunamis at home, work, and school;\n       Whereas the people of the United States can prepare for \n     tsunamis by finding out if their home, school, workplace or \n     other frequently visited locations are in tsunami hazard \n     areas, and by identifying evacuation routes; and\n       Whereas additional information about tsunami preparedness \n     may be obtained through TsunamiReady at National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration, at www.tsunamiready.noaa.gov: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2011 as ``Tsunami Awareness Month''; \n     and\n       (2) encourages the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and other \n     applicable entities, along with the people of the United \n     States, to observe Tsunami Awareness Month with appropriate \n     events and activities to promote tsunami preparedness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/05/senate-section/article/S2144-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1255\n\n  Mr. BENNET.
