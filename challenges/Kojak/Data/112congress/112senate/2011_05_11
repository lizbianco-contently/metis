Madam President, I recognize we are in a partisan \nenvironment. In a partisan environment, there is temptation to turn \nevery issue into a political issue. We certainly live in one of those \nenvironments today. That is regrettable but far from unfamiliar. \nPolitics play a role in our representative government, of course, and \nthey always have. The Founders created a system of checks and \nbalances--three branches of government, for example, and two Chambers \nof the Congress--precisely because they anticipated these passions. Our \nFounding Fathers wanted to keep us from losing our way.\n  Long after that system was created, a new, independent Federal agency \nwas created in the same spirit of checks and balances. That agency is \nthe National Labor Relations Board and acts as a check on employers and \nemployees alike. It safeguards employees' rights to unionize or not to \nunionize if they so choose. It mediates allegations of unfair labor \npractices. It does all this independent of any outside influence.\n  The Acting General Counsel of the NLRB is a man who is as nonpartisan \nand as independent as the agency for which he works. Last month, he \nissued a complaint against one of America's largest companies, Boeing. \nThe complaint alleges that after Boeing workers in some States went on \nstrike, the company retaliated by opening a new production line in a \nnonunion facility. That kind of retaliation, if that is what happened, \nis, of course, illegal.\n  That is just the background. I am not here to judge the merits of the \ncase. In\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\nfact, I am here to do the exact opposite--to remind the Senate that \nprejudging the case is not our job. That would overstep long-\nestablished boundaries and weaken our system of checks and balances. \nLately, though, some of our Republican colleagues have attacked the \nNLRB and have tried to poison the decisionmaking process. They are \ninterfering with the case pending before a legal body. For example, \nevery Republican Senator on the HELP Committee--and let's remind \neveryone, the ``l'' in HELP stands for ``labor''--sent a letter to the \nActing General Counsel defending Boeing. The letter itself, sent 6 \nweeks before a hearing even takes place, seems questionable at the very \nbest, but these 10 Republicans went further. They went out of their way \nto link their request to the Acting General Counsel's pending \nnomination. If there were ever a case of intimidation, that sounds like \nit to me. But that is not all. Eight State attorneys general--all \nRepublicans--also signed a letter to the Acting General Counsel calling \non him to withdraw the complaint against Boeing--again, long before an \nadministrative judge has had the opportunity to even look at the case, \nlet alone review the case.\n  I strongly encourage all of them to take a step back, my Republican \ncolleagues on the HELP Committee and these attorneys general. We all \nknow Republicans dislike organized labor. We know they disdain unions \nbecause unions demand fairness and equality from the big businesses \nRepublicans so often shield at all costs. So let's be honest--\nRepublicans are threatened by unions. They are threatened because when \na large organized group is so concerned with workers' rights, the \nmembers of that group vote in large numbers. And because Republicans \nand the big businesses they defend so often try to take away workers' \nrights, workers don't often vote Republican.\n  This kind of interference is inappropriate, it is disgraceful and \ndangerous. We wouldn't allow threats to prosecutors or U.S. attorneys \ntrying to stop them from moving forward with charges they see fit to \nbring to the courts, and we shouldn't stand for this. It may not be \nillegal, but it is no better than the retaliation and intimidation that \nis the fundamental question in this case, and it should stop.\n  We need agencies such as the NLRB to be able to operate freely and \nwithout political pressures. We need to keep our independent agencies \nindependent. This case is for them to decide, not for us to decide.\n  Would the Chair now announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2852-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

By taxing \nAmerican energy production, they are also outsourcing American jobs. So \nlet me get this straight: higher gas prices, fewer American jobs, and \nmore dependence on foreign competitors at the expense of American \nenergy? That is their plan? No thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2852-5", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2852-S2853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DRAFT EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I was happy to see the No. 2 Democrat \nin the House yesterday take a stand against the President's proposed \nExecutive order, a proposal disguised as increased ``transparency,'' \nwhich would allow the administration to review a company's political \ndonations before deciding whether to award a Federal contract. That is \nright; the administration would be able to review a company's political \ndonations before deciding whether to give them a Federal contract.\n  Here is how he put it: This is the No. 2 Democrat in the House:\n\n       [The] White House plan to require federal contractors to \n     disclose political contributions could politicize the bidding \n     process and undermine its integrity.\n\n  Similar efforts have already been rejected by the Supreme Court, the \nFederal Election Commission, and the Congress during the last session \nof the Congress. Now there is bipartisan opposition to the \nadministration's Executive order.\n  The White House is spinning this as ``reform,'' claiming the American \npeople deserve to know how taxpayer money is being used by contractors. \nHowever, the proposed Executive order would exclude Democratic allies, \nincluding Federal employee labor unions, environmental groups, and, of \ncourse, Planned Parenthood.\n  As I have said, no White House--no White House--should be able to \nreview a contractor's political party affiliation before deciding if \nthey are worthy--worthy--of a government contract. No one should have \nto worry about whether their political support will determine their \nability to get or to keep a Federal contract or to keep a job.\n  The issuing of contracts by the Federal Government should be based on \nthe contractor's merits, bids, and capabilities. Under no condition--no \ncondition--should political contributions play a role in that decision. \nHowever, the White House draft Executive order makes it crystal clear \nthat if a contractor wants to do business with the government--if they \nwant to do business with the government--they cannot contribute to the \nRepublicans.\n  As Senator Collins recently pointed out, this Executive order would \nbasically repeal the Hatch Act and inject politics back into the \nprocurement process. This is simply unacceptable.\n  Democracy is compromised when individuals and small businesses fear \nreprisal or expect favor from the Federal Government as a result of \ntheir political associations. So the recent press reports about this \nunprecedented Executive order raise troubling concerns about an effort \nto silence or intimidate political adversaries' speech through the \ngovernment contracting system.\n  The White House still has an opportunity to not go forward with this \norder, and you can rest assured we will be watching very closely \nbecause the proposed effort would represent an outrageous--a truly \noutrageous--and antidemocratic abuse of executive branch authority.\n  It is my sincere hope that the recent reports of the draft Executive \norder were simply the work of a partisan within the administration and \nnot the position taken by the President himself. He should state his \nposition.\n  Mr. President, we are waiting for your response.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, since I first came to the Congress back \nin 1997 as a freshman Member of the House of Representatives, I have \nbeen talking about spending and debt and deficits, and that was a key, \ncentral element of my campaign for my first election to the House of \nRepresentatives way back in the day. Of course, at that time the \nnumbers were a lot less daunting than they are today.\n  If we just look at even where we were 15 years ago in relative terms, \nthe point at which we find ourselves today is almost overwhelming. The \ndebt now is over $14 trillion. We are being asked to raise the debt \nceiling even further. I would argue we can no longer afford to put \nthese hard decisions off because these are serious times and these call \nfor serious solutions and serious leadership. I hope we are up to that \ntask.\n  For a long time we thought debts and spending and deficits and all \nthose sorts of things could be acceptable up to a certain level, and I \nsuppose to some degree that is true. Historically, if we look at our \ncountry in terms of revenue and spending, over time we have \nconsistently had a certain amount of debt that we carried. But I think \nby any stretch, any American, any economist, anybody who watches this \nclosely has to recognize the situation in which we find ourselves today \nis unprecedented in American history and cries out for action--\nimmediate action and bold action.\n  This is something I would argue my constituents are very concerned \nabout--I think all Americans are very concerned about--because, again, \nif we look at it in relative terms, where we are today--$14 trillion in \naccumulated debt--and we go back in the annals of history and look at \nfrom the formation of this country back in the late 1700s until 1849, \nour Federal Government spent--if you can imagine this--only about $1 \nbillion over that 60-year time period.\n  Today, we will borrow $4 billion. Between today at 9:50 a.m. and this \ntime tomorrow at 9:50 a.m., our Federal Government will borrow $4 \nbillion, which, to put that into perspective, suggests we will borrow, \nin the next 24 hours, more than four times what we spent in our first \n60 years as a nation.\n  Now, in fact, in 1835, under President Andrew Jackson, the government \ndebt--for the only time in our Nation's history--was completely paid \noff. Since that time, our debts have been large and small, with large \nrunups in the debt during times of war, while the debt largely declined \nduring times of peace. Never, though, did our debt top even 50 percent \nof our entire economy, of our GDP, until the Great Depression.\n  At the end of World War II, debt topped 120 percent of GDP. But in \nthe postwar period, debt steadily declined as a percentage of our \neconomy, attributable to a couple factors: One was strong economic \ngrowth, and the second was a government that managed to keep spending \nrelatively low.\n  When we look at the post-World War II time period, and we get into \nthe 1960s and we reach the end of the 1960s, in that time period to \n2008--from 1969 to 2008--on average government spending consumed about \n20.6 percent of our entire economy while taxes during that time period \non average were about 18 percent of our economy. That, in balance, led \nto a sizable but a manageable national debt. Debt held by the public \njust before this President took office was $6.3 trillion.\n  Now, to put it into perspective, during the previous 40 years the \nbudget was balanced on five occasions. So if we look back, in the last \n40 years of our Nation's history there were five occasions on which we \nwere able to balance the budget. In each of these years--and those were \n1969, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001--spending was below the historical \naverage.\n  In 1969 spending was just 19.4 percent of our GDP. In 1998 it was \n19.1 percent of our GDP. In 1999 it was 8.5 percent of GDP. In 2000 and \n2001 it was only 18.2 percent of our GDP. So when we look at the years \nwhen our budget was balanced, spending averaged just under 18.7 percent \nof GDP. So what are we set to spend this year? Madam President, 24.3 \npercent of our GDP--an astonishing 30 percent more than we have spent \nhistorically when our budget was balanced. Our debt held by the public \nat the end of this year will be nearly double what it was when this \nPresident took office.\n  So how did we get to such a high level of spending? Well, to be fair, \nI think we would have to say some of this is attributable to the \neconomic downturn. Obviously, tax receipts, revenues, are down as a \nconsequence of the economy being in a recession. We also have the \nongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have been expensive \nand, obviously, have required a large commitment of resources in order \nto conduct the operations that are necessary for success there. But I \nwould also argue that a substantial chunk is due to the spending spree \nthat Congress has been on since 2008.\n\n  Between 2008 and 2010 spending on nondefense discretionary programs \nwent up more than 20 percent even though inflation over that same time \nperiod was around 2 percent. When we add in what eventually the \nbailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are going to cost, which will be \nhundreds of billions of dollars, that adds significantly to the debt. \nOf course, the stimulus boondoggle cost us over $800 billion in the \nshort term. When we add in the interest costs that are associated with \nthat, it will be over $1 trillion--which was all borrowed, borrowed \nmoney, borrowed from our children and grandchildren.\n  When we look at the percentage, as I said before, of spending $1 \ntrillion, literally, on that one program, that one policy, the stimulus \nprogram that went into effect a couple years ago, that is literally a \nthousand times more than what we spent as a nation in our first 60 \nyears of its existence.\n  If we look at the projections included in the President's budget, it \nis revealing that it never balances, and that is due entirely to \nspending. Spending under the President's budget never falls below 23 \npercent of our entire economy, of our GDP. After 2015 it grows, and \nthere is not a single year when the spending does not grow as a share \nof our economy. So we have this constant growth in overall spending as \na percentage of our GDP that is way beyond the norm if we look at any \nsort of historical average.\n  So when the President submitted his initial budget to the Congress, I \nthink we were all hopeful it would demonstrate an acknowledgement that \nhe gets it; that he understands the dimensions of this problem and how \nserious our fiscal and financial straits are. But the budget he \nsubmitted to Congress a few months ago actually increased spending over \nthe 10-year time period, massively increased the debt, and raised taxes \non our small businesses at a time when, as I said earlier, we are \nhoping to get the economy growing and expanding again, which helps \naddress many of the problems I just mentioned. We cannot have economic \ngrowth when we are raising taxes on the job creators in our economy, \nwhich is our small businesses.\n  I would argue the two things that are going to be necessary for us to \nget our economy back on track and to address this issue of spending and \nthis out-of-control debt are to get spending under control, to make the \nhard decisions that have been put off for far too long; and, secondly, \nto put policies in place that will enable and create the conditions for \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  Well, if we look at what the current administration is doing in terms \nof policies, what I hear as I travel in my State of South Dakota from \nsmall businesses--I hear it from agricultural producers--is that at \nalmost every turn they are facing new regulations, new policies coming \nout of Washington that do not reduce the cost of doing business but \nactually increase the cost of doing business and drive down their \nmargins, make it more difficult for them to invest capital, to hire new \npeople, and to get this economy going and expanding again.\n  There are numerous examples of that. We have a number of agencies \nthat are just issuing, promulgating regulations, pursuing an aggressive \nagenda, much of which cannot be accomplished in Congress because there \nare not the votes in the Congress to accomplish much of that agenda. So \nthe administration has decided, by just sort of an executive power \ngrab, to try to accomplish much of that agenda.\n  Well, as I said before, most of those policies are things that make \nit more\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nexpensive to do business in this country and are going to make it more \ndifficult for our small businesses to get back on track. I mentioned \nthe tax increases the President has proposed, consistently proposed, \nnot only in the budget he released to Congress several months ago but \nmore recently, a couple weeks back, when he came out with his sort of \nnew improved budget still loaded up with tax increases on small \nbusinesses--the very opposite of what we would want to do if we want to \nencourage small businesses to invest and create jobs.\n  The economic uncertainty that is created by tax policies which are \nnot permanent, expire in a couple years, the economic uncertainty \ncreated by not knowing what the next regulation coming out of \nWashington, DC, is going to do to their bottom line is creating an \nanxiety out there among investors and keeping on the sidelines a lot of \nthe capital that otherwise would be put to work and deployed in \ncreating jobs.\n  So if we look at just a few examples--the EPA is probably the most \nnotable one; that is the one I hear the most about--it does not matter \nwhether I am talking to a small business group or whether I am talking, \nagain, to farmers and ranchers, consistently, they say: These \nregulations coming out of Washington, DC--and specifically in this \ncase, most of them are referring to policies that are coming out of the \nEPA--are making it very difficult for us to create jobs, to put people \nback to work, and to invest, reinvest in our businesses.\n  So we have these types of regulations that are coming out of these \nagencies. We also have, as I said, a runup in costs associated with \nmany of the policies the Congress has enacted, the spending and debt \nissues that have been created by the stimulus bill, the new health care \nbill, which when it is fully implemented will cost $2.5 trillion or \nthereabouts, but it is going to pass on lots of new costs to businesses \nacross this country not only in the form of tax increases but also in \nthe form of higher insurance rates which they are going to be looking \nat.\n  I think you are going to see a continued period where businesses in \nthis country--small businesses--because of this economic uncertainty, \nwill continue to sit it out and don't do the things that are necessary \nto get people back to work and to deal with high unemployment. There is \nalso the issue of a depressed economic downturn that will make it more \ndifficult for us to expand the economy and address this issue of \nincreasing revenues at the Federal level, which will help solve the \nproblem we have with the deficit and debt.\n  Another issue that I think is significant now, but it is always an \nissue for the people I represent in South Dakota, is high energy costs. \nThe Democratic prescription--the most recent one--is to tax energy \ncompanies. If you want to get lower cost energy, one of the things you \nwould not do is raise taxes and make it more costly and expensive for \npeople to do business. If you look at, again, EPA and their attempt to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, which they \ndon't have the authority to do but want to do anyway, has made it more \ndifficult for energy companies to get permits, and a number of projects \nhave been scratched across this country. I can think of a couple in \nSouth Dakota.\n  If you look at the fact that if we continue to get 60 percent of our \nfuel from outside the United States--we are literally sending $1 \nbillion a day to foreign countries because of our addiction to foreign \nenergy--and if you look at the policies here that we should be \nimplementing if we are interested in getting to be energy independent \nand produce more American energy, you find a complete contradiction \nwith what the President and his allies in Congress say. They all talk \nabout energy independence, getting away from spending $1 billion a day \non foreign oil. Yet, their policies tell another story, because we are \nlimiting even more the amount of area in this country that would be \nopen to energy exploration and production. We have enormous resources \nin the United States--oil and gas, clean coal, biofuels, and others \nthat we can gain access to.\n  Right now, we have energy policies that seem more intent on and \nconcerned with some other agenda rather than energy independence. If \nyou are interested in energy independence, I would think you would put \npolicies into place that encourage the production of more American \nenergy. Exactly the opposite is occurring. We have more and more areas \nthat have been taken off limits--public lands. We cannot get to the \nOuter Continental Shelf. A permatorium is in existence in the South. \nThe North Slope of Alaska has tremendous energy resources. Much of this \nis off limits, and that will continue to drive us into the arms of \nforeign countries--many that don't have the best interests of this \ncountry in mind and, perhaps even worse, fund organizations that plan \nattacks against the United States and our allies.\n  It strikes me at least that if you are serious about getting deficits \nand debt under control, the one thing you would do is put policies into \nplace that enable small businesses to do what they do best, and that is \ngrow and create jobs. Secondly, you would put constraints on Federal \nspending in Washington, DC--this issue I mentioned earlier--so that the \nconsistent runup in the amount we spend on our Federal Government as a \npercentage of GDP will start to not only taper off but come down.\n  There are a number of suggestions that have been made out there--\ncertainly, perhaps, no perfect one. At least people are taking a \nlegitimate shot at trying to address this issue. There has been a lot \nof discussion about the Ryan budget that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. That is already being immediately attacked. Perhaps it \nis not perfect, but it is a serious effort to control spending.\n  The only other suggestions we have seen, as I mentioned, are some \nstatements made by the President about his proposals, again, all of \nwhich increase taxes, increase spending, and add massively to the \nFederal debt. It seems to me that we are not having a serious \ndiscussion about balancing our budget and paying off our debt, \nparticularly, again, when you put into perspective where we are. \nBetween now and 10 a.m. tomorrow, we will borrow another $4 billion, \nwhich, as I said before--I think it bears repeating--is literally four \ntimes the amount our entire country spent in the first 60 years of its \nexistence. Again, that is $4 billion between now and this time \ntomorrow.\n  We are being requested to raise the debt limit, the amount we can \nborrow, raise the limits on our credit card in the next few weeks \nbecause we are up against that ceiling. We have hit the maximum. We \nhave capped out our ability to borrow money. We are going to be asked \nto make a vote to increase that borrowing ceiling. I don't think that \ncan occur honestly until such time as we are willing to put into place \nand take the necessary steps to get this issue of spending under \ncontrol.\n  This is, by definition, a spending issue. Some people argue that we \nneed tax increases and additional revenue. The observation I made about \nbalancing the budget was that at the times we did that over the last 40 \nyears--on those five occasions, in every case, we spent less than the \naverage--in some cases significantly less--as a percentage of our GDP.\n  Clearly, the way to attack this issue is to get spending under \ncontrol. That will require hard decisions, many of which have been \npostponed. We have been kicking the can down the road for a long time. \nWe are out of road now. We have come up to the cliff. We cannot kick \nthe can any further. The road is at an end. We are up against some very \nserious impediments if we don't take the necessary steps to fix the \nproblem.\n  Again, when I talk about the seriousness of it, over the last few \nyears we have paid lipservice to the issue of spending and debt. I \nmaintain that you have to judge people by what they do and how they \nvote, not by what they say. We need to debate this issue. As we get \ninto the discussion over raising the debt limit, it creates an \nopportunity for both sides--Republicans and Democrats--to come together \nbehind a plan that will meaningfully reduce spending in this country, \nwhich will deal with entitlement reform, which is needed. We cannot \nsolve this problem in the long term unless we address the issue of \nentitlement reform and get some limits on spending that will be \nbinding, that we cannot get around.\n  It is too easy too waive things here and declare an emergency and \ncontinue to spend as if there is no tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\nThese are serious times. They require serious leadership and serious \nsolutions. That point is no better made than by some of our leaders in \nthis country. As we all know, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, ADM Mike Mullen, has said in testimony before Congress that the \ngreatest threat to America's national security is our national debt. I \nthink that is a stunning and powerful statement about where we are and \nthe importance of acting now. We had the former Federal Reserve \nChairman, Alan Greenspan, say not too long ago that there is a 50-\npercent probability that we will face a debt crisis in the next 2 to 3 \nyears. And then, of course, we had Standard & Poors provide a negative \nassessment to our credit rating in this country. That, too, is \nsomething we have not seen before. I hope we are willing to take the \nnecessary steps to avoid our credit rating being downgraded. When you \nget an assessment such as that, it is not too long that a downgrade in \nyour credit rating follows.\n\n  Those are not just anecdotal things, those are fact-based assessments \nand analysis of where we are. These are people who know the importance \nof dealing with these issues. If we continue to borrow more money from \nother places and don't take the necessary steps to fix this, we will \ncontinue to put our future of our children and grandchildren at greater \nrisk and in greater jeopardy.\n  This will not be easy. Obviously, there will be political \nconsequences to any decisions we make. But these decisions are more \ndifficult because we have put them off for so long. The easy decisions, \nthe low-hanging fruit is no longer out there. We have to decide now, \nare we going to continue to spend and spend and borrow and borrow, to \nthe point where we head over the cliff because we ran out of road, or \nwill we make these decisions now and get serious about providing a \nstronger and better and more prosperous future for our children and \ngrandchildren?\n  We cannot act as though the Federal Government doesn't have a \nspending problem. Those days are gone. We no longer have that luxury; \nthe numbers bear that out. So we need to look at the debt limit and the \nupcoming vote as an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to come \ntogether behind a plan that will meaningfully address our spending \nproblem.\n  The status quo is not acceptable. It is going to require leadership \nfrom the President, which has been nonexistent so far. I hope he will \nstep forward. It will require leadership from Democrats in the Senate. \nThey control the agenda here and they have the majority. I hope we do a \nbudget this year. We didn't do one last year in the Senate. I think it \nis important to have that debate, so that the American people see us \ndebating how we are going to spend their tax dollars. That is something \nevery American should expect and deserves from their elected leaders.\n  I hope we will have a budget markup where we can get these issues out \nin front not only for us to discuss but also in front of the American \npeople. This is their future we are talking about. If we don't act, we \nare putting in great peril and jeopardy the future for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I wanted to point out where we have come from and where, in my view, \nwe need to go if we are going to solve this problem. I hope my \ncolleagues will join in that discussion, not only rhetorically but that \ntheir actions will follow. We cannot just talk about this; it is time \nfor us to quit talking and start acting.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to speak about an issue that is \ndirectly impacting each and every family, not just in West Virginia but \nthroughout this whole country. It is the high gas prices. The truth is, \nin States all across this Nation, and particularly in West Virginia, \ncountless families have to drive to survive. For these families, a jump \nin the gas price is not just an inconvenience or an annoyance, it is a \nthreat that hits extremely hard in the pocketbook and could change \ntheir way of life.\n  But as every American knows, the cycle of high gas prices is not a \nnew phenomenon with any of us. I still vividly remember waiting in line \nfor gas in the early 1970s, when gas was rationed based on our license \nnumber--when we could buy gas. It is something I thought could never \nhappen in America, and I am sure those whom it happened to felt the \nsame.\n  This all came about because of our dependency on foreign oil. If we \nthink back to the early 1970s, we were 28 percent dependent on foreign \noil, which we thought was a high number at that time. But today we are \nmore than 50 percent dependent on foreign oil, which has caused a \nmassive transfer of American wealth to countries that do not like us \nthat much and want to do us harm. We have seen this bad movie time and \nagain. Yet somehow it seems Washington keeps thinking there is going to \nbe a different outcome or a different ending. The right ending will \nonly come when our Nation makes it a high priority to achieve energy \nindependence within this generation.\n  While crafting such a bold plan will be difficult, I recognize--and \nthe special interests that oppose using our own resources such as coal, \nnatural gas, and oil in an environmentally responsible way will resist \nloudly--we can no longer allow this Nation and our hard-working \nfamilies to be held hostage by high gas prices. We can no longer allow \npartisanship and politics to undermine the common ground that can be \nachieved if we work together with one goal in mind--true energy \nindependence within this generation.\n  Let me make it perfectly clear, high gas prices are not the only high \nprice we are paying as a nation. For decades, our great men and women \nwho serve us so well have been called to action in defense of our vital \ninterests in the Middle East and all around the world. Thousands have \nbeen killed and injured. Their families have suffered the incredible \npain of loss. Our nations have spent trillions in the course of these \nmissions. Yet too many of these oil-rich countries have and will \ncontinue to use against us our dependence on their oil.\n  For all these reasons and for the sake of our national security, it \nis time for our Nation to become truly energy independent within this \ngeneration. I believe we can do it, and I know we can because just this \nweek in beautiful Mingo County, WV, my State took a major step to \nconfront our gas prices head on. On Monday, West Virginia said enough \nis enough. On a sunny morning in the town of Gilbert, WV, I helped \nbreak ground on a promising new project that could help bring down the \ncrushing gas prices our families are confronting. There, entrepreneurs \nand State and local governments are participating to create hundreds of \njobs at a coal-to-gasoline plant that is at the forefront of any \ntechnology in the world.\n  The anticipated production of this plant is very impressive. It is \nprojected to convert 7,500 tons of West Virginia coal into 756,000 \ngallons of premium gasoline each and every day, which can be used to \nrun our cars and our trucks and even some of our military equipment.\n  Over a 4-year construction period, it is estimated that 3,000 skilled \ntrade workers in America will be employed. When the plant is finished, \nit is expected to create 300 direct jobs and hundreds of more ancillary \njobs in the community.\n  In West Virginia and Mingo County, the government is acting as a \npartner--and as a good partner, not an obstacle--and that is the role \nour Federal Government should take toward energy independence. This is \nexactly the kind of project the Federal Government should work on with \nus to make sure it succeeds. They should be our ally, not an obstacle \nor an adversary. If my little State has the courage to step out and \ninvest in our independence, then the Federal Government should also \nhave the courage to do the same. West Virginians are sending the right \nmessage for this country. We will not let ourselves be held hostage to \nforeign countries that want to see the United\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\nStates be financially crippled simply because those countries have oil.\n  My State of West Virginia also proves we can and we must use all our \ndomestic resources to break our cycle of dependence on foreign oil \nwithin this generation. It doesn't matter whether your State has oil, \ncoal, natural gas, geothermal, nuclear, biomass, wind, solar or hydro \nbecause we have to harness all the tremendous resources right here in \nAmerica or we are going to continue to rely on countries that have \ncontributed directly or indirectly to changing America for the worse.\n  At the end of the day, it is going to take everything we can do and \nevery resource we have to become truly independent. That is one of the \nmany reasons why I am cosponsoring the American Alternative Fuels Act \nwith my colleague, John Barrasso, from Wyoming. Among other things, the \nbill would break down barriers to alternative energy fuels, including \nthose from coal, biomass, algae, and waste.\n  There are other smart, targeted actions we can take in the short term \nto help reduce the price of gas for our families. I have signed on to \nan important piece of bipartisan legislation sponsored by my friend, \nSenator Herb Kohl, from Wisconsin. It is the No Oil Producing & \nExporting Cartels Act, better know as NOPEC. This bill would finally \nallow the Department of Justice to go after foreign countries, such as \nthe members of OPEC, because of their price-fixing behavior.\n  The other major issue we must address now is speculators and oil \ncompany subsidies. This is not a supply issue. The real problem is pure \ngreed--some who are taking advantage of the instability in our world to \nline their pockets on the backs of American families--or a tax policy \nthat does not make any sense at all, that continues to subsidize oil \ncompanies when the price of a barrel of oil is at the highest it has \never been and the profits are at a record high. This doesn't make any \nsense to American families.\n  Wouldn't it make more sense that these subsidies they now have should \nonly be available when the cost of production exceeds the price of a \nbarrel of oil? That would be a commonsense solution. It would ensure \nstability and steady production, and it does not force taxpayers to \nfill the bank accounts of major oil companies when they are already \nmaking record profits.\n  Because we must do so much more to protect American families, I have \nalso encouraged the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to take \naggressive steps in the short term to regulate and pursue the oil \nspeculators who are driving the price of a gallon of gas through the \nceiling.\n  While the most important thing our country can do is establish a \nnational energy plan for independence, all of those actions are steps \nwe can take to make sure we relieve the financial pressures on our \nfamilies and help secure our country.\n  For all of the wonderful families of West Virginia, for the great \npeople of the United States of America, and all of our children and \ngrandchildren, this country must finally answer the call. It is time. \nIt is truly time. It is time to free this Nation, put politics aside, \nand work together to make energy independence a national priority.\n  I truly believe that if we work together as Americans and focus on a \ncommonsense approach, we can develop a strong bipartisan energy plan \nthat will not only break the power of foreign oil countries and \nspeculators, but use the resources that we have right here in America. \nWe can chart a new and promising energy future for this great Nation \nand we must start today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \ncomments on our dependence on foreign oil. We import about $1 billion \nworth of oil a day. That does not make our Nation any stronger. In \nfact, it makes us more dependent. For our economy to grow, we need to \nhave good homegrown energy sources. We may never be totally \nindependent, but if we do not move toward independence, then I am \nafraid we are going to continue to be victimized, as we have been \nrecently, by not only oil companies but the greed the Senator mentioned \nthat drives up gasoline prices every Spring. Just as sure as the \nbaseball season is going to open, gasoline prices are going to go sky \nhigh. Then they are going to retreat, but they never retreat to where \nthey started. They always end up higher as we go into the summer \nvacation season. The Senator from West Virginia has some thoughtful \nideas here on how to address this. I share his support of Herb Kohl's \nlegislation that deals with NOPEC, the OPEC cartel, and the fact that \nwe have been victimized by them for way too long.\n  Like the Senator's State, we have a lot of coal in Illinois. We want \nto find an environmentally responsible way to use it, to take all of \nthe energy out of the ground and put it to work for America so \nAmericans can go to work. I thank the Senator for his leadership on \nthis important topic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2856-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2856-S2857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ILLINOIS FLOODING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, closer to home in Illinois, we are \nfighting the floods. It happens regularly, and we have had a tough time \nwith it. The Ohio River, the Illinois River, and the Mississippi River \nhave all been threatening communities such as Metropolis and Old \nShawneetown. I was down in Cairo, IL, a couple of weeks ago and saw how \nbad it was. It was a scary situation in a very poor town.\n  The Corps of Engineers had a tough decision to make. They had to blow \na levee, which means opening farm land to be flooded. To take the \npressure off the rivers, they did it. I said to General Walsh when he \nwas in the process of making the decision: Do what is right and I will \nstand by you. I know what I want you to do, but do what is right. I \nthink he did the right thing, and I stand by him.\n  Now I stand by those living in Missouri who were affected by that \ndecision. If they in any way suffered hardship or inconvenience or loss \nof income as farmers, we need to stand by them, as we do with so many \nacross America in times of disaster.\n  I know we have had a big challenge in our State. Governor Quinn and I \nwere on the phone the day before yesterday talking about the response. \nHe was on his way down to Metropolis. A mutual friend of ours, Mayor \nBilly McDaniel, down there is working with Pulaski County Board \nChairman Monte Russell to find places for people to stay as they wait \nfor the flood waters to recede in Metropolis.\n  In Carmi, Mayor David Port and Golconda Mayor Bill Altman are working \nwith our office to make sure that pumps and other supplies are there \nwhen they are needed. In Cairo, we had a change in administration. I \nworked with Judson Childs, the former mayor. He has now been replaced \nby Tyrone Coleman. We will continue to work with them. They vacated a \nlot of homes. People are staying in gyms and other places and waiting \nfor a chance to go back home. We are going to do our best to make sure \nthat happens.\n  A special salute to our Illinois National Guard. These men and women \ncome to the rescue of our State every time we face a disaster. This is \nno different. They are putting in long hours. I thank them for their \nunselfish commitment. And GEN Bill Enyart can be proud of the men and \nwomen of the Guard units across the State of Illinois.\n  The Illinois Emergency Management Agency under Director Jonathon Luck \nhas been in touch with our office every single day. They are assessing \nthe damage that has been done. They will measure that damage, and at \nthe appropriate moment--and I am sure it will be soon--will move \nforward with our congressional delegation to ask for Federal disaster \nstatus and Federal disaster assistance. That is something that I think \nwill definitely be needed and is appropriate for the magnitude of this \nchallenge.\n  I will work with my colleague Senator Kirk, who visited last week in \nthis region. We are going to work together, in a bipartisan way, to \nmake sure that our State and the people who are suffering under these \nflooding conditions have a chance to recover, get back to their homes \nand back to their businesses and back to work.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 952 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am here to call for the end of the \n$4 billion in giveaways that taxpayers are providing to big oil \ncompanies every year. At a time of skyrocketing gas prices and of \nrecord oil company profits and of difficult decisions about where and \nhow to cut the Federal deficit, we should not be providing big oil with \nexpensive and unnecessary taxpayer handouts.\n  Gas prices nationwide are averaging $3.96, up over a dollar from this \ntime a year ago. In my home State of Rhode Island the average price per \ngallon is now over four bucks. These prices are putting a significant \ndent in family budgets across the country.\n  In the last 50 years prices in real terms have only been this high \ntwice--in 1981 after the oil crisis and in parts of 2007 and 2008. High \ngas prices not only increase the cost of driving, but they leave \nfamilies with less to spend on other basic necessities. They ripple \nthroughout the economy as gas-guzzling buses strain school district and \npublic transportation budgets, food prices increase from trucking \ncosts, and wherever transportation is a factor it raises costs for \nAmerican consumers.\n  The current price spike could not have come at a worse time. When gas \nprices last peaked in July 2008, unemployment nationally was 5.8 \npercent. Now unemployment nationally is 8.8 percent, and it is even \nhigher in many States. In my home State of Rhode Island, we are still \nstruggling under a staggering 11-percent unemployment rate.\n  I recently heard from Tony, a constituent in Wakefield, RI, about the \nimpact rising gas prices have had on his wallet. He said:\n\n       We have few options to offset the higher pricing and thus \n     much less to spend.\n\n  Gas prices are forcing individuals such as Tony to make difficult \nchoices about what to cut out of the family budget. Yet even as \nfamilies are struggling, oil companies are once again reaping record \nprofits.\n  Here are the earnings numbers the oil companies recently announced \nfor this quarter: ConocoPhillips earned a first-quarter profit of $3 \nbillion, up 44 percent from the period last year. Chevron earned $6.2 \nbillion, a 36-percent increase in profit. Royal Dutch Shell earned $6.3 \nbillion, a 30-percent increase in profit. BP earned $7.1 billion, a 17-\npercent increase in profit. And the big one, ExxonMobil, earned a \nprofit in one quarter of $10.7 billion, a 69-percent increase from last \nyear in quarterly profit.\n  These companies combined for a total profit of $33.3 billion in the \nfirst quarter. That is $370 million per day or more than $250,000 in \nprofit every minute. I have probably been speaking for at least 4 \nminutes, so they have made 1 million bucks.\n  There is a direct correlation between how much consumers pay at the \npump and how much oil companies rake in. As gas prices climbed from \n2002 to 2008, so did profits. When gas prices fell in 2009, down went \nprofits. Sure enough, as gas prices climb again to over $4 per gallon, \noil profits are up sharply.\n  With people in Rhode Island and across the country being forced to \ntighten their budgets, and with the Federal Government working to \nreduce our deficit, it is all the more frustrating to read about these \ntaxpayer-subsidized, sky-high profits. At the very least, when we are \nlooking at cutting Head Start, for instance, we should not be wasting \n$4 billion per year in precious taxpayer dollars to help these big oil \ncompanies earn higher profits. They are doing wonderfully on their own.\n  So I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing the Close Big Oil \nTax Loopholes Act to end some of these egregious subsidies for the big \nfive oil companies. To highlight a few, the proposal would repeal \nsubsidies to oil companies for producing oil overseas. It would repeal \na deduction that can often eliminate Federal taxes for oil companies, \nand it would repeal the head-scratching classification of oil companies \nas manufacturers which allows them to take a tax credit aimed at \ngetting our manufacturing industry back on its feet. It is time to \nclose these loopholes and make sure oil companies are paying their fair \nshare to help us lower our deficit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an op-ed from \nJacqueline Savitz which ran today in my hometown paper, the Providence \nJournal, calling on Congress to end these handouts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From McClatchy-Tribune News Service, May 11, 2011]\n\n Jacqueline Savitz: Make Congress End Handouts to Big Oil: Providence \n                             Journal Op-Ed\n\n                         (By Jacqueline Savitz)\n\n       Maybe the Internal Revenue Service should rename its 1040 \n     Form the WD-40. After all, after millions of Americans paid \n     their taxes this year, a hefty chunk of their hard-earned pay \n     went to grease the palms of some of the world's richest oil \n     companies.\n       But these companies are already well lubricated. Despite \n     profits that surged to nearly $80 billion in 2010, Big Oil \n     will pocket nearly $5 billion in taxpayer handouts this \n     year--even as gasoline prices soar and our national debt \n     deepens.\n       One year after the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the \n     Gulf of Mexico, it's time to ask whether we keep shoveling so \n     much tax money to companies that need it so little--and seem \n     to care even less about the long-term health of America's \n     economy and environment.\n       Not surprisingly, in poll after poll, the American people \n     are saying: ``No!'' A February NBC/Wall Street Journal survey \n     found that a whopping majority of Americans--74 percent--\n     support ending longstanding oil-industry tax credits worth \n     tens of billions of dollars. President Obama has proposed a \n     change designed to keep the engine of innovation humming. He \n     has asked Congress to dispose of some grubby subsidies that \n     have rewarded Big Oil for bad behavior. And he wants to \n     replace them with more effective incentives for saving energy \n     and shifting to cleaner, greener and safer energy choices.\n       It's a sensible plan for leveling a playing field too long \n     tilted in Big Oil's favor. It recognizes that we can't just \n     pump our way out of our energy problem. And it would provide \n     the entrepreneurs who are creating tomorrow's energy sources \n     with the same kind of help the nascent oil industry got more \n     than a century ago but no longer needs.\n       The plan is also a welcome sign that, in the wake of the \n     Deepwater Horizon disaster, we are recognizing the true costs \n     of dirty energy. We don't pay just once for that gallon of \n     gas or quart of oil. We pay at least three times: Once at the \n     station; again on Tax Day for the subsidies; and again every \n     time taxpayers have to help clean up the environmental and \n     economic mess created by a leaking pipeline, smashed \n     supertanker or burning offshore rig.\n       It's one thing to mourn the lost lives, oiled birds, fouled \n     beaches and fishing grounds created by these catastrophes. \n     It's quite another, however, to realize that billions of our \n     tax dollars contributed to these disasters by cushioning \n     these companies from the true costs of their mismanagement.\n       So what's the problem? Apparently, the WD-40 has made its \n     way to Congress, and the well-lubricated process has so far \n     ensured that oil-industry subsidies continue to slip through \n     the legislative process.\n       At Oceana, we're calling on Congress to end this expensive, \n     self-destructive coddling. Oil and natural-gas companies have \n     already received at least $190 billion in subsidies since \n     1968, said a recent analysis by congressional staff. That \n     could grow by an additional $36.5 billion over the next \n     decade, if our laws aren't changed. And that doesn't count an \n     additional $2 billion to $3 billion in royalties a year that \n     companies aren't currently paying on the oil pumped out of \n     certain federal leases offshore, due to sloppy lawmaking and \n     political gridlock. A private company would never give that \n     oil away for free. Why should we the people?\n       In these lean times, we can't afford to waste more money on \n     further enriching the oil behemoths. Instead, we could: Pay \n     down our debt. Help our kids become the next Thomas Edison or \n     Bill Gates. Let today's small offshore-wind and ``smart \n     power'' firms become tomorrow's Google--or even tomorrow's BP \n     creating new jobs and big fortunes along the way.\n       Replacing oil won't happen overnight. But it won't happen \n     at all unless we make smarter choices now about spending the \n     public's money.\n       First, Congress should act now, as urged by President \n     Obama, to end unnecessary handouts to Big Oil. Second, make \n     sure that the companies pay fair royalties on the crude they \n     pump from public lands and waters. Finally, invest in people \n     and companies that will create the next energy revolution--\n     building everything from better offshore wind turbines to \n     electric cars. It's time we started using our scarce tax \n     dollars for the benefit of all Americans--and stopped handing \n     them over to a handful of rich oil executives. Come on \n     Congress, it's time for an oil change.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I have also called on President Obama to release some \nof the oil stored in our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. History \nhas shown that releasing some of this oil into the market can have a \nshort-term impact on prices. When President George H.W. Bush announced \nhe was authorizing a\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\ndrawdown in 1991, oil prices fell by nearly $10 per barrel the next \nday. There is not much we can do to reduce oil prices in the near term, \nbut this action could bring some relief to American consumers.\n  We must also clamp down on excessive oil speculation. I joined 47 of \nmy colleagues in opposing a Republican proposal to cut one-third of the \nfunding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the cop on the \nbeat, for improper speculation. The Commission is responsible for \ncracking down on illegal speculative activities that artificially \ninflate the price of oil. We need to make sure Wall Street is not \nunfairly gouging and hurting middle-class families. We should not be \ntaking this cop off that beat.\n  I am joining Senators Cantwell and Wyden in sending a letter calling \non the Commission to impose position limits on oil trading that were \nrequired by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill. This \ncongressionally imposed deadline has already passed, and the Commission \nshould act swiftly to protect consumers by helping to restrain \nspeculation. I am glad President Obama has directed an investigation \ninto the role of speculation in our current gas prices.\n  In the long run, we must invest in electric vehicles, alternative \nfuels, public transit, high-speed rail, and freight rail. Each of these \ntransportation methods can significantly reduce our reliance on oil in \nthe transportation sector. Indeed, moving freight by rail is three \ntimes more fuel efficient than by truck.\n  If we do not take long-term action, these price spikes we are seeing \nnow are going to keep on coming. We have seen them before, and we will \nsee them again. As President Obama said, the United States keeps going \n``from shock to trance on the issue of energy security, rushing to \npropose action when gas prices rise, then hitting the snooze button \nwhen they fall again.'' Let's not hit the snooze button after this one. \nLet's take the long-term action necessary to get our country off of \nforeign oil. But in the meantime, let's work together to end the \nunnecessary and costly $4 billion giveaway to these highly profitable \noil companies and promote instead long-term solutions to move us off \noil and to protect American consumers from the harmful price shocks \nthey are now experiencing.\n  I would leave with this question: Can the deficit be at once the most \nimportant challenge facing our Nation, as many of my colleagues say it \nis, and at the same time less important than protecting big oil \nsubsidies? I think not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2858-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2858-S2859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, a headline in the Hill today reads \n``Budgets everywhere, but not [a single] one has votes to pass.'' Well, \nthat is not exactly correct. In reality, there is only one budget that \nhas been presented, publicly debated, worked on in committee, shared \nwith the American people, and passed on the floor in one house, and \nthat is the budget of the Republican House. Paul Ryan led the fight on \nthat, and it is a courageous, serious budget that would restore fiscal \nsanity and prosperity to this Nation.\n  It deals with our short-term funding crisis and the long-term ability \nof our financial system. We had another budget presented by President \nObama. It was an irresponsible budget. The budget presented by the \nPresident to the Senate is about this thick. It is required by law that \nthe President submit one every year. He has around 500 people in the \nbudget office who help prepare that. That budget--analyzed by the CBO, \nour independent group of analysts--was found to not reduce the debt \npath we are on but to actually increase the debt over 10 years more \nthan would occur based on the Congressional Budget Office baseline we \nare already on--substantially, $2 trillion more. It has tax increases \nin it too. This is not a responsible budget. It was never received \nresponsibly in the Senate and not by the independent commentators. They \nall said it fails to do the job we have to do.\n  I have to say, by contrast to the House, that there still is no \nSenate Democratic budget--a budget set up to be passed by a majority. \nThe majority party always has the responsibility--and sometimes they \nmeet it and sometimes not--to present a budget. No action has even been \nscheduled in the Budget Committee. No plan or resolution has been \nbrought up for a vote. In fact, it has been 742 days since the Senate \npassed a budget--2 years. The Democratic-led Senate has missed the \nstatutory deadline of April 15 to produce a budget for the second year \nin a row. In fact, as a statutory requirement, the committee is to \nstart work on it by April 1. We have not begun it yet and it is mid-\nMay. Is it any wonder that this country is in a financial crisis, that \nwe are not containing spending, when we don't even have a budget and we \ndidn't even bring one to the floor last year? Majority Leader Reid \nchose not to bring a budget to the floor for debate or to even attempt \nto pass a budget.\n  We are in the middle of a fiscal crisis. There is no doubt that the \nsingle greatest threat to America at this point in time is the \nfinancial situation in which we find ourselves. This year, we will \nspend, by September 30--and we are moving on to that date--$3.7 \ntrillion. We will bring in revenue of $2.2 trillion. Forty cents of \nevery dollar we are spending this year is borrowed. It is an \nunsustainable path, as every expert has told us in the Budget \nCommittee, where I am ranking Republican.\n  We have heard witness after witness, Democratic and Republican, and \nthe President's own debt commission tell us we are on an unsustainable \npath. Erskine Bowles, the man chosen by President Obama to head the \nfiscal commission the President established, told us--along with Alan \nSimpson, his cochairman--that this Nation has never faced a more \npredictable financial crisis. We are heading right to it. It is going \nto hammer us, our children, and our grandchildren. If we don't get off \nthis course, the bond markets are going to revolt, and we are going to \nhave a serious financial crisis of some kind that will not be good for \nthis economy.\n  When asked when such a crisis could occur, Mr. Bowles said 2 years, \nmaybe a little less or a little more, and Alan Simpson said he thought \nit would be 1 year. These are independent people who love America. They \nare warning us to take action now. The President's budget simply \ndoesn't get it.\n  The American people are not happy with us. They think we are not \nmeeting our responsibilities.\n  Are they right? They hammered a lot of big spenders in the last \nelection. Were they right? I totally believe they are right. I totally \nbelieve that. I am of the view that there is no way this country should \nbe in the present debt situation. It should never, ever have happened. \nI opposed a lot of the spending. I would like to think I was more \nvigorous than most in warning against it. But I don't think I have done \nenough. There is no reason to borrow 40 cents out of every dollar we \nspend; it threatens our future.\n  We will double the entire debt of our country in 4 years under this \nPresident's watch. When he leaves office, completes his 4-year term, he \nwill have doubled the entire debt of America, and we are on a course \nthat continues to be dangerous.\n  As we know, Budget Committee Chairman Conrad has been meeting \nprivately with his Democratic caucus--it has been in the press--to try \nto finally bring some sort of budget forward. The Democrats apparently \nhave been unable to do so, from reports we see, because the big \nspenders in their caucus cannot support a plan that would actually get \nthe job done and put us on a sound financial path, and they can't \nproduce a plan that will withstand public scrutiny, apparently, and \nthat the American people would support. So they have a difficult \nproblem.\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\n  This was shown, as reported in The Hill, because Chairman Conrad--who \nserved on the debt commission and I believe fully understands the \ndangers this country faces--has repeatedly acknowledged that. I really \nrespect Senator Conrad's insights into the challenges this country \nfaces. Apparently, his proposal, which was going to be somewhat better \nthan President Obama's, I assume, failed to win the support of his \nconference and of Senator Bernie Sanders, who is a gutsy Senator and is \nopen about what he believes. But he has described himself as a \nSocialist and is the Senate's most powerful advocate for bigger \ngovernment. He is a member of the Budget Committee. The reason Senator \nSanders' vote became important is because the Democrats have apparently \nbeen working to pass a budget through committee without a Republican \nvote. They don't expect to get any Republican votes. The committee only \nhas one more Democrat than Republicans, so the chairman needs Senator \nSanders' vote if he wants to get the budget out of committee.\n  Here is an excerpt from The Hill:\n\n       Reid said Senator Conrad presented to the [Democratic] \n     Caucus a 50/50 split when asked about the preferred ratio of \n     spending cuts to tax increases. . . . Conrad has moved his \n     budget proposal to the left in order to gain the support of \n     Senator Bernie Sanders, an outspoken progressive on the \n     budget panel.\n\n  You know, ``progressive'' is a word they are using now for big \ngovernment types. They want to take more money from the American people \nbecause they believe they know better how to spend it than the American \npeople who earn it. They want to spread it around the way they want to \nspend it.\n  This is a remarkable turn of events. It is particularly stunning \nbecause the President's budget--repudiated for its dramatic levels of \nspending and taxes--claimed there was a 3-to-1 ratio of spending cuts \nto tax hikes. ``We cut spending $3 for every $1 in tax hikes'' is what \nthe President said. Chairman Conrad has indicated that would have been \nhis choice. He praised that. He said he favored that same ratio. I \ndon't think that is necessarily a good ratio. We need to reduce \nspending more than that.\n  Taken literally, what this means is that Senator Conrad has, in a \nfundamental respect, moved his plan to the left of the President and \nthe fiscal commission, which also proposed a plan that actually did \nreduce spending $3 for every $1 in tax increases or pretty close to \nthat, pretty fairly, without gimmicks, and came close to achieving \nthat. The President's budget was so gimmicked that it really didn't \nachieve $3 in spending cuts for every $1 of tax increases. It did not. \nIt wasn't correct for him to say that.\n  It is important to note that the President and the fiscal commission \nuse a baseline that assumes tax rates will go up. Fairly analyzed, \nthose plans rely much more heavily on taxing than those ratios \nindicate, as I said, and I fear that the composition of this new \nDemocratic budget proposal may not even meet the 50-50 plan. The others \nhave it in terms of taxes and spending cuts.\n  The merits of this 50-50 split between savings and taxes are both a \nquestion of philosophy and economics. Philosophically, the American \npeople don't want Washington to continue raising taxes to pay for \nlarger and larger spending. American families should not be punished \nfor the sins and excesses of Washington.\n  According to the CBO, we are going to spend $45 trillion over the \nnext 10 years. The Senate Democratic plan, which no one is likely to \nsee until after the committee meets--that is what we have been told, \nthat we won't see it until it is plopped down at the beginning of the \ncommittee markup, where amendments are supposed to be offered soon \nthereafter--their own plan, at least from what we read about it, says \nit will cut or save just $2 trillion out of $45 trillion over the next \n10 years.\n  The American people know there is much more we can and must do to \nbring this government under control and to achieve real balance in this \ncountry. What kind of balance? Between raising taxes and cutting \nspending, 50-50? No. The balance we need is one that respects the \nAmerican people, that reduces the growth in spending and wealth taken \nby Washington and allows it to be kept by the American people, who earn \nit.\n  There is also a question of economics. Our committee has conducted an \nexhaustive survey of available research which conclusively shows that \ndebt reduction plans that rely equally on saving money, reducing \nspending, and raising taxes are far less successful and result in far \nweaker economic growth than those plans that rely on cutting spending. \nWe will release a white paper very soon that will share these findings \nwith my colleagues and the country. It is very important that we \nunderstand this. What history is showing us is that when you reduce \nspending, you get more growth and prosperity than increasing spending \nand taxes.\n  Here is one example of the many studies we analyzed. This is a \nGoldman Sachs study by analysts Ben Broadbent and Kevin Daly. The \nreport resulted from a cross-national study of fiscal reform that:\n\n       In a review of every major fiscal correction in the OECD--\n\n  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the \nworld's major developed economies--\n\n     since 1975, we find that decisive budgetary adjustments that \n     have focused on reducing government expenditure have (i) been \n     successful in correcting fiscal imbalances; (ii) typically \n     boosted economic growth; and (iii) resulted in significant \n     bond and equity market outperformance.\n\n  In other words, the stock market and the bond market improved, and \nboth of those are a bit shaky now after some rebound.\n\n       Tax driven--\n\n  ``Tax driven,'' that means tax increases--\n\n     fiscal adjustments, by contrast, typically fail to correct \n     fiscal imbalances and are damaging for growth.\n\n  That is the Goldman Sachs study. Half of our U.S. Treasury Department \nhas been manned by people who served at one time or another at Goldman \nSachs. They are not considered a rightwing group. That is what their \nanalysts have said to us.\n  The Democratic Senate, I believe, should heed the large body of \nresearch showing that spending cuts on a basic economic level work \nbetter than trying to drain more out of the economy by way of taxes. In \nother words, the Senate should produce a budget based on facts. They \nshould produce a budget that grows the economy, that imposes real \nspending discipline on Washington. They should produce a budget without \ngimmicks and empty promises. They should produce this budget publicly, \nopenly, and allow the American people to review and consider it before \nthe committee meets in 72 hours, as my colleagues have pleaded with the \nchairman twice to do but he will not do. They should produce a budget \nthe American people deserve--an honest budget that spares our children \nfrom both the growing burden of debt and the growing burden of an \nintrusive big government.\n  I hope we can continue to have the opportunity to talk about this \nissue. It is right that the American people be engaged in it. I have to \nsay, I feel as though we failed in our responsibility to conduct open \nhearings and markups on a budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2859-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2859-S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, recently the National Labor Relations \nBoard general counsel issued a complaint against the Boeing Company \nalleging that the company had violated the National Labor Relations \nAct. This routine administrative procedure has set off what I call a \nmelodramatic outcry from Boeing, the business community, the editorial \nwriters of the Wall Street Journal, the National Chamber of Commerce, \nand, of course, our friends on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  A headline in the Wall Street Journal editorial page calls it: ``The \ndeath of right to work.''\n  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley declared that it was ``government \ndictated economic larceny.''\n  At a press conference held at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday \nmorning, Senator DeMint from South Carolina referred to it as \n``thuggery.''\n  The senior Senator from Utah warned that foot soldiers of a vast and \npermanent bureaucracy were trying to implement a ``leftist agenda.''\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\n  One would think this one decision by an administrative arm of an \nindependent agency was surely going to bring about the death of \ncapitalism in the world today. This has taken on incredible proportions \nin terms of the outcry and the mischaracterization of what has \nhappened.\n  Instead of talking about how we get Americans working again, get the \nmiddle class on its feet, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare taking their time on the Senate floor and in press conferences \ndowntown attacking the handling of a routine affair--an unfair labor \npractice charge.\n  I do not think it is worth the time of the Senate to debate this \nissue. However, because of this huge outcry and the fact that the Wall \nStreet Journal has chosen to editorialize on this issue and because of \nthe disturbing misinformation that has distorted public discussion of \nthis case, I am going to take some time on the Senate floor to try to, \nas they say, set the record straight.\n  I have said before this Boeing case is a classic example of the old \nsaying that a lie is halfway around the world before the truth laces up \nits boots. I would say, in this case, Senate information travels even \nfaster than that. So it is time to set the record straight.\n  Here are the facts in the case. It is undisputed Boeing recently \ndecided to locate a production facility for the new Dreamliner planes \nin South Carolina. They decided to do that. Many statements were made \nby executives of Boeing, publicly stated, that the decision to move \nthere was based in whole or in large part on the fact that there had \nbeen work stoppages, strikes in the last few years at the Boeing plant \nin Everett, WA. The NLRB's complaint alleges that this decision was \nunlawful retaliation against the Boeing workers in Washington State.\n  This has been put into a political context, but let's again be clear \nabout how this happens. The National Labor Relations Board is an \nindependent agency set up under the Wagner Act 75 years ago. There are \ntwo branches of the NLRB. One is the Board, the NLRB, the national \nboard. It is a five-member board appointed by the President, with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. On the other hand, there are the \ncareer service people, outside of the General Counsel, the civil \nservants who are not appointed. They are nonpolitical. They carry out \nthe day-to-day functions of the National Labor Relations Act. If I may \nsay, it is similar to the Food and Drug Administration. The Food and \nDrug Administration has an Administrator appointed by the President, \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, as do a lot of other \nindependent agencies. But then there is a civil service side of it that \nis professional--professional people not appointed by the President. \nThey have career civil service status.\n  The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board is \nappointed, but the rest of the staff in the area of the career civil \nservice. The acting general counsel now has been a civil servant for 30 \nyears.\n  What happens is, a business or a union--it does not have to be them; \nit can be anybody--can file a complaint with the NLRB, alleging that \ncertain actions were in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. \nOne of the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act says it is \nunlawful for a company to retaliate against workers for a protected \nactivity conducted by those workers--protected activity.\n  One of the protected activities under the National Labor Relations \nAct is, of course, the right to organize, the right to join a union, \nand, of course, under the Taft-Hartley bill, some years later, the \nright not to join a union if you do not want to, so-called right-to-\nwork States.\n  The protected activity in this case is the right to strike. The \nNational Labor Relations Act protects that activity. Organized workers \nin a union have the right to strike. It is a protected activity. A \ncompany cannot retaliate against workers for exercising that right.\n  So if--if, I say ``if''--if the Boeing Company did, in fact, move a \nproduction line to another State in retaliation against the workers who \nexercised their right to strike in Washington, that would be illegal \nfor Boeing to do that--unlawful. I said ``if'' because I am not here \ntaking a side in the case. I am not certain where the truth lies. This \nis for the trier of fact and the trier of law.\n  When a complaint such as this comes to the National Labor Relations \nBoard, they investigate it. The National Labor Relations Board \ninvestigated, under the general counsel's office, the civil service \npart. They did an investigation. They took affidavits. They talked with \npeople to find out whether there was any cause to move forward.\n  Again, whether it is right or wrong, I do not know, but this \nindependent civil servants decided there was enough evidence for them \nto warrant taking this case to an administrative law judge. That is the \nprocess. Boeing then can make its case before the administrative law \njudge. The general counsel's office can make its case. The \nadministrative law judge then makes a decision. As I understand it, the \nadministrative law judge can find for the general counsel, it can \nuphold their theory or it can modify it.\n  After that is done, either side can appeal it. That appeal then goes \nfrom the civil service part over to the National Labor Relations Board. \nAfter the Board then reviews it, they make a decision. They either \nuphold what the administrative law judge said or they do not uphold it.\n  From there, either side can appeal to the circuit court of appeals, \nand from the circuit court of appeals, they can appeal to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. That is the process. That process has been \nfollowed now for 75 years.\n  We follow similar processes in other independent agencies of the \nFederal Government. I mentioned the Federal Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Federal Trade Commission. A lot of other \nindependent boards and agencies have that same process.\n  What has happened now is, many of our friends on the Republican side \nand in the business community have now taken up the hue and cry that \nthis process should be interfered with, that this process should \nsomehow be stopped politically. I do not think it is our right, our job \nhere to interfere in something such as that politically. If my friends \non the Republican side do not like the provision of the National Labor \nRelations Act which says it is illegal to take retaliation against \nworkers for protected activity, if my friends on the Republican side \nwant to change that law, offer a bill, offer an amendment. That law can \nbe changed. With both bodies--the House and the Senate--and the \nPresident signing it, we can change it. But it is wrong for, I believe, \nelected officials, such as myself or anyone else, to interfere in that \nprocess and to cast it as a political decision. But that is what is \nbeing done by so many Republican Senators and people in the business \ncommunity.\n  They have alleged that President Obama was behind this, that somehow \nbecause he has appointed a couple members of the National Labor \nRelations Board that he is behind this issue. President Obama had \nnothing to do with it. This was a complaint filed by the Machinists \nUnion, the International Association of Machinists, with the NLRB. \nPresident Obama has nothing to do with this whatsoever, and he should \nnot have anything to do with it. But, again, people on the Republican \nside are alleging--again, misinformation, misinformation, \nmisinformation going out--that somehow this is being orchestrated out \nof the White House.\n  Again the facts: The facts are there was a complaint filed. The \nNational Labor Relations Board is doing exactly what they have done for \nthe last 75 years. It is going to go before an administrative law judge \nand then find out how it works its way through the courts at that time.\n  I would ask my friends on the Republican side, if in, fact--if, in \nfact--the Boeing Company did retaliate against workers because of a \nprotected activity, do my friends on the Republican side say that \nshould be OK? Is that what they are saying; that if workers exercise a \nlegally protected right and a company retaliates against those workers \nanyway they ought to be able to do that?\n  I can take all kinds of cases. Let's say a company decides to move a \nplant from Southern California to, let's just say Fargo, ND, and the \nreason they state they moved it was because there were too many \nHispanics working in their plant in Southern California and they didn't \nlike that. They wanted to\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nmove it to Fargo, ND, because there are not that many Hispanics there.\n  Guess what, folks. That is illegal. That is illegal. Do my friends on \nthe Republican side say they ought to be able to do that in violation \nof all our civil rights laws in this country? Of course not.\n  People say: Of course, they can't make that kind of decision based on \nthat. They can't make a decision to move a plant where there are more \nmen than women so they won't have to hire more women; or less African \nAmericans so they don't have to hire more African Americans. We can \ncarry this on and on.\n  So I hope my friends on the Republican side are not saying a company \ncan retaliate and then just walk away without any penalties, without \neven any recourse by the workers to have their cases heard. That is \nwhat I am here defending. I am defending the rights of the workers in \nthe plant in Everett, WA, to have their complaints heard.\n  Now, I don't know the facts. I know a little of the law, but I don't \nknow the facts. That is for the trier. That is for the administrative \nlaw judge and the NLRB and the appeals court and the Supreme Court. \nThat is their jurisdiction. But for us to say it shouldn't even go \nthere; that these workers can't even bring a case--and I might add, \nthere are a lot of cases that are filed with the NLRB that don't go \nthere because the NLRB investigates; they do their due diligence; and \nthey find out there is not even enough evidence to warrant going \nforward.\n  So all I can assume is here there was enough evidence to warrant \ngoing forward. Whether there is enough to actually find that Boeing did \nretaliate, again, I don't know. That is up to the trier of fact--the \nadministrative law judge. But I am hearing from these dramatic outcries \nthat somehow we are destroying the right to work. This case has nothing \nto do with right to work--nothing--zero. It has nothing to do with \nright-to-work laws. This case has nothing to do with the outcry that \nsomehow this is destroying the essence of a business to be able to \ndecide, in its best economic interest, where to locate.\n  If Boeing wants to open their plant in Timbuktu, they can do that. If \nthey want to open a plant in South Carolina, they can do that. What \nthey can't do is open a plant someplace in retaliation against the \nworkers exercising their legally protected rights; that, they can't do.\n  Now, again, this is an evidentiary-type hearing. So the evidence will \nhave to come forward as to just what decisions were made, why they were \nmade. Quite frankly, there are executives of Boeing who have publicly \nstated--publicly--that one of the reasons they moved was because of the \nwork stoppages at the Everett plant--work stoppages, strikes. Is that \nenough evidence? I don't know. Maybe it is enough evidence to warrant \ngoing forward. Obviously, the general counsel's office decided there \nwas.\n  I would also point out, Mr. President, the general counsel's office \nin cases such as this works long and hard to try to settle the case--to \nget both sides to settle. I know the general counsel's office in this \ncase did try to do that, but they were unsuccessful; therefore, the \ncase goes forward.\n  So I want to point out again--just to reiterate, Mr. President--this \nis not about doing away with the right-to-work laws. It has nothing to \ndo with that. It has nothing to do with interfering with businesses' \nmaking decisions on where to locate their plants or anything such as \nthat. It has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with \ndestroying capitalism. It has to do with whether workers have a right--\nfirst of all, can they exercise their legally protected rights, and \nthen can they make a case to the NLRB they were retaliated against \nbecause they exercised their legal rights. That is what this case is \nabout. That is what this case is about.\n  Again, I understand the desire of certain people to raise money for \npolitical campaigns. I understand that. I understand how one might \nexaggerate things a lot of times in direct mail and in the press. I am \nsure there will be a lot of businesses that will hear: You have to \ncontribute to this campaign or that campaign to stop President Obama or \nto stop the National Labor Relations Board from taking your business \ndecisions away from you.\n  Well, that is misinformation. I know it can be used to raise a lot of \ncampaign money, but it is not right. It is not right to deceive and to \nmisinform the American people about a basic right that protects middle-\nclass workers in America. Americans understand fairness, and they \nresent it when the wealthy and the powerful manipulate the political \nsystem to reap huge advantages at the expense of working people.\n  I think I have always been a pretty good friend of the Boeing \nCompany. I have been a big supporter of Boeing in so many things, going \nback in my 30 years in the Congress. It is a great company. They \nprovide a lot of great jobs for American workers. They build great \nairplanes--better than Airbus, I might say. But it is wrong for them \nnow to come in and try to get the political system to undo a legal \nadministrative procedure the workers at that Boeing plant have \ninstigated and have asked for the NLRB to investigate and to charge \nBoeing with retaliation.\n  What is happening in this case is that the powerful and the big are \ntrying to manipulate the political system. Powerful corporate interests \nare pressuring Members of this body to interfere with an independent \nagency rather than letting it run its course.\n  We should not tolerate this interference. We should turn our \nattention to the issues that matter to American families--how we can \ncreate jobs in Washington, and, yes, in South Carolina, in Iowa, and \nacross the country; how we can rebuild the middle class, how we can \nensure that working hard and playing by the rules will help rebuild a \nbetter life for families and for their children. Playing by the rules \nis what the workers did. They played by the rules. They exercised their \nlegal rights, and now there is a complaint filed. I say it is wrong for \nus to interfere in that.\n  Again, if we don't like the law, if we don't like the administrative \nprocedures that undergird this, it can be changed. It can be changed. \nBut I daresay we have had 75 years of the Wagner Act--of this process, \nand I will close on this: Sometimes businesses file a complaint with \nthe NLRB against a union activity, and that is investigated. That goes \nbefore administrative law judges, too. So both sides use this.\n  I think it is unbecoming for us now to try to turn this into some \nkind of a political maelstrom, a political tornado, when it shouldn't \nbe that. Let's let the law and let's let the administrative procedure \ndo its job. Then, if corrective action needs to be taken, then it is \nthe purview of Congress to deal with it at that time. Not now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to \nthe leadership in the Senate of both parties for scheduling a vote \ntoday on Arenda Wright Allen's confirmation for a seat on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  All of us in this body know how important it is to fill the vacancies \non our Federal bench, and particularly when we have highly qualified \nnominees who have no particular issues that need to be discussed in a \npolitical sense, and Virginia is no exception in this matter. The sheer \nvolume of our Federal court workload demands we appoint dedicated, \nqualified jurists.\n  In that regard, Senator Mark Warner and myself were very pleased to \nhave recommended Arenda L. Wright Allen to the President in June of \nlast year for this position on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia. President Obama nominated Arenda Wright Allen \nlast December. She was renominated this year. She was reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee without opposition on March 10 of this year, \nand I believe the President has made an extraordinary choice in \nnominating Ms. Wright Allen.\n  Whenever a vacancy has occurred on the Virginia Federal bench, \nSenator Warner and I have very carefully conducted thorough and \nextensive reviews of candidates for the position. This review process \nincludes interviews and recommendations by the bar associations and in-\nperson interviews with\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\nmany of the candidates. I am proud to say the Virginia candidate pool \nfrom which we had to choose on this particular occasion was excellent. \nIt was deep. It included judges, legal scholars, and skilled trial \nattorneys.\n  From this very competitive field, Senator Warner and I moved for the \nnomination of Ms. Wright Allen. She distinguished herself as the \npremier candidate in a very competitive field for this vacancy.\n  Ms. Wright Allen has displayed during her career the highest degree \nof integrity, competence, and commitment to the rule of law. She \nexemplifies the best of the Virginia Bar and, in fact, received the \nhighest ranking from the Virginia State Bar.\n  As one who was privileged to serve as Secretary of the Navy and also \nas a combat marine, I personally understand the sacrifices that \nveterans have made to their country. Ms. Wright Allen is a veteran of \nthe U.S. Navy. She served for 5 years as an Active-Duty JAG officer, \nand she continued her service as a Reserve JAG officer until her \nretirement from the Navy as a commander in 2005.\n  Her record of military service is excellent. Given the huge military \npresence in the Eastern District of Virginia, I believe this military \nexperience will be valuable to her in her capacity as a Federal judge.\n  Ms. Wright Allen has dedicated her civilian career to serving her \ncommunity, first as a Federal prosecutor and since 2005 as a Federal \npublic defender. Unanimously, prosecutors and defenders who have worked \nwith or have been on the opposing side to Ms. Wright Allen have \nattested to her talent, her dedication, and above all her exceptional \ncharacter. Upon meeting her, it was clear to me she possesses the \ncorrect judicial temperament and dedication to make an excellent judge.\n  I have also had the pleasure of meeting her family and a number of \nher friends. Her dedication to her family, her church, and her \ncommunity is clearly evident. I am proud Virginia has such an exemplary \nindividual to put forward as a Federal district court judge nominee, \nand I urge all my colleagues to support Ms. Wright Allen today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators McCain, \nSessions, Cornyn, Vitter, Wicker, and Inhofe--and probably others \nbefore the end of the day--I am going to introduce legislation called \nthe New START Implementation Act, which I would like to describe \nbriefly. This legislation is nearly identical to a companion bill \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Mr. Turner, the chairman \nof the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. \nHe has been a leader in the House on nuclear and missile defense \nissues. I understand many of the provisions have been included in the \nchairman's mark of the National Defense Authorization Act in the House \nand that the remainder will be introduced as amendments later today at \na full committee level. I specifically wish to thank Chairman Turner \nfor his leadership.\n  Nuclear deterrence issues are among the most complicated and \ntechnical issues that we in the Congress are confronted with, and he \ndeserves full credit for tackling them with vigor and for mastering \nthem so quickly.\n  Similar to the House legislation, it is my hope that the Senate bill \nwill be incorporated into the Senate version of the National Defense \nAct for fiscal year 2012. Let me now explain a little bit why I think \nthis legislation is necessary at this time.\n  I voted against the New START treaty for reasons I have made clear \npreviously on the floor. But I recognize the President's stated \ncommitment to the modernization of our nuclear deterrent is necessary \nand is important and that Congress needs to codify the commitments made \nduring the debate on the New START ratification process as well as the \nagreements the President has indicated through his comments and letters \nto us. This is important for the future, for future Congresses and \nfuture Presidents, because this process is going to take place over a \nperiod of at least 10 to 12 years. Modernization of our nuclear weapons \nfacilities and the strategic delivery systems all will require \ncommitments over the space of another decade or more. Memories fade, \npeople's interpretations may change over time, circumstances change, \nand what we want to make sure of is that over the time period involved \nduring which this modernization process must occur, the understandings \nthat were agreed to at the time of the START treaty ratification will \nbe memorialized in statute and complied with by the Congress and by the \nadministration as time goes on.\n  The five key features of the legislation are these. First, it would \nlink the funding of the administration's 10-year nuclear modernization \nprogram with any U.S. nuclear force reductions during the \nimplementation phase of the treaty. What that means is, as in the later \nyears of the treaty, funding is necessary for the demobilization, the \ndismantling of some of the weapons that are called for to be dismantled \nunder the treaty but that funding is coordinated with the funding for \nthe modernization program which is going on at the same time. It urges \nthe President to stand by the timelines he pledged on warhead \nmodernization in the revised plan he submitted in November of 2010. \nThis is key to ensuring that Congress will support these modernization \nefforts that were deemed necessary in conjunction with the New START \ntreaty.\n  The second thing the bill does is to ensure that nuclear doctrine and \ntargeting guidelines and the New START force levels that the former \nSTRATCOM commander, GEN Kevin Chilton, said were ``exactly what is \nneeded'' are not arbitrarily cut by the administration that seems eager \nnow to go to even lower levels, perhaps even unilaterally, than were \nnegotiated in the START treaty. The President has indicated his desire \nfor a world without nuclear weapons and said he would like to do new \nthings in the future to reduce the numbers of these weapons. We simply \nwant to make certain the guidelines that are militarily necessary \nreference points for the number of weapons we have, the types we have, \nhow they are deployed and so on, are not modified in order to be a \nreason for or an excuse for reducing strategic weapons thereafter.\n  I think this is necessary because the President's National Security \nAdviser said on March 29 that, even as ``we implement New START, we're \nmaking preparations for the next round of nuclear reductions.'' In \ndeveloping options for further reductions, he said: ``We need to \nconsider several factors, such as potential changes in targeting \nrequirements and alert postures that are required for effective \ndeterrence.''\n  We were told the New START force levels were exactly what is needed \nfor deterrence. Yet now the administration may seek to alter deterrence \nrequirements in order to justify further reductions. My view is, the \nadministration cannot use one set of facts to ratify the treaty and \nthen immediately change those facts in order to suit its Global Zero \nagenda. Forty-one Senators made clear in a letter to the President on \nMarch 22 that we expect the administration to consult with Congress \nbefore directing any changes to U.S. nuclear weapons doctrine or \nproposing further strategic nuclear reductions with Russia. No \nconsultations have occurred to date, and we expect that those \nconsultations would occur before any discussions with Russians take \nplace.\n  Third, the legislation would ensure that the triad of strategic \nnuclear delivery systems--that is to say, the bombers, cruise missiles, \nICBMs and ballistic missile submarines--are modernized and that their \nreliability is assessed each year. Even today, we are still uncertain \nabout the administration's plans to modernize the ICBM leg, nor do we \nknow if the new bomber will be nuclear certified upon its deployment. \nFor example, according to an April 22, 2011, press account in the \nGlobal Security Newswire, ``The US Airforce cannot say exactly how much \nit will spend to explore options for modernizing its ICBM fleet, nor \nwhere the money will come from.''\n  Obviously, if we are currently planning the modernization of these \nfleets, but we do not even know where the money is going to come from \nfor the planning, we have a problem that needs to be resolved now \nrather than later.\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nThat is what the third requirement of the legislation would require.\n  Fourth, the bill would affirm that the New START treaty contains no \nlimitation on U.S. missile defense beyond the language in article V, \nsection 3 and that any future agreement with Russia that would attempt \nto limit U.S. missile defenses could only be done by a treaty that \nwould require the Senate's advice and consent. This is no different \nthan what we all talked about on a bipartisan basis when the New START \ntreaty was ratified, but we think these commitments should actually be \ncodified to ensure they are kept.\n  Finally, the bill would counsel against unilateral reductions or \nwithdrawal of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Europe without the \nunanimous approval of NATO's members. Obviously, in NATO, one State \nshould not be permitted to end NATO's successful article V policy, the \npolicy that an attack on one is an attack on the others and will be met \nwith resistance from the other NATO allies.\n  In conclusion, I think this bill should enjoy broad congressional \nsupport, given the fact that it merely builds on what the Senate and \nthe administration agreed to in the New START resolution of \nratification with respect to nuclear modernization and our freedom of \naction to develop and deploy missile defenses. It ensures that a future \nCongress and a future President understand and support the current \ncommitment to nuclear modernization and ensures that there will be no \nfurther limitations on our missile defense efforts.\n  Finally, it builds in vital checks to permit congressional oversight \nof impending activities by the administration that portend significant \nchanges to U.S. nuclear doctrine, further strategic nuclear reductions \nand potential activities with, and possibly concessions to, Russia with \nregard to missile defense and tactical nuclear weapons in Europe--all \nof which might be counter to U.S. security.\n  I will be pleased to add other colleagues as cosponsors to the \nlegislation. As I said, I intend to actually introduce this toward the \nend of the day, and I am sure we will have additional cosponsors by \nthat time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I want to recognize Chairman Leahy and Ranking \nMember Grassley for holding the nomination hearing and reporting this \nnomination by unanimous consent.\n  Senator Webb and I had the privilege of interviewing several \ncandidates to fill this vacancy on the bench. Ms. Wright Allen stood \nout for her exceptional qualifications and impressive record in the \nNorfolk community.\n  She has spent her entire legal career in public service, beginning \nwith her service as a JAG officer in the Navy.\n  She also has the unique perspective of having served as both a \nprosecutor and a public defender. She spent 14 years serving as an \nassistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and 1 year \nin the Western District of Virginia. Today, Ms. Wright Allen is a \nFederal public defender in Norfolk. Without a doubt, her extensive \ntrial experience will go a long way on the bench.\n  While I was considering Ms. Wright Allen's record, I read several \nletters of support for her nomination. In addition, the Virginia State \nBar ranked Ms. Wright Allen as ``highly qualified,'' and she came \n``highly recommended'' by the Virginia Bar Association and the Virginia \nWomen Attorneys Association.\n  I would also be remiss not to mention the historic nature of this \nnomination. Ms. Wright Allen would be the first African-American woman \nto serve as a Federal district court judge in Virginia. I know she will \nserve with distinction and make all Virginians proud.\n  Mr. President, President Obama nominated Ms. Wright Allen in January \nof this year. The time is now to confirm her nomination so that she can \nbegin to serve the people in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  I look forward to casting my vote in support of Ms. Wright Allen's \nnomination and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do \nthe same.\n  I hope the Presiding Officer, who has spent extensive time as a great \nattorney general, lawyer, and attorney of great repute and respect, \nwill be able to join us in this effort.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, I spent some time on the floor \ntalking about the recoverable reserves in the United States of America. \nI was shocked so many Senators--first of all, I was shocked that many \nlistened but more shocked they came up to me and said: We were not \naware we have this opportunity.\n  I have, from the Congressional Research Service, a breakdown of where \nall of it is. I wish to share that breakdown and get it into the \nRecord. I applaud Senator Murkowski and others for trying to open and \nfully develop the resources in the Gulf of Mexico. That is very \nsignificant. I applaud their effort, and I join them in their effort.\n  We need to go further than that because in the Gulf of Mexico are--\nthese are figures of the Congressional Research Service--undiscovered, \ntechnically recoverable resources. Our resources, according to CRS, are \ngreater than any other country in the world in oil, gas, and coal. I am \ngoing to talk just about gas right now because one of the big issues, \nof course, not just with my wife but with others, is the price of gas \nat the pumps.\n  If we look at the undiscovered, technically recoverable resources \njust onshore, in the United States--some actually would be on public \nlands--it is 37.8 billion barrels of oil. Throw in Alaska and that \nwould be 26.6 billion barrels; the Atlantic, 3.8 billion barrels; the \nPacific, 10.5 billion barrels; the Gulf of Mexico, as I already said, \n44.9 billion barrels. The total U.S. endowment--our endowment--of \ntechnically recoverable oil is 162.9 billion barrels.\n  We have talked about this before and talked about the fact that we \nhave all these resources, but our problem is a political problem \nbecause the politicians will not let us reach these reserves. We are \ntalking about the fact that they are hardly able to reach them in the \nAtlantic and the Pacific, and we know what has happened on the North \nSlope, ANWR. We have talked about that for a long time.\n  People do not realize public lands--90 percent--are off-limits, off-\nlimits politically.\n  I have to correct some of the statements some people have made that \nconveniently misrepresented what our\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\nreserves are. Instead of using ``recoverable reserves,'' they use \n``proven reserves.'' That is a technical term. In order to prove a \nreserve, you have to drill and analyze and core and see how much oil \nthere is. Obviously, if we will not let anyone drill, they cannot prove \nit.\n  When they say we only have 2 percent of the world's proven reserves, \nthat is absurd because we have to drill to determine what that is. \nOther countries do not have that problem. We are the only country in \nthe world that does not exploit our own resources.\n  People are going to have to realize that if you want to do something, \nit is such a simple thing to do deal with. It is supply and demand. \nThere is not a person here or a person listening today who has not gone \nthrough the elementary experience in school of learning supply and \ndemand. We have the supply in America and we have the demand. The \npoliticians will not let us exploit our own resources. That is the \nproblem we have. You do not have to overly complicate this issue.\n  It is interesting--and I hate to say it; I am not pointing fingers in \na partisan way--when Democrats and the administration say: We are going \nto tax big oil, they say actually they are going to do away with some \nof the benefits big oil has. They are not benefits. These would be four \nhuge tax increases the Democrats are doing on big oil. That is not big \noil. That is oil, period. I will not go into the details of depletion \nallowances and percentages. It is not important.\n  The point is, they have the same benefit every other manufacturer \nhas, and to single them out and say: We are going to punish big oil, \nall that is going to do is make the price at the pumps skyrocket. It \ngets right back to supply and demand.\n  By the way, those who are trying to use the argument that this \nsomehow is going to produce revenue that is going to be used, I suggest \neven the White House's figures, the maximum revenue generated would be \n$4 billion. Keep in mind, they lose all the benefits, so that is not a \nnet of $4 billion.\n  Take the State of Texas, for example. They do not have an income tax. \nThey have the oil tax that has run that State very well for a long \nperiod of time. Senator Menendez made a statement and said taxing the \noil companies is not going to bring down the price of gas. They are not \neven claiming it will. I just think that when one sees such an obvious \nsolution to the problem--just exploit our own resources--we are very \nfoolish not to do that.\n  We all talk about the solutions to the problem. We talk about the \nspending of this administration, more debt increases in just the first \n2 years of the Obama administration than the entire debt since George \nWashington, in the history of this country, the huge spending, the $5 \ntrillion in the President's three budgets of deficit--I remember coming \ndown and complaining in 1995, at this very podium, when the Clinton \nadministration came out with a budget for fiscal year 1996 and it was \n$1.5 trillion. I said: We cannot sustain that level. Now it is $1.5 \ntrillion in each of the three budgets, just the deficit. That is more \nthan the entire United States of America back in 1996.\n  I suggest that when people say there are only two solutions to this \nproblem, either reduce spending, which would be my choice, or increase \ntaxes, which I would not do, I say there is a third option. That option \nis to do something about the cost of regulation. Right now, if we just \ntake what the EPA is doing in five--in fact, I will say three of the \nmajor overregulations we are going over right now--people in the Senate \nknow we have defeated cap-and-trade legislatively by massive \npercentages five times since 2003. This administration says: If we \ncannot have cap and trade, we are going to do it, not legislatively, we \nwill do it through the EPA. That is what is going on now with \ngreenhouse gases.\n  If you add up what the administration is doing in terms of the cost \nof greenhouse gas regulations, that is between $300 billion and $400 \nbillion; on ozone, if they choose--and they said they are going to \nchoose--the 60-parts-per billion standard, that would be $676 billion; \nthe boiler MACT would be something in excess of $1 billion. Throw in \nutility MACT and cement MACT, it comes to $1 trillion. This is what I \nam trying to get at. I used the figure that for every 1 percent \nincrease in economic activity, it produces new revenue of $42 billion. \nThat has changed. According to the Congressional Research Service--they \nare bipartisan, they are factual--for every 1 percent increase in GDP, \nit produces $50 billion additional revenues.\n  If we just take these regulations and add them up, all the increase \nof costs to GDP of the three regulations I mentioned, that is $1 \ntrillion. If we take the fact it is $14 trillion GDP in a given year, \nthis would be 7 percent of that $14 trillion. For each 1 percent, it \nwould be $50 billion. We could generate new revenue of $350 billion \njust by taking this overregulation out of our society.\n  One can argue: Inhofe, that is not true because these regulations \nhave not passed yet. That is right, so it would probably right now be \nabout half that. When the Obama administration came in and announced \nthese regulations were coming, the manufacturers, the producers, those \nwho are driving the economic ship were the ones who said that because \nof the uncertainty of these regulations, we are going to slow down what \nwe are doing. If we were to lift all these regulations, I assure my \ncolleagues we would be approaching, at least by 1 year, $350 billion. \nThat is without a tax increase. That is without reducing spending.\n  We need to look at this realistically because this is an opportunity \nwe have. A lot of people remember back in the days of Ronald Reagan. I \ncan say the same thing back in the days of President Kennedy. Of \ncourse, he was a Democrat. They felt overregulation and high taxation \nwas an inhibiting factor to slow down revenue. Of course, in the case \nof Ronald Reagan, the total revenue coming from the marginal rates of \n1980 was $244 billion. In 1988, it was $466 billion. That was at a time \nwhen we had the largest reduction of taxes and regulations in this \nsociety. It is shown to be true over the years.\n  My bottom line is this: People know about spending. People know about \ntaxes. They do not know about regulations. The people who are affected \ndirectly--the manufacturers--understand it. The figures I am using are \nactual figures we have gotten with which no one argues. The fact that \n$50 billion of increased revenue comes from each 1 percent increase in \nGDP is a fact that is supported by the CRS.\n  I offer that, along with our opportunity to become totally \nindependent from the Middle East, with regard to our ability to run \nthis machine called America.\n  Before I yield the floor, I see the Senator from Alaska. I hope he \nwas listening to what I was talking about because the opportunities in \nAlaska are tremendous--26.6 billion barrels of oil. I am sure he \nunderstands that. I wish to make sure everybody else does.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2864-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WRIGHT ALLEN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Arenda L. \nWright Allen, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Arenda L. \nWright Allen, of Virginia, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate with respect to the nomination, with the time equally divided \nin the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for scheduling \ntoday's vote on the nomination of Arenda\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\nL. Wright Allen to fill a vacancy on the Federal District Court for the \nEastern District of Virginia. This is the fifth judicial nomination the \nSenate has considered since returning from the Easter recess. I hope \nthis is a sign of progress. Another 11 judicial nominations are pending \non the Senate's Executive Calendar, and with judicial vacancies around \nthe country remaining above 90, we still have a long way to go to \naddress the needs of the Federal judiciary.\n  Arenda Wright Allen's nomination has the strong support of both of \nher home State Senators, Senator Webb and Senator Warner. When she is \nconfirmed, Ms. Wright Allen will become the first African-American \nwoman to serve as a district court judge in Virginia. Her nomination \nwas reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee over a month ago, \nalong with that of another Virginia nominee, Michael Francis Urbanski, \nwho has been nominated to the Western District of Virginia.\n  In her 25-year legal career, Ms. Wright Allen has served as a Federal \ndefense attorney, a Federal prosecutor, and a military attorney. She is \ncurrently a supervisory assistant Federal public defender in the \nEastern District of Virginia having previously served as an assistant \nU.S. attorney and in the U.S. Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps. It \nis vital to have men and women serve as judges who have been \nprosecutors and defense attorneys. This nominee has been both, and I am \nsure her experience will serve her well when she is confirmed.\n  Recently, Republican Senators have tried to twist qualified nominees' \nlitigation experience against them. Their partisan attacks are not \nconsistent. Republicans oppose some nominees by saying that they do not \nhave sufficient litigation experience. When a nominee has extensive \nexperience and is a successful trial lawyer, they reverse themselves \nand complain that the nominee has too much experience and will be \nbiased by it. They opposed Judge McConnell of Rhode Island on this \nsupposed ground. They opposed Judge Chen of California despite his 10 \nyears as a fair and impartial Federal magistrate judge. I hope they \nwill not now oppose Ms. Wright Allen because she served as a Federal \npublic defender. All of these nominees have assured us that they \nunderstand the difference between being an advocate for a client and \nserving as a judge. I have no doubt that they do.\n  With continued cooperation from both sides of the aisle, the Senate \nshould also consider the other 11 judicial nominees ready for final \nSenate action. We should certainly proceed with the judicial nominees \nfor whom there is no opposition and no reason for delay. That would \nallow us to confirm another seven nominees. They have all been \nthoroughly reviewed by the members of the Judiciary Committee and have \nall been recommended to the Senate unanimously. They are Judge \nUrbanski; Clair C. Cecchi to fill a vacancy in New Jersey; Esther Salas \nto fill another vacancy in New Jersey; Paul Oetken and Paul Engelmayer \nto fill vacancies in the Southern District of New York; Ramona Manglona \nto fill a vacancy in the Marianas Islands; and Bernice Donald of \nTennessee, to fill a vacancy on the Sixth Circuit.\n  I also hope that we can soon consider two of the nominees currently \nawaiting a Senate vote who have twice been considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee and have twice been reported with strong bipartisan support, \nfirst last year and again in February. They are Susan Carney of \nConnecticut to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on Second Circuit and \nMichael Simon to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the District \nCourt in Oregon. We should also consider the nomination of Goodwin Liu \nto fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit, a nomination \nwe have reported favorably three times, and the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to fill a judicial vacancy on the DC Circuit, which we \nreported favorably over 2 months ago.\n  All these nominees have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a \ndemonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. They should have an up-\nor-down vote after being considered by the Judiciary Committee and \nwithout additional weeks and months of needless delay.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many, \nand they have persisted for too long. Whereas the Democratic majority \nin the Senate reduced vacancies from 110 to 60 in President Bush's \nfirst 2 years, judicial vacancies still number 91 over 27 months into \nPresident Obama's term. By now, judicial vacancies should have been cut \nin half, but we have barely kept up with attrition. If we join together \nto consider all of the judicial nominations now on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar, we would be able to reduce vacancies to 80 for the \nfirst time since July 2009.\n  Regrettably, the Senate has not reduced vacancies as dramatically as \nwe did during the Bush administration. In fact, the Senate has reversed \ncourse during the Obama administration, with the slow pace of \nconfirmations keeping judicial vacancies at crisis levels. Over the 8 \nyears of the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2009, we reduced \njudicial vacancies from 110 to a low of 34. That has now been reversed, \nwith vacancies staying above 90 since August 2009. The vacancy rate--\nwhich we reduced from 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term \nto 6 percent by this date in President Bush's third year and ultimately \nto less than 4 percent in 2008--is now back to more than 10 percent.\n  We have a long way to go to do as well as we did during President \nBush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial nominations. \nWe confirmed 100 of those judicial nominations during the 17 months I \nwas chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. So far, \nwell into President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only \nbeen allowed to consider 82 of President Obama's Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees, well short of 205.\n  The last 2 weeks are a sign that the Senate can consider these \nnominations. We must work together to ensure that the Federal judiciary \nhas the judges it needs to provide justice to Americans in courts \nthroughout the country. Judicial vacancies throughout the country \nhinder the Federal judiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional \nrole. That is why Chief Justice Roberts, Attorney General Holder, and \nthe President of the United States have spoken out and urged the Senate \nto act.\n  I congratulate Ms. Wright Allen and her family on her confirmation \ntoday.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that the time be counted against the Democratic \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Energy Security\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, \nabsolutely, I am aware of the quantity and value of Alaska oil and gas \ntoday. I rise to discuss this issue, as well as a few others related to \nthe issues of oil and gas.\n  I rise to discuss an issue foremost on the minds of my constituents \nand a concern to all Americans: the rising cost of energy. I wish to \noutline the proposals aimed at providing short-term relief for high \nprices at the pump and to ensure America's long-term energy security. \nThese are the issues which have been discussed many times in this \nChamber. The time for talk has passed. The time to act is now. High \nenergy prices today already are pinching the pocketbooks of families \nand crippling our small businesses across my State and across this \ncountry.\n  When I was home over the recess, I visited the roaded areas of \nAlaska. These are communities connected by our highway road system, \nfrom Kenai Peninsula to Fairbanks, where gas prices are well over $4 a \ngallon. As one can see on the poster next to me, they range from $4.15 \nto $4.45 a gallon. These prices might look good to some of my \ncolleagues who saw gas prices over $5 a gallon in their States, but off \nthe road system in Alaska prices are much higher. The fact is prices \nfor gasoline and home heating oil never came down in rural Alaska. They \nhave been well over $5 a gallon for years. Some places, such as \nAnaktuvuk Pass are nearly $10 a gallon.\n  I started a discussion with Alaskans on Facebook to just see how \nthese high prices are affecting their budgets.\n  Some families are already facing tough choices to make their budgets \nbalance. For families commuting into Anchorage from the Mat-Su Valley \nevery day, they are forced to pay more than $100 a week to fuel up. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\nmore than a pocketbook pinch, it is a punch.\n  Even worse, families know the price isn't coming down anytime soon. \nEven though speculation ranges all over the place, prices are expected \nto rise still another 30 to 40 cents by July.\n  Mr. President, families know the price of fuel is not coming down \nanytime soon. As I mentioned, it is continuing to rise. It is not just \naffecting families but businesses. They feel the sticker shock also at \nthe pump. We are seeing businesses through rising food and delivery \nprices making up the difference. These families and businesses expect \nus to act now. No more excuses.\n  Energy is one place where we should be able to find bipartisan common \nground. I have been calling for a comprehensive energy bill from day \none in the Senate. Our lack of progress is frustrating. We were real \nclose last spring, but now here we are again.\n  We need to provide Americans with reliable and affordable energy in \nthree ways: short-term relief for consumers, new renewable energy \nsources for reliable electricity prices and keep strong investment in \nalternative transportation systems, and increase domestic oil and gas \nproduction so we are not dependent on unfriendly foreign sources.\n  First, the short term, which I call the pocketbook relief. We must \nhelp families keep their budgets balanced and help ensure that \nincreasing consumer confidence doesn't falter. To do that, I have \nintroduced the Family Account to Save on Transportation--or the FAST \nAct--to help families get through high gas prices over the next 2 \nyears.\n  This bill will allow us to set up pretax transportation savings \naccounts--just like medical savings accounts--to help offset the pain \nof high gas prices on the family pocketbook. The bill would sunset in 2 \nyears, so it would have no long-term burden on the Federal budget.\n  Second, we have to bring online alternative power sources to buffer \npower companies from price shocks of rising oil and gas prices. No \nmatter where you are in Alaska, you don't have to go far to find \nalternative energy sources--wind, tidal, geothermal, and hydro. Even in \nthese tough budget times, this is a good investment to strengthen our \neconomy far into the future.\n  The same is true for alternative transportation systems and fuels. We \nmust fully support efforts to develop electric, hybrid, and highly \nefficient vehicles. At the same time we must recognize most working \nfamilies cannot afford to purchase a new vehicle. So we need to find \nother ways to reduce their transportation costs, such as greater \ninvestment in city-to-city commuter services.\n  The recent investment in high-speed rail is positive but is not \nreaching most of the country, and will not. Even in Alaska we have the \npotential for commuter rail. It is critical to move commuters from city \nto city and cut the $100-a-week gas prices folks from Mat-Su pay as \nthey drive into Anchorage for employment.\n  Solving our energy security challenge cannot just focus on reducing \nconsumption. Yes, it is important. But we must cut the use of fossil \nfuels in all sectors--as identified through consumption, especially \ntransportation--but we also need to increase our domestic production.\n  Every new oil and gas development buys our country more energy and \nnational security while also creating American jobs. Unfortunately, we \nare going in the wrong direction. Thirty years ago, 28 percent of our \noil was imported; today it is 60 percent.\n  While our largest share of oil imports comes from Canada, too much is \ncoming from unstable countries or those openly hostile to the United \nStates. Not only will we become increasingly dependent on these \ncountries for our oil, we are exporting over $1 billion a day. Let me \nrepeat that: We export $1 billion a day.\n  In my home State of Alaska we have vast potential to increase \nAmerica's energy security. The fact is, developing Alaska's oil and gas \nresources buys our country decades of energy security by offsetting \nforeign imports from unfriendly countries.\n  Consider a few examples which I have reflected on the board next to \nme.\n  Developing offshore resources in the Chukchi and the Beaufort Sea \nwill produce 1.8 million barrels of oil a day. This is easily enough to \noffset oil imports from Saudi Arabia. We could even cover Iraq too. \nDeveloping the oil beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, \ncould offset imports from Nigeria. Developing the CD-5 project in the \nNational Petroleum Reserve-Alaska--the National Petroleum Reserve-\nAlaska, set up for petroleum products and production--and BP's Liberty \nproject could replace daily imports from Libya.\n  This does not even include the tremendous onshore and offshore \nnatural gas resources we have in Alaska. One-third of the country's \nsupply is in Alaska. So why aren't we developing these enormous \nresources in my State? Two words: politics, bureaucrats.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year President Obama went to Brazil where \nhe declared that America wants to be a customer for Brazilian oil and \nnatural gas. I have to say, we don't need to go to Brazil to do that. \nWe can do it right here in Alaska, with our people, our resources and \nour opportunities. I reminded the President of that, and I will remind \nhim on a regular basis. To his credit, I will say later in the month he \ndid mention Alaska. In his call for energy and domestic energy \nindependence, he mentioned Alaska.\n  Unfortunately, the bureaucrats in his administration are not \nlistening. They are tossing up barriers to additional Alaskan oil and \ngas production every chance they get. Sadly, some of my colleagues in \nthis body are not much better. Instead of addressing the problem with \nspecific solutions, they are going for headlines by dragging energy \ncompany executives before committees or proposing the rollback of \nincentives for increased domestic energy production, some of which have \nbeen on the books for decades.\n  Let's stop the headline grabbing and get serious about energy \nsecurity. I have three ideas: First, better coordinate the Federal \noffshore permitting process. I introduced legislation before our recess \nto create the Arctic OCS Coordinator, modeled after legislation the \nlate Senator Ted Stevens passed establishing a Federal gas pipeline \ncoordinator. My bill addresses the problem too many projects are caught \nup in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Too many projects are caught up in what I call the \n``regulatory whack-a-mole.'' You think you have smacked down one \nregulatory hurdle and another one pops up. My bill would give authority \nto work across the agencies causing companies so much heartburn today--\nthe EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of the \nInterior, just to name a few.\n  Second, let's align the clean air standards for offshore drilling \npermits among the affected Federal agencies. We must have a level \nplaying field whether you are in Alaska or the Gulf of Mexico or the \nEastern United States.\n  As my colleague from Louisiana knows--who is here joining me on the \nfloor--Louisiana has one rule, and Alaska has another rule for the same \nissue.\n  Third, let's invest in American transportation and safety \ninfrastructure to develop oil and gas resources in frontier areas. The \nfact is, we need a far greater Coast Guard presence in the Arctic for \noilspill prevention and response.\n  We also need to invest in our pipeline infrastructure, including the \nAlaskan Natural Gasoline, to move oil and gas resources from the Arctic \nto other U.S. regions.\n  There is a lot of talk right now about ending tax incentives for the \noil and gas industry. With the high profits right now, these companies \nare easy targets. But one thing every Alaskan knows--just because you \nhave an easy target doesn't mean it is the right thing to shoot. It \nwould not decrease gas prices at the pump for our families and our \nsmall businesses. It will discourage companies, especially the \nindependents, from domestic investment and job creation.\n  As someone who represents a State with the highest energy prices in \nthe country, and some of the best renewable and traditional energy \nresources, I am ready to join my colleagues on both\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nsides of the aisle to address America's energy needs now. We need to \nset a hard target. That is why I am asking my colleagues to get serious \nabout a real energy plan and give Americans freedom from high gas \nprices by the Fourth of July.\n  Let's work together, roll up our sleeves and pass a real \ncomprehensive energy plan our families and our small businesses can get \nbehind. Let's finally invest in our energy future and put the reforms \nin place for our long-term energy security.\n  Mr. President, I recognize my colleague from Louisiana--another great \nState for oil and gas development--is on the floor with me, and I yield \nthe floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for \nasking me to join him in a general presentation and potential colloquy \nbetween the two of us about the importance of continuing our support \nfor oil and gas production in the United States by the large \ninternational companies that have operated in our country and around \nthe world now for many years, as well as by the hundreds, if not \nthousands, of independents that operate doing the same.\n  There is going to be a bill that will be debated in the Senate \nFinance Committee tomorrow. It is S. 940, sponsored by the Senator from \nNew Jersey, our colleague, Senator Menendez. I want to go on record in \nstrongly opposing it, and I will give some reasons why, and I urge my \ncolleagues, when this bill comes up--which I understand it will come \ndirectly to the floor of the Senate without being heard, as is \ntradition, in the committee--to vote it down.\n  I doubt the bill, in its current form--or in any form that it could \nbe modified--can get the 60 votes necessary for passage, but I would \nlike to add my strong voice in urging my colleagues to read this bill, \nto look at it and understand the inherent unfairness in it, the lack of \nsignificant deficit reduction, and the fact that it will not--although \nit is being touted to do so--reduce gasoline prices by one penny.\n  Mr. President, I want to start with some facts that people might find \nvery interesting, or hard to believe, based on the political rhetoric \nthey have been hearing from the sponsors of this bill and others in the \nSenate. The story line goes something like this: Big oil makes huge \nprofits at the expense of everyone. They pay virtually nothing in \ntaxes, and we subsidize them. Why are we doing this? Why don't we stop?\n  I think it would be good to get a few things clarified for the \nrecord. It may be surprising to American taxpayers to know that of the \n$16.6 billion spent on U.S. energy subsidies over the course of 1 year, \noil and gas subsidies account for less than 13 percent. I want to say \nthat again. Of the $16.6 billion spent on U.S. energy subsidies over \nthe course of 1 year, fuels such as renewables, refined coal, nuclear, \nsolar, hydro, et cetera, account for 85 percent. Oil and gas is less \nthan 15 percent--actually, 13 percent.\n  Now, you would think because of this bill, S. 940, that big oil and \ngas companies are getting all the subsidies, making all the profits, \npaying no taxes, and the rest of us are suffering. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  Let me repeat: This bill, S. 940, is going to repeal virtually all \nsubsidies from one industry, and one sector of one industry--oil and \ngas companies--but they only get 13 percent of all the energy \nsubsidies.\n  Why aren't we talking about the other 85 percent? Some of them--in \nsome people's minds--create some harm to the environment, whether it be \ndams blocking up rivers so fisheries are extinct or whether it is coal \nthat has its own issues. Of course nuclear doesn't have any problems. \nWe must not be paying attention to what is happening in Japan. Why are \nwe singling out one sector of one part of the energy industry to repeal \nthe subsidies when it will, in fact, have the opposite effect of \nreducing gasoline prices? Even one of its cosponsors said publicly for \nus not to be fooled, this will not reduce gasoline prices. Why are we \ndoing it? Will it create jobs? No. It will actually hurt job production \nin the United States.\n\n  According to the EIA study--which is the U.S. Government, not a \ncompany--published in 2008, the oil and natural gas industry received \n13 percent of the subsidies while producing 60 percent of the energy. \nLet me repeat. This industry got only 13 percent of the subsidies but \nproduced 60 percent of the energy. But the bill, S. 940, is going to be \ndebated in the Finance Committee where the industry leaders are going \nto be called to talk about this gimmick, 940, but the oil and gas \nindustry, with their independent counterparts, produced 60 percent of \nthe energy.\n  I would like to say where exactly that energy comes from because it \nreally is a bone of contention. The Senator from Alaska will appreciate \nthis. The sponsor of this bill represents a State that is one of the \nhighest deficit energy-producing States in the Nation because some of \nus do this better than others. Louisiana produces a lot of energy. \nAlaska produces a lot of energy. Texas produces a lot of energy.\n  Some States like to consume a lot and produce nothing. That would be \nlike some of our States that put some of their land in agriculture so \nthey can produce food--other States saying: We don't want to produce \nfood, but we expect you to provide it to us--provide it to us when we \nwant it, how we want it, and for the price we want it. And I am tired \nof it, and so are the people I represent.\n  I want to put this deficit chart up here. We have seen a lot of \ndeficit charts about deficits of infrastructure, real deficits of \nmoney, debt. Let me talk to you about the deficit and the debt owed by \nsome States in this Union that consume a lot, talk a lot, and produce \nnothing.\n  California has the greatest deficit. It consumes a tremendous amount \nof energy, and the imbalance is the highest. It produces the least, \nconsumes the most. To California's benefit, before Senators Feinstein \nand Boxer run down here to argue this point, I want to concede this one \npoint: California has been on the forefront of energy conservation and \nefficiency. This chart does not recognize them for that, but I will \nconcede that point, and I am going to have some further data to explain \nthat. California, while it doesn't produce a lot of energy--it consumes \na tremendous amount--at least California has been in the forefront of \nsavings and efficiency because there are a lot of States up here that \ndon't produce, don't conserve, are not efficient, and all they want to \ndo is yell about high gas prices. Why don't you do something about it?\n  Florida is a perfect example. Florida has a net deficit in Btu's. I \nguess it is 3.889 billion. Florida is a great example. I don't think \nFlorida does much in nuclear. I don't think they do much in hydro. They \nhave a lot of Sun; I don't know how much solar they are doing. They \nwill not let anybody produce oil and gas on or off their shores, but \nthey sure fill up a lot of their gas tanks every day. They sure fire up \nthose hotels and those restaurants with that energy. Where do they get \ntheir energy from? If it weren't so serious, it would be laughable. \nThey have a gas line that goes from Mobile, AL, to the Florida \npeninsula. We pump the gas out of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, \nput it in a pipeline, and ship it under the Gulf of Mexico so they can \nlight up their State. Would they ever think of putting in an oil and \ngas well or building a nuclear powerplant? If they can't do that, why \ndon't they conserve their energy?\n  New York is another user of energy which produces very little; Ohio, \nGeorgia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Michigan, and Illinois. Some of \nthese States, such as New Jersey and Michigan--think about what they \nlook like. They have big factories, they have big industries. Michigan \nis home to the automobile industry, so they use a lot of gas in \nproducing things we all use, so we want to give them credit for that. \nBut still the fact remains that Michigan uses a lot more energy than it \nproduces.\n  Then you get down here to what I call the gold-star States.\n  We get criticized so much, we are treated like we are some sort of \npariah sometimes, but I think we do a great job--Kentucky, Alaska, New \nMexico, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Alaska is up here \nsomewhere--Alaska is right here. Kentucky, Alaska, New Mexico, \nLouisiana, West Virginia, and Wyoming. We produce enough energy for \neverybody in our State, what we need, and we export it to everyone else \nin America who needs\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nit. And what do we get? We get bills like this that go after, directly, \nthe big companies in our State, that work in our State, to somehow put \nthem in a position to make them feel as if they are not really good \ncompanies, they are not American companies, they don't pay tax, they \nget all these subsidies. I am going to read into the record what taxes \nthey pay. It is going to surprise you. Then, on top of that, we get \nmoratoriums, we get permatoriums. We can't even drill for the oil we \nhave. We can't even look for the oil we might have.\n  When I go home, my people ask me--and it is a very hard thing for me \nto answer, and maybe they ask Senator Begich the same thing--they say: \nSenator, since we do so much to produce energy for the country, why do \nwe pay $4 a gallon for gasoline and sometimes we pay a little bit more \nthan everybody else? They don't produce anything, Senator. Why do we \npay so much?\n  Can the Senator tell me what he answers his people because I don't \nknow what to tell them other than this place is a little screwed up. \nUntil I get an answer for that, and I will ask the Senator--go ahead, \nwhat do you tell them?\n  Mr. BEGICH. That is a hard one to answer because they see the oil \nflowing. As I mentioned, we have $10-a-gallon gas in some of our \ncommunities--$10 a gallon. So it is hard to explain that, yes, we are \nthe big producer, but the rest of the country then picks on us.\n  I am just listening, and it is unbelievable, the green slice you have \nthere.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I say to the Senator, because he raises an excellent \npoint, President Obama is not the first President to go overseas and \nask them to produce more oil to send it to us. This goes on--President \nClinton did it. President Bush did it. We beg Saudi Arabia to produce \nmore energy. We ask OPEC to please don't tighten it so much so our \nprices--why don't you go to the local OPEC or the local producers, \nwhich are Kentucky, Alaska, New Mexico, West Virginia, Louisiana, and \nWyoming? Why don't you help us produce more, because we can do it. But \nwe get shut down by bureaucracy, moratoriums, permatoriums, rules, \nregulations, EPA, refuges. We can't even get free to produce the energy \nthat we can produce for this country. Then you have all these middle \nStates that do a fairly good job on balance.\n  But I tell you, if we passed a law here that said every State in \nAmerica had to produce the energy it needed, we would have an energy \npolicy all right, Senator Begich knows. I don't know what it would be, \nbut it would be an interesting rule, you know, just like in the old \ndays--if you wanted food, you produced it. It would be a great law. \nEvery State in America, all 50, if you consume energy, you need to \nproduce something. You could produce it by wind; you could produce it \nby hydro; you could produce it by nuclear; you could stop driving your \nautomobiles and have everybody walk; you could give everybody a \nbicycle. We don't care. Just eliminate the energy deficit. That would \nbe a very interesting discussion to have, and I might even file a bill \nlike that because this one is so ridiculous, people might actually read \nthe one I would file.\n  Let me give a couple of other stats, and then I know I am exceeding \nmy time. I want to ask for 2 more minutes. I want to put to rest this \nissue that the big oil companies don't pay any taxes.\n  This is from Forbes magazine, so take it as it is. It is slanted \ntoward industry, I give you that. It is not left of center, it is right \nof center, sometimes very right, but I think you can check these \nfigures with anybody else. I am assuming they are accurate. This is for \nthe top 20 most profitable U.S. corporations in 2010.\n  ExxonMobil's net income was $30 billion. Their tax rate was not 10 \npercent, not 15 percent, not 25 percent, not 35 percent--a 45-percent \ntax rate. Their estimated worldwide tax bill was $90 billion. Of $10 \nbillion in total taxes paid in the United States, $3 billion was income \ntax. Let's go on. ConocoPhillips' tax rate was 42 percent; pre-income \ntax, $19.8 billion; net, $11.4; tax rate, 42. Chevron was 40 percent.\n  So let's review: Exxon, 45 percent; Conoco, 42; and Chevron, 40. Do \nyou want to know what Google was? Google is a pretty big company. They \ndon't produce oil and gas. They have another line of business. Their \ntax rate was only 21 percent.\n  Let's take Hewlett-Packard--not in my State, in other parts of the \ncountry. Their headquarters is not in the South. Their tax rate was 20 \npercent. Apple Computer's tax rate was 24 percent.\n  People will say: It is not just the rate; it is what you paid. But I \nthink if you look--Coca-Cola, very big company, their tax rate was down \nto 16.7 percent.\n  Does this make sense? No. So that is why we need tax reform, \nsignificant transformational tax reform, so all big companies pay \nsimilar in taxes and we eliminate some of these loopholes that don't \nmake sense. I could be for that. I could be for that when we are \ntalking about Google, Apple, GM, GE, ExxonMobil, and Chevron. But if \nyou are going to ask me to stand here and pick on one industry that \npays billions of dollars in taxes, that only gets 13 percent of the \nenergy subsidies, that hires--350,000 people in my State are hired by \noil and gas companies or their contractors or affiliates, large and \nsmall, not just the large. And when I see what our people produce and \nthese States produce nothing, or virtually nothing, and you ask me can \nI vote for a bill like this? No. Not only can I not vote for it, it is \nlaughable.\n  I hope the Senator from Alaska and I--I know we are going to be the \nskunks at the garden party because, as Democrats, to be against this \nbill, it is going to be because we just have to coddle this industry. I \ndon't coddle this industry. I am holding BP's feet to the fire. I want \nExxon to pay the tax they owe. I want Chevron to pay the tax they owe. \nI want this President and this administration to stop the moratorium \nand the permatorium in the gulf. I want to get our people back to work.\n  I would much love to reduce gasoline prices, and one way we could do \nit is if cars did not have to be so dependent on gasoline. Why don't we \ngive a significant subsidy to produce different kinds of automobiles? I \nwould vote for that. I have voted for that. If you had a car right now \nrunning on natural gas, you would be paying the equivalent of $2 a \ngallon for gasoline at the pump. That is much better, I say to the \nSenator, than $10. Why don't we take some money and invest in natural \ngas vehicles or more incentive for electric vehicles? If people are \nreally serious about breaking the back of OPEC, then start building the \nkinds of automobiles and infrastructure in this country necessary to do \nit and stop introducing gimmicks such as this that might get you a few \npolitical points in the short run, but it is not leading us in the \nright direction.\n  Having beat up on the Democrats, let me say something about the \nRepublican side.\n  All they want to talk about is drill, drill, drill. We cannot drill \nour way out of the situation we are in. Do I want to drill more? Yes. \nDo I think there is more than 2 percent of the world's oil and gas in \nAmerica? Yes. But you know what? You have to look for it in order to \nfind it.\n  We are under certain provisions--the Senator knows in Alaska, we \ncannot even go look for the oil and gas we might have. The Senator \nmight want to talk about that, and I am going to close in a minute.\n  Mr. BEGICH. To the Senator from Louisiana, let me say, when you \ndescribe the moratorium or whatever they call it in the gulf, it is \neven worse in the Arctic, or even on, as I mentioned when I had the map \nand I showed the National Petroleum Reserve. That is not a name picked \nout of the sky by the industry. That was set aside by the government to \nprepare our country for more energy independence decades ago.\n  We cannot even get a permit to go across--in some places, they call \nit a stream. But everyone else now calls it a big river. It is not. It \nis a very small area. But a bridge to go over to explore for what you \ndescribed--we cannot even get onto the land the government set aside \nthat would then determine if we have oil and gas. We believe there is, \nbecause obviously they have--it is set aside as the National Petroleum \nReserve.\n  But the other piece to this--the Senator hammered away on it and I \nagree with her--if we are skunks at the garden, so be it, because it is \na question of\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\nfairness. As the Senator described the 13 percent of the subsidies or \nincentives they receive, they produce 60 percent of the energy. But her \nother statistic is even more dramatic.\n  Of the remaining 87 percent of those subsidies, they only produce 40 \npercent of the energy. If this were a business, you would eliminate \nthat part of the equation because it does not give a good return on \ninvestment. But we are still doing that, because there is a lot of \npolitics being played.\n  The point on the tax issue. Like the Senator, I think there should be \nan overhaul to this tax system. But picking on one industry because it \nsounds good, rates good in the polls, gets you a couple of headlines, \nis not what the American people want us to do here. If anything, they \nare getting fed up with that.\n  What they want us to do is sit down and, as you have described so \neloquently in the description of the country, you bet, I would love \nevery State to do it, produce. Then they would see what we go through. \nBecause we are a collective group of States, we do our part, but we \nshould not be picked up because we do more than our share, because we \nare trying to help out States that are producing vehicles or producing, \nyou know, a lot of chemical industry, and other things, or the \npharmaceutical industry. We can go through those lists that somehow do \nnot end up on these, getting rid of their subsidies.\n  Your point is right on. If there is anything we should be doing right \nnow--I agree with the Senator--it is the issue of--when I open the \npaper and I see administration officials, current and past, saying the \nway we are going to control our energy cost is talk to Saudi Arabia. Is \nthat our energy policy? Because that sure the heck is one that, one, \ndoes not create one job here; two, is the worst national policy from a \nnational security perspective; and, three, it is foolish, as I \nmentioned earlier, that we export $1 billion a day out of this country \nto buy from countries--and in some cases good allies. Canada is a good \nexample. Some of these countries are not our friends, but we are giving \nthem cash so they can then use it against us. It does not make any \nsense. You are right, this piece of legislation they have put down \nwithout a committee process on it is a gimmick; a gimmick to get the \nnext week of activity, get some press out there. But we have to be \nserious.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding for me to rant a little bit. I am \nglad you said the part too, the assumption is that these companies pay \nno taxes, that somehow they get the subsidies and they pay nothing. You \nbet you they are profitable. They are big companies. They are huge \ncompanies. But they pay taxes in the billions to the Treasury of this \ngovernment. When you listed out all of those differential rates, that \nis again why we need tax reform. Then I am happy to have this \ndiscussion, but not singling out an industry because it is a good \npolitical score and good fodder for the newsprint and everything else. \nI appreciate the Senator yielding me a few more minutes to ramble there \na little bit.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. I wish to ask the Senator a final \npoint. We are going to hear tomorrow speeches given about America is at \nthe highest production levels ever. That may be true. But it is true \nfor a very short period of time--maybe the next month or two--because \nas you can see, there is going to be a precipitous fall. Why? Because \nof the Deepwater Horizon, the shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Even \nthough people say we are at the highest production levels we ever have \nbeen, it is going to be temporary. Then the production levels are going \nto decline down to the lowest level since 1997.\n  I want people to understand, we are not on a path to produce more in \nAmerica. We are on a path to produce less. And taking all subsidies \naway from the five major international oil companies is not going to \nchange this line. It is going to make it continue to go down. It is not \ngoing to reduce the price of gasoline at the pump, not by one penny. It \nis not going to get us on the path to a strong, sound energy policy.\n  I will say in conclusion, should some of these subsidies and tax \ncredits be looked at? Yes, in a comprehensive format. And I will say, I \nwill be open to the ones that are the least effective, the least \nnecessary, and are fairly applied across companies such as Google, \nAT, GE, and other companies. I will be happy to do my part. People in \nLouisiana will do our part.\n  But we are not, along with Texas and Oklahoma and Alaska, going to \ntake it all on our shoulders. We have had enough. We have had high \nwater. We have had high wind. We now have a high river. We have a \nmoratorium. We have a permitatorium, and now we have no more subsidies.\n  At least they left the independents out. I want to thank them for not \nputting independent oil and gas companies in this bill. But still, the \nbig five pay a significant amount of tax. They take a smaller \npercentage of the overall subsidy. I think we need to do this in a \nfairer way.\n  I am yielding my time.\n  Mr. BEGICH. If I can make one last comment, the chart that you have \nup there, there is one other piece on there. It is the Alaska oil \npipeline. We are at a little over 600,000 barrels a day going through \nthere. We are losing 6 to 7 percent a year in volume, and it will not \nbe a question--somebody will say: Well, you will get down to zero and \nthen you will stop the pipeline. No. No. When we get down to a level of \n300,000 or 400,000 barrels, then it will be questionable if we can even \nrun the line. Then you can actually potentially shut off the whole \nvolume. So the chart there is important because we have to look at the \nlong term. Because if we decide today to have a comprehensive energy \nplan that includes conservation, alternative energy, renewable energy \nand, yes, domestic production, the Senator from Louisiana knows, as I \nknow, you cannot walk down the street and say, we are going to start \ndrilling tomorrow and suddenly, voila, there is fuel. It is a 7- to 10-\nyear process. So that chart is a critical chart, because in order to \nreach that decline, you have to start doing something today. Unless we \ndecide the policy of this country, what the energy policy of this \ncountry is, we will pick up the phone and we will call Saudi Arabia, \nNigeria, Iraq, Iran, Libya--that is the list, that is our policy--then \nso be it. I think that is the worst policy we could have ever for this \ncountry.\n  Again, thank you to the Senator from Louisiana. Again, if we are \nskunks at the garden, my view is we will be good-smelling skunks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate continues its very \nrapid pace to confirm another of President Obama's judicial nominees. \nThe Judiciary Committee's workload has not slowed since this Congress \nconvened. I am pleased to report we are ahead of the pace of the 108th \nCongress. With this vote, the Senate will have confirmed 22 nominees in \njust 47 days. That is a rate of one judge almost every other day of \nSenate session. We have confirmed 32 percent of President Obama's \njudicial nominees this Congress compared to only 29 percent of \nPresident Bush's confirmed during the same time period.\n  We have also reported out of committee another 11 nominees. We have \nreported out of committee 46 percent of President Obama's nominees sent \nto the Senate this year. That exceeds the 38 percent of President \nBush's nominees reported out during a comparable period.\n  Furthermore, we have held hearings on 10 nominees. Some of those, I \nexpect, will be reported out of committee at our markup scheduled for \ntomorrow. In total, we have taken positive action on 43 of 71 judicial \nnominees submitted this Congress or approximately 61 percent of all \nnominees. I hope these facts will put to rest, once and for all, any \ncomplaints that we are delaying or obstructing judicial nominees.\n  There are currently 89 vacancies before the courts. Yet the President \nhas not sent nominees for 51 percent of those vacancies. He has, \nhowever, sent the Senate four nominees for seats which are not yet \nvacant. This is perplexing to me since the current vacancy rate is 10 \npercent. I would think\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\nthe White House would concentrate on current vacancies. Nevertheless, \nwe simply cannot confirm nominees who do not exist.\n  I have a few remarks regarding the nomination we are voting on \ntoday--Arenda Lauretta Wright Allen, who is nominated to be U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. Mrs. Allen \nreceived her B.A. from Kutztown State College in 1982 and her juris \ndoctorate from North Carolina Central University School of Law in 1985. \nFollowing law school, she was commissioned into the U.S. Navy as an \nensign. She served there as legal intern in the Naval Legal Service, \nOffice of Judge Advocate General's Corps. In the same year, she was \npromoted to lieutenant and became a defense attorney for the Navy. In \n1988, the nominee became the staff judge advocate at the Naval Air and \nEngineering Center, where she was the sole legal advisor to the \ncommanding officer.\n  Leaving the Navy in 1990, Mrs. Allen joined the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the Western District of Virginia as an assistant U.S. \nattorney. In 1991, she moved to the Eastern District of Virginia, where \nshe remained for the next 15 years as an assistant U.S. attorney. In \n2005, the nominee left the U.S. Attorney's Office to become an \nassistant Federal public defender with the Federal Public Defender's \nOffice for the Eastern District of Virginia. The American Bar \nAssociation Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has given her \nthe rating of majority ``qualified'', minority ``well qualified.''\n  I congratulate the nominee and her achievement and public service. I \nurge my colleagues to support this nomination. Hopefully, it will be \nsupported unanimously.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I understand we are in the time of our Republican \ncolleagues, so I would just indicate that if we have a Republican who \ncomes to the floor during that time, I will certainly be glad to stop \nand yield to them.\n\n\n                        Gas Prices--Paying Twice\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about something that is incredibly \nimportant to the families and businesses of Michigan--I am sure it is \ntrue in Pennsylvania as well--and that is the great concern about what \nis happening in terms of gas prices going through the roof right now. \nWe have families that are paying as much for gasoline at the pump as \nthey are paying for their health care and almost as much as they are \npaying for groceries right now to put food on the table for their \nfamilies.\n  What adds insult to injury is that we are seeing an industry, the top \nfive companies with the highest profits ever, also receiving taxpayer \nsubsidies. So we pay twice. We pay at the pump in outrageous prices, \nand we pay again when we are paying as taxpayers to support an industry \nthat clearly does not need to be subsidized.\n  We are involved in a major debate right now about what to do about a \nvery large deficit. I was here when we balanced the budget in 1997, \nwhen I was in the House, and I was proud to do that. I was here when we \nhad the largest surplus in the history of the country. In 2001, a \nnumber of things happened, including policy decisions that put us back \ninto a deficit. So we have to dig out again, and it is very serious.\n  So the question is, What are our priorities? Our Republican \ncolleagues in the House have said their priority is to eliminate \nMedicare as we know it--eliminate Medicare and balance the budget on \nthe backs of tens of millions of seniors in our country. In the Senate \nwe are saying: Wait a minute. Let's start with taxpayer subsidies, some \nof which have gone on for 70 or 80 years that are now being given to an \nindustry that is the most profitable in our country and probably the \nworld and that clearly do not need taxpayer subsidies. Why don't we \nstart there. By the way, let's make sure we are sending a clear message \nthat we don't appreciate paying twice. We don't appreciate paying at \nthe pump and at the same time paying through our taxpayer dollars.\n  When we look at the numbers, just in the first quarter of this year, \nit is staggering. We certainly don't begrudge industry profits, \nalthough with the gas prices going up, what we are talking about now \nare consumers getting gouged in the face of these numbers. But we are \ntalking about $35.8 billion in total profits in just 3 months for the \ntop five oil companies in America. These folks are asking us to \nsubsidize them on top of that. So our message, and what we will be \nvoting on next week, is a message that says: That check for $4 billion \na year, we are going to void it. We are done with that--no more \ntaxpayer subsidies for an industry that clearly does not need it.\n  What we need to be doing are a couple things. First of all, we need \nto create real competition at the pump. We need to create competition \nthat maybe doesn't require a pump or at least not very often. In my \ngreat State of Michigan, we are making new, terrific, award-winning \nautomobiles that are electric vehicles--the Chevy Volt, the Ford Focus, \nother hybrids--that are winning awards, top-quality vehicles that are \ngoing 100 miles or 200 miles on a gallon of gas. Real competition is \nwhat we need, investing in alternative vehicles, alternative fuel \nvehicles for the future, including jobs. I am very excited about the \nannouncements being made now--in fact, on Friday by General Motors \nabout expanding their operations--and to see what Chrysler and Ford are \ndoing is very exciting. It is jobs for us, and it is real competition \nfor the oil companies that know right now the only choice we have is to \npay whatever price they put up at the pump.\n  We have begun to create some other choices, and we need to continue \nto support those. I find it so interesting that we are going to be \ndebating shortly whether to support ethanol and EA5 and the ability to \ncreate some alternative to gasoline at the pump. There will be those \nwho will argue: Well, we have supported them for a few years now. They \nare a maturing industry. They no longer need support; that is, maybe 5 \nyears, 6 years, 8 years, 10 years. We are talking 70 or 80 years, a \nsubsidy that is now going to the largest, most profitable companies in \nour country and probably the world. Yet because of sheer politics and \nnothing else, we have not been able to get these subsidies stopped.\n  Taxpayers in our country are saying we need to make better choices to \nbalance the budget. We need to decide what is important, what is not \nimportant, and we need to cut the things that are not important. \nClearly, subsidizing the top five big oil companies in this country is \nnot a priority when they are making huge profits. We should be \ninvesting in what will, first of all, bring down the debt because we \nare taking away this $4 billion and using it to pay down the debt. We \nshould then make choices about how we do create jobs and create \nalternatives in clean energy manufacturing, alternative fuel vehicles, \nwhether it is advanced biofuels, natural gas, clean diesel, electric \nvehicles. We have a lot of choices we need to present to consumers so \nthey can get off the price-gouging efforts that are going on at the \npump.\n  There is another issue as well. We have heard from the companies that \nthey need to be able to drill more. Yet at the same time, we know there \nare 60 million acres under lease by the oil companies. They hold on to \n60 million acres right now that are oil and gas leases where they are \nnot drilling. They hold on to them, maybe because they don't want their \ncompetitors to get them, but they are not drilling. So I strongly \nsupport, and I am pleased to cosponsor, Senator Menendez's legislation \nthat simply says use it or lose it--use the leases you have for \ndomestic drilling in America or lose it.\n  I also held hearings, as chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nto focus on and investigate how much market manipulators are driving up \nprices and to explore ways to strengthen Americanmade biofuels \nindustries and other alternatives to foreign oil because our farmers \nare very much a part of the solution for the future.\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\n  So there is much we can do to create real consumer choice, get off of \nforeign oil. But part of our deficit reduction effort should start by \neliminating the outrageous subsidies that are going to the top five oil \ncompanies in America. We should stamp this check ``null and void.''\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of Arenda L. Wright Allen, of \nVirginia, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District \nof Virginia?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today I invite my colleagues to \njoin me in celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Woman's Club of \nBethesda, MD. The club, a nonprofit organization, was organized on May \n27, 1911. It was founded by seven women for the purpose of promoting \ncivic activities and welfare in the neighborhood. Those activities \nincluded assistance and fundraising for schools, churches, and \nhospitals. Club members selected the American Beauty Rose as their \nflower; ``An Earnest Club for Earnest Women'' as their motto; and \nAmerican Beauty Red and green as their colors. Before a clubhouse was \nbuilt, meetings were held at various members' homes, limiting \nmembership to 35 and allowing only a cup of tea and a cracker to be \nserved.\n  During World War I, from 1914 to 1916, the members sold over $10,000 \nworth of Liberty Bonds, raised funds for French orphans, worked with \nlocal merchants to beautify the roads into the Nation's Capital, and \nworked to secure a new fire truck for the community that was capable of \nfighting chemical fires.\n  In 1925, club members raised $1,500 to purchase three lots at the \ncorner of Sonoma Road and Old Georgetown Road for construction of a \nclubhouse. On May 27, 1927, the club laid the cornerstone for the \nclubhouse, which is still in use today. In 1948, the mortgage was \nburned--quite a feat for women who began the club without the right to \nvote.\n  During World War II, the clubhouse was used to host USO \nentertainment. Today, the club continues its philanthropic efforts by \nraising money for local charitable organizations--Friends of the \nMaryland Library; Mobile Medical Care, Inc., Montgomery; Crisis Center \nof Montgomery County; Bethesda Cares; and Manna Food Banks--and by \nsupporting national and international efforts to curb homelessness and \ndomestic violence, and promote access to health care and clean water.\n  There is no doubt that the Woman's Club of Bethesda has made \nsignificant contributions to the betterment of the surrounding \ncommunity and is a valuable asset to the people of Montgomery County \nand the State of Maryland. I would ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the past and present members of the Woman's Club of \nBethesda on their century of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2871-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LARRY KELLY\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I congratulate and honor \nLarry Kelly, who is retiring from his position as executive director \nfor Tri- County Community Action Program, CAP, which serves New \nHampshire's North Country.\n  Larry's career has been one of admirable service to New Hampshire and \nhis community. Through various roles, including positions at the \nCommunity Services Administration in Boston, Federal Regional Council \nof New England, and other CAP agencies, Larry's career has been \ndedicated to helping others and serving the less fortunate.\n  In 1984, Larry joined Tri-County CAP. Larry's dedication to the \ngreater Berlin community and the entire State of New Hampshire, coupled \nwith his decades of volunteer service, is a testimony to his character. \nHis kind and gentle disposition is complemented by a passion and drive \nto make his community a better place in which to live and work. Always \nputting the community's interests above his own, Larry has been a \nchampion for the neediest among us, advocating on behalf of those \nwithout a voice and without hope. He has been rightly recognized as a \nleader among his peers throughout his professional life, receiving \nnational awards such as the Community Action Foundation's Executive \nDirector of the Year Award.\n  On a personal note, I am very grateful to Larry for his support and \ncounsel during my years in public office. Whether it was a CAP-related \nmatter or not, Larry was always ready and willing to assist in whatever \ncapacity he could. I consider Larry a friend, and I know his \ncontribution to the North Country will be missed. Please join me in \ncongratulating Mr. Larry Kelly of Berlin, NH, on his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2871-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2871-5", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2871-6", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2871-S2872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:16 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1016.

A bill to reaffirm the authority of the Department of Defense \nto maintain United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a \nlocation for the detention of unprivileged enemy belligerents held by \nthe Department of Defense, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, nearly 10 years after the September 11 \nterrorist attacks, our country remains at war with violent extremists \nwho want to kill Americans. Yet the administration has not designated a \nsecure location for detaining, interrogating, and trying current and \nfuture terrorist detainees. Rather than seeking to address this \nproblem, the administration continues to insist on closing Guantanamo \nBay.\n  Earlier this week, Attorney General Holder in Paris reiterated the \nadministration's determination to ultimately close the Guantanamo Bay \nfacility. This determination to close Gitmo represents a misguided view \nthat treats terrorism like everyday crime, hesitates to call this war \non terrorism what it is, and places the perceptions of others over the \nsafety of Americans.\n  I believe this desire to close Guantanamo represents an unacceptable \nabrogation of the Federal Government's most important responsibility: \nproviding for the common defense. Therefore, today I rise to introduce \nand to urge my colleagues to support Senate bill 944, the Detaining \nTerrorists to Secure America Act of 2011.\n  Our diligent intelligence professionals and our brave special \noperations forces who brought bin Laden to justice don't need to be \nreminded that the United States and our international partners remain \nengaged in a war with violent Islamist extremist groups, including al-\nQaida and associated terrorist groups that are committed to killing \nAmericans and our allies. Indeed, in the treasure trove of information \nour forces gathered at bin Laden's compound, we have learned the \nterrorist groups are actively plotting new attacks against our country. \nThis is the latest in a long string of attacks, or planned attacks, \nagainst our country in the last 2 years alone.\n  Just some of the examples of what we have seen: In September 2009, \nthe plot to conduct a suicide bomb attack on the New York subway \nsystem; to the November 2009 attack on Fort Hood that killed 13 people \nand wounded 32; to the Christmas Day 2009 attempted bombing on an \ninternational flight to Detroit; to the May 2010 attempt to bomb Times \nSquare; to the October 2010 attempt to send explosives to Jewish \ncenters in Chicago; to a February 2011 plot to manufacture explosives \nand to conduct attacks in Texas and in New York. Al-Qaida and their \nfellow terrorists continue to threaten our country. Bin Laden's death \nis a significant blow to al-Qaida and associated terrorist \norganizations and a great accomplishment for our country, but the \nthreat continues and our detention policies must reflect that reality.\n  Since 2001, we have captured and detained thousands of terrorists who \nhave planned and conducted attacks and who have served as terrorist \ntrainers, financiers, bomb makers, bodyguards, recruiters, and \nfacilitators. Interrogations of these terrorists, including those at \nGuantanamo, have provided valuable intelligence that has prevented \nattacks, saved lives, and helped locate other terrorists. Detention and \ninterrogation of terrorists at Guantanamo not only protects American \nlives which is the core function of our federal government, but \ndetention and interrogation of terrorists at Guantanamo also protects \nour allies. Of course, the most recent and noteworthy example that \ndemonstrates the value of intelligence gleaned from detainee \ninterrogations is the case of Osama bin Laden. Our intelligence \ncommunity would never have found bin Laden if it weren't for the \nintelligence gleaned from the interrogation of terrorist detainees.\n  Not only have interrogations of detainees helped us track down other \nterrorists, but detaining terrorists helps prevent future attacks. \nUnfortunately, as Secretary Gates confirmed in response to my question \nduring an Armed Services Committee hearing in February, approximately 1 \nout of 4, or 25 percent of the Guantanamo detainees who have been \nreleased, have reengaged or we suspect have reengaged in hostilities \nagainst the United States and our allies. I can tell my colleagues, as \na former prosecutor that is an unacceptable reengagement rate.\n  Former Guantanamo detainees are conducting suicide bombings, \nrecruiting radicals, and training them to kill Americans and our \nallies. Said al Shihri and Abdul Zakir represent two examples of former \nGuantanamo detainees who have returned to the fight and assumed \nleadership positions in terrorist organizations that are dedicated to \nkilling Americans and our allies. Said al Shihri is now working as the \nNo. 2 in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. After a recent promotion, \nAbdul Zakir now serves as a top Taliban military commander and a senior \nleader in the Taliban Quetta Shura. In the world of terrorists, it has \nbecome a badge of honor to have served at Guantanamo, and then to have \nbeen released, and then to get back into the fight against us.\n  It is unacceptable for even one released detainee to reengage in the \nfight against our country. As a military spouse and a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I find it sickening that our country \nhas released dangerous prisoners who are\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nnow actively plotting to kill Americans and our allies.\n  Some have expressed concerns regarding the legality of long-term \ndetention for these terrorists, or expressed concerns about the \nconditions at Guantanamo. I wish to address both of those concerns.\n  First, as the former Attorney General of the State of New Hampshire, \nI am as eager as anyone to ensure that our detention policies conform \nto the rule of law and reflect our core values. Some have questioned \nthe legality of detaining terrorists. Yet we should be very clear that, \naccording to the law of war, detention is a matter of national security \nand military necessity and has long been recognized as legitimate under \ninternational law.\n  Second, some have expressed concerns about the conditions at \nGuantanamo. In March, I visited the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. \nGitmo now represents the most professionally run detention facility in \nthe world. International human rights activists, reporters, Members of \nthe Congress and the Senate, constantly stream through Guantanamo \nchecking on the conditions and holding the Department of Defense \naccountable. Guantanamo is no Abu Ghraib. Detainees are treated in a \nmanner that conforms to international law and honors our values. \nGuantanamo detainees receive three meals a day tailored to the \npreferences of each detainee. They also have access to topnotch health \ncare facilities. Their religion is respected. They have television, \nnewspapers, books, English classes, and art classes. In fact, the \nofficials at Guantanamo bend over backwards to respect the cultural and \nreligious preferences of the detainees who are held there. Don't get me \nwrong; Guantanamo is no Club Med, but the terrorists who are detained \nthere, most of whom would undoubtedly kill Americans if they were given \nthe chance, are getting much better treatment than they deserve.\n  As a former prosecutor, I have been in a few prisons in my time, and \nI can tell my colleagues the detention facility at Gitmo is much nicer \nthan some that our common criminals are in, in the United States of \nAmerica. I was also impressed with the state-of-the-art courtroom at \nGuantanamo which would rival any Federal courtroom in the United \nStates. However, unlike your average courtroom, it is set up to address \nthe special security concerns associated with trying terrorists and it \nis also especially designed to enable the judge to ensure that \nclassified information will not be compromised or leaked. This \ncourtroom is the appropriate courtroom and venue for Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed and the other 9/11 conspirators to be held accountable for \ntheir roles in the horrific attacks on our country on September 11. And \nafter almost 10 years, the victims of September 11 have waited much too \nlong for justice.\n  I believe our country stands on a solid legal framework in detaining \nterrorists according to the law of war, and I also believe Guantanamo \nrepresents the ideal facility for detaining, interrogating, and trying \ncurrent and future terrorist detainees.\n  Some may ask, Why introduce this legislation now? Why is it needed? \nIn February, during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, I asked \nSecretary Gates where we would detain high value terrorists that we \ncapture in the future if the President goes forward with his plan to \nclose Guantanamo. Secretary Gates candidly said to me: ``I think the \nhonest answer to that question is we don't know.''\n  I was encouraged by President Obama's decision to resume military \ncommissions at Guantanamo. Yet the administration was careful to \nreiterate its determination to ultimately close Guantanamo. \nUnfortunately, as I previously mentioned, on Monday Attorney General \nHolder, in Paris, reiterated the administration's desire to close \nGuantanamo. But we know intelligence gathered at Guantanamo played a \nvaluable role in helping to ultimately find Osama bin Laden. We know \nthere are other terrorists out there who want to do us harm, and we \nneed to keep this facility open. For this reason, I believe Congress \nmust pass this legislation without delay.\n  Before concluding, let me briefly summarize what S. 944 will do.\n  This legislation reaffirms the authority to maintain Gitmo as an \noperating facility for the detention of current and future unprivileged \nenemy belligerents.\n  It directs the Secretary of Defense to take actions to maintain Gitmo \nas an operating facility for the detention of current and future \nunprivileged enemy belligerents.\n  It extends permanently the limitation of transfer of detainees to \nforeign entities and the prohibition of construction or modification of \nfacilities in the United States of America for detaining terrorists. We \nhave heard loud and clear from the American people that they do not \nwant terrorists detained on American soil.\n  Finally, it supersedes sections of President Obama's Executive order \nthat he issued shortly after he got into office on January 22, 2009. He \nissued an Executive order saying that Guantanamo would be closed. This \nlegislation will supersede the portions of that Executive order related \nto the closure of Gitmo, the determination of transfer, the prosecution \nof terrorists in article III courts and the military tribunals.\n  In short, this legislation would establish Gitmo as the permanent \nlocation for detaining, interrogating, and trying unprivileged enemy \nbelligerents or terrorists. To accomplish this, we will permanently \nlimit the transfer of detainees to foreign entities because what has \nhappened is that terrorist detainees have been transferred to foreign \ncountries and then the foreign countries release the former detainee. \nThat is how so many former detainees have made there way back to the \nbattlefield. So we have to stop that. And this legislation will \nprohibit the construction or modification of facilities in the United \nStates of America for detaining terrorists, to make sure we keep \ndetained terrorists at Gitmo and off U.S. soil.\n  I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation called Detaining \nTerrorists to Secure America Act of 2011, S. 944. I am especially proud \nthat many friends and colleagues have decided to support this \nbipartisan legislation, including Senators Graham, Lieberman, \nChambliss, Brown, Rubio and Webb, all of whom have been leaders when it \ncomes to fighting terrorism and protecting Americans.\n  Everything we do in this Chamber must be guided by our Constitution, \nand the Federal Government must fulfill its most important \nconstitutional duty of protecting the American people. Pretending we \nare not at war with terrorists will not change the fact that terrorists \ncontinue to plot against us and to attack Americans. Consistent with \nour values and the rule of law, we must establish the Guantanamo \ndetention facility as the permanent location for detaining, \ninterrogating, and trying terrorists.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank the \nPresiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Detaining Terrorists to \n     Secure America Act of 2011''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following finding:\n       (1) The United States and its international partners are in \n     an armed conflict with violent Islamist extremist groups, \n     including al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations, \n     that are committed to killing Americans and our allies.\n       (2) In the last 2 years, terrorists have repeatedly \n     attempted to kill Americans both here at home and abroad, \n     including the following attacks, plots, or alleged plots and \n     attacks:\n       (A) A September 2009 plot by Najibullah Zazi--who received \n     training from al Qaeda in Pakistan--to conduct a suicide bomb \n     attack on the New York, New York, subway system.\n       (B) A November 2009 attack by Nidal Malik Hasan at Fort \n     Hood, Texas, that killed 13 people and wounded 32.\n       (C) A Christmas Day 2009 attempt by Umar Farouk \n     Abdulmutallab to detonate a bomb sewn into his underwear on \n     an international flight to Detroit, Michigan.\n       (D) A May 2010 attempt by Faisal Shahzad to bomb Times \n     Square in New York, New York, on a crowded Saturday evening, \n     an attack that was unsuccessful only because the car bomb \n     failed to detonate.\n       (E) An October 2010 attempt by terrorists in Yemen to send, \n     via commercial cargo flights, 2 packages of explosives to \n     Jewish centers in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\n       (F) A February 2011 plot by Khaled Aldawsari, a Saudi-born \n     student, to manufacture explosives and potentially attack New \n     York, New York, the Dallas, Texas, home of former President \n     George W. Bush, as well as hydroelectric dams, nuclear power \n     plants, and a nightclub.\n       (3) Since the September 11, 2001, attacks on our Nation, \n     the United States and allied forces have captured thousands \n     of individuals fighting for or supporting al Qaeda and \n     associated terrorist organizations that do not abide by the \n     law of war, including detainees at United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who served as planners of \n     those attacks, trainers of terrorists, financiers of \n     terrorists, bomb makers, bodyguards for Osama bin Laden, \n     recruiters of terrorists, and facilitators of terrorism.\n       (4) Many of the detainees at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay provided valuable intelligence that gave the \n     United States insight into al Qaeda and its methods, \n     prevented terrorist attacks, and saved lives.\n       (5) Intelligence obtained from detainees at United States \n     Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay was critical to eventually \n     identifying the location of Osama bin Laden.\n       (6) In a February 17, 2011, hearing of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate, the Secretary of Defense \n     confirmed that approximately 25 percent of detainees released \n     from the detention facility at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay are confirmed to have reengaged in hostilities \n     or are suspected of having reengaged in hostilities against \n     the United States or our allies.\n       (7) Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an organization that \n     includes former detainees at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay among its leadership and ranks, has claimed \n     responsibility for several of the recent plots and attacks \n     against the United States.\n       (8) Detention according to the law of war is a matter of \n     national security and military necessity and has long been \n     recognized as legitimate under international law.\n       (9) Detaining unprivileged enemy belligerents prevents them \n     from returning to the battlefield to attack United States and \n     allied military personnel and engaging in future terrorist \n     attacks against innocent civilians.\n       (10) The Joint Task Force-Guantanamo provides for the \n     humane, legal, and transparent care and custody of detainees \n     at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, \n     notwithstanding regular assaults on the guard force by some \n     detainees.\n       (11) The International Committee of the Red Cross visits \n     detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay on a \n     quarterly basis.\n       (12) The detention facility at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay benefits from robust oversight by Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish an Office of Rural Education Policy in \nthe Department of Education; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Mike Mansfield once said, ``Knowledge is \nessential for acceptance and understanding.''\n  This statement is all too true for the students and educators \nresiding in rural areas. While rural education is becoming an \nincreasingly large and important part of the U.S. public school system, \nthe unique challenges and circumstances within these rural communities \nare often misunderstood or overlooked. According to the Digest of \nEducation Statistics reported annually by the National Center for \nEducation Statistics, the number of students attending rural schools \nincreased by over 11 percent, from 10.5 million in 2004 to nearly 11.7 \nmillion by 2008. Rural students now comprise almost \\1/4\\ of the \nNation's public school enrollment. And nearly one-third of all schools \nin the nation are located in rural areas.\n  Rural is also becoming increasingly diverse. According to NCES, the \nincrease in rural enrollment between 2004 and 2009 was \ndisproportionally among students of color. And in the 2007-2008 school \nyear the national average rate of student poverty in rural school \ndistricts, as measured by the rate of participation in federally \nsubsidized meals programs, was almost 40 percent.\n  Yet despite the significant percentage enrolled in rural schools, the \nimportance of rural education is often obscured by the fact that rural \nstudents are, naturally, widely-dispersed, located in small, \ngeographically isolated school districts. The size, diversity, and \ncomplexity of rural education support a greater policy focus on the \nunique challenges and solutions for rural education.\n  Montana is the fourth largest state by land mass, totaling over \n147,000 square miles. More than half of Montana's 830 schools enroll \nless than 100 students. From Eureka to Ekalaka, from Scobey to Darby, \nthese small schools dot the landscape, providing not only a learning \nenvironment but often a community center.\n  Montana's rural communities are doing an excellent job educating \nMontana's next generation. Overall, Montana graduation rates are higher \nthan the national average. Montana students taking the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, in 2009 scored higher than \nthe national average in both reading and math.\n  But despite the success of Montana's rural schools, these schools \nface a unique set of challenges that their urban-centric peers may not \neven comprehend. In 2004, the U.S. Government Accountability Office \nreleased a report highlighting the needs and distinctive challenges of \nrural schools and districts across this nation.\n  For example, rural schools report greater difficulties in recruiting \nand retaining qualified teachers, due to inability to offer competitive \nsalaries, geographic isolation, and for some, severe weather. Rural \ndistricts often have fewer personnel. The district superintendent is \noften also the high school principal. He or she may also be the Title I \ncoordinator, math curriculum specialist, and sometimes also the head of \ntransportation services! In isolated areas, schools face challenges in \nproviding professional development and training for teachers and \nprincipals. Small rural districts are often located long distances from \nother districts, towns, and universities, drastically reducing \nopportunities to partner or collaborate. Additionally, the long \ndistances students must travel between school and home make it more \ndifficult to participate in traditional remedial services, mentoring, \nand after school programs.\n  I commend the Secretary for efforts he has taken to try to address \nconcerns of rural areas. However, these efforts have fallen short, and \nin some cases, even good intentions have created adverse consequences. \nMost recently, the Investing in Innovation, i3, competitive grant \nprogram provided ``competitive preference points'' for applicants \nserving at least one rural district, in an effort to encourage and \nsupport rural applicants. However, the department's lack of guidance \nand independent scorers' lack of understanding of rural areas still \nleft authentically rural programs at a clear disadvantage. The Rural \nSchool & Community Trust highlighted in its report Taking Advantage \nthat this ``rural preference'' instead had the effect of inducing\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nurban applicants to include minimal rural participation merely in order \nto gain the additional scoring points for primarily urban projects.\n  I am joined today by my colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, in introducing the Office of Rural Education Policy Act. \nThis bill will establish the Office of Rural Education Policy, housed \nat the Department of Education's Office of Elementary & Secondary \nEducation. This office and its director will be tasked with \ncoordinating the activities related to rural education and advising the \nSecretary on issues important to rural schools and districts. The \nlegislation requires the department to consider the impact of proposed \nrules and regulations on rural education and to produce an annual \nreport on the condition of rural education. The Office of Rural \nEducation Policy will be tasked with establishing a clearinghouse for \ncollecting and disseminating information related to the unique \nchallenges of rural areas, as well as the innovative efforts under way \nin rural schools to tackle these challenges.\n  The strong list of supporters of this bill further solidifies the \nneed for an Office of Rural Education Policy. We have received strong \nsupport from: American Association of Community Colleges, American \nAssociation of School Administrators, Alliance for Excellent Education, \nAssociation of Educational Service Agencies, Center for Rural Affairs, \nCoalition for Community Schools, Council for Opportunity in Education, \nMontana School Board Association, Montana State Superintendents \nAssociation, Montana Rural Education Association, National Association \nof State Boards of Education, National Association of Development \nOrganizations, National Association of Elementary School Principals, \nNational Association of Federally Impacted Schools, National Education \nAssociation, National Congress of American Indians, National Farmers \nUnion, National Indian Education Association, National Rural Education \nAssociation, National Rural Education Advocacy Coalition, National \nSchool Board Association, Organizations Concerned about Rural \nEducation, Public Education Network, Rural School and Community Trust, \nand Save the Children. I want to thank all the supporters of the bill, \nand want to particularly thank the efforts of the Rural School and \nCommunity Trust for its steadfast commitment to this proposal.\n  Mike Mansfield was right. ``Knowledge is essential for acceptance and \nunderstanding.'' I look forward to working with my colleagues here in \nthe Senate to move this legislation, to bring about greater knowledge \nof rural schools and ensure they are both accepted and understood.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Office of Rural Education \n     Policy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Secretary of Education has recognized that \n     ``[r]ural schools have unique challenges and benefits'', but \n     a recent report by the Rural School and Community Trust \n     refers to the ``paucity of rural education research in the \n     United States''.\n       (2) Rural education is becoming an increasingly large and \n     important part of the United States public school system. \n     According to the Digest of Education Statistics reported \n     annually by the National Center for Education Statistics, the \n     number of students attending rural schools increased by more \n     than 11 percent, from 10,500,000 to nearly 11,700,000, \n     between the 2004-2005 and 2008-2009 school years. The share \n     of the Nation's public school enrollment attending rural \n     schools increased from 21.6 percent to 23.8 percent. In \n     school year 2008-2009, these students attended 31,635 rural \n     schools, nearly one-third of all schools in the United \n     States.\n       (3) Despite the overall growth of rural education, rural \n     students represent a demographic minority in all but 3 \n     States, according to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics.\n       (4) Rural education is becoming increasingly diverse. \n     According to the National Center for Education Statistics, \n     the increase in rural enrollment between the 2004-2005 and \n     2008-2009 school years was disproportionally among students \n     of color. Enrollment of children of color in rural schools \n     increased by 31 percent, and the proportion of students \n     enrolled in rural schools who are children of color increased \n     from 23.0 to 26.5 percent. More than one-third of rural \n     students in 12 States are children of color, according to \n     research by the Rural School and Community Trust (Why Rural \n     Matters 2009).\n       (5) Rural education is varied and diverse across the \n     Nation. In school year 2007-2008, the national average rate \n     of student poverty in rural school districts, as measured by \n     the rate of participation in federally subsidized meals \n     programs, was 39.1 percent, but ranged from 9.7 percent in \n     Connecticut to 71.9 percent in New Mexico, according to the \n     National Center for Education Statistics.\n       (6) Even policy measures intended to help rural schools can \n     have unintended consequences. In awarding competitive grants \n     under the Investing in Innovation Fund program under section \n     14007 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \n     (Public Law 111-5), the Secretary of Education attempted to \n     encourage and support rural applicants by providing \n     additional points for proposals to serve at least 1 rural \n     local educational agency. But according to research by the \n     Rural School and Community Trust (Taking Advantage, 2010), \n     this ``rural preference'' mainly had the effect of inducing \n     urban applicants to include rural participation merely in \n     order to gain additional scoring points for primarily urban \n     projects.\n       (7) Rural schools generally utilize distance education more \n     often for both students and teachers. A fall 2008 survey of \n     public schools by the National Center for Education \n     Statistics found that rural schools were 1\\1/2\\ times more \n     likely to provide students access for online distance \n     learning than schools in cities. A September 2004 study from \n     the Government Accountability Office reported that rural \n     school districts used distance learning for teacher training \n     more often than non-rural school districts.\n       (8) The National Center for Education Statistics reports \n     that base salaries of both the lowest and highest paid \n     teachers are lower in rural schools than any other community \n     type.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish an Office of Rural Education Policy in the \n     Department of Education; and\n       (2) to provide input to the Secretary of Education \n     regarding the impact of proposed changes in law, regulations, \n     policies, rules, and budgets on rural schools and \n     communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE OF RURAL EDUCATION POLICY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title II of the Department of Education \n     Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3411 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 221.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Baucus \nfrom Montana and my colleagues Senator Begich of Alaska, Senator Bennet \nof Colorado, Senator Franken of Minnesota, Senator Johnson of South \nDakota, Senator Leahy of Vermont, Senator Sanders of Vermont, and \nSenator Udall of Colorado, in introducing legislation today to \nestablish an Office of Rural Education Policy at the Department of \nEducation. Senator Baucus's leadership in bringing attention to \neducation in our rural areas is remarkable, and I am proud to work with \nhim on this increasingly important issue.\n  In addition to my colleagues who are cosponsoring this legislation, I \nwant to acknowledge the many organizations who have already announced \ntheir support for it. Their concern for the students living in rural \nAmerica is greatly appreciated. These organizations include American \nAssociation of Community Colleges, American Association of School \nAdministrators, Alliance for Excellent Education, Association of \nEducational Service Agencies, Center for Rural Affairs, Coalition for \nCommunity Schools, Council for Opportunity in Education, National \nAssociation of State Boards of Education, National Association of \nDevelopment Organizations, National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, National Association of Federally Impacted Schools, \nNational Congress of American Indians, National Education Association, \nNational Farmers Union, National Indian Education Association, National \nRural Education Association, National Rural Education Advocacy \nCoalition, National School Board Association, Organizations Concerned \nabout Rural Education, Public Education Network, Rural School and \nCommunity Trust, and Save the Children.\n  We rightly focus quite a bit on education around here--the future \nsuccess of our nation depends upon today's students. Since nearly one \nquarter of the students in America are at rural schools and the share \nof students in rural schools has been increasing, our Nation's success \ndepends considerably on success in rural schools. Over half of the \nschools in West Virginia are in rural areas. This legislation will \ncreate an Office at the Department of Education to make sure the \nprograms there are working for students in schools in rural areas.\n  Rural schools are not just miniature versions of their urban \ncounterparts. They face special challenges and they have unique \ncapabilities. Among the challenges faced are shrinking local tax bases, \nrecruiting and retaining teachers and principals, limited access to \nadvanced courses, and proportionally higher transportation costs. At \nthe same time, rural communities, and I am very proud of the \ncommunities in West Virginia often provide a strong foundation for \nsupport and improvement. They are leaders in the use of distance \nlearning. While smaller schools lack an economy of scale, they often \nprofit from this small size and their closeness to community. Parental \ninvolvement and support is typically high. Rural schools can be very \ninnovative, and research on what works in rural schools needs to be \ncompleted and disseminated.\n  The Office of Rural Education Policy is modeled after the successful \nOffice of Rural Health Policy at the Department of Health and Human \nServices which Congress established in 1987. The office will be led by \na director charged with coordinating the activities of the Department \nof Education concerning rural education. It will establish and maintain \na clearinghouse for issues faced by rural schools, such as teacher and \nprincipal recruitment and retention; partnerships with community-based \norganizations; and financing of rural schools.\n  The office will identify innovative research and demonstration \nprojects on rural schools, and recommend research to bridge any gaps. \nIt will issue an annual report on the condition of rural education, and \nan analysis of the impact on rural education from proposed regulations \nand other activities will be made public.\n  Rural schools have been a part of our national fabric since its very \nbeginning. Their students deserve the focus this legislation will \nprovide. It has been said that education in rural America is ``too \nlarge to be ignored but too small and diverse to be highly visible.'' \nWe need to establish this office so that it is not ignored and so that \nits successes are made more visible. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 950. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to repeal a \nprohibition on allowing States to use toll revenues as State matching \nfunds for Appalachian Development Highway projects; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today Senator Casey and I are introducing \na bill to help facilitate the completion of critically important \ntransportation infrastructure to the Appalachian region of the United \nStates. The Appalachian Development Highway System, ADHS, is designed \nto alleviate Appalachia's isolation from major commercial corridors and \ncreate better transportation connectivity between communities within \nthe Region and to destinations outside of Appalachia.\n  According to the Appalachian Regional Commission, ARC: ``Because the \ncost of building highways through Appalachia's mountainous terrain was \nhigh, the Region had never been served by adequate roads. Its network \nof narrow, winding, two-lane roads, snaking through narrow stream \nvalleys or over mountaintops, was slow to drive, unsafe, and in many \nplaces worn out. The Nation's interstate highway system had largely \nbypassed the Appalachian Region, going through or around the Region's \nrugged terrain as cost-effectively as possible.''\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\n  That's why in 1964, ARC recommended that investments in improving \nAppalachia's highways were essential to economic growth of this \nhistorically economically depressed region of the country. The ADHS is \ncurrently authorized at 3,090 miles and is nearly 88 percent complete \nor under construction. The remaining miles left to be built are located \nin some of the more difficult places to build located near the mid-\nAtlantic portion of Appalachia.\n  The difficulty of construction in this region makes these stretches \nof the ADHS more expensive to build as well. The legislation I am \nfiling today will provide Appalachian States with greater flexibility \non how they may raise and their portion of matching funds that are used \ntowards ADHS projects.\n  Toll credits, first authorized in the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), are being used \nextensively by States with toll facilities. As of May 31, 2007, over \n$18 billion in toll credits had been approved in 22 States and Puerto \nRico. Toll credits are designed to encourage States to increase capital \ninvestment in transportation infrastructure and enable States to \nsimplify program administration. However, there is an interesting \nexception for how and where toll credit may be used.\n  SAFETEA-LU included a modification to the toll credit requirements as \ncodified in Section 120(j) of Title 23, United States Code, U.S.C., \nprohibiting the use of toll credits on the Appalachian Development \nHighway System program under Section 14501 of Title 40.\n  Our legislation, quite simply, repeals this prohibition against \nStates using toll credits as their state matching funds for ADHS \nprojects.\n  Given these particularly difficult economic times that have presented \nexceptional budgetary challenges for States to revenue adequate \nrevenues to pay for essential infrastructure projects, I believe States \nneed the flexibility to use highway revenues as they see fit regardless \nof the means in which those revenues are raised. The SAFETEA-LU \nprohibition against the use of toll credits on the ADHS is \ndiscriminatory against a particular revenue mechanism.\n  Allowing a State to use toll credits towards an ADHS project does not \nrequire that State to raise the tolls revenues on the ADHS road that \nthe toll credits were used towards.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Sen. Casey and I in repealing SAFETEA-\nLU's prohibition against one particular revenue stream that could be \nused to complete an incredibly important system of transportation \ninfrastructure designed to serve a historically underserved region of \nrural America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 950\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MATCHING FUNDS FOR APPALACHIAN DEVELOPMENT HIGHWAY \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n       Section 120(j)(1)(A) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``and the Appalachian development highway \n     system program under section 14501 of title 40''.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the development of \nthe Appalachian Development Highway System, ADHS. The completion of \nthis highway system, which connects 13 States from New York to \nMississippi, is critical to the economic development of the region as a \nwhole.\n  Despite the significant progress Appalachia has made over the past \nfew decades, the region has continued to face economic challenges. In \nthe 420-county region, approximately one fourth of these counties are \ndesignated as having high poverty, meaning that the poverty rate is 1.5 \ntimes the U.S. average. According to the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, two thirds of the Appalachian counties have unemployment \nrates that are higher than the national average.\n  Completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System will spur \neconomic development in the region and create much needed jobs. The \nFederal Government has played a significant role in the development of \nthis initiative and I urge my colleagues to renew this commitment.\n  Today, my colleague Senator Cardin from Maryland and I introduced a \nbill that will help the continued development of this highway system. \nOur bill will reverse language in the 2005 Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \nEfficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU, \nthat prohibits the use of toll credits for the non-federal share for \nADHS projects. This legislation would allow States to unlock existing \nunspent balances and make it easier for States to access and leverage \nadditional funding. Our bill will allow ADHS projects to move forward, \nsuch as Route 219 in my home State of Pennsylvania. In addition, this \nchange would eliminate a disparity that does not exist for the vast \nmajority of other Federal transportation programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Begich, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of Ohio, \n        Mr. Casey, Mr. Coons. Mr. Sanders, Mr. Tester, Mr. Leahy, and \n        Mr. Brown of Massachusetts)\n  S. 951. A bill to improve the provision of Federal transition, \nrehabilitation, vocational, and unemployment benefits to members of the \nArmed Forces and veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to introduce the Hiring \nHeroes Act of 2011.\n  My colleagues, including Senators Murkowski, Leahy, Baucus, \nRockefeller, Akaka, Boxer, Sanders, Brown of Ohio, Casey, Tester, \nBegich, Coons, and Brown of Massachusetts join me in introducing this \nimportant legislation. I appreciate their continued support of our \nNation's veterans. I also want to thank the veterans service \norganizations and their representatives, who have supported this \nlegislation, including Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nMilitary Officers Association of America, The American Legion, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \nStates.\n  Today, we are taking a huge step forward in rethinking the way we \ntreat our men and women in uniform after they leave the military. For \ntoo long in this country we have invested billions of dollars in \ntraining our young men and women with new skills to protect our nation, \nonly to turn our backs once they have left the military. For too long, \nat the end of their career we patted these troops on the back for their \nservice and then pushed them out into the job market alone. Where has \nthat left us today?\n  Today, we have an unemployment rate as high as 27 percent among young \nveterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. That is over one in \nfive of our Nation's heroes who cannot find a job to support their \nfamily; who do not have an income that provides stability; and do not \nhave work that provides them with the self-esteem and pride that is so \ncritical to their transition home.\n  All too often we read about the results of veterans who come home--\noften with the invisible wounds of war--who cannot find the dignity and \nsecurity that work provides. We read about it in skyrocketing suicide \nstatistics; problems at home; substance abuse problems, and even in \nrising rates of homelessness among our young veterans.\n  I frequently hear from veterans that we have failed to provide \nadequate job support. I have had veterans tell me that they no longer \nwrite the fact that they're a veteran on their resume because they fear \nthe stigma that employers might attach to the invisible wounds of war. \nI have heard from medics like Eric Smith, a former Navy Corpsman who \nreturned home from treating battlefield wounds and could not get \ncertifications necessary to be an emergency medical technician or to \ndrive an ambulance.\n  I have heard from veteran after veteran who said that they did not \nhave to go through the military's job skills training program or that \nthey were never taught how to use the vernacular of the business world \nto describe the benefits of their experience. These stories are as \nheartbreaking as they are frustrating, but more than anything they are \na reminder that we have to act now.\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\n  The bill we are introducing today allows our men and women in uniform \nto capitalize on their service, while also ensuring that the American \npeople capitalize on the investment we have made in them. For the first \ntime, it would require broad job skills training for every \nservicemember as they leave the military as part of the military's \nTransition Assistance Program. Today, nearly \\1/3\\ of our \nservicemembers do not get this training.\n  This bill would also allow servicemembers to begin the federal \nemployment process prior to separation in order to facilitate a truly \nseamless transition from the military to jobs at the VA, Homeland \nSecurity or many of the other federal agencies in need of our veterans.\n  In addition, this bill also requires the Department of Labor to take \na hard look at what military skills and training should be translatable \ninto the civilian sector, and will work to make it simpler to get \nneeded licenses or certifications.\n  Finally, this bill will allow for innovative partnerships with \norganizations that provide mentorship and training programs that are \ndesigned to lead to job placements. All of these are real, substantial \nsteps to put our veterans to work, and all of them come at a pivotal \ntime for our economic recovery and our veterans.\n  I grew up with the Vietnam War and I have dedicated much of my Senate \ncareer to helping to care for the veterans we left behind at that time. \nThe mistakes we made then have cost our nation and our veterans dearly \nand have weighed on the conscience of this nation; yet today we stand \non the brink of repeating those mistakes.\n  We cannot let that happen. Our Nation's veterans are disciplined, \nteam players who have proven they can deliver under pressure like no \none else. It is time for us to deliver for them.\n  This is not a full summary of all the provisions within this \nlegislation. However, I hope that I have provided an appropriate \noverview of the major benefits this legislation would provide for \nAmerica's servicemembers as they transition into civilian life. I also \nask our colleagues for their continued support for the Nation's \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 951\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the cancellation of removal and \nadjustment of status of certain alien students who are long-term United \nStates residents and who entered the United States as children and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We had a historic vote in the Senate last December on the \nDREAM Act. Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, promised that we \nwould bring this measure for consideration on the floor of the Senate. \nSome people on both sides of the aisle said, it is a bad idea, do not \ndo it. But he kept his word, and I am glad he did.\n  We called it. We had three Republican votes, and we fell short. Oh, \nwe had a majority. It seems as if we always have a majority when we \ncall this bill. But because of the threat of a Republican filibuster, \nwe needed 60 votes, and we did not reach the 60 votes necessary. So 55 \nSenators, a bipartisan majority, voted for the DREAM Act. I have \nreintroduced it today. By way of background, this is a simple piece of \nlegislation, but it is one that affects thousands of people across \nAmerica. It came to my attention 10 years ago when a Korean-American \nwoman called me in my Chicago office and told me she had a problem.\n  She had come to the United States about 18 years before and brought \nher little girl with her. She had raised a family. She was now a \nnaturalized citizen. The children who were born in the United States \nwere citizens. But her older daughter was in a different status. Her \nolder daughter was a special person. Her older daughter was a concert \npianist who had been accepted at the Julliard School of Music in New \nYork, the best. As she filled out the application form, and they asked \nfor her citizenship, she turned to her mom and said: USA, right?\n  And her mom said: You know, we never filed any papers for you.\n  So the little girl said: What should we do?\n  And her mom said: We ought to call Durbin.\n  So they called my office, thinking I could solve this. I found out \nthe awful truth. Our laws currently say the only recourse for that \nlittle girl--who came here at the age of 2, who grew up in the United \nStates, going to school here, saying the Pledge of Allegiance to our \nflag every morning, singing the only national anthem she knew, speaking \nthe only language she knew--under our law could never be a U.S. citizen \nand had to leave our country.\n  What is wrong with this? Well, it is unfair. That is what is wrong. \nAt 2 years of age, she had no voice in the decision of her family to \ncome here. She had done everything right. All she was asking for, all \nshe continues to ask for, is a chance to be part of the only country \nshe has ever known, a country she dearly loves.\n  The DREAM Act gives young people that chance. It says: You can have a \nchance if you graduate high school, have no criminal record involving \nanything of a serious nature, if you are prepared go through and prove \nthat you have been in the United States, came before the age of 16, \nbeen here at least 5 years, then you will have a chance to apply. If \nyou apply, you have two ways that you can reach legal status in our \ncountry: Serve in our military, or complete at least 2 years of \ncollege. For thousands of young people across America, this is the only \nway to get them out of their current situation.\n  We just had a press conference with Senator Harry Reid and Senator \nBob Menendez, as well as Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut to \nreintroduce this DREAM Act. At that press conference was a young woman \nwho\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\ntold her story. Like thousands of others it is a compelling personal \nstory. Her name is Tolu Olubunmi. She was born in Nigeria and brought \nto the United States as a child. She graduated her high school with \nhonors. She was awarded a full scholarship to one of the Nation's top \nuniversities. In college, she was a leader: a peer counselor, a \nresident assistant, a volunteer in an abused women's shelter, and a \nresearch analyst in the department of engineering.\n  Tolu received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 2002. \nBut she has never been able to work 1 day as a chemical engineer in \nAmerica because she is undocumented.\n  She cannot leave this country, because she could not return. She \ncannot get a job in this country because she is undocumented. Her whole \nlife is focused on America. She is asking for a chance to be an \nengineer, to be a productive part of America, to move us forward as a \nnation. The DREAM Act would give her that chance.\n  When we introduced the bill today, we have 32 original cosponsors. We \nare hoping for more. We have the Democratic leadership, the Chairs of \nthe Judiciary, Armed Services, and Homeland Security Committees, and \nall 10 Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee. I want to thank \nthe lead sponsors over in the House: Howard Berman of California, Luis \nGutierrez, from my State of Illinois, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of \nFlorida. Thanks to their leadership last year, the House passed the \nDREAM Act.\n  I want to especially thank the President. As a Senator and my \ncolleague from Illinois, he was a cosponsor of this bill. He has been a \nstrong supporter ever since. He never fails to mention the DREAM Act in \nhis conversations with America about immigration. Yesterday, he said:\n\n       These are kids who grew up in this country, love this \n     country, and know no other place as home. The idea that we \n     should punish them is cruel and it makes no sense. We are a \n     better nation than that.\n\n  The President is right. This is a matter of simple justice. Thousands \nof immigrant students in America were brought here as children. It was \nnot their decision to come here. But they grew up here and they called \nit home. The fundamental premise of the DREAM Act is an American \npremise. We do not hold children responsible for the wrongdoings of \ntheir parents.\n  These young people do not want a free pass. They do not want amnesty. \nAll they want is a chance to earn their place in America. That is what \nthe DREAM Act would give them. The DREAM Act would strengthen our \nnational security, making thousands of young people eligible to serve. \nThat is why the Department of Defense and Secretary Gates support it.\n  In fact, the Secretary said:\n\n       There is a rich precedence supporting the service of non-\n     citizens in the U.S. military. . . . The DREAM Act represents \n     an opportunity to expand this pool to the advantage of \n     military recruiting and readiness.\n\n  The first casualty in the war in Iraq was a Hispanic who was not a \ncitizen of the United States, was not even a permanent resident of the \nUnited States. But he had volunteered to serve his country and gave his \nlife. I think that shows the level of commitment these young people \nhave to this great Nation.\n  A recent study at UCLA found that allowing the DREAM Act to pass \nwould put so many productive young people into our economy, they will \ngenerate jobs, they will build businesses, they will help our economy \ngrow.\n  I want to salute in your home State of New York, Madam President, \nMayor Michael Bloomberg who has spoken out in support of the DREAM Act, \nand said:\n\n       They are just the kind of immigrants we need to help solve \n     our unemployment problem. Some of them will go on to create \n     new small businesses and hire people. It is senseless for us \n     to chase out the home-grown talent that has the potential to \n     contribute so significantly to our society.\n\n  When you take a look at the supporters of the DREAM Act, they have \nsuch diverse backgrounds. They include business leaders such as Rupert \nMurdoch, and the CEOs of companies such as Microsoft and Pfizer.\n  There are some who oppose the DREAM Act and argue that we need to \nenhance border security first. I can certainly make the argument, as \nthe President did yesterday, that we have done extraordinary things, \nmore than doubling the number of people at the border, adding technical \ndevices there to detect people who are trying to cross, using drones, \nbuilding fences.\n  We have gone, I think, as far as I can imagine, but I am open--I told \na Republican Senator this morning: I am open to any reasonable \nsuggestion to make the border safer. But I say to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, if we show good faith in border enforcement, \ncan you join us by showing good faith in helping to pass the DREAM Act? \nI do not think that is an unreasonable exchange. I am open to their \nideas. I hope they are open to the idea of the DREAM Act.\n  I also have to say that many of the young people who are affected by \nthis have been dramatically positive in their contribution to America. \nThere are restrictions in the DREAM Act that prevent abuse. The DREAM \nAct students would not be eligible for Pell grants or other Federal \ngrants, which means they are going to pay more to go to school.\n  DREAM Act students will be subject to tough criminal penalties for \nfraud, including a prison sentence of up to 5 years. No one is eligible \nfor the DREAM Act unless they arrived in the United States at least 5 \nyears before the bill becomes law, and there is no exception and no \nwaiver.\n  Also the DREAM Act specifically includes a 1-year application \ndeadline. An individual would be required to apply for conditional \nnonimmigrant status within 1 year of obtaining a high school degree or \nGED, or within 1 year of when the bill becomes law.\n  This is not an amnesty. On many occasions I have come to the floor to \ntell the personal stories of people who are involved. Their lives speak \nmore eloquently than anything I can say on the floor. Let me tell you \nabout Nelson and Jhon Magdaleno. They are brothers who came to the \nUnited States from Venezuela when Nelson was 11 and Jhon was 9. They \nwere both honor students at Lakeside High School in Atlanta, GA. This \nis a picture of Nelson Magdaleno at graduation. Jhon, his brother, \nserved with distinction in the Air Force Junior Officer Reserve Corps. \nHe was the fourth highest ranking officer in a 175-officer cadet unit \nand commander of the Air Honor Society. Here is a picture of Jhon in \nhis ROTC uniform in high school.\n\n  Both Jhon and Nelson are honor students at Georgia Tech University, a \ngreat school. It is one of the most selective engineering schools in \nAmerica. Nelson, who is now 21, is a junior. He is a computer \nengineering major with a 3.6 GPA. Jhon, 18, is a freshman. He is a \nbiomedical engineering major with a 4.0 GPA.\n  Let me ask my colleagues, can we afford to lose these two young \npeople? Well, I guess we could but at great expense because their \ntalent, their energy, their determination to make a contribution to \nAmerica can make us a better nation. I don't think returning them to \nVenezuela, a country they have never called home, is going to be good \nfor the United States.\n  John David Bunting, Nelson and Jhon's uncle, wrote me a letter about \nhis nephews. Here is what he said:\n\n       They will be able to give back so much to our country if \n     they are allowed to stay. I am overwhelmed by my pride in \n     them and how they have managed to persevere and even flourish \n     under these circumstances. . . . I also have two young sons \n     and I teach them about the incredible history of the United \n     States and the way that our country can address wrongs \n     committed in its name and come out of the process even \n     stronger. Please help us.\n\n  Nelson and Jhon asked the Department of Homeland Security to stop \ntheir deportation proceedings. After I received their uncle's letter, I \ncontacted the Department and asked them to consider this case. The \nDepartment has decided to grant a stay to Nelson and Jhon to give them \na chance to continue their education. That was clearly the right thing \nto do.\n  Some have criticized the Obama administration for granting this kind \nof deferral action to a small number of DREAM Act students, but this is \nexactly what the Bush administration did. I wish to commend President \nGeorge Bush, who was steadfast and consistent in his support of \nimmigration reform.\n  It is a waste of limited resources to deport two fine engineering \nstudents from the United States, and it is entirely consistent with the \nlaw to grant them deferred action.\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues about another student, Pedro Pedroza. Here \nis his photograph. Pedro was brought to Chicago from Mexico when he was \n5 years old. He graduated from St. Agnes Catholic School in Little \nVillage, a great part of our city of Chicago. He was an honor student \nat St. Ignatius College Prep, one of the best schools in Chicago. He is \nnow a student in New York at Cornell University in Ithaca. His goal is \nto become a teacher.\n  Do we need teachers with his qualities? You bet we do, not just in \nNew York but in Illinois and across America. But, unfortunately, Pedro \nis in deportation proceedings. He was riding a bus from Chicago back to \nschool in New York when immigration agents arrested him. He has asked \nthe Department of Homeland Security to grant him a stay, and I hope \nthey will. It makes no sense to send someone like Pedro, who has so \nmuch to contribute, to a country he barely remembers.\n  Here is what he wrote to me in a letter:\n\n       Mexico is not only unfamiliar to me, but leaving the U.S. \n     means leaving everything and everyone I know. I only hope I \n     can have a future in the U.S. for as long as I am here. Even \n     if I am left no choice but to leave for Mexico, I would still \n     strive to adjust my status and return to a place I consider \n     home--The United States of America.\n\n  The last photograph I wish to show is Steve Li. This is his \nphotograph. His parents brought him to the United States when he was 11 \nyears old. He is a student at the City College of San Francisco where \nhe has majored in nursing and is a leader in student government. He \nwrote a letter:\n\n       My dream is to become a registered nurse at San Francisco \n     General Hospital and be a public health advocate. I want to \n     give back to my community by raising awareness about \n     preventive care and other health care issues. I am well on my \n     way to achieving that dream. By passing the DREAM Act, I will \n     be able to achieve these goals and contribute to the growing \n     health care industry.\n\n  So can we use more health care professionals? You bet we could. \nNurses, we need a lot of them. In fact, the United States imports \nthousands of foreign nurses each year in this country because we just \ndon't have enough.\n  Unfortunately, Steve Li is also in deportation proceedings. His case \nis especially complicated because while his parents are Chinese, he was \nborn in Peru. So he could be deported back to Peru where he knows no \none and has no family members.\n  Senator Feinstein asked the Department of Homeland Security to \nconsider his case. They have given him a temporary stay, for now.\n  I first introduced the DREAM Act 10 years ago. Since then, I have met \nso many immigrant students who would qualify for it. When I first \nbrought up this bill I used to have meetings in Chicago. After the \nmeetings, without fail there would be someone waiting for me outside. \nSometimes in the dark of night they would be standing by my car. They \nwere always young and most of them had tears in their eyes, and they \nwould say to me: Senator Durbin, please pass the DREAM Act. It is my \nlife.\n  Times have changed. Ten years of effort, even passing it with a \nmajority, hasn't resulted in this becoming a law because of the \nRepublican filibuster. Times have changed to the point where the DREAM \nAct students are now stepping up and saying: Here we are. This is who \nwe are. We are not going to hide in the shadows anymore.\n  When we debated that bill on the floor of the Senate last December, \nthe galleries were filled with students wearing graduation gowns and \ncaps, waiting, praying for the vote, and it failed. They left, many of \nthem crying. They went downstairs, and I met with them. They couldn't \nhave felt worse. They just don't know where to turn. They are being \nrejected by the only country they have ever known, the only place they \nhave ever called home.\n  I said to them: I am not giving up on you. Don't give up on me. We \nare going to keep working on this.\n  We reintroduced the bill today. I thank my colleagues who have \nalready cosponsored it. I urge and plead with others who have not for \nsimple justice and fairness. Give these young people a chance. That is \nall they are asking for.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me express my great appreciation \nto Senator Durbin of Illinois for his many years of leadership on this \nissue. I am very proud to be a cosponsor of his legislation, and I look \nforward to passing this bill.\n  I am reminded of the story in the Bible of Joshua at Jericho. It was \nnot the first time around Jericho that the horns of Joshua and his \nIsraelite Army brought down the walls. If I recall the Bible correctly, \nit was seven times around those walls before they came tumbling down, \nbut tumble down is what they did.\n  I look forward to joining the Joshua of this crusade, Senator Durbin, \nto go around those walls as long as it takes in order to get the DREAM \nAct passed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 952\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote the strengthening of the Haitian private \nsector; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \nlead to the establishment of the Haitian-American Enterprise Fund. The \nHaitian-American Enterprise Fund bill authorizes the Administration to \nallocate, from existing resources, such sums as required to create the \nFund. The mission of the Fund will be to help empower Haiti's private \nsector to create jobs, which will contribute towards achieving long-\nterm social stability and economic growth.\n  Last month, I asked six of the most distinguished directors of the \nformer enterprise funds in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union \nto travel to Haiti to evaluate the current status of Haiti's private \nsector, the scope of U.S. Government efforts targeting sustainable job \ncreation, and the role, if any, an enterprise fund might play there in \npromoting economic growth. Led by Kim Davis, a founder of the private \nequity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners, each member of the Delegation \nhas had a very successful private sector career and each traveled to \nHaiti, at his or her own expense, in order to provide the Congress an \nexperienced perspective as to whether proven economic growth strategies \nthey employed to strengthen other fragile countries might work in \nHaiti. They were also asked to describe what immediate actions they \nwould recommend, if any, to jump-start Haiti's private sector, with a \nparticular emphasis on entrepreneurship, and other initiatives that \ncould assist Haiti in its necessary transition to a nation with a \nmiddle class and a market economy.\n  In a recent letter to me, Haitian President-elect Michel Martelly \nnoted he is fully supportive of efforts to create an enterprise fund \nfor Haiti. Enterprise funds have historically filled important voids in \nthe nascent capital markets of fragile economies. President-elect \nMartelly has indicated a keen interest in creating an enterprise fund \nin order to generate lending vehicles for mortgages and agricultural \nloans--as housing and agricultural production rank among his top \npriorities. There are many other voids in Haiti's economy that have \nbeen identified, which previous enterprise funds have effectively \nworked to address in other countries.\n  The Delegation's report makes clear that enterprise funds are not \nsilver bullets. However, at a time when we face significant domestic \nand global economic challenges, the enterprise fund model, if \nimplemented effectively, provides a proven vehicle by which the U.S. \nGovernment can leverage the extensive intellectual and financial \ncapital of the American business community in order to help address \nthese challenges in underdeveloped economies such as that of Haiti. As \nan example, the Polish Fund received a USG grant of $240 million in \n1990 and used that to attract more than $2.3 billion to Poland over the \nnext several years.\n  Since Senator Leahy and I introduced legislation authorizing the \ncreation of an enterprise fund for Haiti in April 2010, the \nAdministration has requested that enterprise funds also be created for \nPakistan, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan. Such keen interest in utilizing \nthe enterprise fund model for advancing sustainable economic growth is \nwelcomed. Empowering a group of U.S. citizens who understand democratic \ncapitalism to help translate our foreign assistance strategies into \npractical actions will complement the important work performed by our \ncapable diplomats and development experts.\n  The May 14, 2011 inauguration of Mr. Martelly as President of Haiti \nprovides an opportunity to start anew. Congress should aide the \nPresident-elect in this important effort by honoring his request for \nthe creation of a Haitian-American Enterprise Fund. I ask for your \nsupport on passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 957. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code to improve the \nprovision of rehabilitative services for veterans with traumatic brain \ninjury, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, traumatic brain injury, TBI, is becoming \nan increasingly common injury on the modern battlefield. Thankfully, \nbecause of advances in medicine, service-members who would not have \nbeen expected to survive catastrophic attacks in previous conflicts are \nreturning home today from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan with \nunprecedented severe and complex injuries. Since 2001, over 1,500 \nservice members have suffered from a severe TBI, many of whom require \nrehabilitative programs ranging from total care for the most basic \nneeds to semi-independent living support. A restrictive approach to \nrehabilitation puts these wounded warriors at risk of losing any \nprogress they made towards recovery. For this reason, my colleague, \nSenator Mark Begich of Alaska, and I are introducing the Veterans' \nTraumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitative Services' Improvements Act of \n2011. I would also like to thank my House colleagues, Rep. Tim Walz of \nMinnesota and Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida, for their support and \nleadership on the House companion version of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Traumatic Brain \n     Injury Rehabilitative Services' Improvements Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REHABILITATIVE SERVICES FOR VETERANS WITH TRAUMATIC \n                   BRAIN INJURY.\n\n       (a) Rehabilitation Services in Plans for Rehabilitation and \n     Reintegration.--Section 1710C of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1), by inserting before the semicolon \n     the following: ``with the goal of maximizing the individual's \n     independence and quality of life'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by inserting after ``improving'' the following: ``(and \n     sustaining improvement in)'';\n       (ii) by inserting ``behavioral,'' after ``cognitive'';\n       (iii) by inserting ``and mental health'' after \n     ``functioning''; and\n       (iv) by inserting ``, quality of life,'' after \n     ``independence'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``rehabilitative \n     services and'' before ``rehabilitative components''; and\n       (C) in paragraph (3)--\n       (i) by striking ``treatments'' the first place it appears \n     and inserting ``services''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``treatments and'' the second place it \n     appears; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Rehabilitative Services Defined.--For purposes of \n     this section, and sections 1710D and 1710E of this title, the \n     term `rehabilitative services' includes--\n       ``(1) rehabilitative services, as such term is defined in \n     section 1701 of this title;\n       ``(2) services (which may be of ongoing duration) to \n     sustain, and prevent loss of, functional gains that have been \n     achieved; and\n       ``(3) any other services or supports that may contribute to \n     maximizing an individual's independence and quality of \n     life.''.\n       (b) Rehabilitation Services in Comprehensive Program for \n     Long-term Rehabilitation.--Section 1710D(a) of such title is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``and rehabilitative services (as defined \n     in section 1710C of this title)'' after ``long-term care''; \n     and\n       (2) by striking ``treatment''.\n       (c) Rehabilitation Services in Authority for Cooperative \n     Agreements for Use of Non-Department Facilities for \n     Rehabilitation.--Section 1710E(a) of such title is amended by \n     inserting ``, including rehabilitative services (as defined \n     in section 1710C of this title),'' after ``medical \n     services''.\n       (d) Technical Amendment.--Section 1710C(c)(2)(S) of such \n     title is amended by striking ``opthamologist'' and inserting \n     ``ophthalmologist''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/11/senate-section/article/S2889-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2889-S2890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 179--TO CONSTITUTE THE MINORITY PARTY'S MEMBERSHIP ON \nCERTAIN COMMITTEES FOR THE ONE HUNDRED TWELFTH CONGRESS, OR UNTIL THEIR \n                         SUCCESSORS ARE CHOSEN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 180\n\n       Whereas, in March 2011, large-scale peaceful demonstrations \n     began to take place in Syria;\n       Whereas the Government of Syria, led by President Bashar \n     al-Assad, responded to protests by launching a violent \n     crackdown, committing human rights abuses, and violating its \n     international obligations, including the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the United \n     Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \n     or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;\n       Whereas demonstrations have now spread to more than a dozen \n     towns and cities across all parts of Syria;\n       Whereas demonstrators initially demanded political reform, \n     but under violent attack by the Government of Syria, have \n     increasingly demanded a change in the Syrian regime;\n       Whereas Insan, a respected international nongovernmental \n     organization, has documented more than 600 deaths since \n     demonstrations began in Syria, and reported that ``arbitrary \n     detained and enforceable disappearance in the country easily \n     exceeds 8,000 people'';\n       Whereas the Government of Syria has deployed tanks and \n     snipers against civilian population centers, including the \n     cities of Daraa and Baniyas, and the Damascus suburbs of \n     Douma, Harasta, Saqba, and Zabadani;\n       Whereas the Government of Syria has cut off civilian \n     population centers from access to food, water, electricity, \n     mobile and land lines, Internet, and medical services;\n       Whereas several respected international human rights \n     organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the Damascus \n     Center for Human Rights Studies, have documented a nationwide \n     campaign of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of \n     activists, protesters, and their family members, by the \n     Government of Syria;\n       Whereas the International Crisis Group, an independent \n     international nongovernmental organization, reported on May \n     3, 2011, that there is ``ongoing, credible evidence'' in \n     Syria of ``abundant instances of excessive and indiscriminate \n     state violence. . . including arbitrary arrests, torture and \n     firing into peaceful crowds'';\n       Whereas the International Crisis Group has also reported a \n     ``determined and cynical attempt to exploit and exacerbate'' \n     sectarian tensions by the Government of Syria;\n       Whereas, despite sectarian provocations by the Government \n     of Syria, demonstrations have maintained a message of \n     national unity and solidarity;\n       Whereas, on April 15, 2011, the United Nations Special \n     Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Christof Heyns, \n     stated that live ammunition has been used by the Syrian \n     regime against demonstrators ``in clear violation of \n     international law'';\n       Whereas international organizations, including Amnesty \n     International and Human Rights Watch, have documented \n     evidence that peaceful protestors detained by Government of \n     Syria security forces are being subjected to torture, \n     including with electro-shock devices, cables, sticks, and \n     whips, and are being held in overcrowded cells, deprived of \n     sleep, food, and water for days at a time;\n       Whereas international non-governmental organizations, \n     including the International Committee on the Red Cross and \n     Human Rights Watch, have reported that Government of Syria \n     security forces have prevented injured protesters from \n     accessing hospitals and have denied medical personnel and \n     humanitarian relief organizations access to those in need of \n     medical attention;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran is providing material \n     support to assist the Government of Syria in its efforts to \n     suppress peaceful protestors, including the transfer of \n     equipment to help security forces crack down on protests and \n     curtail and monitor protesters' use of the Internet, cell \n     phones, and text-messaging;\n       Whereas the White House Press Secretary has repeatedly \n     condemned the Government of Syria's brutal crackdown, \n     including on May 6, 2011, when he stated, ``The Syrian \n     government continues to follow the lead of its Iranian ally \n     in resorting to brute force and flagrant violations of human \n     rights in suppressing peaceful protests.'';\n       Whereas the Department of State has repeatedly condemned \n     the Government of Syria's brutal crackdown, including on May \n     6, 2011, when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned \n     ``in the strongest possible terms'' the Government of Syria's \n     continued use of force and intimidation against peaceful \n     protestors and pledged to ``hold to account senior Syrian \n     officials and others responsible for the reprehensible human \n     rights abuses'';\n       Whereas, on April 29, 2011, President Obama issued an \n     Executive Order authorizing targeted sanctions against \n     individuals and organizations responsible for the human \n     rights abuses in Syria;\n       Whereas President Obama on April 29, 2011, designated 3 \n     individuals pursuant to the Executive Order issued that same \n     day: Mahir al-Assad, the brother of Syrian President Bashar \n     al-Assad and brigade commander in the Syrian Army's 4th \n     Armored Division; Atif Najib, the former head of the \n     Political Security Directorate for Daraa Province and a \n     cousin of Bashar al-Assad; and Ali Mamluk, director of \n     Syria's General Intelligence Directorate;\n       Whereas, on May 6, 2011, envoys of the European Union's 27 \n     nations agreed to impose sanctions on the Government of Syria \n     for the human rights abuses it is perpetrating, including \n     asset freezes and visa bans on 13 members of the Government \n     of Syria and an arms embargo on the country;\n       Whereas, on April 29, 2011, the United Nations Human Rights \n     Council passed Resolution S-16/1, which condemns the Syrian \n     regime for its human rights abuses and establishes a mandate \n     for an international inquiry led by the Office of the United \n     Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate all \n     alleged violations of international human rights law in Syria \n     ``with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring full \n     accountability'';\n       Whereas the Government of Syria, prior to March 2011, had a \n     well-documented track record of human rights abuses against \n     its own citizens and violations of international agreements \n     and international law;\n       Whereas, in February 1982, the Syrian army, under the \n     orders of then-Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, killed at \n     least 10,000 civilians in the city of Hama in an effort to \n     quell an uprising there;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State's most recent \n     Human Rights Country Report, published on April 8, 2011, the \n     Government of Syria commits unlawful killings against \n     civilians; has severely and systematically restricted basic \n     freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and \n     religion; is responsible for ongoing politically motivated \n     arrests, detentions, and disappearances; lacks an independent \n     judiciary system; and maintains prisons where torture and \n     physical abuse are widespread and where detainees lack access \n     to food, proper clothing, and medical treatment;\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated Syria since \n     1979 as a ``state sponsor of terrorism'' and according to the \n     Department of State's most recent ``Country Reports on \n     Terrorism,'' published in August 2010, the Government of \n     Syria provides ``political and material support to Hizballah \n     in Lebanon and allowed Iran to resupply this organization \n     with weapons'';\n       Whereas the Government of Syria's transfer of weapons to \n     Hizballah in Lebanon is in violation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006), which established an \n     arms embargo requiring all states to prevent the supply of \n     arms and weapons to militias and terrorists in Lebanon;\n       Whereas the Government of Syria has violated the \n     territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon in \n     contravention of United Nations Security Council resolutions, \n     including Resolution 425 (1978), Resolution 520 (1982), and \n     Resolution 1701 (2006);\n       Whereas Syria, as a party to the Treaty of the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, is legally bound to declare \n     all its nuclear activity to the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency (IAEA) and to place such activity under the monitoring \n     of the IAEA;\n       Whereas the IAEA issued a report on February 25, 2011, \n     criticizing Syria's implementation of the NPT Safeguards \n     Agreement, concluding that ``Syria has not cooperated with \n     the Agency since June 2008'' in connection with the Agency's \n     investigation of the Dair Alzour site and 3 other locations'' \n     and warning that ``the Agency has not been able to make \n     progress towards resolving the outstanding issues related to \n     those sites'';\n       Whereas it has been widely reported that the Government of \n     Syria was developing a covert nuclear program, in violation \n     of its international obligations under the NPT, until that \n     site was bombed by Israel in September 2007; and\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\n       Whereas, on December 12, 2003, Congress passed the Syria \n     Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of \n     2003 (Public Law 108-175) in order to, among other purposes, \n     hold the Government of Syria accountable for its actions and \n     as expression of support consistent with these aims: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses solidarity and support for the people of \n     Syria as they seek to exercise universal rights and pursue \n     peaceful democratic change;\n       (2) strongly condemns and deplores the human rights abuses \n     of the Government of Syria, including the use of arbitrary \n     and lethal violence and deployment of military forces against \n     peaceful demonstrators;\n       (3) strongly condemns and deplores the Government of \n     Syria's extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, \n     torture, and arbitrary and mass arrests against civilians in \n     Syria;\n       (4) strongly condemns and deplores the deliberate cut-off \n     of water, electricity, food, telecommunications, and other \n     basic services to civilian population centers in Syria;\n       (5) strongly condemns the Government of Iran for assisting \n     the Government of Syria in its campaign of violence and \n     repression against the people of Syria;\n       (6) warns that international crimes are being committed by \n     the Government of Syria against its people, for which the \n     responsible officials must be held accountable;\n       (7) finds that the Government of Syria, led by Bashar al-\n     Assad, through its campaign of violence and gross human \n     rights abuses, has lost legitimacy and expresses support for \n     the people of Syria to determine their future for themselves;\n       (8) commends President Obama for authorizing targeted \n     sanctions on human rights abusers in Syria, including United \n     States visa bans and asset freezes, and using that authority \n     to designate 3 individuals;\n       (9) urges the President to act swiftly to expand the list \n     of sanctioned persons to include all individuals responsible \n     for gross human rights abuses in Syria, including Bashar al-\n     Assad;\n       (10) urges the President to speak out directly, and \n     personally, to the people of Syria about the situation in \n     their country;\n       (11) urges the President to work, in conjunction with \n     international partners, to ensure access of humanitarian \n     relief organizations, medical workers, and international \n     media to affected areas of Syria, and to impose consequences \n     on the Government of Syria and its leaders if access by these \n     organizations continues to be impeded;\n       (12) urges the President to work, in conjunction with \n     international partners, to ensure access by the people of \n     Syria to accurate news and information, as well as \n     information and social networking technologies;\n       (13) urges the President to continue to work with the \n     European Union, the Government of Turkey, the Arab League, \n     the Gulf Cooperation Council, and other allies and partners \n     to bring an end to human rights abuses in Syria, hold the \n     perpetrators accountable, and support the aspirations of the \n     people of Syria;\n       (14) encourages United States officials, including through \n     the United States Embassy in Damascus, to engage with civil \n     society in Syria, including human rights and democracy \n     activists, political dissidents, and opposition leaders;\n       (15) urges the President to work with our allies and \n     partners at the United Nations Security Council to condemn \n     and hold accountable human rights abusers in Syria and to \n     support the human rights of the people of Syria; and\n       (16) urges the United Nations Human Rights Council--\n       (A) to swiftly implement United Nations Human Rights \n     Council Resolution S-16/1 and to ensure that the \n     international investigation into violations by the Government \n     of Syria of international human rights law called for in the \n     resolution is undertaken immediately; and\n       (B) reinforce the crucial need for the United Nations \n     General Assembly to reject Syria's candidacy for membership \n     on the Human Rights Council and terminate the consideration \n     of Syria's candidacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",
