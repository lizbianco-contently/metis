I now object to any further proceedings on this matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar under rule XIV.\n\n\n                            The DISCLOSE Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson, one of our greatest \nPresidents, once said,\n\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\n\n       The end of democracy . . . will occur when government falls \n     into the hands of lending institutions and moneyed \n     corporations.\n\n  Campaign finance reform protections we have in place--and have had \nfor many years--have solved the problem Jefferson talked about by \nlimiting political spending by corporations. Then out of nowhere came \nthe Supreme Court to issue its Citizens United opinion, rolling back a \ncentury of work to make elections transparent and credible.\n  The result of Citizens United has been a flood of corporate, special-\ninterest campaign spending by shadowy front groups with questionable \nmotives. Not since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican who put a \nstop to unlimited corporate donations, has America seen this kind of \nout-of-control spending to influence elections.\n  Democrats and the majority of Americans believe the Supreme Court got \nit very wrong with Citizens United. Anonymous spending by so-called \nnonprofits, often backed by huge corporate donors or a few wealthy \nindividuals, used to make up 1 percent of election spending. This year \nit will make up well over half of the spending. There is no question \nCitizens United opened the door for big corporations and foreign \nentities to secretly spend hundreds of millions of dollars to influence \nelections and undermine the fairness and integrity of the process. Let \nus look at Nevada. Through the first part of this year, more money has \nbeen spent per capita on TV ads in Nevada than in any other State in \nthe country. Most of the ads have been funded by anonymous groups flush \nwith cash from these huge oil interests, Wall Street, moneyed \ninterests, foreign gambling interests, and other interests seeking \ngreater influence in Washington.\n  Voters in Nevada and across the country deserve to know who paid for \nthese ads. We have proven it is possible to remove the veil of secrecy \nfrom outside money and make the process more transparent. We have done \nthat before and we need to do it again. We can require large political \ndonors to disclose their identities so voters can at least judge their \nmotivations for themselves.\n  Requiring large donors to disclose their entities is not a new \nconcept. In fact, my counterpart, Senator McConnell, and many of his \nRepublican colleagues, have supported this in the past. The legislation \ntoday before the Senate--the DISCLOSE Act--would require disclosure of \ndonations in excess of $10,000 if they are used for campaign purposes.\n  The bill treats all political entities equally--whether unions, \ncorporations, business associations, or super PACs. And contrary to \nRepublican claims, this legislation would not require organizations to \nturn over membership rosters or lists of grassroots donors. Rather, it \nwould prevent corporations and wealthy individuals from using front \ngroups to shield their donations from disclosure.\n  Yet my Republican colleagues, with rare exception, have lined up \nagainst this commonsense legislation. Their newfound opposition to \ntransparency makes one wonder who they are trying to protect. Perhaps \nRepublicans want to shield a handful of billionaires willing to \ncontribute nine figures to sway a close Presidential election.\n  If this flood of outside money continues, the day after the election \n17 angry old White men will wake up and realize they have just bought \nthe country. That is a sad commentary. About 60 percent or more of \nthese outside dollars are coming from these 17 people.\n  These donors have something in common with their nominee. Like Mitt \nRomney, they believe they play by their own set of rules. Mitt Romney \nhas refused to release his tax returns. I think everybody in America \nnow knows that. From the one and only return we have seen, we know Mitt \nRomney pays a lower tax rate than most middle-class families. We know \nhe has a Swiss bank account. We know he takes advantage of tax shelters \nin the Cayman Islands and tax shelters in Bermuda. But we can only \nguess what new secrets would be revealed if we could examine a dozen \nyears of his tax returns. His father, George Romney, set the standard \nfor Presidential elections. He released 12 years of tax returns so \nAmericans could evaluate his record for themselves. His son should also \nlet his records out so we can evaluate his record for ourselves.\n  Even nominees for Cabinet posts are required to release 3 years of \ntax returns and declare financial holdings worth more than $1,000. \nRomney's refusal to be open and honest would disqualify him from even \nbeing a Cabinet secretary. And his penchant for secrecy makes Americans \nwonder: What is he hiding?\n  Thomas Jefferson famously argued: Democracy depends on an informed \nelectorate. If that is true--and I believe it is--it stands to reason \ndisclosure can only strengthen our democracy. But don't take my word \nfor it. As my friend Senator McConnell has said, ``Disclosure is the \nbest disinfectant.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            The DISCLOSE Act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later today Senate Democrats will show \nwhere their legislative priorities truly lie.\n  At a moment when the American people are reeling from the slowest \neconomic recovery in modern times, and just 5\\1/2\\ months away from the \nculmination of tax hikes and spending cuts already being referred to \naround the world as America's fiscal cliff, Senate Democrats want us to \nwaste our time on the DISCLOSE Act, a bill that has only two \ndiscernible purposes: to create the impression of mischief where there \nis none, and to send a signal to unions that Democrats are just as \neager to do their legislative bidding as ever.\n  Think about it. We have had 41 straight months of unemployment above \n8 percent. It has been more than 3 years since the Democratic Senate \npassed a budget, but this is what they want to do.\n  For months Republicans have been urging Democrats to do something \nabout the approaching fiscal cliff now, before it is too late. The \nAmerican people don't expect us to see every crisis that comes around \nthe corner, but they should be able to expect us to do something about \nthe problems we do see and that we know are coming. Yet last week \nPresident Obama signaled that he and his campaign advisers think it is \ngood politics to keep the threat of these looming tax hikes on everyone \nright on the table as supposed leverage in an effort to raise taxes on \nnearly 1 million business owners right now.\n  As the Washington Post reported this morning, not only do Democrats \nin Congress agree with him, they are ready and willing to go right off \nthe fiscal cliff if they don't get their way. In their near fanatical \ncrusade to inflict even more pain on American businesses, Democrats are \nnow openly admitting that they plan to wait until this debate reaches \nfull throttle and Americans are panicked about the outcome to do \nanything because they think it will make it more likely they will get \ntheir way. And if they don't, then so be it. They are ready to accept \nthe economic and fiscal consequences. They see a crisis coming, and \nthey don't want to waste it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said that not doing anything and \nwalking off this fiscal cliff would lead to a recession. The IMF chief \nsays it would threaten the global economy. Yet Senate Democrats today \nare announcing they are perfectly ready and willing to accept all that \nif Republicans don't allow them to raise taxes on the very businesses \nwe are counting on to create the jobs we need.\n  This is what passes for governance among Democrats these days: Put \nthe American people up against a wall, pick their pockets, and then \nhope that in the midst of the scuffle they will blame it--and the \nrecession that would follow--on the Republicans.\n  Now, let's make no mistake. What the Democrats are proposing today is \nan entirely avoidable high-stakes game of chicken with the single-\nminded goal of taking more money from those who earn it for government \nto waste. The President made it very clear over the\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\nweekend that he doesn't think entrepreneurs are responsible for their \nown success. They owe it to the government. Successful entrepreneurs \nowe their success to the government. That is the attitude driving \neverything this President and his Democratic allies in Washington are \ndoing right now. Their one-point plan for getting America back on track \nis clear: You earn, we take. And if they don't get to impose it, then \nthey will welcome a recession.\n  They are so single-mindedly focused on taking the earnings of others \nfor themselves and spreading it around--in the President's famous \nphrase--that they are recklessly ignoring any proposal to prevent the \ncoming crisis in order to achieve it.\n  Last week Senate Republicans proposed a legislative solution which \nensures that no one sees their income tax go up--no one--at the end of \nthe year, legislation that creates a path for the kind of fair, broad-\nbased comprehensive tax reform members of both parties claim they want \nand which would give individuals and businesses the certainty they have \nbeen asking us to give them since the very beginning of the \nadministration.\n  We could have passed this completely reasonable proposal last week \nand put the anxiety of millions of Americans at ease with a single \nvote, but Democrats, of course, refused. They would rather keep the \ncrisis unresolved, keep it looming out there on the horizon. They think \nit gives them a political edge. They think it is good politics. And \nthey should be ashamed. They should be ashamed.\n  Consider this: It has been nearly 1 year since the President demanded \n$500 billion in automatic cuts to defense at the end of this year. Yet \nwith the date now fast approaching, we still don't know how he intends \nto handle it. The President's campaign wants people asking whether his \nopponent is hiding something on a 10-year-old tax return. How about \nwhat this President is actually concealing about his plans to slash \ndefense? With just a few months to go before these cuts devastate \ncommunities all across the country, the President has yet to outline \nhis plans.\n  Republicans in the House have already passed, and Senate Republicans \nhave proposed, concrete plans to avoid these devastating cuts to our \nnational defense. Our uniformed military deserves the certainty that \ntheir operations, training, support, and weapons systems will be fully \nfunded. Meanwhile, the President hasn't demonstrated the least bit of \ninterest in this issue--no interest whatsoever. He hasn't said a thing. \nHe is apparently more interested in blowing smoke about his opponent's \ntax returns than in talking about the tax hike he actually plans to \nimpose on the very businesses we are counting on to create the jobs \nAmericans need--not some other day but right now.\n  He would rather spend his time raising unfounded suspicions about a \nguy whose entire professional career has been a dress rehearsal for \nbringing order to a government that has become so bloated, so \ninefficient, and so bureaucratic that it is crying out for the kind of \nleadership and reform Democrats simply refuse to provide. He would \nrather attack a guy who has succeeded at just about everything he has \never done than propose a solution himself. And the reason, of course, \nis perfectly clear: Washington Democrats are worried he might succeed \nat reforming government too. They don't want to give him the chance.\n  Think about it. The economy is flat on its back, millions are \nstruggling to find work, and Democrats aren't outlining a solution. \nThey are plotting about how to take advantage of it to advance an \nideological agenda most Americans oppose and to cast doubt about \nanybody who poses a serious threat to the crony-capitalist bureaucratic \nfavor factory right here in Washington.\n  Where the rest of us see the worst economic recovery in modern times, \nDemocrats see another opportunity to use a crisis to grow the \ngovernment, and that is what they are focused on--not on providing hope \nand relief for already struggling Americans but providing more tax \ndollars for the government to waste and misdirect. In the meantime they \nwill waste our time with bills like this one which they know will not \npass but will give them a chance to make a fuss about a problem that \ndoesn't exist--and blow a kiss to the unions for good measure.\n  But if we are going to have to vote on proceeding to this bill, I \nwould like to take a moment to explain why it is not only exhibit A in \nhow completely irresponsible Democrats are being right now, but why it \nis such a terrible idea in itself.\n  First, a point on process. When the history books are written, the \n112th Congress may well be known as the Congress of irrelevant \ncommittees--the Congress of irrelevant committees. There once was a day \nwhen committees held hearings on bills, debated them, offered \namendments, and reported them out for full Senate consideration. Now it \nis find a bill, put it on the calendar, move to proceed, file cloture, \nlose, and repeat. That is today's Senate. Committees are not being used \nto generate good legislation. In other words, they are viewed as an \nobstacle to overcome in the effort to make a point in front of the \ncameras on the Senate floor. The latest such effort is the DISCLOSE \nAct, a bill aimed at doing something about people exercising their \nfirst amendment rights to participate in the process.\n  My question is, do something about what? Do something about races \nwhich previously would not have been competitive but now are? Do \nsomething about individuals and organizations criticizing unpopular \npositions and policies? Do something about groups advocating on behalf \nof their members to promote or oppose the very positions for which \ntheir members joined? As George Will has pointed out, the political \nprocess is not a private club with the parties and the candidates \ncontrolling membership. Under the Citizens United decision of 2010, \nindependent groups are now able to speak, again, under the first \namendment regardless of who, when, and about what they are speaking. \nThis is something Democrats should be celebrating, not excoriating.\n  The Founders envisioned a nation in which speech would be promoted as \nwidely as possible. That is what the first amendment is all about, \nparticularly when it comes to the political process. The purpose of \nthis legislation is totally clear. After Citizens United, Democrats \nrealized they could not shut up their critics so they decided to go \nafter the microphone instead by trying to scare off the funders. As \nSenator Schumer put it during debate on an earlier version of this \nbill, `` . . . the deterrent effect should not be underestimated.'' \nThat was Senator Schumer on the real purpose of this bill: ``The \ndeterrent effect should not be underestimated.''\n  Just as with the DISCLOSE Act of 2010, this amounts to nothing more \nthan member and donor harassment and intimidation and is all part of a \nbroader government-led intimidation effort by this administration. \nThere are parallel efforts going on at the FCC, the SEC, the IRS, the \nDOJ, and the White House itself to silence its critics.\n  The creation of a modern day Nixonian ``enemy's list'' is currently \nin full swing and, frankly, the American people should not stand for \nit. As I have said before, no individual or group in this country \nshould have to face harassment or intimidation or incur crippling \nexpenses defending themselves against their own government simply \nbecause the Government does not like the message they are advocating. \nBut that is what we are seeing.\n  My own view has always been, if you cannot convince people of the \nwisdom of your policies, then you need to come up with some better \narguments. Instead, the left has resorted to tactics such as the \npending legislation. This legislation is an unprecedented requirement \nfor groups to publicly disclose their donors, stripping a protection \nrecognized and solidified by the courts. As a result of this \nlegislation, advocacy groups ranging from the NAACP to the Sierra Club, \nto the Chamber of Commerce, all of which already disclose their donors \nto the IRS, would now be forced to subject their members to public \nintimidation and harassment. Why? For supporting organizations and \ngroups whose goals they agree with.\n  Predictably, unions are exempted from the kind of disclosure \nDemocrats now want to impose on everybody else. The so-called stand by \nyour ad provision in an earlier version has done a\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\nDavid Copperfield and entirely vanished.\n  I am not advocating for the provision but simply to note its absence, \nwhich proves the primary goal of this bill is not good government or \ntransparency but targeted speech suppression. That is what this is \nabout--targeted speech suppression.\n  I have to give the authors credit, whoever they are. They actually \nlist labor unions as a covered organization in the bill. However, \nthrough an elaborate scheme of thresholds and triggers, they might as \nwell have saved the ink, since unions are largely given a free pass by \nthis bill, despite the fact they are, by far, the biggest players in \npolitical campaigns in our entire country. No one else comes close--\nalmost all of it, of course, on the Democratic side.\n  As the Wall Street Journal reported last week, labor unions spent a \ntotal of $4.4 billion on campaigns from 2005 to 2011, a staggering \namount of money and perfectly within their rights, I would add, under \nthe first amendment.\n  Let's be clear. The other side may be able to whip the media up into \na lather over the increased participation of individuals and groups \nthat do not like the direction this President has taken our country, \nbut the big money is coming from the left in the form of mandatory dues \nto labor unions. To the left, big money from individuals and \ncorporations is a problem. But the nearly $800 million spent by unions \nin 2008, oh, that is just fine and dandy--as long as nearly 100 percent \nof it goes to their own campaigns.\n  As supporters of this legislation have readily admitted, the real \ntarget of this bill is to protect themselves from criticism over their \nwildly unpopular policies and positions. This is precisely why this \nlegislation has been opposed by business groups from coast to coast and \nopposed by everyone from the NRA--which is key voting this vote--to the \nACLU, to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. I greatly appreciate all the \neffort these folks have put into educating and advocating on this \nissue.\n  I will certainly do everything in my power to protect the first \namendment rights from DISCLOSE, the sequel, and I ask my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join with me in voting no. We have many \nserious problems in this country. Too much free speech is not one of \nthem.\n  Democrats can call this bill whatever they want, but they cannot \nconceal its true intent, which is to encourage their allies and \ndiscourage their critics from exercising their first amendment right to \nspeak their mind. If Democrats do not like the level playing field \nensured by the first amendment and reaffirmed by Citizens United, they \nshould do a better job convincing the American people of the wisdom of \ntheir policies and focus on real problems instead of inventing ones \nthat do not exist. To this point, I once again urge our friends to put \nthe political games aside and do something now about the fiscal cliff \nthat is approaching before it is too late. Our Nation has been mired in \nan economic coma for years. More people signed up for disability last \nmonth than found a job. The number of Americans on food stamps \ncontinues to climb. It is all about to get worse, and we have a \nPresident who is on a single-minded crusade to punish business owners \neven more.\n  Republicans have proposed serious, concrete ideas for addressing the \nproblems we face, but we cannot do any of it if the President and his \nDemocratic allies in Congress refuse to join us. Unfortunately, that is \nwhere we are. Democrats have made their priorities perfectly clear and, \nsadly, the American people they were elected to serve appear to be very \nmuch at the bottom of the list.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The sacrifices of Americans in uniform and their families \nembody the courage, honor, and patriotism that we must always remember.\n  Today I am here to pay my respects to Army SGT Michael Strachota, an \nArkansas soldier who sacrificed his life for the love of this country \nin support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Sergeant Strachota graduated from Pine Bluff High School in Pine \nBluff, AR in 2002. In 2007 he enlisted in the Army and was assigned to \nthe 96th Transportation Company, 180th Transportation Battalion, 13th \nSustainment Command at Fort Hood, TX.\n  Sergeant Strachota was aware of the dangers he faced having served a \nprevious deployment to Iraq in 2009. His family says that Michael was \nproud of his job and recalled to Arkansas newspapers how excited he was \nabout his position and how he wanted to pursue a new direction in the \nmilitary as an Army Ranger or pilot.\n  Sergeant Strachota's family said he was known for his friendly, out-\ngoing, and generous nature and his love of the outdoors and riding \nmotorcycles. Most of all he was devoted to his family. He delayed his \nR to be home for his son's birthday on July 5th.\n  Sergeant Michael Strachota answered the highest call for this \ncountry. He is a true American hero. I ask my colleagues to keep his \nwife Lauren, son William and the rest of this family and friends in \ntheir thoughts and prayers during these difficult times. I humbly offer \nmy sincerest gratitude for his selfless service and patriotism for this \nNation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the DISCLOSE Act \nof 2012, legislation that will shine some much needed light into the \nflood of secret money that is now polluting our elections. I would like \nto open with thanks to Senators Chuck Schumer, Mike Bennet, Al Franken, \nJeff Merkley, Jeanne Shaheen, and Tom Udall for their hard work in our \ntask force that developed this legislation. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them through this debate.\n  On Thursday, Majority Leader Reid moved to proceed to this vital \npiece of legislation, and we will vote on it this evening. I thank the \nleader. I and many of my colleagues are looking forward to the \nopportunity to make the case for this important measure. But in a \nsense, for the American public, the case has already been made. As \nanyone who watches television knows, our airwaves are filled with \npolitical attack ads. The organizations paying for many of these ads \nhave patriotic and benign-sounding names with words such as \n``prosperity'' and ``freedom'' and ``future'' frequently to be found. \nThese names sound harmless, but all too often the ads are actually paid \nfor by secret special interests, such as billionaires and wealthy \ncorporations seeking secret special influence in our democracy. In the \nprocess, they drown out the voices of regular American families who \nwish to participate in elections.\n  The Republican leader indicated we were going after the impression of \nmischief where there is none. Many Americans certainly have the \nimpression of mischief.\n  As U.S.A. Today put it last week in an editorial supporting this \nDISCLOSE Act:\n\n       Everybody's watching what's expected to be by far the most \n     expensive presidential campaign in history, and not without a \n     dose of horror. Freed by the Supreme Court from spending \n     limits, all manner of special interests are opening the \n     spigots to buy influence.\n\n  Here is how my home State paper, the Providence Journal, explained \nthe Citizens United decision that unleashed this torrent of special \ninterest money.\n\n       The [Citizens United] ruling will mean that more than ever, \n     big-spending economic interests will determine who gets \n     elected. More money will especially pour into relentless \n     attack campaigns. Free speech for most\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\n     individuals will suffer because their voices will count for \n     even less than they do now. They will simply be drowned out \n     by the big money.\n\n  I think the Providence Journal hit the nail right on the head. What \nhas happened since the Citizens United decision has, in fact, proved \nthem right. Senator John McCain said earlier this year:\n\n       The United States Supreme Court--in what I think is one of \n     the worst decisions in history--struck down the restrictions \n     in the so-called McCain-Feingold law, and a lot of people \n     don't agree with that, but I predicted when the United States \n     Supreme Court, with their absolute ignorance of what happens \n     in politics, struck down that law, that there would be a \n     flood of money into campaigns, not transparent, unaccounted \n     for, and this is exactly what is happening.\n\n  Senator McCain is right. This is exactly what is happening. It is not \nan impression of mischief, it is mischief on the loose.\n  Richard Posner, a leading conservative legal scholar and a Federal \njudge, recently said:\n\n       Our political system is pervasively corrupt due to our \n     Supreme Court taking away campaign-contribution restrictions \n     on the basis of the First Amendment.\n\n  Our political system is pervasively corrupt. This is from a \nconservative Federal judge.\n  The impact of Citizens United has been very clear. In the 2010 \nmidterm elections, the first after Citizens United, there was a more \nthan a fourfold increase in expenditures from super PACs and other \noutside groups compared to 2006--$69 million up to $305 million--with \nnearly three-quarters of political advertising coming from sources that \nwere prohibited from spending money back in 2006. Also, in 2010, those \n501(c)(4)s and (c)(6) not-for-profit organizations spent more than $135 \nmillion in unlimited and secret political contributions. Anonymous \nspending rose from 1 percent of outside spending in 2006 to 44 percent \nin 2010.\n  We are already seeing the influence of money on the 2012 elections. \nSuper PACs and other outside groups have spent over $150 million in \nthis election cycle, about twice of what was spent in the same period \nof 2008 during the last Presidential election.\n  Nondisclosing groups, said the New York Times, ``have accounted for \ntwo-thirds of the political advertising bought by the biggest outside \nspenders so far in the 2012 election cycle . . . with close to $100 \nmillion in issue ads.''\n  Campaigns are no longer waged by candidates and parties fighting over \nideas, they are now waged by shadowy political attack groups posing as \nsocial welfare organizations run by the likes of Karl Rove and other \npolitical operatives and fueled by millions of undisclosed dollars from \nsecret special interests. When these secret special interests take over \nour elections this way, it drowns out the voices of regular individual \nAmericans. It also puts in jeopardy some of the key pillars of a strong \nmiddle class, pillars such as Medicare, Social Security, and Pell \ngrants that have paved the way for generations to achieve the American \ndream but have always been the targets of special interests.\n  These special interests have motives. They have motives to spend this \nkind of money. If those motives were good for America and were welcomed \nby the average American, they wouldn't need and wouldn't want to keep \nthem secret. We need to ask ourselves a very important question: What \nare they hiding? Why do they demand secrecy? Whatever the answer, one \nthing is clear: Americans who worry that Washington is too beholden to \nspecial interests now need to be concerned more than ever. Hang onto \nyour wallets, here come the special interests, and you won't even know \nwho they are.\n  As recently reported in the New York Times, secret spending groups \nhave accounted for two-thirds of this advertising. Two-thirds of ad \nspending from groups, other than candidates or parties, has come from \nsecretive corporations and billionaires whose names and agendas the \nvoters may never know and who will have no accountability for how that \nmoney is spent. Impression of mischief, indeed.\n  Of course, when we don't have accountability, there is no limit to \nwhat people will say. One of the restraints on the vitriol and the \nfilth that is so often part of the American political debate is that \ncandidates have to stand by their ads. If someone says something that \nis awful, if they engage in relentless negative attacks, voters may \ncharge them a price for that. They may find that unwelcome. That, of \ncourse, disappears when the name behind the ad is attached to no living \nperson or corporation. It is just an entity, a sham, a phony, a shell.\n  How has this worked out? Not well for the American public. An April \nstudy found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have \nbeen negative. That is up from only 9 percent through the same period \nin 2008. In 2008, 9 percent of ads in that time period had been \nnegative. In this cycle, 70 percent have been negative. Over the last 6 \nmonths, if we look at the four top-spending political 501(c)(4) \norganizations, the ones that don't have to disclose their donors, they \nspent an estimated 85 percent of their election spending on ads \ncontaining deceptions. So 70 percent of the stuff out there is \nnegative, up from only 9 percent, and 85 percent of the big spenders \nare spending their money on ads that have been determined to be \ndeceptive.\n  The names of the organizations sound lovely: Americans for \nProsperity, American Future Fund, American Energy Alliance, and \nCrossroads GPS. Without knowing who funds these shadowy groups, the \nAmerican voter has no idea what mischief they are up to.\n  This is all a result of the Supreme Court's disastrous and misguided \ndecision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. This is the \ndecision that opened the floodgates to unlimited and secret corporate \nand special interest money pouring into our elections.\n  This chart shows how easy it is under our current system for wealthy \ninterests to skirt existing disclosure rules and spend secret millions \nin election ads. This amounts to a form of legalized political money \nlaundering or, to use the phrase Senator McCain and I used in our brief \nto the Supreme Court, ``identity laundering.''\n  Super PACs are supposed to disclose their donors under current law, \nbut that can sometimes be weeks or months after a deceptive ad runs. If \na donor wants to avoid even that disclosure, it can set up a shell \ncorporation, which may be nothing more than a P.O. box someplace, and \nsend the money through that super PAC through a shell corporation \nwithout a real name showing up on a disclosure form. They just launder \nit through the shell corporation, and the next thing they know the \nmoney is doing their work.\n  They can also pass the money through a 501(c)(4) social welfare \norganization. I put the words ``social welfare'' in quotes because that \nis the IRS phrase that is used for these organizations. There is very \nlittle social welfare being accomplished by the big political donor \ngroups known as social welfare associations. The IRS gives nonprofit \nstatus to these groups whose primary purpose--and in many cases their \nonly purpose--is to shield big spenders from having their identities \ndisclosed. In many cases, these 501(c)(4) so-called social welfare \ngroups are so closely affiliated with the super PACs that they have all \nthe same staff and the same office space. It is a 501(c)(4) independent \nsocial welfare organization for the IRS with the same staff and the \nsame office space as a super PAC. Please. Of course, the 501(c)(4) \ngroups still don't have to disclose their donors, even when they are \nthe same staff and the same office as the super PAC.\n  On this chart, we see the money raised by one of them, Citizens \nUnited, by Republican political operatives, including Karl Rove. They \nraised money through the Crossroads PAC. It is a super PAC, and it is \nsupposed to disclose its donor. It has attached to it Crossroads GPS, a \n501(c)(4) group that is not the super PAC and it can maintain complete \nsecrecy for its donors. Guess which one has raised the most money. It \nis an easy question. It is the 501(c)(4) group that doesn't have to \ndisclose its donors. The group raised $76.8 million through 2011 as \nopposed to only $46.4 million raised by its sister super PAC. This is \nby no means a unique situation.\n  As the New York Times wrote in an editorial last Sunday in support of \nthe DISCLOSE Act, ``Corporations love the secrecy provided by Mr. \nRove's group because it protects them from scrutiny\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\nby nosy shareholders and consumers.'' They want a big influence on \nelections but without leaving any tracks.\n  An unnamed corporate lobbyist told the newspaper Politico earlier \nthis year that nondisclosure is always preferred by corporate donors. \nWhy is it preferred? Because it makes it impossible for the public and \nlaw enforcement to track down the corrupting influence of the money \nthat these corporations spend in elections. The DISCLOSE Act puts an \nend to this nonsense. It puts an end to using 501(c)(4) groups and \nshell corporations to shield the identities of big donors.\n  One thing that should not be lost in the discussion of anonymous \nspending is the fact that there is one person to whom this spending is \nnever anonymous; that is, the candidate who is either benefited or \npunished. Although the donors have managed to hide their identities \nfrom the public, they can sure tell the candidate how much money they \nare putting in the candidate's super PAC and, by the way, what position \nthey want that candidate to take on issues. What this creates is a \nperfect recipe for corruption--wealthy corporations, individuals, and \nspecial interests secretly spending millions of dollars to influence a \ncandidate in ways the public never sees.\n  A rich donor can secretly threaten massive spending against a \ncandidate without even putting up the money. If the candidate doesn't \ntake the right position on an issue, then they can pull the trigger, \nbut they can make the threat quietly.\n  Political scientist Norm Ornstein recently said:\n\n       I had this tale told to me by a number of lawmakers. You're \n     sitting in your office and a lobbyist comes in and says, \n     ``I'm working for Americans for a Better America. And I can't \n     tell you who's funding them, but I can tell you they really, \n     really want this amendment in the bill.'' And who knows what \n     they'll do. They have more money than God.\n\n  If the candidate complies, of course, the expenditure is never made, \nthere is no paper trail, no trace of that threat. Yet the system has \nbeen corrupted. Let's also dispense with the fiction that this spending \nis independent. The whole rationale for unlimited spending was that it \nwas to be done independently of candidate campaigns. The reality is \nthat super PACs are anything but independent. Campaigns and super PACS \nshare fundraising lists, donors, former staff, and consultants. \nCandidates appear at fundraisers for their super PACs. Super PACs \nrecycle ads that were originally run by the candidates. They share \nfilm. They are free to act as the evil twins of candidate campaigns, as \none FEC Commissioner put it, raising unlimited, secret money, and then \nspending it on massive amounts of advertising--most of it negative--to \nbenefit their preferred candidates.\n  Our campaign finance system is broken, and it lends itself to \ncorruption in new and unprecedented ways. Immediate action is required \nto fix it. Today we are debating a bill that will at least bring some \ntransparency and accountability into this election spending. This \nshould not be a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, and in the \npast, it has not been. It has always had bipartisan support because it \nis about protecting our Democratic process. We need to pass the \nDISCLOSE Act now.\n  The USA Today editorial said:\n\n       Citizens United left the public only one way to protect \n     itself from the rising threat: Disclosure. At the federal \n     level, this would be achieved by the DISCLOSE Act.\n\n  I thank USA Today for supporting this bill.\n  The Supreme Court also made it crystal clear in this very Citizens \nUnited decision that disclosure was an appropriate and even a necessary \npart of a healthy campaign finance system. Here is what Justice Anthony \nKennedy wrote, writing for the majority:\n\n       [P]rompt disclosure of expenditures can provide \n     shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold \n     corporations and elected officials accountable for their \n     positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether \n     their corporation's political speech advances the \n     corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can \n     see whether elected officials are in the pocket of so-called \n     moneyed interests.\n\n  The new version of the DISCLOSE Act will do exactly this. It says \nnothing more and nothing less than when corporations and other wealthy \ninterests spend money--more than $10,000--to influence our elections, \ntheir identities must be disclosed.\n  There is no question where the American people stand on this issue. \nAmericans of all political stripes are disgusted by the influence of \nunlimited, anonymous corporate cash in our elections and by campaigns \nthat succeed or fail depending on how many billionaires the candidate \nhas in his pocket--or advisers, perhaps. More and more, people feel \ntheir government responds only to wealthy and corporate interests. They \nsee their jobs disappear. They see their wages stagnate. They see \nbailouts and special deals for the big guys. And they lose faith that \ntheir elected officials will listen to them.\n  Six in ten Americans say the middle class will not catch a break in \nthis economy until we reduce the influence of lobbyists, big banks, and \nbig donors. Seven in ten Americans, nearly, including a majority of \nboth Democrats and Republicans, agree that ``new rules that let \ncorporations, unions, and people give unlimited money to super PACs \nwill lead to corruption.'' Notwithstanding what the NRA and the chamber \nand other big DC lobbying powerhouses want, they are at odds with the \nregular American people. Indeed, one in four Americans says they are \nactually less likely to vote because big donors to super PACs have so \nmuch more influence over elected officials than average Americans.\n  These numbers should be a call to arms for anyone who believes our \nAmerican democracy is one of our world's shining jewels and should be \nscrupulously, carefully, ardently protected. Indeed, people are \nanswering this call to arms in numbers that are increasing every day.\n  I have with me today here on the Senate floor 213,000 Americans--\n213,000 citizen cosponsors of this DISCLOSE Act, which were collected \nby CREDO Action. My colleagues can leaf through them and see people \nfrom Apple Valley, MN; from San Francisco, CA; from Ashland, OR; from \nAustin, TX; from Long Beach, NY; from Imperial, NE; from Yorktown \nHeights, NY; from Brick, NJ; from Schaumburg, IL; people from all \nacross the country--nearly a quarter of a million of them now--coming \nfrom all 50 States, and more than 1,000 Rhode Islanders are in this \ngroup. Unlike the corporations and the billionaires who are spending \nhundreds of millions of dollars to buy our elections and who insist on \ndoing it in secret, these regular people are unashamed to stand up for \nwhat they believe in. Their pride in civic engagement reflects the best \nvalues of America, and their numbers show that this is an issue where a \nbroad cross-section of Americans demand a change to what is happening \nin our elections.\n  Justice Antonin Scalia has written:\n\n       Requiring people to stand up in public for their political \n     acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is \n     doomed.\n\n  Our friends who have signed on as citizen cosponsors have that \ncourage, and the biggest campaign spenders in the world should as well. \nFrankly, even those big campaign spenders should be patriotic enough to \nunderstand, as Justice Scalia did, that democracy is doomed without \ncivic courage, and they should step up on their own. But, instead, they \nare hiding behind the rules and hiding their identities and trying to \nbuy influence.\n  I will conclude by saying that prior to Citizens United, there was a \nlong bipartisan tradition supporting laws that require disclosure of \nspending in elections. This bipartisan consensus may be reemerging. \nSenator John McCain of Arizona and I recently filed with the Supreme \nCourt a brief that urged the Court to reconsider the flawed premise of \nits decision in Citizens United--the false premise that independent \nexpenditures can't lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption. \nAs the statistics about anonymous spending and public perception I have \ncited make clear, this premise has been fully discredited.\n  Although the Supreme Court declined this opportunity to put our \nelections back on a saner path, I am proud to have worked in a \nbipartisan fashion on that brief with Senator McCain, who has long been \na leader in this Congress and in this country on campaign finance \nissues. I hope our partnership will mark the beginning of greater \ncooperation across party lines on this issue of vital importance to our \ndemocracy.\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\n  There are some misconceptions about the act that have colored the \npublic debate. We plan to explain during the course of the debate why \nthe critics of this bill have gotten so many things just plain wrong. \nThis act contains only the most basic provisions requiring outside \ngroups to disclose campaign-related fundraising and spending. The \nlegislation has been streamlined from the DISCLOSE Act that nearly \npassed the Senate in 2010. It places fewer burdens on covert \nadministrations. It contains no prohibitions on spending, no special \nexemptions for any group or type of group. Contrary to what the \nRepublican leader said, it does not require grassroots organizations to \ndisclose their donors, and it treats every organization exactly the \nsame right across the board.\n  Some have complained, such as a Republican witness in the Rules \nCommittee hearing on this bill, that the so-called stand-by-your-ad \nrequirements originally in the bill were too burdensome. He described \nthem, actually, as radical. So we removed them. We have tried to \naccommodate. I know that many of my colleagues, including Senator Ron \nWyden, who authored this stand-by-your-ad legislation and who has \nheroically fought for it for many years, remained very supportive of \nthese provisions, and I hope we will be able to reintroduce them at \nanother time. But we didn't, so that complaint should be closed off. \nSome complain that this was just an attempt to influence this election. \nWell, its effective date is January 1, 2013, so it will not, to the \nregret of many, influence this election.\n  According to Republican former FEC Chairman Trevor Potter, the \nDISCLOSE Act of 2012 is ``appropriately targeted, narrowly tailored, \nclearly constitutional and desperately needed.''\n  I stand ready to work with any of my colleagues, Democrats or \nRepublicans, who want to make this bill better, but we can't use \ncomplaints--particularly unjustified complaints--as an excuse to do \nnothing.\n  While the status quo of unlimited secret money may work to benefit \nsome politicians for the moment, in the long run it will hurt us all, \nregardless of party. Unlimited money is not a force that anyone can \nultimately hope to control, and unlimited secret money is even more \ndangerous. More important, the American people, who are already \nbeginning to lose faith in our electoral system, can reasonably fear \nthat their elected officials will only care about the anonymous donors \nwriting eight-figure checks in deals and gifts that they will never \nsee.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues in the Senate know this, and they \nhave supported disclosure in the past. Senator Mitch McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, for instance, was once a great advocate for \ndisclosure. As he said in 2000, ``Republicans are in favor of \ndisclosure,'' adding, ``Why would a little disclosure be better than a \nlot of disclosure?'' That question is as timely today as it was then.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will join us in passing this \nimportant piece of legislation. Help us restore the fundamental \nprinciple of a government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.\n  The Washington Post wrote yesterday in an editorial supporting this \nDISCLOSE Act:\n\n       We'd like to see a few courageous Republicans rise in the \n     Senate on Monday and declare: Enough is enough.\n\n  If our friends across the aisle decide to block this legislation \nwhich clearly reflects the will of the American people, I am prepared \nto force this issue by debating this bill long into the night. If they \nare unwilling to join us in our mission to shine a light on secret \nmoney elections, we will keep the lights on here.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the DISCLOSE Act of 2012.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Fiscal Policy\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about two related \nsubjects. Both are very much in the news, and both relate to the fiscal \ncondition in the United States and what happens on January 1 if the \nU.S. Congress and the President allow a tax increase to be imposed upon \nthe American people that will amount to the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of our country--about $4.5 trillion over 10 years. That tax \nincrease is slated to go into effect unless we stop it. The effect of \nthat tax increase on economic growth, on job creation, and on our small \nbusinesses and families will be devastating unless we act. The other \nsubject, which is also pertinent to tax policy, is a subject that has \nbeen raised by many in the Obama Presidential campaign relating to \noutsourcing of jobs. Let me speak to that first because it has a direct \nrelationship to this question of taxation.\n  In today's Wall Street Journal, there is an op-ed piece by Arthur \nLaffer and Ford Scudder called ``The Tax Cliff is a Growth Killer.'' \nLet me quote just two sentences from it:\n\n       The United States faces economic collapse thanks to massive \n     tax increases on Jan. 1, and continued deficit spending for \n     years on end.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The blunt reality is that we cannot have a prosperous \n     economy when government is overspending, raising tax rates, \n     printing too much money, overregulating and restricting the \n     free flow of goods and services across national boundaries.\n\n  Now, what does this have to do with outsourcing? There has been \ncriticism of companies that send jobs to another country or that hire \npeople in other countries to do work for them. The same thing can be \nsaid when a business no longer expands in the State in which it is \nheadquartered or operating and moves part of its business to another \nState. We have seen our States actually compete for business. The \nreason they do this, in many cases, is because the business conditions \nunder which they operate in the first State are no longer conducive to \ncompetition, for them to be able to make products or provide services \nthat are competitive with those who are working to compete against \nthem. So they have to go where labor is cheaper, where the costs are \nless, where the regulation is not as onerous, and where taxes are \nlower, perhaps--in other words, where the conditions for doing business \nare more favorable so they can continue to compete.\n  The same thing is true when jobs are sent overseas. The reality is \nAmerican businessmen are not sitting around wondering how they can be \nevil, how they can fire American workers, how they can go overseas to \ndo business. It is much easier to stay right here in the good old USA. \nFor a whole lot of reasons, they make a lot of sacrifices to keep their \nbusinesses here. But there comes a point in time when American tax \npolicy, regulatory policy, and the uncertainty of doing business here \nfinally gets to the point where--in order to stay in business, in order \nto remain competitive--they have to find places elsewhere where they \ncan do their work that enables them to remain competitive.\n  When we go to the store, and we are looking at the goods on the \nshelf, and we see the very same thing, where in one case it costs $5 \nand in the next case it costs $10, chances are we are going to buy the \n$5 product. If a company has to make that product overseas in order to \nstay competitive, that is exactly what they are going to do. It ends up \nhelping the American consumer. It is not good for American workers who \ncannot work in that particular industry.\n  But what is the cause for it? Is it because there are entrepreneurs \nout there, business folks--your neighbors and mine--who want to somehow \nhurt American workers, who are not patriotic or who are evil people? \nThink about it. The answers, of course, are no. The only reason they \nare hiring work to be done in foreign countries is because that is how \nthey can stay competitive, how they can offer that same product for $5, \nas their competitor does.\n  What causes them to have to do that? Well, the first thing is \nAmerican tax policy. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the \nworld. Of all industrialized countries, we are No. 1. In this case, No. \n1 makes it more difficult to do business. We have the most progressive \ntax system; that is, the people at the highest end pay the highest \namount of taxes of anyone in any country in the industrialized world. \nWhen\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\nyou take the corporate tax rate and add to it the capital gains and \ndividends, we have the highest tax rate--the integrated tax rate is \nwhat they call it--in the industrialized world for dividends and the \nsecond highest for capital gains.\n  What about regulations? We impose far more in the way of regulatory \nburdens on our businesses--ranging from environmental regulations to \nlabor regulations, you name it--than most of the other industrialized \ncountries do.\n  What about uncertainty? Well, we have this new law called ObamaCare \nthat has put a tremendous amount of burden on American businesses. They \nare either going to have to continue to provide insurance for their \nemployees or pay a fine. They have to pay new taxes. There are some \n$800 billion in taxes under ObamaCare--some 21 different taxes.\n  The problem here is not that there are evil businessmen who hate \nAmerican workers. They bend over backwards to keep their business here; \nit is a lot easier. But the reason sometimes they have to go abroad is \nbecause their government treats them unfairly compared to their \ncompetitors overseas. We tax them too much. We regulate them too much. \nAnd there is too much uncertainty.\n  So when we are debating this subject about outsourcing, about people \nabroad making products that are then sold in the United States, ask \nyourself the question: Why would an American company do that? The \nanswer is, they do it when they have to, when their own government's \npolicies make it impossible for them to compete effectively here in the \nUnited States.\n  That leads to the second. Why would the President be proposing to add \nmore taxes, both on American businesses and American families, at a \ntime when we are in the middle of a very severe economic downturn, and \nwhen the President himself a year and a half ago said: To raise taxes \nunder these circumstances would be a blow to the economy? Again, he \nsaid: You don't raise taxes in a recession.\n  When he said those things, our gross domestic product growth was \nabout 3 percent. We were growing at a rate of about 3 percent. Today, \nit is under 2 percent, and we still have 8.2 percent unemployment. So \nthe circumstances today are, if anything, worse than they were a year \nand a half ago when the President said: We should not raise taxes \nbecause it will be a blow to the economy. You don't raise taxes in a \nrecession.\n  So why would the President be proposing it now? And what is he \nproposing? He says we should raise taxes on any individual who makes \nover $200,000 a year and a family who makes over $250,000. We should \nraise capital gains taxes to the rate of 23.8 percent; dividends the \nsame; the death tax to 45 percent. So your dad created a business, \nbuilt it up; he passed away, you and your sister are the heirs, and the \nday he dies, Uncle Sam says: That will be 45 percent of the value of \nthe business, please, minus whatever the exemption is. It is \nunconscionable we would do that in this country.\n  When the President was asked by Charlie Gibson in one of the \nPresidential debates, when he was campaigning the first time: Senator \nObama, would you raise taxes on capital gains even if it did not bring \nin any more revenue--because economists all agree that frequently \nraising the rate actually results in less tax collection because people \ndo not sell the property that would be subject to the tax under those \ncircumstances--what did he answer? He said, yes, he would still raise \nit, even if it did not bring in more revenue. And the reason is because \nhe wanted to redistribute the wealth from people who made money to \nother people to whom it would be given, presumably.\n  So this is not about deficit reduction as much as it is about a \ntheology that we need to raise taxes, and we need to raise it on people \nwho are the productive, successful people in our society who make \nmoney.\n  If you take the top quintile of taxpayers--the top 20 percent, high \nincome earners--they already pay 90 percent of the taxes in the \ncountry. Is it fair that top 20 percent should pay 90 percent of the \ntaxes? Well, you can argue whether it is fair, but I think for the \nPresident to say that is unfair, they should pay even more, raises the \nquestion: Well, how much more? Should they pay all of it? Should 20 \npercent of our citizens pay all of the taxes for everybody else? Nobody \nelse has to pay anything? As it is, the rest of us only pay 10 percent.\n  So what is fair? Why is it fair to take away from people what they \nhave earned and what they want to save in order to give it to somebody \nelse or to have the government spend the money as if the government was \nwiser in spending money than the citizens are?\n  The reality is the people who are successful, who make money, create \ncapital, which is then invested in businesses, and that investment \npromotes job creation and economic growth, raising the gross domestic \nproduct for all of us. That is the economics of success and it is the \nopportunistic society this country has held sacred for over two \ncenturies. Give people an opportunity to succeed, and when they do, do \nthey put their money--the money they earn--do they put it in a \nmattress? Well, not anymore. You either put it in a bank or you invest \nit with a mutual fund or in some other kind of investment.\n  What happens when that money is put in the bank or in the mutual \nfund? It creates capital for somebody else to use, to create a job, to \ninvent a new product, whatever it might be. It helps business expand.\n  So why would you change your mind, a year and a half after you said \nit would be a blow to the economy, to now suggest raising taxes? And \nwho are these people who make $200,000? Well, it turns out about a \nmillion of these people--940,000, to be exact--are business owners. \nThese are the small business folks who create the jobs--most of the \njobs coming out of the recession. In fact, they account for 25 percent \nof all jobs in America. A quarter of all of the jobs are by these very \nfolks on whom you are going to raise the taxes.\n  I know some people said: Well, that is only a small percentage of the \nbusiness owners, it is only 3 percent. Yes, and that 3 percent accounts \nfor 53 percent of the income taxes paid. In other words, these are the \nbusinesses that are creating the jobs. They employ a quarter of all of \nthe people in country. They are paying 53 percent of the taxes in this \ntax bracket. The reality is, when raising taxes on that group, you are \ngoing to make it more difficult for them to grow their businesses, to \nadd more people.\n  Here is an example. A woman by the name of Karen Madonia, who is the \nCFO of a family business in Aurora, IL--it is called Illco, and it \nsupplies ventilation and heating and air conditioning and refrigeration \nequipment--testified before the House Small Business Committee in May. \nAmong the things she said was--and I am quoting her now:\n\n       We don't have money sitting in the bank to pay more taxes--\n     all our profit is invested in the business. If we have to pay \n     more taxes, that means we can't hire workers or buy trucks \n     and inventory.\n\n  That is typical of small businesses. The money is plowed back into \nthe business. And when the owner passes away, it goes to his heirs--and \nthen subject to the kind of tax we are talking about here? That would \nbe devastating to this kind of business.\n  One of the objections from those who support the President's idea of \nraising taxes is that: Well, the Bush tax cuts benefited the wealthy \nmore than anybody else. Bear in mind that the Bush tax cuts applied to \neverybody. That is the tax rate that has been in existence now for a \ndecade, and everybody's taxes were reduced to some extent.\n  They say: Well, that contributed to the deficit. How much did it \ncontribute to the deficit? The Congressional Budget Office, \nnonpartisan, recently issued a report, and in that report they \ncalculated the difference between the projections of a surplus and then \nthe resulting deficit and what was the reason for that. Do you know \nwhat they found? That the amount of tax relief to this top 20 percent \nof taxpayers--the high income earners--accounted for all of 4 percent \nof the deficit. And how much did the new spending and the interest cost \non that spending account? Over 12 times as much. So the reality is the \nBush tax cuts, which helped everyone, did not help the wealthy more \nthan everybody else, did not contribute to the deficit, and, in fact, \nthose taxpayers are now paying 94 percent of income taxes, up from 81 \npercent before\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\nthe Bush tax cuts went into effect. So that high income group is paying \nmore now in taxes than it did before the Bush tax cuts went into \neffect.\n  My point here is, when the President demagogs this issue, suggesting \nthat somehow it was only the rich who got the benefit of the Bush tax \ncuts and we have to take that money away from them, they are paying \nmore than they did before, and it only accounted for 4 percent of the \ndeficit. And these are the very people who are creating the jobs in \nAmerica today. So why would we want to raise taxes at this point on \nanybody, including on this group of people?\n  My final point: Again, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nhas issued a report in which they say that this fiscal cliff--the \ncombination of across-the-board sequestration and the expiration of the \nexisting Tax Code on January 1--will result in a new recession; that we \nwill have growth next year of only one-half of 1 percent if we allow \nthat to happen. Why would the President be willing to raise taxes on \nAmerica and take a chance that we are going to drive ourselves even \ndeeper into economic trouble than we already are?\n  I urge my colleagues to work together to forestall these new tax \nincreases on all Americans and to forestall the sequestration--a \ncombination of which will drive us back into recession.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing my remarks, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I came to speak on the DISCLOSE Act. I \nwould say parenthetically that I congratulate my colleague from Arizona \nfor his statement earlier--a spirited defense of those U.S. business \nleaders who choose to shift jobs overseas. That is a subject for \nanother day. I will not engage in that debate today, but I think it \nadmirable that he feels compelled to make that case here on the Senate \nfloor today.\n  I want to speak in support of the DISCLOSE Act. If there is one thing \nthat Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree on, it is that \nour campaign finance system is broken. My colleague from Rhode Island \nmade that point earlier, and I certainly agree with that.\n  With the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, corporations, \nunions, and other groups are able to raise millions of dollars through \nsecret contributions and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence \nFederal elections, as long as they do not directly coordinate with a \ncandidate.\n  According to the Federal Election Commission, it is expected that \nsomething over $11 billion will be spent over the course of the 2012 \nelections. That is about twice the 2008 level of spending. This is a \nstaggering amount of money, and the source of much of that money will \nbe completely in the dark. As a result, extraordinarily well-financed \nspecial interest groups dominate the airwaves, and it is nearly \nimpossible for the average citizen to know who is behind campaign ads. \nIn fact, it is nearly impossible for experts to know who is behind \nparticular campaign ads.\n  This is not good for public discourse, and it is not good for our \ndemocracy. In a healthy democracy, voters need to be able to make \ninformed decisions about the information that is presented to them. The \nlack of transparency that currently exists in our political system \nmakes that incredibly difficult.\n  I strongly disagree with the Supreme Court's ruling in the Citizens \nUnited case, but the reality is that short of a constitutional \namendment or a decision by the Court to reverse its opinion--both \noccurrences are unlikely anytime in the near future--the ability of \nCongress to restrict independent expenditures is very limited.\n  There is something we can do now that would make a difference. We can \nenhance transparency with respect to the high-volume spending that is \ninfluencing our elections. We may not be able to stop the flood of \nunlimited spending, but we can shed some light on the process and \nenable the public to at least see where the money is coming from.\n  The enactment of legislation requiring greater transparency about who \nis spending on campaigns was specifically called for by the Supreme \nCourt in the Citizens United decision. The Republican leader in the \nSenate has argued against the DISCLOSE Act on the theory that it would \nsquelch political speech.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks an opinion piece in Politico this morning entitled, ``Mitch \nMcConnell dead wrong on DISCLOSE Act.'' It was written by Adam Skaggs, \nthe senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for \nJustice at the New York University School of Law.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In that opinion piece Mr. Skaggs points out that there \nis no legal or logical basis to support the Republican leader's \nargument. The DISCLOSE Act is an important step in the direction of \nrequiring transparency. The legislation would require certain \norganizations that make more than $10,000 in campaign-related \nexpenditures to file a disclosure report with the Federal Election \nCommission and to report the names of any donors who contributed over \n$10,000.\n  About 93 percent of the money raised by super PACs in 2010 through \n2011 came from donors giving over $10,000, and this legislation would \nshed some light on where this money is coming from. The disclosure \nrequirements apply to corporations, to labor unions, to 501(C)(3) \nnonprofit organizations, and to 527 election advocacy organizations, \nbut they would not apply to 503(c)(3) charitable organizations.\n  The legislation also includes mechanisms to protect legitimate \nnonpolitical donations from disclosure and prevents funding sources \nfrom being hidden by laundering funds through third-party groups. It is \nclear our campaign laws are outdated. They are in desperate need of \nrevision. Frankly, I wish there was a consensus in Congress to make \nmore fundamental reforms to our campaign finance system than we are \nconsidering today. Unfortunately, this is not presently the case, but I \nhope that we could build bipartisan support for some basic disclosure \nprovisions and for this narrowly tailored bill that is pending in the \nSenate.\n  A much more comprehensive version of the DISCLOSE law was \nfilibustered by Republicans in 2010. The revised version we are \ncurrently debating has been narrowed significantly. The provisions \nbanning campaign spending by foreign entities and government \ncontractors were removed. Corporate campaign spending is no longer \nrequired to be reported to shareholders, and lobbyists will not have to \nreport their campaign spending in their annual disclosure reports under \nthe bill being considered in the Senate.\n  The new bill also raises the disclosure trigger from $600 to $10,000 \nto focus only on large donations and to reduce the burden on \norganizations. The newest version dropped the ``stand-by-your ad'' \nprovision that required the listing of donors in TV and radio ads.\n  I am not unsympathetic to first amendment concerns regarding the \nrights of politically active groups that want to be engaged in the \ndiscussions regarding the future of our country, but enabling \ncorporations and special interest groups to use what are essential \nshell organizations for the simple purpose of spending vast sums of \nmoney to influence elections, and to do so in secret, is incredibly \nharmful to our democracy.\n  Requiring the disclosure of large donors is a reasonable mechanism to \nmaintain the integrity of our electoral system without infringing on \nthe ability of organizations to actively participate. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the political aisle to take this \nopportunity to support the modest but important reforms that are \nincluded in the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From Politico, July 15, 2012]\n\n               Mitch McConnell Dead Wrong on DISCLOSE Act\n\n                            (By Adam Skaggs)\n\n       Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has launched \n     a full-throated attack\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\n     on the DISCLOSE Act, which Democrats are set to bring to the \n     Senate floor on Monday. DISCLOSE supporters say it ensures \n     transparency and accountability in U.S. elections. McConnell, \n     however, contends it's a vehicle for intimidation that will \n     squelch political speech and let the Obama administration \n     compile an ``old-school enemies list'' to punish critics.\n       Central to McConnell's strongest indictment is that the \n     bill is a lawless end run to get around the Supreme Court's \n     Citizens United decision. McConnell seems to suggest the \n     Democrats' actions are not only wrong--they're un-American.\n       But McConnell's critique fundamentally mischaracterizes the \n     relationship between the Supreme Court and other branches of \n     our government. By intimating that it is illegitimate for the \n     legislative and executive branches to develop policy in \n     response to Supreme Court decisions, the Senate leader \n     displays ignorance of the basic hydraulics in the founders' \n     system of separated powers.\n       Indeed, suggesting that enhanced disclosure undermines \n     Citizens United takes what Justice Antonin Scalia might call \n     ``a particularly high degree of chutzpah.'' The decision \n     endorsed robust disclosure--by a near-unanimous, 8-1 vote.\n       ``The First Amendment protects political speech,'' Justice \n     Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority, ``and disclosure \n     permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of \n     corporate entities in a proper way.''\n       McConnell, by arguing that disclosure undermines the First \n     Amendment, is in fact turning Citizens United on its head.\n       He also misrepresents the relationship between branches of \n     government. To be sure, the role of the elected branches is \n     distinct from that of the judiciary. It is emphatically the \n     job of the courts to say what the law and Constitution mean, \n     and the President and Congress may not trump the Supreme \n     Court's interpretation. But once the high court announces its \n     interpretation, it is appropriate, sometimes even expected, \n     that elected officials develop new statutes and policies that \n     fit the new parameters.\n       That is exactly what Congress is seeking to do with \n     DISCLOSE. Citizens United posited the benefits of a \n     ``campaign-finance system that pairs corporate independent \n     expenditures with effective disclosure,'' explaining that \n     ``disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and \n     citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and \n     elected officials accountable for their positions and \n     supporters.''\n       But, because of numerous loopholes in current law, \n     effective disclosure exists today only in theory--not \n     reality.\n       The proposed law would remedy that deficiency by requiring \n     groups that run campaign ads to disclose their major \n     contributors--while letting donors who earmark contributions \n     for nonpolitical purposes remain anonymous. The bill \n     represents a clear constitutional exercise of congressional \n     power--consistent with the guidelines laid out by the court \n     in Citizens United.\n       This back-and-forth dialogue among the branches of \n     government, driving the creation and development of law and \n     public policy, is healthy, even essential, for democracy. \n     This policymaking in response to Supreme Court decisions is \n     also routine--contrary to McConnell's specious argument.\n       After the court read the Civil Rights Act to limit certain \n     gender discrimination claims, for example, Congress responded \n     by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to extend the \n     statute of limitations for such claims. In another case, soon \n     after the court struck down the military commissions the Bush \n     administration had set up to try Guantanamo detainees, \n     Congress passed the Military Commissions Act to create new \n     panels it hoped would pass muster before the high court.\n       Policymaking in the states follows the same dynamic. After \n     the Citizens United decision, more than 10 states responded \n     by amending their laws--many to require disclosure of the new \n     corporate political spending that the ruling enabled.\n       There is nothing out of the ordinary--and certainly nothing \n     untoward--about these or countless other examples of \n     lawmakers responding to legal precedent. The only remarkable \n     thing is McConnell's contention that this legislative action \n     is somehow illicit.\n       In fact, legislative responses to Supreme Court rulings can \n     sometimes be necessary. When a court rests its decisions on a \n     policy assumption that turns out to be wrong, elected \n     officials have an obligation to address that discrepancy. \n     Citizens United conditioned corporations' right to unlimited \n     political speech on transparency--pairing corporate spending \n     with ``effective disclosure''--so voters could better \n     understand what groups are trying to influence their votes.\n       By passing DISCLOSE, Congress can ensure that reality \n     conforms to the idealized disclosure system that the Supreme \n     Court assumed existed.\n       While they're at it, Congress should address one more \n     Citizens United problem. The ruling allows corporations to \n     make independent expenditures because, it said, spending \n     wholly independent of candidate campaigns could not lead to \n     corruption.\n       Unfortunately, much of the outside spending now dominating \n     the 2012 election has come from candidate-specific super \n     PACs, functioning like de facto arms of the candidate \n     campaigns. About as far from ``wholly independent'' as can be \n     imagined.\n       Congress should adopt meaningful coordination rules to \n     police the ties between campaigns and super PACs--and ensure \n     that groups claiming to be ``independent'' really are.\n       It is not an ``end run'' around a Supreme Court ruling that \n     embraced transparency and independence for Congress to ensure \n     transparency and independence. Despite McConnell's `Chicken \n     Little' rhetoric, it's what democracy is about.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                             FISCAL POLICY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking more time to \ndebate a bill that will have little consequence for the American \npeople--all people, that is, but those who work in the White House on \nPresident Obama's reelection campaign.\n  We are in our 41st straight month with unemployment above 8 percent, \nbut the Senate is again taking up precious time--time that could be \ndevoted toward creating jobs--to address legislation that is instead \ndesigned to create votes for the President's flagging reelection \nefforts. I would be outraged at this partisan display if it were not so \npathetic, but in the end I think the American people will have enough \noutrage to spare.\n  It is important for the American people to know what the Senate \nDemocratic leadership considers pressing business. Today the world's \ngreatest deliberative body, the Senate, takes up one of the most \ndeliberately political pieces of legislation you will ever see. \nMeanwhile, my friends on the other side of the aisle are now saying \nthat when faced with the choice of addressing the fiscal cliff we are \nfacing at the end of this year by raising taxes on small businesses, \nthey will take their stand with tax hikes.\n  This is remarkable. Rather than stop the country from going over the \nfiscal cliff and preventing the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief, they are prepared to ``Thelma and Louise'' the American economy \nright off the cliff.\n  This is an astonishing admission, but it is not surprising. We hear \nfrom the other side about Republican orthodoxy on tax relief, but we \nrarely hear them come clean about their own economic orthodoxy. \nOccasionally it emerges for all to see.\n  On Friday in Virginia the President let his real views on economic \nmatters slip. Here are his views on business owners.\n\n       Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system \n     that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in \n     roads and bridges. If you've got a business--you didn't build \n     that. Somebody else made that happen.\n\n  Well, the President is right that somebody did make that happen. The \npeople who made it happen are called taxpayers. The President seems to \nthink the Department of Transportation just made those roads and \nbridges happen, but that is not how it works. Nothing happens in this \ncountry--no roads, no bridges, no firefighters, no military, no public \nschools, no nothing--without taxpayers footing the bill.\n  Much of that financing comes from the very small businesses on which \nPresident Obama was lecturing on Friday and on which he and his allies \nare desperate to raise taxes. Their economic philosophy appears to be \nthat government is the engine of the economy when, in fact, the \ngovernment ceases to exist without economic growth and the tax revenues \nthat fund all of these investments the President wants to spend on.\n  With this bizarre world view, it is not surprising that President \nObama and Senate Democrats think it is more important to raise taxes on \nover 1 million small businesses than it is to prevent a recession and \nencourage job growth. If we do not address this fiscal cliff, taxes \nwill go up by over $4.5 trillion over the next 10 years. The \nPresident's former Director of the Office of Management and Budget has \nsuggested this might throw us into a recession. The Federal Reserve has \nsuggested this dire outcome as well. But instead of dealing with it by \nextending the existing tax rates, the President and Senate allies are \nplaying chicken with the economic recovery. They are playing games not \nonly with the economy, but they are playing games with peoples' \nlivelihoods. This is a disgrace.\n  The American people understand that tax increases in the name of \ndeficit reduction wind up being tax increases to fund larger \ngovernment.\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\nThat has been the history of my 36 years here, and the American people \nhave the last say on this matter. A recent poll found that a majority \nof the American people want all the 2001 and 2003 tax policy extended--\nall of it. Then we can undertake fundamental tax reform. Why can't we \ndo that? What is the other side's objection?\n  There is no real policy objection. The only real objection is that it \ndiverts the President and his Democratic allies from their real \npressing business, which is apparently getting the President reelected. \nHere we are debating another bill that will do nothing to create a job \nand nothing to get our economy moving again.\n  The politically motivated bill du jour is the DISCLOSE Act. I oppose \nthis legislation on policy grounds, but just as importantly, I oppose \nthe majority's ongoing effort to convert the U.S. Senate into a vessel \nfor President Obama's political campaign. The majority knows this \nlegislation will not pass in the Senate, or at least they should know, \ngiven the fact this Chamber has already rejected this legislation. What \nis worse is that it appears that the majority does not even want this \nlegislation to pass. What they want and what has become too common in \nthe Senate these days is another dog-and-pony show--another opportunity \nto demonize the business community in service of the President's class \nwarfare campaign theme.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle would have you believe the \nSupreme Court's Citizen United decision has paved the way for a \ncorporate takeover of our election system, that corporations are \nspending untold millions to influence elections with no accountability.\n  What they will not tell you is that increased spending by super PACs \nin this campaign cycle has nothing to do with Citizens United. While \nthey are touting the benefits of increased disclosure, they \nconveniently leave out the fact that super PACs are already required to \ndisclose their donors and that the Supreme Court in Citizens United no \nless actually upheld those disclosure requirements.\n  Furthermore, and contrary to the majority's talking points, Citizens \nUnited has not led to a dramatic increase in corporate campaign \nspending. Yet the majority argues that the dangers of corporate \ncampaign spending are ever present and, as a result, we need to know \nthe names and addresses of individual donors to such campaigns.\n  So with the dangers to democracy of corporate giving and the negative \nimpact of Citizens United largely straw men, what is the purpose of our \ndebating this bill today? Clearly, this effort is more about \ndiscouraging political speech than on transparency. It is just another \neffort on the part of the Obama administration and their congressional \nallies to intimidate those who disagree with the President's policies. \nNot able to defend these policies, it is critical that the President \ndiscourage those who would criticize them.\n  We saw this last year when the President issued an Executive order \nthat would, in effect, give the President the authority to deny \ngovernment contracts to certain companies based on their donations or \npolitical engagement. Earlier this summer, the IRS requested \nconfidential donor information from organizations applying for tax \nexempt status, information that is protected by Federal law--the \nconfidentiality of which is protected by Federal law.\n  This past June I was joined by a number of my colleagues in \nexpressing our concerns about these questionable IRS practices, and we \nare still awaiting a response. Liberal advocacy organizations have \npublicly stated that they plan to use campaign disclosures to \nintimidate and embarrass those who have donated to opposing campaigns. \nAs we have seen in several recent news reports, many political \noperatives have already done so.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would make this type of political intimidation \neasier and more common. So given the other side's track record when it \ncomes to ``transparency,'' I hope they excuse me if I am a bit \nskeptical when they claim this is about good government and not about \npunishing political opponents.\n  If the majority wanted us to take them seriously in this effort, they \nwould have at least included provisions that would apply the same type \nof standards to the labor unions who have, for decades now, bankrolled \nDemocratic election campaigns on the local, State, and Federal levels--\nand to the tune of billions of dollars, and they are the best political \noperatives in the business. It is no accident that the unions are far \nmore likely than corporations to engage in the type of advocacy and \npolitical spending the majority is deriding in this debate.\n  Yet while the language of the DISCLOSE Act ostensibly applies to \nunion spending, the unions' bottom-up business model of funding their \npolitical activities would continue unabashed under this legislation \nwithout a single additional disclosure on the part of most unions.\n  This can hardly be a coincidence.\n  Mr. President, in Citizens United, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that \nmoney spent in the political process is protected by the first \namendment. While this may be accompanied by spending and speech that \nsome find objectionable, such is the natural byproduct of living in a \ncountry that has a first amendment.\n  While colleagues are free to lament the results, they should not use \nthis occasion as an opportunity to silence citizens who oppose their \nagenda and discourage their critics from speaking out. Because the \nDISCLOSE Act seems designed for that very purpose, I urge my colleagues \nto vote no on cloture.\n  As much as I disagree with the decision of the Senate leadership to \nplay political small ball when there are pressing fiscal issues facing \nthis country, I appreciate their desire to shift the debate to \npolitically expedient legislation. The fact is, from a policy \nperspective this administration has come up wanting again and again.\n  Last week the President, when asked to evaluate the failings of his \nadministration, claimed he had focused too much on policy. This is like \na recent college graduate saying at a job interview that one of his \nbiggest shortcomings is that he cares too much and sometimes works too \nhard.\n  Give me a break. For all of the trillions in new spending and tax \nhikes, there is apparently nothing in the President's policy record \nworth defending. In fact, their modus operandi is to avoid any \ndiscussion of any policy at all, pretend the last 4 years did not \nhappen, pretend the stimulus did not happen, pretend the efforts of cap \nand tax and union card check did not happen, pretend ObamaCare did not \nhappen, and, instead, just smear the opponent.\n  When the President said his administration needed to focus less on \npolicy and more on storytelling, I guess this is what he had in mind: \nRather than defend his own policies, he and his campaign surrogates \nwould develop a storyline that smears their political opponent. That is \nall fine and good. As they say, life is about choices, but let's not \nsugarcoat this decision. It is an ugly one, and the President will have \nto live with it.\n  Should the President be forced to defend his record, he would have a \nlot of explaining to do. Just last week we learned another doozy from \nhis administration.\n  In essence, by the stroke of a pen--and against the clear intent of \nbipartisan majorities of the American people, Congress, and the law \nitself--President Obama's administration has attempted to undo welfare \nreform, one of the signature bipartisan policy achievements of the last \n20 years.\n  Nearly 16 years ago, on August 22, 1996, after two vetoes, then-\nPresident Bill Clinton finally signed the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act--otherwise known as welfare reform. \nThis landmark legislation, the product of the Republican-controlled \nCongress, ended the entitlement to welfare and replaced it with a block \ngrant to the States. This block grant, known as the temporary \nassistance for needy families--or TANF--provided States with \nunprecedented control over welfare programs in exchange for meeting \nFederal work standards.\n  Since enactment of welfare reform, welfare caseloads have dropped \ndramatically. Families receiving welfare have dropped by nearly 60 \npercent. People got jobs who were unemployed for years, and they gained \nself esteem from working.\n  Welfare reform remains popular and is often cited as the most \nsignificant\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\ndomestic policy accomplishment in decades. The core philosophy behind \nwelfare reform is the emphasis on work and moving from dependency to \nself-sufficiency.\n  Despite the popularity of welfare reform, programs created under TANF \nhave languished. As more States were able to get credit toward the \nFederal work requirement based on the declining caseloads, TANF \nincreasingly became less of a welfare-to-work program and more of a \nfunding stream to prop up other social programs.\n  In 2005, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office reported \nthat several States listed as part of their definition of a ``Federal \nwork activity'' under TANF some of the following: One, bed rest; two, \npersonal care activities; three, massage; four, exercise; five, \njournaling; six, motivational reading; seven, smoking cessation; eight, \nweight loss promotion; nine, participating in parent-teacher meetings; \nten, helping a friend or relative with household tasks and errands.\n  My gosh.\n  The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which then-Senator Barack Obama \nopposed, attempted to refocus State efforts on getting individuals \nengaged in work and closing these work activity loopholes. The funding \nauthority for TANF expired at the end of fiscal year 2010.\n  The Obama administration has not proposed a comprehensive \nreauthorization of TANF, and TANF has continued under a series of stop-\ngap extensions. Late last week, the Obama administration quietly \nreleased ``guidance'' to the States, informing them that the \nadministration had granted itself authority to waive work requirements \nin TANF, ``including definitions of work activities and engagement, \nspecified limitations, verification procedures and the calculation of \nparticipation rates.''\n  In the 16 years since the creation of the TANF, no administration has \nconcluded that they have the authority to waive TANF work requirements. \nThe provision in the Social Security Act, section 1115, which allows \ncertain waivers, does not cite the section of the law that includes the \nTANF work requirements. In an attempt to justify the waiver scheme, the \nObama administration cites a reference in section 1115 to a provision \ndealing with a TANF State plan. Because the State plan section refers \nto the work requirements, according to the Obama administration, this \nallows them to waive TANF work requirements.\n  Mr. President, if this sketchy logic is allowed to stand, a case \ncould be made that there is virtually no domestic social program whose \nrules and protections cannot be waived. For example, since Medicaid is \nreferred to in section 1115, and since the foster care programs are \nreferred to in the Medicaid statute, a case could be made that under \nthe administration's sketchy logic the protections for children in \nfoster care could be waived.\n  This executive overreach is a very serious matter with major long-\nrange implications. The Obama administration, through this waiver \nscheme, is attempting to unilaterally disarm the legislative branch of \nthe government and accomplish by executive fiat what they never even \nattempted to do through the regular legislative process.\n  This administration has consistently demonstrated a flagrant \ndisregard for the constitutionally mandated coequal branch known as the \nlegislative branch. This is but the latest in a series of decisions \nthat demonstrates the administration's sheer arrogance in attempting to \nbypass Congress without legal warrant.\n  To be clear, disregard of Congress's power to make the laws under \nwhich we live is disregard for the American people. The essence of \nRepublican governance is that the American people have a say in what \nthe laws are. That say comes through their elected representatives, not \nsome unelected bureaucrat putting out guidance that is in flat \ncontradiction to the wishes of the people's representatives and the \nclear text of the law that is supposedly being enforced.\n  Ours is a government of laws, not of men. With this action, the \nadministration has shown that it will not let the constitutional \nprerogatives of Congress or the actual intent of the law stand in the \nway of their policy goals.\n  We cannot let this stand. I, for one, have no intention of letting it \nstand. Let me just say when we did the temporary assistance for needy \nfamilies bill, one of the most important provisions in that bill was \nthe work activity provision. Because people had to go to work after a \ncertain period of time--during which we gave them help, money, \nsubsidization, and did all the necessary things to help them go to \nwork--literally about 60 percent to two-thirds of those who had been on \nwelfare, some for generations, went to work and gained self esteem by \nsupporting themselves.\n  I, for one, have no intention of letting it stand. I will shortly \nintroduce legislation to halt this risky scheme and attempt to gut \nwelfare reform. I urge colleagues to stand with me. Nothing less than \nthe constitutional viability of the Congress is at stake.\n  I can imagine if Senator Byrd, who was the majority leader for many \nyears and became the principal rules person on the Senate floor for \nmost of my service--if he were here today he would be having a fit over \nthis type of arrogance by this administration or any other \nadministration, Republican or Democrat. He would be standing for the \nrights of the Senate.\n  I caution my colleagues on the other side that it is time for them to \nstand for the rights of the Senate and the House--this legislative body \ncalled the Congress. We have to quit this and quit relying on an out-\nof-control administration to do Executive orders that modify what is \nreally legislation passed by this branch of government, which is \nsupposedly coequal.\n  I hope we will all fight. Our country will be better off if we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is considering the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3369, the DISCLOSE Act.\n  Mr. KERRY. Senators are permitted to speak on the previously agreed-\nupon time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few \nwords about the DISCLOSE Act, which we are debating on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I have been involved in this issue of campaign finance reform since I \nfirst entered politics, when I first became involved in the political \ndiscourse of our country in the late 1960s and early 1970s--a long time \nago now.\n  With 27 years as a Member of the Senate, I have seen this debate over \nmoney in American politics. I have seen it endure its highs and also \nits lows.\n  Looking back in history, I can remember back in 1990 when we summoned \n59 votes in the Senate--mostly Democrats, which will tell you a lot \nabout this issue, and 4 Republicans, including Senators Cohen of Maine; \nJeffords of Vermont; McCain of Arizona, who is still here and fighting \non this issue; and Senator Pressler from South Dakota. We passed a \nrestraint on spending in American politics, a balanced bill which would \nhave, in fact, required disclosure and limitations on spending, with a \ncertain ability of people to be able to be held harmless if people were \nmillionaires and spent extraordinary amounts of money. It made the \nplaying field in America fair, and it gave the best opportunity for the \nAmerican citizen--about whom this entire exercise is supposed to be \nfocused--an opportunity to know they were not going to be bombarded \nwith unbelievable amounts of money that distort the American political \ndebate. We thought we had a chance, but unfortunately that bill was \nvetoed by the President.\n  It is not a coincidence that only four Republicans supported that \nbill. It is not a coincidence today, as we come to the floor of the \nSenate, that maybe no Republican or very few--very few, I think is a \nfair way to say it--will be willing to vote to disclose where our money \ncomes from.\n  We are not even here seeking a limitation on the amount of spending. \nWe ought to be, but we are not. We are here simply trying to get the \nAmerican people the right to know who is giving the money, who is \npaying these millions of dollars in order to affect the\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\ndebate in America and, in most cases, I will tell everyone, frankly, to \ndistort the debate. I believe the amount of money in American politics \ntoday is stealing America's democracy. It is robbing Americans of the \nright to have the kind of representation and the kind of discussion \nAmericans deserve.\n  When I was first here back in 1985, we were working with people such \nas Bill Bradley from New Jersey and David Boren from Oklahoma and Joe \nBiden, now the Vice President, obviously, and George Mitchell, the \nformer majority leader and Senator from Maine, all of whom were \ndedicated to trying to take the big money out of politics and replace \nit with a public match for Senate and House races. Fundamentally, the \nstatus quo won. The status quo stopped us, and the status quo is \nwinning today.\n  In response to the soft money scandals--maybe people have forgotten \nwe had our scandals in the 1990s--we finally passed the McCain-Feingold \nbill, modest as it was. All it did was put a ban on soft money, the \nsoft money, which is the big amounts of money that get poured into the \npolitical system. That ban had the unintended consequence of pushing \neverybody to look for the biggest loophole they could find, and they \nfound a loophole. The 527 groups, as we have come to know them, came \nout and the debate was again taken away from the candidates and given \nto outside groups that had huge amounts of money.\n  A lot of Americans are not aware of that. A candidate could be \nrunning and have one thing he or she wants to actually say, but outside \ngroups can come in with enormous amounts of money and completely flood \nthe ability of a candidate to control the message of that particular \ncampaign and certainly have a profound impact on it. Never did we \nimagine then, however, that with one decision, the Supreme Court would \ntilt the voice of our democracy and our discourse so heavily in favor \nof large unaccountable interests at the expense of the average \nAmerican. That, my friends, is what happened when the Supreme Court \nmade the Citizens United decision, which is certainly the worst \ndecision in 100 years, if not more.\n  What we are talking about today is a system that is simply broken. It \nis as fundamentally broken as the campaign system in our country has \never been. I worry personally, deeply, about what it has done to our \nability to govern in the public interest and what it does today to \nthreaten the ability of this institution to function.\n  In explaining why she is leaving the Senate, our Republican colleague \nSenator Snowe wrote: This body is not living up to what the Founding \nFathers envisioned. She spoke of our Founding Fathers' vision for the \nSenate, where we could reach consensus in an orderly manner. There is \nnothing orderly and there is no consensus. Does anyone believe we can \nmake that kind of Senate occur today, given the kind of campaign \nfinance system we have, where all our time--or a huge amount of our \ntime is a fairer way to say it--is spent raising money? I have heard \nthe majority leader and the minority leader complain they can't have \nSenators here Mondays, Fridays, and other periods of time because \neverybody is governed by the campaign schedule. We now have secret \ndonors who blow candidates out of the water with on-air distortions \nthat are simply mind-boggling. I lived through many of those \ndistortions in 2004, when I ran for President, so I know what I am \ntalking about when I talk about the power of the lie with a lot of \nmoney put behind it. I don't think anybody here believes the amount of \nmoney in the system today doesn't have the ability to drown out the \nvoices of people who get into public service in order to get things \ndone but who don't have that kind of money and don't have access to \nthat kind of money.\n  Frankly, the fundamental reason why there is such a disparity between \nthe numbers of Democrats who want to have a fair playing field and the \nnumber of Republicans who vote against campaign finance reform is, \nobviously, they have a lot more money. Corporations have a lot more \nmoney, big billionaires who don't want to be taxed in a fair way in \nAmerica have a lot more money to throw at the system. So we have one \nguy out in Las Vegas who can put millions of dollars behind a candidate \nfor President and keep a candidacy alive when normally it would have \ndied long ago. The only life it had was the money. That is what happens \ntoday.\n  That is not what the Founding Fathers intended for this institution. \nOurs is a system where billions of dollars can be spent by any \nmillionaire or billionaire or the largest corporations in the world to \ndistort our democracy, diminish the voices of candidates, pollute our \nairwaves with spending whatever and wherever, and the average American \ndoesn't even get to know where the money is coming from. They have the \nability in the United States of America to do it secretly--secretly. It \nis secret money. The sources are unspecified and the American people \ndon't know who is behind it.\n  I think it is an insult to the freedom every Senator extols the \nvirtues of all the time in this Senate. It is an insult to the notion \nregarding our liberty and our equality and our fairness. It violates \nthe rules of honorable discourse and debate, and it is a threat to \nevery single public servant running for office in this Nation because \nit means their ideas can be drowned by the dollars.\n  I got an e-mail the other day from somebody in another country who e-\nmailed me and said: You guys are beginning to look like the oligarchies \nof the world, where the amounts of money buy anything they want.\n  The increased influence of special interest money, big money in our \npolitics is robbing the average citizen of their ability to be able to \nset the agenda. The agenda is set by the money because the money is \nwhat runs the campaigns. As a result of the Supreme Court ruling in \nCitizens United, all any CEO or billionaire has to do is turn over \nbillions of dollars to somebody who goes out and runs a media campaign.\n  Senator McCain, as we all know, feels passionately about this issue. \nHe recently said: ``I think there will be scandals associated with the \nworst decision of the United States Supreme Court in the 21st \ncentury.''\n  I agree with Senator McCain. There already are scandals, but not \neverybody sees them. But I will tell you this, a lot of Senators know \nexactly what they are.\n  This imbalance we have will result in escalating media wars, where \ncandidates are reduced to mere proxies in the process. Somewhere, at \nsome time, those winning candidates are going to be asked to pay up on \nsome special interest need or to tow the line on an agenda that is set \nby a kind of new terror that enters into our politics.\n  All one has to do is think about the trajectory we are on today. Will \nRogers once said that ``politics has gotten so expensive that it takes \na lot of money to even get beat with.'' That has never been more true. \nWill Rogers would be stunned by the amount of money in politics today.\n  In 2008, a record total of $5.2 billion was spent in Presidential, \nSenate, and House races. That broke the 2004 record the year I ran of \n$4.1 billion, and that broke the 2000 record of $3.1 billion. In other \nwords, every single year more and more money. But now, in 2010, in the \nfirst campaign after Citizens United, there was a fourfold increase in \nthe expenditures from super PACs and other outside groups compared to \n2006--fourfold increase--in a 2-year period of time. Anonymous \nspending--anonymous spending--rose from 1 percent of the outside \nspending to 44 percent in a 2-year period of time.\n  That is what we get when the Supreme Court of the United States rules \nin a 5-to-4 decision--one vote--that corporations and big interests \nhave the same rights to speech as individuals. I mean it is stupefying \nto think about it. I remember from law school that a corporation was a \nfictitious entity--a fictitious entity--created to provide a veil of \nprotection for the people who form it in order to permit commerce in \nAmerica. Nobody ever created a corporation with the notion it would \nhave the same rights as a person. Corporations don't get married. They \ndon't have kids. They don't cry. Sometimes, I suppose, when Wall Street \nfalls apart, a few people may. But the notion that somehow corporations \ncan have the same rights of people is an insult to the drafters of the \nConstitution of our country and the corollary that somehow they, \ntherefore, get to spend the same amount of money in an election cycle \nas an individual.\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\n  As a result, we are now seeing a spending blitz by shadowy groups \nthat is projected to reach billions of dollars--money that is \nimpossible to trace to its source, money that is kept in shadows, away \nfrom the average American's ability even to ask who is paying the bills \nfor those ads, who is behind those ads, whose interests do those ads \nrepresent? The sums of money we are talking about will mean little to \nthe corporations compared to what they may get in return, and that is \nwhat this is all about: blocking legislation, blocking a regulation, \npreventing a change in the tax law that takes away a preference that \nhas no relationship to today's economy.\n  There are hundreds of examples, and I have seen them through the \nyears, where money drives the agenda of the Congress and of our \npolitics, way in excess of what it ought to be when we measure it \nagainst the real concerns of the average family trying to make ends \nmeet or find a job in America.\n  Today, we will vote on a bill--a vote that ought to go unopposed by \nany Member of this institution who swore to uphold the Constitution of \nthe United States--and this vote could go a long way toward making the \nfight between the public interest and corporate interest, if not fair, \nat least transparent. The American people are smart and, given that \nopportunity, will begin to make some judgments about exactly what is at \nstake.\n  The DISCLOSE Act is not an act to amend the Constitution. It doesn't \neven overturn the decision of the Supreme Court that equated the right \nof corporations to people, nor does it constitute campaign finance \nreform. It is none of those things. Those would be structural \nsolutions. I, frankly, am for them. I think we ought to do them. I \nthink we need a constitutional amendment at this point in order to \nrectify what the Supreme Court has had difficulty discerning. But all \nthe DISCLOSE Act would do is shed light on who is giving money--\ntransparency.\n  This bill ought to receive unanimous support. It is an effort to \nshine the disinfectant of sunlight on corporations and faceless \norganizations trying to buy and bully their way into influence in \nWashington through campaigns that are run against the Members who \ndisagree with them. All we need to do is look at the amount of money \nthat has been spent against some of our colleagues who are running this \nyear--millions of dollars dumped in anonymously in these States to try \nto affect those races.\n  In short, the DISCLOSE Act requires corporations, organizations, and \nspecial interest groups to disclose their political advertising just \nlike a candidate for office does. That is all it requires. What could \nbe more normal in America, what could be more American than allowing \nthe American people to know who is trying to speak to them? I don't \nthink it is radical, and I don't think it is prohibitive. It simply \nremoves the fallacy that Americans are voluntarily somehow organizing \nto pursue some public interest. That is a farce. That is not what is \nhappening in these instances. The truth is that Americans aren't \norganizing or mobilizing to bring you the vast percentage of the \nadvertisements that are seen on TV. The truth is that corporate special \ninterest money is being compiled and targeted to pursue a special \ninterest and send a loud televised message to those who disagree with \nthem that they are going to be punished and tempered. And not only is \nit going to tip elections, it is going to cripple the legislative \nprocess.\n  When the Citizens United decision was handed down, the voices that \nwere seeking corporate largess said at that time that it is not going \nto have any impact. They said we need not worry about funneling new \nfunds to candidates. But the truth is that Karl Rove has admitted that \nbased on the Citizens United decision, he formed two new groups to \ninfluence the 2010 elections with $52 million worth of ads bankrolled \nanonymously by special interests. And now that the Supreme Court has \nopened that door to these anonymous ads, similar groups are already \nplanning to spend approximately $300 million on the election this fall.\n  So whether or not you agree with the message those ads and \norganizations are sending, at a minimum you ought to support the idea \nthat these messages should be sent openly and that those who send them \nought to be held accountable. As I have said before, this ought to be \nsomething every U.S. Senator supports.\n  As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have the privilege \nof trying to press our interests in many different parts of the world, \nand I meet with people in various parts of the world who look back at \nus and ask a lot of questions of us about our democracy. Increasingly, \npeople are asking whether the United States of America can deliver. \nIncreasingly, people are looking at us incredulously and questioning \nour political system because we go to the brink over a default on the \ndebt ceiling or because we can't get a budget passed because we don't \ndo the fundamental business. And one of the most profound reasons we \ndon't do that--and I have seen it change here--is that the power of the \nmoney, the power to influence the election has a profound impact on \nwhat colleagues are prepared to take up, what they are prepared to vote \non, and how they are prepared to vote.\n  It is a dollarocracy that is beginning to call the shots, and the \nAmerican people know it. That is why they are so disappointed in what \nis happening--or not happening--in Washington, DC. That is why the \nratings for the U.S. Congress are so low--because it doesn't produce, \nit can't produce, it won't produce. And the money almost guarantees \nthat.\n  This is not a new fight in our country. Teddy Roosevelt, a \nRepublican, fought this fight in the early 1900s, and he took on the \ngreat malefactors of wealth, he took on the concentration of power, and \nhe was the great trust buster. It was an extraordinary period of time \nin America confronting power.\n  Back in 1910, in Osawatomie, KS, Teddy Roosevelt said:\n\n       The Constitution guarantees protections to property, and we \n     must make that promise good. But it does not give the right \n     of suffrage to any corporation.\n\n  He urged his listeners again and again to demand an especially \nnational restraint upon unfair money-getting, as he called it, and the \nabsence of that restraint, he noted, has tended to create a small class \nof enormously wealthy and economically powerful men whose chief object \nis to hold and increase their power.\n  What Teddy Roosevelt said in 1910 is perhaps even more true today. \nThe reason is that during the 1990s and subsequently, we have created \ngreater wealth in America than during the period when we did not have \nan income tax. People today are wealthier, comparatively, than the \nPierponts, the Morgans, the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, the Mellons, \nand all of those famous names of the 1900s who helped build this \ncountry. Today, the wealth far exceeds that wealth, and the disparity \nbetween the average American and the wealthy has grown wider and wider \nthan at any other time in American history. While the average American \nfamily sees their income getting squeezed and going down, the upper 1 \npercent has seen 10, 20, 30 times increases in their income. And that \nis what is playing out in the American political system today in this \nCitizens United decision.\n  All we ask today--although we ought to be asking for more. We know we \ncan't get it now, but at least we ought to be able to get the ability \nof the American people to know who is putting the money into the \nsystem, who is trying to affect these votes, who is trying to set the \nagenda, whose interests are really at stake. That is what is at stake \nin this vote today, and I hope all our colleagues will vote for the \nright to disclose those funds to the American people, who have an \ninalienable right to know exactly from where they are coming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                               Tax Policy\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier today our colleague from \nWashington State indicated that President Obama and the Democratic \nleadership in Congress are willing to accept the largest tax increase \nin American history and a series of crippling defense cuts unless \nRepublicans will agree to raise taxes significantly falling on the very \npeople we are counting on to get our economy going again and to create \njobs. I wish to say just a few words in response.\n  First of all, Senators on both sides of the aisle understand that a \nmassive tax\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nincrease could well push our economy back into a recession. Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle understand that it would suffocate our \ninvestments that are so important to business creation and job growth. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle understand that middle-class \nfamilies are already struggling with high unemployment and wage \nstagnation. And Senators on both sides of the aisle understand that we \nare living through the weakest economic recovery since the Great \nDepression. Yet President Obama and his party seem obsessed with \nraising taxes on the very people who are responsible for most of that \nnew job creation.\n  Led by the President, these same people are demonizing business \nowners and demanding that they be punished, while simultaneously \ndemanding that these same people create jobs. It is no wonder that so \nmany Americans are concerned about the future of the U.S. economy. In \nthe meantime, Democratic leaders such as our colleague from Washington \nState are apparently ready to stand by and allow truly Draconian \nacross-the-board defense cuts even though the President's own Secretary \nof Defense has said these cuts would hollow out our military and be \ncatastrophic to our national security. It simply amazes and discourages \nme that some people are willing to play chicken with our economy and \nour national security in such a cavalier, calculated sort of way.\n  Given that our country has endured 41 straight months of unemployment \nabove 8 percent and given how devastating these defense cuts would be \nto our military, I would like to ask our President and my Democratic \ncolleagues a few simple questions. Are you really willing to allow the \nlargest tax increase in American history? Are you really willing to \nrisk the U.S. economy heading backwards into a recession by the \ncombination of these huge tax increases and the $1.2 trillion budget \nsequestration scheduled for January 2? Are you really willing to tell \nmiddle-class families that their needs are less important than the \npolitical needs of your party? When it comes to the defense cuts that \nare part of the sequestration scheduled to go into effect in January of \n2013, are you really willing to do what Secretary Panetta said would \nhappen, which is hollowing out the U.S. military? Are you really \nwilling to let Washington gamesmanship compromise our Nation's \nsecurity? Are you really willing to tell the heroes of Iraq and \nAfghanistan and our veterans that their needs are less important than \nthe political needs of your party? In short, are you really willing to \nput election-year politics ahead of the Nation's interests?\n  I can only hope that this is a temporary aberration and that the \nanswer is really no and that cooler heads will ultimately prevail when \nthe price of inaction becomes even more apparent, but I can't say I am \nat all confident.\n  When I hear President Obama tell the American people that the private \nsector is doing just fine or tell business owners that the government \nis responsible for their success, I realize the President simply \ndoesn't understand the challenges facing America's entrepreneurs and \njob creators or the risks they take every day to create jobs. In short, \nI wonder whether the President really understands and appreciates the \nfree enterprise system. It is clear he doesn't understand the damaging \neconomic effects of misguided government policies, such as ObamaCare. A \nsmall businessman named Grady Payne recently told Congress that his 31-\nyear-old lumber company, Conner Industries, based in Fort Worth, TX, \ncould be ``legislated out of existence'' if the President's health care \nlaw is allowed to stand.\n  Whenever I head home to Texas and speak to business owners such as \nMr. Payne, I hear the same complaints. People are worried that the \nprimary engine of American job creation is being held back by \nregulatory overreach, a woefully inefficient and unfair Tax Code, and \nwidespread uncertainty about the future of government policies. These \nare not Republican concerns or Democratic concerns, these are concerns \nthat affect every man, woman, and child in this country but especially \nthose who own a business, those who want to start a business, and those \nwho are looking for a job. We all know these problems are going to have \nto be addressed sooner or later. My preference is that we address them \nsooner and not later if America is going to remain competitive in the \nglobal economy and reduce the painfully high unemployment rate. After \nall, these were the problems we were sent here to solve.\n  I hear time and time again: Well, an election is coming up. This is \nan election year. We can't do it in an election year.\n  But we have had an election every 2 years since 1788. It would be a \ngross dereliction of our duty if Congress and the President were to \ngive up on making important decisions in the last 6 months before the \nnext election. Just imagine what the American people must think. I take \nthat back; I know what they think because they are constantly telling \nme how frustrated they are with Congress and Washington, how \ndysfunctional it is, how they do not believe their political leaders \nare listening to them or hearing them when they say they need help to \nallow this great engine of job creation off the mat and to allow it to \nget back to work and to allow them to get back to work as well. But it \nis not going to happen when the President and his party are willing to \nplay chicken with a recession.\n  My constituents, similar to all our constituents, all 320 million or \nso Americans, have to make important decisions about their families \nevery day, every week, and every month of the year. Why would it be \nthat Congress and the President could have an extended vacation from \nmaking those same kinds of hard choices? It does not make any sense. \nBeyond that, it is an abdication of our responsibility.\n  Nobody has said leadership is easy. But right now, on issues of \nextraordinary importance to our economy and our national security, \nleadership is what the American people need and leadership is what they \ndeserve, but so far that leadership is AWOL. But hope remains that \ncooler heads will prevail and that Congress and the President, working \ntogether, will do our job to help put America back to work, to remove \nthe uncertainties in the political process.\n  When my colleague from Washington makes rash statements, threatening \nour country with a recession unless this side of the aisle agrees to \ntax increases that would fall disproportionately on the job creators in \nthis country, that is not the kind of cool deliberation or common sense \ncoming together we need when it comes to solving our Nation's biggest \neconomic problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. President Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the DISCLOSE Act. I \nrise in very strong support of this bill. I thank the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse, for his leadership on this bill. He \nbrings such great background, with his legal training, as attorney \ngeneral and U.S. attorney, well versed on issues of the Constitution \nand also his very strong commitment that elections should be free and \nfair and not rigged by big special interests.\n  Today, we have a vote to protect the voice of ordinary Americans who \nnow more than ever need to be able to trust their political system. But \nyou know what. We have a big problem and it is something called a super \nPAC. Nobody knows what that means, but I am going to spell it out in \nplain English.\n  First of all, a super PAC means we can have unlimited secret money \nbeing pumped into our elections. That is not the American way. That is \nwhy we are calling our bill the DISCLOSE Act. It is balanced, it is \ncommon sense, and it protects the rights of the individual, looking out \nfor the little guy or gal, and also protects the integrity of our \npolitical system.\n  I am a reformer, and I absolutely believe in the Constitution of the \nUnited States and that wonderful first amendment. In our country, we \ncan speak our mind and we can organize. I stand before you today \nbecause of the first amendment. I fought a highway that would have \nripped through Baltimore. I challenged political machines and political \nbosses. I challenged powerful special interests that were going to make \nmoney. But because of the Constitution I had the right to speak my \nmind, the right to organize--and I did.\n  In other countries, they take people like me and throw them in jail. \nWith me, because of the first amendment, I\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\ncould run in an election, do a sweat-equity campaign door to door, and \ncome to the city council, the Congress, and the Senate. I love that \nfirst amendment.\n  Right now, under the guise of free speech, there are those who say we \ncannot in any way impede big-buck donors or big special interests from \ngiving what they want and not even saying who they are. I think when \nTom Jefferson and John Adams and Charles Carroll sat around \nPhiladelphia writing the Constitution, they did not think the first \namendment was about protecting the right of secret donors to rig \nelections. I do not believe that unfettered influence of super donors \nand big business with no limits or requirements for disclosure was what \nthe Founders wanted when they wrote that Bill of Rights.\n  When the Supreme Court decided a case called Citizens United, it \nopened the floodgates to unlimited secret money. We knew there would be \nrisk and it took no time for it to take root. In the 2010 midterm \nelections, we saw a fourfold increase in this type of so-called super \nPAC spending. Three-quarters of that spending came from groups that \nwere previously prohibited. The worst of it, it is all being kept from \nthe American people--who are these organizations and what do they stand \nfor.\n  At a time when the American public needs a government on their side, \nthey need to know who is working behind the scenes to get people \nelected. The DISCLOSE Act is simple. It requires a covered organization \nto file disclosure with the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours \nafter they spend $10,000 or more on a campaign. What is a covered \norganization? Corporations, labor unions, PACs, and super PACs. This is \nnot a new concept in Congress. We have regulations. If you are a \ncandidate like candidate Mikulski, you face limits on donors. During a \ncampaign, I have to say who is giving me money, I have to disclose who \nis giving me money, and the donor has limits. Whether it comes from a \npolitical action committee such as the National Association of Social \nWorkers, which has always supported me, whether it is the American \nNurses Association, which has always supported me, they disclose it. So \nwe know it is the nurses; we know it is the social workers.\n  Also, there are donors whose names appear. Why can that not be true \nfor all campaigns? What is wrong about saying who you are when you are \ngiving more than $10,000 a year? The American public has a right to \nknow. They have a right to be heard, and they need to be represented.\n  I am a Shirley Chisholm Democrat. She said she wanted a government \nthat was unbought and unbossed. Put me in that Shirley Chisholm \nDemocratic column. Our Democratic process is currently clouded by a \ncloak of secrecy. The integrity of our political system is important to \nme. We are not sent to do the business of secrecy or high-dollar \nbidding on our seat. We are sent to do the work of the people and make \ntheir lives better. We owe it to the public to shed light on who gives \nus money--who they are, how much they give, and what is it that they \ndo. Let's vote in favor of democracy. Let's support the DISCLOSE Act \nand let's have a Congress that is unbought and unbossed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, at this moment in time, corruption of \nAmerica is taking place, but it is not in front of our eyes. The \nAmerican people have a right to know who is responsible. It is being \ncorrupted by secret money from secret donors. Every day they spend more \nand more money to buy our elections, but we do not even know exactly \nwho they are. We are talking about a small number of people who are \namong the richest in America, and they are determined to manipulate the \nelection in order to elect those to high office, including a President, \nwho will pursue their special interests.\n  When we turn on the TV, we see their handiwork right in front of our \neyes. Attack ads that are filled with deceptions about what is \nhappening are undermining our democracy one distortion at a time.\n  Who is responsible for the fabrications in these ads? We can't know. \nUnlike the election rules of the past, the names of those funding these \noperations are hidden from the American people. We see organizations \nwith innocuous names such as Americans for Prosperity and Crossroads \nGPS fill the airwaves with wild claims. These front organizations \nprovide the curtain that hides billionaires and corporations from \nsight. We need to pull back the curtain on the sources of secret money. \nWhy shouldn't American citizens know who wants to override our people \npower with their purchasing power?\n  Democrats have offered a way to shine the sunlight on who is trying \nto buy our country. The DISCLOSE Act would reveal the identities of \nthose who pour millions of dollars into efforts to deceive the American \npeople. These groups claim their mission is social welfare, but their \nsinister intention is to protect their own corporate welfare.\n  It is clear the Republicans are doing everything in their power to \nprevent the American people from knowing who is behind this disgraceful \nmission of deception and dishonesty. So today on the Senate floor I am \ngoing to disclose the identities of a couple of people who are among \nthe biggest sources of secret money. I am going to disclose where their \nmoney comes from. Here on this placard we see the Koch brothers, David \nand Charles Koch. They are the powerhouses in this movement to take \naway the ability of the American people to decide how they vote and who \ngets into office.\n  These brothers are worth billions of dollars, and they are unabashed \nin their zeal to use their fortunes to further their political agenda. \nIt has been reported that these two brothers are putting together a \nsecret group of donors, and they are going to put $400 million in the \npot to subvert the upcoming election--$400 million. The Koch brothers \nand their secret group will use those millions of dollars to flood the \nairwaves, but when we see the ads, we will not see the names of the \nKoch brothers or members of their secret group of millionaires. We will \nsee a name, a nice name: Americans For Prosperity. Yes, the Koch \nbrothers' prosperity.\n  When we look at what it stands for, truly, it stands for siphoning \noff the votes of the American people, trading them in for cash and \npicking up their agenda. Registered as a social welfare organization--\nit is an insult. That is why they are allowed to keep their donors \nsecret. They have told the IRS they are not a political committee.\n  Who, aside from the Koch brothers, are the donors to Americans for \nProsperity? We cannot tell you. They are kept secret. They are allowed \nto hide behind the curtain.\n  If these wealthy individuals want to pick our next President, they \nshould have the muscle and the courage to stand and say so; tell \neverybody what it is they want to accomplish, what they want to do to \nour democracy. They don't have the courage. They would rather stand \nbehind the curtain and control our election $1 million at a time.\n  Where do these brothers get all this money? It is interesting. These \nbrothers run a giant international conglomerate, one of the largest \nprivately held companies in the world. This secretive corporation has a \nhuge impact on our lives. Koch Industries controls oil, gas, and \nchemical companies that do business across the globe.\n  Now, while we may not notice, their products are everywhere. In fact, \ntheir products are in many American homes today. For instance, all of \nthese everyday products are sold by Koch Industries. These Dixie cups \nare cups that kids drink out of, and they are sold by the Koch \nbrothers. Paper plates that often serve birthday cakes are sold by the \nKoch brothers. Brawny paper towels that we use to clean the floor when \nour kids spill things are also sold by the Koch brothers.\n  You probably haven't heard of INVISTA--it is another company owned by \nthe Koch brothers' global conglomerate--but they do make things you \nhave heard of, such as STAINMASTER carpet and LYCRA fabric for clothes. \nWe think these goods come in handy, we all buy them, but they are also \na source of revenue for the Koch brothers, who fund attack ads that \npollute our airwaves.\n  The bottom line is that allows the billionaires who sit on top of \nglobal business empires to subvert our democracy. They want to change \nit. They want to change the character of our\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\ncountry. They want a few to be able to name the governance of the \nmillions.\n  Although Brawny paper towels may be able to clean up some spills, \nthey will not be able to clean up what is going on with our electoral \nprocess.\n  The bottom line is this: When the wealthy decide they are going to \ncontrol our elections, the American people have every right to know it. \nWhen these wealthy people decide they want to become kingmakers as \nwell, the public should know what they are up to. Kings went out of \nAmerica centuries ago, and they are trying to bring it back in some \nform.\n  Common sense says our democracy and our country's core are at stake, \nand we don't want it to happen. I hope the American people see what is \ngoing on here and understand that they are not being told what is going \non in our society. That is not what America is about.\n  America's openness has been the bulwark for our society since its \nfounding. Secret societies have largely disappeared from our country, \nbut when they do inevitably appear, it has been to bring instability. \nTransparency has enabled our Nation to flourish with openness. Our \ncountry has become richer as a result of that openness and \ntransparency.\n  Now, at a critical moment in the history of America, it is shocking \nto see this abject use of secrecy and power. We should not let them \ntake it. We should not let the few with all kinds of wealth--\nbillionaires, if you will, made on the backs of the American people--\ntake our democracy from the millions. If it weren't for people who \nmanned the jobs, such as cops, doctors, teachers, and the other people \nin our society, I don't care how smart these people were, they could \nnot have amassed these fortunes. And I don't begrudge them the ability \nto spend it where they want, but when it comes to the election, we have \nto tell the truth. We have to have it happen that way. The American \npeople have to know who is going to put the President in the White \nHouse in the next administration. We don't want it to change because \nsomeone else is hiding behind the curtain and manipulating hundreds of \nmillions of Americans who are going to have to abide by them when these \nelections are over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Lautenberg.\n  I was listening to Senator Mikulski and Senator Bingaman on their \ncomments to try to bring some common sense to our election laws by \nbasically disclosing who contributes to the political process. That is \nsomething Republicans and Democrats have been together on for a long \ntime. I don't know what happened. This seems to be an issue that \ndoesn't get bipartisan support.\n  I particularly wish to thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership on \nthis issue. He has been talking about this matter of DISCLOSE, along \nwith Senator Schumer, since the Supreme Court decision in 2010 with the \nCitizens United decision.\n  I must say that I think the Citizens United decision will go down as \none of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. I say that for many reasons. First and foremost, those \nwho are students of our judicial system and our constitutional \nseparation of powers will understand that the case that went up to the \nSupreme Court was a pretty narrow case based upon a 30-minute \ndocumentary. In that decision of Citizens United, the Court ruled in a \nvery broad way that a corporation has all the rights of an individual \nin our political system. It is the first time that has happened. It \nreversed the legislation that had been passed by Congress.\n  The Framers of our Constitution envisioned that it was the \nlegislative branch of government that would make our laws and policies. \nThe legislature, after a great deal of debate and after many different \nattempts, passed laws that restricted how much money corporations could \nput in our political system and how they had to do it in a very open \nand transparent manner. Then we had a reform bill known as the McCain-\nFeingold bill that spelled out certain restrictions. All of these cases \nand laws have been upheld over a long period of time by court \ndecisions.\n  In Citizens United, the Court not only substituted itself for the \nlegislature but reversed its own precedent in ruling that corporations \ncould literally put an unlimited amount of money into our political \nsystem. As I said, I think it was one of the worst decisions in the \nhistory of the Supreme Court. It has now unleashed unlimited money in \nour political system. What corporations and undisclosed sources can now \nput into our elections will dwarf what individual contributors will \nmake available in the political season.\n  The Center for Responsive Politics has now said that super PACs and \ntheir related organizations have already spent over twice what similar \ngroups spent 4 years ago. We not only have this unleashing of \nundisclosed corporate funds, we are now seeing the super PACs taking \nover as the major source of funding of campaigns.\n  As Senator Mikulski just said on the Senate floor, if we run for \noffice and solicit contributions, every one of those contributors is \nlisted on our reports. We make quarterly reports so that the people of \nthe Nation know who is financing our campaigns. They will not know who \nis financing these ads that are going to appear on television from \nthese Citizens United-type political activities where we don't know \nwhere the money is coming from. It could come from a single source who \nwishes to influence our political system but does not want to be \nidentified in the cause. I really think this compromises our democratic \nsystem. I think an individual could literally distort our political \nsystem through the use of money, and that is something I hope all of us \nwould be concerned about.\n  I am now a believer. I think the only thing we can do to overturn the \nCitizens United case is to support Senator Tom Udall's constitutional \namendment. That amendment gives the Congress the power we thought we \nhad to legislate.\n  I think the people of Maryland, West Virginia, and our Nation would \nbe surprised to learn that we cannot legislate the limits of what \npeople can contribute in campaigns. They think that is our \nresponsibility, not the Court's. Well, Senator Tom Udall's amendment \nwould give us the power to do that and overturn the Citizens United \ncase. I hope we could come together to let us have the power we should \nhave. It seems to me that is something both Democrats and Republicans \nin this body should agree on, that those decisions should be made in \nthe Congress of the United States and not in the Supreme Court or the \ncourts of our land.\n  The bill we have before us--and I urge my colleagues to let us move \nforward to the DISCLOSE Act--brings transparency into the campaign \nfinance system. Many of us frequently talk about transparency. \nTransparency is the most important part of integrity in our system. We \ntalk about a lot of other countries adding transparency to the way they \ndo business. Well, we should have transparency in one of the most \nfundamental parts of our system, and that is how we conduct our \nelections. It is key to our democracy.\n  It is Justice Brandeis who said that ``sunlight is said to be the \nbest of disinfectants.'' I don't understand why we would resist the \npublic knowing who is contributing money to influence our political \nsystem.\n  The DISCLOSE Act has the bipartisan support of the League of Women \nVoters, Democracy 21, and People for the American Way.\n  Let me quote from a letter recently sent to Congress by the \nnonprofit, nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. It says:\n\n       Hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent to influence \n     the outcome of the elections over the next four months. \n     Neither the candidates being attacked with these millions of \n     dollars nor the public will have complete, accurate, \n     meaningful information about the sources of such money. Only \n     the contributors and the beneficiaries will be in the know. \n     Passage of S. 3369 will mean that in future election cycles \n     those funding these shadow campaigns will be disclosed to the \n     public so that voters can make informed decisions at the \n     polls.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       As we get closer to the 2012 elections, the amount of \n     federal campaign-related spending using funds from \n     undisclosed sources continues to rise. Especially troubling \n     is the lack of transparency regarding the expenditures of so-\n     called ``Section 501(c) groups'' this election cycle, such as \n     Priorities USA and Crossroads GPS.\n\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say: Well, can we constitutionally \ndo\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\nthis? Is this allowed for us? After all, Citizens United sort of says \nanything goes. Well, let me quote from the Citizens United decision--\nand this is very interesting--where the Court wrote:\n\n       [P]rompt disclosure of expenditures can provide \n     shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold \n     corporations and elected officials accountable for their \n     positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether \n     their corporation's political speech advances the \n     corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can \n     see whether elected officials are in the pocket of so-called \n     moneyed interests.\n       The First Amendment protects political speech; and \n     disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the \n     speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This \n     transparency enables the electorate to make informed \n     decisions and gives proper weight to the different speakers \n     and messages.\n\n  That is the Supreme Court speaking in Citizens United.\n  We clearly have the authority to move at least this modest step \nforward to allow the American people to see who is making these \ncontributions so they can make an informed judgment on election day. We \nowe it to the citizens of this country to take up and pass the DISCLOSE \nAct.\n  Once again, I wish to thank my colleague, who is now on the Senate \nfloor, Senator Whitehouse, for his leadership on this issue. As I said \nearlier, from day one when the Supreme Court issued its decision, it \nwas Senator Whitehouse who immediately observed that we have to do \nsomething to make sure that those who use this process to influence our \nsystem--that information is disclosed so the public has the information \nthey need in order to properly judge our elections.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud \ncosponsor of the DISCLOSE Act.\n  The Citizens United case opened the floodgates to unprecedented \nspending from super PACs and outside interests. I am concerned this \nruling has effectively given those with the deepest pockets the loudest \nvoice. This is a situation that works to the detriment of our democracy \nbecause the flood of secret money is drowning out the voices of working \nfamilies.\n  In the elections following the Citizens United case, corporate and \nspecial-interest money has poured into our political system. In the \n2010 midterm election, there was a fourfold increase in spending from \nthese entities in comparison to 2006. During that same timeframe, \nanonymous spending by organizations rose from 1 percent in 2006 to 44 \npercent in 2010.\n  In response to the surge in secret election spending by special \ninterests, the DISCLOSE Act seeks to restore accountability and \ntransparency in our country's elections. The bill represents an \nimportant first step in addressing the many problems created by the \nCitizens United ruling.\n  Even the Supreme Court reckoned that greater transparency would \nlikely be needed to mitigate the risk of corruption as a result of its \nruling. Therefore, I am baffled by my colleagues who are dragging their \nheels on such a commonsense measure. Voters deserve to know who is \nmaking large donations to influence an election. The DISCLOSE Act would \ngive Americans the information they need to take back control and hold \nelected officials and large corporations accountable. To those who \nremain opposed to this bill, I urge you to reconsider your position and \nsupport this critically important legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to express my strong \nsupport for the DISCLOSE Act of 2012.\n  This bill is a first step toward restoring some transparency and \naccountability to our electoral system, an action sorely needed in the \nwake of the Supreme Court's misguided Citizens United decision.\n  If the DISCLOSE Act is passed by Congress and signed into law it \nwould put in place the following two new campaign disclosure measures: \nOne, it requires third-party groups to disclose their top funding \nsources those over $10,000 to the Federal Election Commission; and, \ntwo, it requires these independent groups to certify that their \nactivities are not coordinated with candidates or political parties.\n  Why are these new disclosure requirements necessary?\n  The DISCLOSE Act is necessary because Citizens United, a narrow 5-4 \ndecision by the Roberts Court, struck down critical parts of the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act.\n  Let me be clear: Citizens United upended nearly a century of \ncongressional law and overturned two Supreme Court rulings. It is the \nreason super PAC is now a household phrase, and the decision troubled \nme greatly.\n  The Court held that the first amendment affords corporations and \ninterest groups the right to spend freely millions, even billions of \ndollars on election ads to support or defeat a particular candidate.\n  The practical effect of the decision didn't take long to appear. We \nhave already seen how unlimited and opaque special interest money can \ndecide a Presidential primary, and we continue to see the impact during \nthe current general election.\n  The Citizens United decision has opened the door to unlimited, \nundisclosed corporate and special interest spending in Federal \nelections.\n  In other words, an individual or a corporation can give tens of \nmillions of dollars to an independent campaign effort to slander, \nimpugn, or oppose a candidate or an issue or to support the same \nanonymously.\n  Under current law there is no requirement to disclose to the voters \nor any government agency the names of the individuals who contributed \nto these campaign efforts.\n  This is total unlimited and anonymous spending.\n  Let me repeat: unlimited spending.\n  It is impossible to exaggerate how far reaching this decision is: it \nweakens the very essence of our democracy and the integrity of our \nsystem of elections.\n  What does this mean in the real world?\n  This means an oil company like ExxonMobil, which earned $41 billion \nin profits last year, can spend unlimited money to defeat candidates \nwho oppose offshore drilling. It means Academi (the company formerly \nknown as Blackwater) and other defense contractors can spend unlimited \nsums to elect candidates who view their defense positions favorably. \nAnd large banks will be free to use their corporate treasury to attack \ncandidates in favor of financial regulation and consumer protection.\n  During testimony in 2010, Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 said it \nwell:\n\n       It would not take many examples of elections where \n     multimillion corporate expenditures defeat a member of \n     Congress before all members quickly learn the lesson, vote \n     against the corporate interest at stake in a piece of \n     legislation and you run the risk of being hit with a \n     multimillion-dollar corporate ad campaign to defeat you.\n\n  Since Citizens United, we have seen explosive growth in outside \ncorporate and special-interest expenditures:\n  The fall 2010 midterm elections ushered in the independent third-\nparty groups, which spent a record $300 million during that election \ncycle. This amount is quadruple the $69 million spent by outside groups \nin 2006. Nearly three-quarters of political advertising in 2010 came \nfrom sources prohibited from spending money in 2006.\n  By the summer of 2008, about $70 million had been spent by third-\nparty groups during the Presidential race. According to the Center for \nResponsive Politics, outside groups are currently on pace to at least \ntriple that 2008 total. An astonishing $167 million has already been \nspent as of July 11, 2012.\n  Almost $140 million of this comes from super PACs established in the \nwake of the Citizens United decision. As of July 11, there are 667 \nregistered super PACs that have already raised more than $244 million.\n  More money is being spent than ever before, and it is clear that \nthese unlimited sums could be a major factor in the 2012 elections.\n  Earlier this year, the Washington Post reported that many independent \nads for the general election campaign originate from nonprofit interest \ngroups that do not disclose their donors. The analysis found that \npolitically active nonprofit groups with undisclosed donors have spent \nmore than $24 million in the 2012 cycle on political ads.\n  The public deserves to know who these donors are. The value of \ntransparency was demonstrated vividly in 2010, when Texas-based oil \ncompanies funded a ballot measure to repeal California's landmark \nclimate change law, the ``California Climate Change Solutions Act.''\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\n  Although the campaign for this measure spent more than $10 million, \nthey were unable to conceal that their funding came from out-of-State \nsources, led by multimillion-dollar contributions from Texas-based oil \ncompanies. This transparency allowed California voters to know the real \nsource of advertisements during the campaign and make a more informed \ndecision. That proposition failed, and, I believe it failed because \nvoters knew who was paying for the ads.\n  Transparency works. It makes a difference. With public confidence in \ngovernment at a record low, now is the time for more transparency, not \nless. We must restore confidence in our government. The Supreme Court \nmade its decision in Citizens United, so there isn't much that Congress \ncan do. But the DISCLOSE Act is an attempt to make clear the effects of \nCitizens United and ensure that our election process remains \ntransparent.\n  The public deserves to know who is funding the super PACs and other \ngroups that are airing political ads. When voters know who paid for an \nad, they make more educated decisions. The DISCLOSE Act is a step \ntoward making that reality.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. \n3369, the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in \nElections, or DISCLOSE, Act.\n  I joined Senator Whitehouse and some 25 of my colleagues in \ncosponsoring this bill because it is the right thing to do. I do not \nbelieve, as some claim, that the DISCLOSE Act will chill or limit the \nright to free speech in something as fundamental as advocating for a \ncandidate for elected office. The bill will simply require more \nopenness by those advocating, an important point in our world of radio, \ntelevision, and the internet. The DISCLOSE Act will help restore \ntransparency and accountability to our electoral process by requiring \noutside groups to disclose who funds their political activities. It may \nbe worth noting that the bill is not focusing on the average American \ncontributing small amounts of money to her candidate, but rather on \nthose groups who are making donations of at least $10,000. I do not \nthink it is so onerous to ask those contributing such large sums to \nidentify themselves.\n  But, I must be honest. I was disappointed to learn that the so-called \n``stand by your ad'' provision was not included in S. 3369. This \nprovision, which required that the biggest donors of a campaign, or \nsponsors of a radio or TV spot, be identified during the ad, was what \ninitially caught my attention. In an age where communications are \nlargely anonymous whether it is on Twitter, Facebook, or to a lesser \nextent, radio and even television, I believe it is only fair that \nAmericans learn who is speaking to them as they are listening. We have \nmoved past those times when a candidate or his supporters would use a \nsoapbox to explain their positions to a crowd, and who is doing the \ntalking is no longer clear.\n  However, I believe the overarching principle of the DISCLOSE Act \nsharing the identities of those advocating in an election campaign, \nwhether it be for or against a candidate, or simply an opinion is a \nnecessary part of democracy. I hope my colleagues will agree and vote \nto support passage of the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Kevin McNulty, of New \nJersey, to be United States District Judge for the District of New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the \nnomination, I wish to speak for a moment about the debate we are having \non the DISCLOSE Act. We read the horror stories of secret money going \ninto campaigns. If we can't restrict the amount of money, at least \nlet's know where it comes from. It is bad enough the Supreme Court has \nsaid corporations are people, as though having elected General \nEisenhower as President, we could now elect General Electric as \nPresident, or electing yahoos such as Millard Fillmore as Vice \nPresident means we could elect Yahoo as Vice President.\n  There should be only one secret in an election, and that should be a \nsecret ballot. That should be knowing you are secretly voting for who \nyou want to vote for, and it should be disclosed only if you want it \ndisclosed. As far as paying the bills, the American people ought to \nknow who is paying the bills, how much, and why. Otherwise, we do not \nhave honest elections. It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. President, today we will vote on only one of the 18 judicial \nnominations voted on by the Judiciary Committee but that are being \nstalled for no good reason. I am sure the people of New Jersey and the \nNew Jersey Senators appreciate Senate Republicans finally allowing a \nvote on this nomination even after 3 months of needless delay. I \nsuspect they would be more appreciative if the minority were also \nallowing a vote on the nomination of Michael Shipp for another vacancy \non the same Federal court in New Jersey and who was also voted out of \nthe Judiciary Committee virtually unanimously 3 months ago. I am sure \nthey would be even more appreciative than that if Senate Republicans \nwould allow a vote on the nomination of Judge Patty Shwartz to fill the \nvacancy on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals who was voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee more than 4 months ago, and who has the support of \nNew Jersey's Republican Governor, Chris Christie.\n  The minority's stalling votes on judicial nominees with significant \nbipartisan support is all to the detriment of the American people. This \nhas been a tactic that they have employed for the last 3\\1/2\\ years, \ndespite repeated appeals urging them to work with us to help solve the \njudicial vacancy crisis. We have seen everyone from Chief Justice John \nRoberts, himself appointed by a Republican president, to the \nnonpartisan American Bar Association urging the Senate to vote on \nqualified judicial nominees that are available to administer justice \nfor the American public. Sadly, Republicans insist on being the party \nof ``no''.\n  What the American people and the overburdened Federal courts need are \nqualified judges to administer justice in our Federal courts, not the \nperpetuation of extended, numerous vacancies. Today vacancies on the \nFederal courts are more than 2\\1/2\\ times as many as they were on this \ndate during the first term of President Bush. The Senate is more than \n40 confirmations off the pace we set during President Bush's first \nterm.\n  Because they cannot deny the strength of this comparison using apples \nto apples by comparing first terms Senate Republicans instead try to \ndraw comfort by making comparisons to President Bush's second term \nafter we had already worked hard to reduce vacancies by 75 percent and \nconfirmed 205 circuit and district judges. Their effort is unconvincing \nand unavailing. In fact, during President Bush's second term, the \nnumber of vacancies never exceeded 60 and was reduced to 34 near the \nend of his presidency. In stark contrast, vacancies have long remained \nnear or above 80, with little progress made in these last 3\\1/2\\ years. \nToday, there are still 78 vacancies. Their tactics have actually led to \nan increase in judicial vacancies during President Obama's first term a \ndevelopment that is a sad first.\n  But the real point is that their selective use of numbers is beside \nthe point and does nothing to help the American people. We should be \ndoing better. I\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\nknow that we can because we have done better. During President Bush's \nfirst term, notwithstanding the 9/11 attacks, the anthrax attack on the \nSenate, the ideologically-driven selections of judicial nominees by \nPresident Bush, and his lack of outreach to home State Senators, we \nreduced the number of judicial vacancies by almost 75 percent, down to \n29 by this point during his first term and acted to confirm 205 circuit \nand district court nominees by the end of his first term.\n  Another excuse from the minority comes across more as partisan score \nsettling than anything else. They claim that having confirmed two \nSupreme Court Justices, the Senate cannot be expected to reach the 205 \nnumber of confirmations in President Bush's first term.\n  The first and most important point is that those proceedings do not \nexcuse the Senate from taking the actions it could now on the 18 \njudicial nominees voted out of the Judiciary Committee and ready for \nfinal Senate action. That second Supreme Court confirmation was in \nAugust 2010. That is almost 2 years ago and it was opposed by most \nSenate Republicans.\n  Senate Republicans held down circuit and district court confirmations \nin President Obama's first 2 years in office to historically low \nnumbers 12 by the end of 2009 and another 48 in 2010 for a total of \nonly 60. We did better last year when Senator Grassley became the \nranking member and were able to confirm 64 nominees. Had Republicans \nnot stalled 19 nominations at the end of last year and dragged those \nconfirmations out into May of this year, we, the American people, and \nthe Federal courts would be much better off. As it is, however, the \nfact remains there are 18 qualified judicial nominations the Senate \ncould be voting on without further delay.\n  They refuse to acknowledge that in addition to confirming two Supreme \nCourt Justices in President Clinton's first term, the Senate was able \nto confirm 200 circuit and district court judges. And in 1992, at the \nend of President George H.W. Bush's term, the Senate with a Democratic \nmajority was able to confirm 192 circuit and district court judges \ndespite confirming two Supreme Court Justices. Republicans have kept \nthe Senate well back from those numbers by only allowing the Senate to \nproceed to confirm 154 of President Obama's circuit and district court \nnominees. That is a far cry from what we have been able to achieve in \naddition to our consideration of Supreme Court nominations when the \nSenate was being allowed to function more fairly and to consider \njudicial nominees reported with bipartisan support.\n  Nor are the nominees about whom we are concerned recently nominated. \nThese are not nominees dumped on the Senate in scores at the end of a \npresidential term. These are, instead, nominations that date back to \nOctober of last year. Most were nominated before March. In fact the \ncircuit court nominees who Republicans are refusing to consider date \nback to October and November of last year and January of this year. \nWilliam Kayatta was voted on by the Committee and placed before the \nSenate by mid April and could have been confirmed then. Richard Taranto \nand Judge Shwartz have been stalled before the Senate even longer, \nsince March. As I explained in my last statement, Senate Republicans \nhave shut down confirmations of circuit court judges not just in June \nor July but, in effect, for the entire year. The Senate has yet to vote \non a single circuit court nominee nominated by President Obama this \nyear. Since 1980, the only presidential election year in which there \nwere no circuit nominees confirmed who were nominated that year was in \n1996, when Senate Republicans shut down the process against President \nClinton's circuit nominees. The fact that Republican stalling tactics \nhave meant that circuit court nominees that should have been confirmed \nin the spring--such as Bill Kayatta, Richard Taranto and Patty \nShwartz--are still awaiting a vote after July 4 is no excuse for not \nmoving forward this month to confirm these circuit nominees. Both Mr. \nKayatta and Mr. Taranto were voted out of the Judiciary Committee with \nsignificant bipartisan support, and Judge Shwartz, a Magistrate Judge \nand former Federal prosecutor, has the support of Republican Governor \nChris Christie.\n  The American people who are waiting for justice do not care about \nthese excuses. They do not care about some false sense of settling \npolitical scores. They want justice, just as they want action on \nmeasures the President has suggested to help the economy and create \njobs rather than political calculations about what will help Republican \ncandidates in the elections in November.\n  When Republican Senators try to take credit for the Senate having \nreached what they regard as their ``quota'' for confirmations this \nyear, they should acknowledge their strenuous opposition to those \nconfirmations for which they now take credit. As recently as 2008, \nSenate Republicans denied there was a Thurmond rule. They used to say \nthat any judicial nominee reported to the Senate was entitled to a vote \nand that every judicial nominee was entitled to an up-or-down vote and \nthat they would never filibuster judicial nominees. Well, the Majority \nLeader has had to file 28 cloture petitions to end their filibusters of \njudicial nominees. Now they are flip-flopping on their own call for up-\nor-down votes.\n  What they are doing now is a first. As I have noted, in the past five \npresidential election years, Senate Democrats have never denied an up-\nor-down vote to any circuit court nominee of a Republican President who \nreceived bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. They are \ndenying votes to William Kayatta, a nominee from Maine supported by his \nhome State Republican Senators, and Robert Bacharach, a nominee from \nOklahoma supported by his home State Republican Senators, and Richard \nTaranto, whose nomination to the Federal Circuit received virtually \nunanimous support. Even Judge Patty Shwartz, whose nomination to the \nThird Circuit received a split rollcall vote, has the bipartisan \nsupport of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\n  As I have noted previously, in the past 5 presidential election \nyears, a total of 13 circuit court nominees have been confirmed after \nMay 31. It is notable that 12 of the 13 were nominees of Republican \npresidents.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Kevin McNulty to \nfill a judicial vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nNew Jersey. Like all of the judicial nominees voted on by the Judiciary \nCommittee, he has the support of his home State Senators. His \nnomination was reported with a nearly unanimous voice vote by the \nJudiciary Committee nearly 3 months ago, with the only objection coming \nfrom Senator Lee's customary protest vote. He was rated unanimously \nwell qualified by the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, \nthe highest possible rating.\n  Kevin McNulty currently serves as a director and head of the \nappellate practice group at Gibbons, P.C., a law firm in New Jersey. He \nserved as a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nDistrict of New Jersey for more than 10 years, where he was chief of \nthe Appeals Division for 3 of those years. After law school, he clerked \nfor Judge Frederick B. Lacey of the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. Over the course of his 29-year legal career, \nKevin McNulty has tried 12 cases to verdict and has argued numerous \ncases before the Federal courts of appeal. In 2008, the New Jersey Law \nJournal named him ``Lawyer of the Year.'' I support this well-qualified \nnominee.\n  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to reconsider their ill-conceived \npartisan strategy and work with us to meet the needs of the American \npeople. With more than 75 judicial vacancies still burdening the \nAmerican people and our Federal courts, there is no justification for \nnot proceeding to confirm the judicial nominees reported with \nbipartisan support by the Judiciary Committee this year. We can and we \nshould be doing more to help the American people.\n  Anyway, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nwith the time equally divided.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion for a \nquorum?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course. I am sorry. I didn't see my friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Kevin \nMcNulty to be district judge in New Jersey. Although it is the practice \nand tradition of the Senate to not confirm circuit nominees in the \nclosing months of Presidential election years, we continue to confirm \nconsensus district judge nominees. Today's nominee is such a consensus \nnominee, and he will be the 153rd nominee of this President confirmed \nto the district and circuit courts.\n  I continue to hear some of my colleagues repeatedly ask the question: \nWhat is different about this President that he has to be treated \ndifferently than all of these other Presidents? That is a question we \noften hear.\n  I will not speculate as to any inference that might be intended by \nthat question, but I can tell my colleagues this President is not being \ntreated differently than previous Presidents. By any objective measure, \nthis President has been treated fairly and consistently with past \nSenate practices.\n  For example, with regard to the number of confirmations, let me put \nthat in perspective for my colleagues with an apples-to-apples \ncomparison. As I mentioned, we have confirmed 152 district and circuit \ncourt nominees of this President. We have also confirmed two Supreme \nCourt nominations during President Obama's first term. Everyone \nunderstands that Supreme Court nominations take a great deal of \ncommittee time. When the Supreme Court nominations are pending in the \ncommittee, all other nomination work is put on hold.\n  The last time the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees was \nduring President Bush's second term. During that term, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of only 119 district and circuit court nominees. With \nMr. McNulty's confirmation today, we will have confirmed 34 more \ndistrict and circuit court nominees for President Obama than we did for \nPresident Bush in similar circumstances.\n  During the last Presidential election in 2008, the Senate confirmed a \ntotal of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. Today we will exceed the \nnumber of district court judges confirmed. We have already confirmed \ncircuit nominees, and this will be the 26th district judge confirmed \nthis year. Those who say this President is being treated differently \neither fail to recognize history or want to ignore the facts.\n  Another statistic that is often misused to allege a campaign of \nRepublican obstructionism is the number of days to confirmation. My \ncolleagues on the other side want to focus on one particular phase of \nthe confirmation process--the time from being reported out of committee \nto actual confirmation on the Senate floor. They ignore the timeline \nfor the rest of that process.\n  The fact is for both Presidents the average time from nomination to \nconfirmation is roughly equivalent: 211 days for President Bush's \njudicial nominees and 224 days for President Obama's judicial nominees.\n  There is another issue I wish to turn to that is repeatedly raised; \nthat is, the vacancy rate--as if Republicans are to blame for that fact \nas well. Let me review the record and set the facts out for all to \nhear.\n  When President Obama took office there were 59 judicial vacancies. I \nnote that at the beginning of 2008 there were 43 vacancies. So the \npractice for Democrats who controlled the Senate during that last year \nof President Bush's term was to allow vacancies to increase by more \nthan 37 percent.\n  By mid-March 2009, when the first Obama judicial nomination was sent \nto the Senate, there were 70 judicial vacancies. Over the next 3 \nmonths, despite the rise in vacancies, only 5 more circuit nominations \nwere sent to this body. By the end of June, when the Senate received \nits first district nomination, there were 80 vacancies. The failure or \ndelay in submitting nominations for vacancies has been the practice of \nthis administration. Yet somehow people want to blame the Senate, and \nparticularly Republicans in the Senate, for not moving swiftly enough.\n  By the end of 2009 there were 100 vacancies, with only 20 nominees. \nIn December 2010, more than half of the 108 vacancies had no \nnomination. At the beginning of this year, only 36 nominees were \npending for the 82 vacancies. At present, still more than half of the \n78 vacancies have no nominee.\n  I remind my colleagues once again that all of this process starts not \nhere in the U.S. Senate but in the White House, at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. So when one wants to complain about judicial \nvacancies, start first by looking there, and then to the Democrats who \nhave controlled the Senate during this period.\n  Because of those delays in nominations and decisions made by the \nSenate Democratic leadership, only 13 judges were confirmed during \nPresident Obama's first year. That was the choice of Democrats, who \ncontrolled the White House and the Senate, not because of anything the \nRepublican minority could do. Yet Democrats now argue that President \nObama is somehow behind in confirmations, and based upon that flawed \nlogic there is some perceived notion that he is entitled to ``catch \nup'' on nominations.\n  The fact is we have confirmed over 78 percent of President Obama's \ndistrict nominees. At this point in his Presidency 75 percent of \nPresident Bush's nominees had been confirmed. President Obama is \nrunning ahead of President Bush on district confirmations as a \npercentage. It is not the fault of the Republicans that this President \nhas fewer nominations. How many times do I have to say it? The Senate \ncan only act on what comes up here from the White House.\n  Finally, let me respond to some criticisms I have heard or read \nlately about the Thurmond rule. Last week, in the Los Angeles Times, \nfor example, an editorial with the headline ``Reject the `Thurmond \nRule' '' was based on factual errors and omissions, so I want to \ncorrect that. This editorial echoed many of the Democratic talking \npoints that we hear here on the floor.\n  The suggestion that we are operating any differently than Democrats \ndid in 2004 and 2008 is simply without merit. Democrats stalled and \nblocked numerous highly qualified circuit nominees during those \nPresidential election years, including even nominations that had \nbipartisan support.\n  For instance, the fourth circuit provides a prime example of the \ntactics employed by the majority party. Democrats refused to process \nJudge Robert Conrad, even though he had already been confirmed \nunanimously as a U.S. attorney and district court judge. Democrats \nrefused to process Judge Glen Conrad even though he had strong \nbipartisan home-State support. Steve Matthews also had strong home-\nState support. Yet the Democrats in committee refused to even give him \na vote. The Democrats even tried to justify blocking the nomination of \nU.S. attorney Rod Rosenstein to the fourth circuit by claiming he was \ndoing ``too good of a job''--that is their words--as U.S. attorney to \nbe promoted.\n  By refusing to give these nominees a vote in committee, the Democrats \nengaged in what we would refer to as a ``pocket filibuster'' of all \nfour of these candidates to the fourth circuit. This was at a time when \nthe fourth circuit's vacancy rate was over 25 percent.\n  The bottom line is that the Democratic leadership has invoked the \nThurmond rule repeatedly to justify stalling nominees--even those with \nbipartisan support. And now they do not want us to enforce the rule \nthey helped establish.\n  But as I have pointed out, this President is not being treated \ndifferently. In many respects, he is being treated better. We have even \nbeen more fair. And we cannot have two different sets of rules around \nhere. I suppose we could have, but we should not have.\n  I will now speak to the biographical information of our nominee, Mr. \nMcNulty. Again, I want to make it very clear I support this nomination \nand obviously congratulate him on confirmation, which I anticipate will \nhappen with broad support in a few minutes.\n  Mr. McNulty received his BA from Yale University in 1976 and his JD \nfrom New York University School of Law in 1983. Upon graduation, Mr. \nMcNulty served as a law clerk to Judge Frederick B. Lacey, U.S. \ndistrict judge for the District of New Jersey. After his clerkship, Mr. \nMcNulty began his legal career as a litigation associate at Paul, \nWeiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. From 1984 through 1987, he worked \nat the firm handling civil litigation and white-collar criminal defense \nin both State and Federal court.\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\n  From 1987 to 1998, he was a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the District of New Jersey. From 1987 to 1991, he was a \nmember of the Criminal Division, where he prosecuted a variety of \nfirearms, narcotics, fraud and immigration offenses. In 1990, he was \nselected to head the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force, \nwhich handled the largest cases in the Criminal Division, including \nRICO prosecutions. From 1991 to 1992, he prosecuted large white-collar \nfraud cases in the Frauds Division. In 1992, he was appointed deputy \nchief of the Criminal Division. In 1995, he was named chief of appeals. \nIn that position, he briefed and argued criminal appeals to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, supervised other attorneys in \nthe division, served as ethics officer, and acted as general legal \nadviser to the office and U.S. Attorney.\n  In 1998, he joined Gibbons P.C., where he presently is a director and \nchairs the firm's appellate practice. He is also a member of the \nBusiness & Commercial Litigation department. His time there is equally \ndivided between appeals and trial work. The majority of his clients are \ncorporations. He handles litigation between commercial entities, \ntypically including anti-trust, securities, patent, and contract \ndisputes, while also encompassing constitutional and other claims.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nMr. McNulty as ``Well Qualified.''\n  I support the nomination and congratulate Mr. McNulty on his \nconfirmation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a privilege and an opportunity \nfor me to affirm my support for the confirmation of Kevin McNulty to be \na U.S. district judge for the District of New Jersey.\n  The parties who come before a district court deserve to know that \nthey appear before only the most qualified and impartial judges. That \nis why the Constitution gives the Senate a solemn duty to provide the \nPresident with advice and consent on judicial nominations.\n  I take this duty very seriously. Today it is my pleasure to come to \nthe floor to confirm my support for Mr. Kevin McNulty for a judgeship \non the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n  Kevin McNulty has had an exceptional career and has dedicated himself \nto the rule of law and public service. That is why I was so proud to \nhave recommended him to President Obama.\n  I first learned about Mr. McNulty's sterling credentials in 2009, \nwhen one of New Jersey's most respected jurists, former chief judge of \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit John Gibbons \nrecommended him for a position on the district court bench.\n  In the years since, I have had the opportunity to meet Mr. McNulty \nmultiple times and have gained a great appreciation for his outstanding \nreputation in the legal community in New Jersey.\n  Mr. McNulty leads the appellate practice group at an outstanding law \nfirm based in Newark. The law firm is called the Gibbons law firm. He \nhas argued criminal, commercial, intellectual property, and \npharmaceutical matters, displaying his prowess as a litigator.\n  He is a respected leader with solid judgment. He worked as a \nprosecutor and was known for being hard working and fair. For more than \na decade, he prosecuted criminal cases as an assistant U.S. attorney in \nNew Jersey. He served as the deputy chief of the criminal division and \nearned a well-deserved promotion to chief of the appeals division. \nDuring his tenure with the U.S. Attorney's Office, he served with a \nnumber of U.S. attorneys, including a current Supreme Court Justice, \nSamuel Alito.\n  Mr. McNulty's academic credentials are as impressive as his \nprofessional record. After a successful undergraduate career at Yale \nUniversity, he excelled at New York University's School of Law, where \nhe was a member of the Law Review.\n  A few years ago, in 2008, the New Jersey Law Journal honored him as \ntheir Lawyer of the Year. I am confident, if confirmed, his work as a \njudge will earn him similar praise.\n  This fine nominee is, thank goodness, finally getting the vote he \ndeserves. He is going to be great on the bench. He is eminently \nqualified and will make an exceptional judge.\n  In Newark, a Federal courthouse carries my name. When it was \ndedicated, I requested an inscription that I authored and believe in so \ndeeply be placed on the wall. It reads: ``The true measure of a \ndemocracy is its dispensation of justice.'' I firmly believe that there \nis where we see the equalizer of citizenship in this country. As this \nquote demonstrates, our country's core is a belief in equal and just \nrepresentation before the law. Our system thrives because of fair and \nevenhanded judges. They are the stewards of our democracy, and I know \nMr. McNulty will approach this position with thoroughness and honor. So \nI look forward to hearing my colleagues vote to confirm Kevin McNulty \nto the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, with the \nknowledge that we will be sending an outstanding judge to the Federal \nbench, as we so often have in this Chamber.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in support of \nKevin McNulty, a distinguished New Jerseyan and an outstanding \ncandidate for the District Court of New Jersey, and I certainly urge my \ncolleagues to vote affirmatively on his confirmation in a few minutes.\n  A district judge must possess exemplary analytical skills, a strong \nwork ethic, and an extraordinary knowledge of the law. I am proud to \nsay Mr. McNulty has demonstrated these qualities on countless \noccasions.\n  He has been the chair of the appeals group in the prestigious law \nfirm of Gibbons. At Gibbons, he has been directly involved in \napproximately 100 appeals related to a wide variety of legal issues, \nincluding pharmaceutical, intellectual property, commercial, and \ncriminal matters.\n  He has tirelessly fought for his clients' interests. His hard work \nand dedication, as you heard Senator Lautenberg describe, earned him \nthe New Jersey Law Journal's Lawyer of the Year Award for 2008.\n  Before his distinguished time at Gibbons, he served as the chief of \nthe appeals division of the U.S. Attorney's Office, where he was also \nthe lead attorney for the Organized Crime & Drug Enforcement Task \nForce, as well as the ethics officer and grand jury coordinator. While \nat the U.S. Attorney's Office, he was honored with the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association Award.\n  He began his professional career as a law clerk for the Honorable \nFrederick Lacey, U.S. District Judge for the District of New Jersey.\n  He graduated cum laude and was third in his class at the New York \nUniversity School of Law. His academic achievement also earned him \nmembership in the New York University Law Review, where he served as \narticles editor, and membership in the honors society Order of the \nCoif.\n  While at New York University School of Law, he was awarded the \nAmerican Judicial Society Prize, the Pomeroy Prize, and the Moot Court \nAdvocacy Award. It shows the breadth and scope of his intellectual \nability.\n  Outside of his professional career, he has demonstrated an admirable \ncommitment to public service. He is a member of the board of trustees \nof the Urban League of Essex County. He is a former member of the Third \nCircuit Lawyers' Advisory Committee. He is coauthor of the Pennsylvania \nBar Institute Guide to Third Circuit Practice. He has written and \nspoken on a whole host of legal topics. He is also an active member of \nthe New Jersey, Federal, and American Bar Associations.\n  Throughout his career, Kevin McNulty has demonstrated a strong \nanalytical ability, rapid research skills, and an outstanding work \nethic, and I believe he is well equipped to serve with distinction as a \ndistrict judge for the District of New Jersey.\n  In sum, the breadth and scope of Mr. McNulty's experience and \nqualifications make him exceptionally well qualified for the position \nof U.S. district judge.\n  Finally, I want to take the opportunity to say I am hopeful that our \ncolleagues will agree to move forward on two other New Jersey \nnominations: Michael Shipp, who has been nominated\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nto the third district, and Patty Shwartz, who is nominated to the third \ncircuit.\n  Michael Shipp is a highly respected magistrate judge in New Jersey \nwho has an abiding commitment to the rule of law, a deep knowledge of \nboth criminal and civil law, and a long commitment to public service. \nPatty Shwartz is also a well-respected magistrate judge who has handled \nover 4,000 civil and criminal cases. Both of these judges deserve \nimmediate consideration. Their qualifications will make them an \nexceptional addition to the Federal bench in New Jersey, and certainly \nI offer my strong support to both of them as we move forward in this \nprocess.\n  I hope after tonight's vote--where we expect this extraordinary \ncandidate to be confirmed--we will get the opportunity to do so also \nfor Judge Shipp and Judge Shwartz.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                         Law of the Sea Treaty\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise for an announcement. At the \nconclusion of these votes, I will be making what I think is a fairly \nsignificant announcement in terms of 35 Members of this body who have \nstated they will oppose the Law of the Sea Treaty, which, of course, \nmeans it would not be able to be passed this session. So I will be \ndoing that immediately following the votes that take place momentarily.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are going to divide this \namong five Senators so I will just take a few seconds to say \ncorporations are having a field day because they can put all this money \nin to influence the political system while at the same time being \nanonymous. They do not have to disclose what every other donor has to \ndisclose when they make a political contribution.\n  Are they interested in my State, in the quality of the representation \nof my State? I think they are interested in their own agenda and buying \nelections.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, it is not a shareholder democracy \nwhen a $10 million corporate buy effectively drowns out the $5 to $10 \nto $20 donation that represents real people with real concerns. The \nDISCLOSE Act would make CEOs do what political candidates do--what we \nall do--when we pay for political advertising: face the camera and tell \nthe voters we sponsored a commercial. Whether we are Democrat or \nRepublican, surely, we wouldn't want to see our political system, our \ndemocratic system, become the puppet of a few large corporations with \nwhatever interest they have--oil or big insurance or drug companies or \ncompanies that outsource jobs as their specialty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the most astounding fact that has \nemerged since the Citizens United decision is that just 17 people have \ngiven over half the money to the Republican super PAC. There is very \nlittle disclosure, and there are huge amounts of money cascading in \nfrom a small few.\n  My colleagues, whether one is a Democrat or a Republican, we have to \nadmit this is corrosive to our democracy. This gets further away from \nthe idea that each of us has an equal say than anything that has been \ndone in the last 100 years.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in this modest measure, which \ndoesn't even limit how much people can give but simply says they have \nto disclose; they have to tell they are giving. When ads are disclosed, \nthey are less vicious and there is some semblance of truth that has to \nfloat around them.\n  I urge my colleagues, for the good of this country, the sake of our \nfuture, to support this modest, truly modest, piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, perhaps the most important three words \nin our constitution are ``We the people.'' But the whole notion of ``We \nthe people'' is threatened by oceans of dark secret cash, oceans of \ncash used as a threat on the front end and as an election hammer on the \nback end. It is simply destructive to our democracy.\n  Tonight is the night for some profiles in courage to stand for the \nAmerican system, for democracy, and for the people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, in 1822, the Founding Father James \nMadison wrote:\n\n       A popular government without popular information or the \n     means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a \n     tragedy or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern \n     ignorance, and a people who mean to be their own governors \n     must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives.\n\n  A vote for DISCLOSE is a vote to arm the people with the power that \nknowledge gives, to arm them with the popular information about \nelections--information necessary to prevent this\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\ngreat popular government of ours from becoming a special interest \nfarce, information necessary to protect this democracy from the \ntragedy, as John McCain predicted, of scandal that will result.\n  Give the American people the information they need to be their own \ngovernors. Vote for DISCLOSE.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, for 40 straight months we have had \nunemployment above 8 percent and a debt the size of our economy. Yet \nour friends in the majority want to get us to pass a bill that \neverybody from the ACLU to the NRA is opposed to, a bill designed to \ngive the government the information to intimidate people who have the \ncourage to stand up to the government and argue against what it is \ndoing.\n  Not only should we not be doing this in good times but to waste the \nSenate's time on a proposal totally without merit at a time when our \neconomy is in the tank is the ultimate waste of the Senate's time. I \nstrongly urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I wish to use leader time to say we know \nthe Republicans don't like disclosure. We can tell that from the person \nthey are going to nominate for the President of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will report \nthe motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to calendar No. 446, S. 3369, a bill to amend the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide for \n     additional disclosure requirements for corporations, labor \n     organizations, Super PACs and other entities, and for other \n     purposes.\n          Harry Reid, Sheldon Whitehouse, Jack Reed, Joseph I. \n           Lieberman, Jon Tester, Mark L.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                         Law of the Sea Treaty\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am about to make a major announcement \nthat I think is very significant and, hopefully, would give us more \ntime to attend to some of the problem areas we are trying to attend to, \nsuch as the Defense authorization bill, sequestration, expiring tax \ncuts, and all the spending bills. The announcement I would make is that \nwe now have a letter containing 34 signatures of those who say: If you \nbring up the ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty this year, we \nwould oppose it. So we actually have 35 such signatures.\n  I want to make a couple of comments. I was going to talk for a little \nlonger, but I know there are a lot of Senators wanting to get the \nfloor. So I will try to do this in a shorter period of time.\n  First of all, I have been involved in this treaty for a long period \nof time. Way back during the Reagan administration this treaty that was \nactually first negotiated back in the 1970s was defeated for a variety \nof reasons. A lot of people are saying the reasons Reagan opposed it at \nthat time have been answered. That is just flat not true. Ambassador \nJames Malone, who renegotiated the lost treaty during the Reagan \nadministration, stated:\n\n       All the provisions from the past that make such a [new \n     world order] outcome possible, indeed likely, still stand. It \n     is not true, as argued by some, and frequently mentioned, \n     that the U.S. rejected the Convention in 1982 solely because \n     of technical difficulties with part XI.\n\n  That is the seabed mining portion of it.\n\n       The Collectivist and redistributionist provisions of the \n     treaty were at the core. . . .\n\n  They are still in there today.\n  I think it is important to recall what happened in 2004. In 2004, \nwhen Republicans were the majority, I chaired the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works and was also one of the senior members of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. At that time the Law of the Sea \nTreaty passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee without--I believe \nit was without a dissenting vote. I think it was 16 to 0. So we started \nhaving hearings before the two committees that were my committees, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, talking about how this would \nsubject us to other countries imposing their will on us, as well as \nramifications that would affect the Senate Armed Services Committee. As \na result, of course, we recall it was defeated.\n  We have this happening again. I do appreciate Senator Kerry and his \nefforts to get this through. We have had several hearings. They have \nbeen pretty lopsided. I believe the count today is there have been 16 \nwitnesses supporting it and some 4 witnesses opposing it. That is not \nreally important because I think it is worth mentioning a couple of \nthings about it but then actually going into the detail as to why, if \nit is brought up, it could not be ratified during this year or during a \nlameduck session.\n  First of all, when I talk to someone about the problems with this I \ntell them this would cede authority to the\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\nUnited Nations over 70 percent of the surface of the Earth, along with \nthe air above it. I remember one time a witness came--this was back \nduring the Bush administration which was supporting the treaty, but I \nasked the question, I said: If you have 70 percent of the surface area, \ndoes that mean you also have 70 percent of the air above it? They could \nnot answer that question. Now I think it is pretty well understood that \nwould be the case.\n  I tell people three things: First of all, we would be submitting our \nsovereignty, surrendering it to the United Nations, over 70 percent. \nThat really is enough. But when we talk about the fact that for the \nfirst time in the history of this country it authorized the United \nNations to have taxing authority over the United States of America, \npeople go ballistic. That is something that is not conceivable we would \neven be considering.\n  Then when we are talking about the lawsuits, how we have lawsuits we \ncould be facing--let me be a little more specific.\n  The area that is in controversy in terms of its ability to tax or \notherwise get royalties from the United States, would otherwise go to \nthe United States and put those into the United Nations, is an area \ncalled the Extended Continental Shelf. That would be in excess of 200 \nnautical miles offshore. Nothing within this treaty is going to affect \nthis within the 200 miles, but outside it would be.\n  As it is right now, it is important to understand how the royalties \nare paid at the present time. The royalties the United States usually \ncollects from the Extended Continental Shelf is an amount between 12.5 \npercent and 18.75 percent. The reason there is a disparity between \nthose is because the royalties go along with how much money can be made \nout there if things go well and how deep it is, how far out it is, how \nexpensive it is to drill, and all of that. So the range the United \nStates currently collects is between 12.5 percent and 18.75 percent \nfrom the Extended Continental Shelf.\n  Under article 82, if we pass the Law of the Sea Treaty, at the end of \nthe 12th year, 7 percent of the royalties would be taken away from the \nUnited States--that is roughly half the royalties we would have--and \ngiven to the International Seabed Authority to redistribute those in \naccordance with whatever they want to do. It is not specific. This all \nwould take place in Kingston, Jamaica, of all places, where they would \nmake this redistribution of wealth. I have often said that is something \nthe United Nations has always desired; that is, to have the ability to \nredistribute the wealth.\n  It is hard to say what amount would fall into the royalties within \nthe Extended Continental Shelf. There is a group that was appointed to \ntry to approximate these things, and they have said it would be in the \nhundreds of billions or maybe even in the trillions.\n  For each trillion that would be in production, that would equal about \n$70 billion that would be taken out of the U.S. Treasury and put into \nthe United Nations, sent to the Seabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica, \nto be redistributed around the world in accordance with whatever \ncriteria they would have. That is a huge amount, and it is very \nsignificant, and it is specific that the figure would be up to 7 \npercent after the 12th year. That is a very significant amount.\n  When we stop and think about it, we have been talking about how we \ncan come up with $1 trillion in the next 10 years. Now all of a sudden \nwe have an amount that could come close to equaling that just from \nlosing our royalties that would otherwise come to the United States of \nAmerica. Of course, there is the lawsuits. I think this is significant. \nUnder the Law of the Sea Treaty, any country could sue the United \nStates in an international tribunal and not in the U.S. courts.\n  In other words, we could be subjected to lawsuits from other \ncountries. There are already a number of Pacific Island nations that \nintend to sue the United States for environmental damage to their seas \nand air if the United States joins the Law of the Sea Treaty. In other \nwords, we would be voluntarily allowing people to sue the United States \non what they would allege to be environmental damages.\n  The members of the convention and regulations to prevent pollution in \nmaritime is very specific. Article 212 of the Law of the Sea Treaty \nstates to ``adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control \npollution of the marine environment from or through the atmosphere, \napplicable to the air space under their sovereignty''--we are talking \nabout the United Nations--``and to vessels flying their flag or vessels \nor aircraft of their registry, taking into account internationally \nagreed rules, standards and recommended practices.''\n  If the EPA--as we found out in their endangerment finding--is able to \ndeclare an endangerment, just imagine what they could do under this \ncase. In fact, article 235 states that countries ``are responsible for \nthe fulfillment of their international obligations concerning the \nprotection and preservation of the marine environment. They shall be \nliable in accordance with international law.''\n  That is why we have so many of the far-left environmental groups, \nsuch as Greenpeace, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, and all of them fervently supporting this \ntreaty because they want to use it admittedly to bring the United \nStates and all other countries into conformity with their environmental \nagenda.\n  I am going to submit this for the Record. It is interesting because \nwe have, for example, Andrew Strauss, who is a law professor and is \nvery well known, who states that the U.S. rejection of the Kyoto \nProtocol ``makes the United States the most logical first country \ntarget of a global warming lawsuit in international forum.''\n  I commend to the attention of my colleagues the various legal \nentities that are rejoicing about the fact that they might be able to \nsue this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter signed \nby 31 Members of the Senate stating that they will object to and vote \nagainst any ratification effort that would take place this year. It \ndoesn't restrict it to this year. There are 31 Members.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader, We understand that Chairman Kerry has \n     renewed his efforts to pursue Senate ratification of the \n     United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are \n     writing to let you know that we believe this Convention \n     reflects political, economic, and ideological assumptions \n     which are inconsistent with American values and sovereignty.\n       By its current terms, the Law of the Sea Convention \n     encompasses economic and technology interests in the deep \n     sea, redistribution of wealth from developed to undeveloped \n     nations, freedom of navigation in the deep sea and exclusive \n     economic zones which may impact maritime security, and \n     environmental regulation over virtually all sources of \n     pollution.\n       To effect the treaty's broad regime of governance, we are \n     particularly concerned that United States sovereignty could \n     be subjugated in many areas to a supranational government \n     that is chartered by the United Nations under the 1982 \n     Convention. Further, we are troubled that compulsory dispute \n     resolution could pertain to public and private activities \n     including law enforcement, maritime security, business \n     operations, and nonmilitary activities performed aboard \n     military vessels.\n       If this treaty comes to the floor, we will oppose its \n     ratification.\n           Sincerely yours,\n         Mitch McConnell, Jon Kyl, Jim Inhofe, Roy Blunt, Pat \n           Roberts, David Vitter, Ron Johnson, John Cornyn, Jim \n           DeMint, Tom Coburn, Mike Johanns, John Boozman.\n         Rand Paul, Jim Risch, Mike Lee, Jeff Sessions, Mike \n           Crapo, Orrin Hatch, John Barrasso, Richard Shelby, Pat \n           Toomey, John Thune, Richard Burr, Saxby Chambliss.\n         Dan Coats, John Hoeven, Roger Wicker, Jerry Moran, Marco \n           Rubio, Dean Heller, Chuck Grassley.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a separate letter that is signed by Senators Portman and Ayotte \nstating essentially the same thing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Recently, there has been renewed interest \n     in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a \n     treaty\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\n     completed in 1982 and modified in 1994. After careful \n     consideration, we have concluded that on balance this treaty \n     is not in the national interest of the United States. As a \n     result, we would oppose the treaty if it were called up for a \n     vote.\n       Proponents of the Law of the Sea treaty aspire to admirable \n     goals, including codifying the U.S. Navy's navigational \n     rights and defining American economic interests in valuable \n     offshore resources. But the treaty's terms reach well beyond \n     those good intentions. This agreement is striking in both the \n     breadth of activities it regulates and the ambiguity of \n     obligations it creates. Its 320 articles and over 200 pages \n     establish a complex regulatory regime that applies to \n     virtually any commercial or governmental activity related to \n     the oceans--from seaborne shipping, to drug and weapon \n     interdiction, to operating a manufacturing plant near a \n     coastal waterway.\n       The terms of the treaty are not only expansive, but often \n     ill-defined. Article 194, for example, broadly requires \n     nations to ``take . . . all measures consistent with this \n     Convention that are necessary to prevent, reduce and control \n     pollution of the marine environment from any source, using \n     for this purpose the best practicable means at their disposal \n     and in accordance with their capabilities.'' Article 207 \n     decrees that ``[s]tates shall adopt laws and regulations to \n     prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine \n     environment from land-based sources . . . taking into account \n     internationally agreed rules.'' Article 293 empowers \n     tribunals to enforce not only the treaty provisions but also \n     ``other rules of international law not incompatible with [the \n     treaty].'' Because the treaty authorizes international \n     legislative and judicial bodies to give shape and substance \n     to these and other open-ended commitments, the United States \n     would be binding itself to yet-unknown requirements and \n     liabilities. That uncertainty alone is reason for caution.\n       The treaty's breadth and ambiguity might be less troubling \n     if there were adequate assurance that it will be enforced \n     impartially and in a manner consistent with U.S. interests. \n     But that is not so. The United States could block some but \n     not all actions of the International Seabed Authority, a \n     legislative body vested with significant power over more than \n     half of the earth's surface. Further, the treaty's judicial \n     bodies are empowered to issue binding judgments even over \n     U.S. objections. In some cases, the United States could elect \n     to resolve disputes before a five-member arbitration \n     tribunal, in which we would choose two arbitrators. But the \n     United States would have no hand in selecting the decisive, \n     fifth arbitrator, unless it could agree with the opposing \n     party. Other cases would be decided by the powerful \n     International Tribunal, which is even less accountable to the \n     United States. Comprised of 21 foreign judges with no \n     guaranteed U.S. seat, the tribunal can resolve any dispute \n     concerning interpretation of the treaty. It has compulsory \n     jurisdiction over disputes concerning the seabed beyond \n     national borders and power to grant preliminary injunctive \n     relief whenever it deems necessary ``to preserve the \n     respective rights of the parties to the dispute or to prevent \n     serious harm to the marine environment.''\n       The method of executing tribunal judgments further concerns \n     us. Unlike many international agreements, key provisions of \n     the Law of the Sea treaty are drafted to be ``self-\n     executing,'' meaning that certain tribunal judgments would \n     automatically constitute enforceable federal law, without \n     congressional legislation or meaningful review by our \n     nation's judiciary. As Justice John Paul Stevens noted in a \n     concurring opinion in Medellin v. Texas, the Law of the Sea \n     treaty appears to ``incorporate international judgments into \n     domestic law'' because it expressly provides that decisions \n     of the tribunal `` `shall be enforceable in the territories \n     of the States Parties in the same manner as judgments or \n     orders of the highest court of the State Party in whose \n     territory the enforcement is sought.' '' In other words, the \n     treaty equates tribunal decisions with decisions of the U.S. \n     Supreme Court. This means that private litigants will likely \n     be able to invoke tribunal judgments as enforceable in U.S. \n     courts--against the government and possibly against U.S. \n     businesses. The United States will have no lawful choice but \n     to acquiesce to tribunal judgments, however burdensome or \n     unfair.\n       The treaty could also spawn international environmental \n     tort claims directly against U.S. businesses and citizens. A \n     federal law called the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) gives courts \n     the power to hear ``any civil action by an alien for a tort . \n     . . committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty \n     of the United States.'' Remarkably, even though the U.S. has \n     not yet ratified the Law of the Sea treaty, the treaty has \n     already been invoked as a basis for ATS litigation targeting \n     industrial activities. In a 2002 lawsuit brought by residents \n     of Papua New Guinea against a mining corporation, a federal \n     district court in California held that the plaintiffs had \n     stated a valid ATS claim under the environmental provisions \n     of the Law of the Sea treaty. A panel of the Ninth Circuit \n     agreed. Accession to the treaty would only strengthen ATS \n     claims like this 2002 lawsuit by transforming international \n     environmental norms into a binding treaty obligation.\n       In short, we are deeply concerned about the treaty's \n     breadth and ambiguity, the inadequate U.S. input in the \n     treaty's adjudicative bodies, and the automatic enforcement \n     of tribunal judgments in the United States. Against these \n     risks to U.S. sovereignty, however, we have also carefully \n     weighed the potential benefits of the treaty.\n       As members of the Armed Services Committee, we are mindful \n     that the Defense Department believes this treaty would help \n     secure the navigational freedom of our fleet. We take this \n     recommendation seriously and recognize that the treaty would \n     provide an additional tool to our diplomatic and military \n     leaders in resolving maritime disputes. We also understand \n     the commercial interests associated with treaty accession. \n     Several U.S. businesses have explained that the treaty would \n     enhance investment in energy development and mineral \n     extraction by increasing certainty about ownership claims. \n     Specifically, the treaty would codify rights to resources in \n     the U.S. exclusive economic zone, the extended continental \n     shelf, and the deep seabed. It would also give the United \n     States a formal role in the Commission on the Limits of the \n     Continental Shelf, which is now reviewing claims by treaty \n     members in the Arctic.\n       At the same time, even treaty proponents recognize that \n     these provisions primarily clarify rights that the United \n     States already possesses under customary international law \n     and has other means of asserting. For example, the treaty's \n     200-nautical-mile rule defining coastal states' exclusive \n     economic zones is consistent with longstanding U.S. claims. \n     Moreover, the United States has successfully used bilateral \n     negotiations with Russia and Mexico to define claims to the \n     extended continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and the \n     Arctic. Similarly, the treaty's navigational regimes reflect \n     the current practices of the U.S. Navy, and we believe that \n     our maritime interests are best secured by maintaining U.S. \n     naval power beyond challenge.\n       The real issue is not whether the United States will defend \n     its maritime rights, but rather who will have the final say \n     on the scope of those rights. We simply are not persuaded \n     that decisions by the International Seabed Authority and \n     international tribunals empowered by this treaty will be more \n     favorable to U.S. interests than bilateral negotiations, \n     voluntary arbitration, and other traditional means of \n     resolving maritime issues. No international organization owns \n     the seas, and we are confident that our nation will continue \n     to protect its navigational freedom, valid territorial \n     claims, and other maritime rights.\n       On balance, we believe the treaty's litigation exposure and \n     impositions on U.S. sovereignty outweigh its potential \n     benefits. For that reason, we cannot support the Law of the \n     Sea treaty and would oppose its ratification.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rob Portman,\n       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and \n     Capabilities, Committee on Armed Services.\n     Kelly Ayotte,\n       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Readiness and Management \n     Support, Committee on Armed Services.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I also have a statement from the Web site of Senator \nIsakson, and I was given permission to speak on behalf of Lamar \nAlexander, that while he hasn't taken a position on the Law of the Sea \nTreaty, he does object to having it brought up this year. So we have 35 \nMembers of the Senate who have stated they would object if it is \nbrought up before the Senate this year.\n  So with these items I referenced included as a part of the Record, I \nwould like to say that something isn't going to happen this year. It \ncould be they want to bring it up, and that is up to the leader. If he \ndesires to do so, of course, he could do it. If it does come up, it \nwill take a lot of time from other business that this body should \naddress.\n  With that, I would only say there are some 35 Members--and many more \nI might suggest--who would vote against it should it come up.\n  I have used my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I am here to be on the Senate floor to join my \ncolleagues in support of the DISCLOSE Act. We need to bring some \ntransparency to the secret money that is being spent on campaigns \nacross this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the following speakers to speak in the \norder that I am listing them: Senator Klobuchar, followed by Senator \nMenendez, Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator Levin, and then myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I first want to thank the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for his great leadership on this issue and all the \nSenators who have been involved. I am a cosponsor of the DISCLOSE Act, \nand I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nwill strongly reconsider that vote today so we can actually go to a \nvote and actually debate this bill. This filibuster is basically \nputting a stop to the debate on an issue that is so important.\n  We get calls from people all across Minnesota. Yesterday people asked \nme in two parades: What is going on? What are these ads that we are \nseeing on TV?\n  They have a right to know what these groups are called, no matter \nwhat their names are, who is paying for those groups, who is paying for \nthese ads, and that isn't happening today.\n  I am here to focus on the public's distrust of our political process \nand our need to ensure that the American people have a government that \nis responsive to their concerns. Free and fair elections in which every \nAmerican has a right to make their voice heard at the voting booth are \nthe cornerstone of our democracy. Yet in the wake of the Citizens \nUnited decision, a flood of special interest spending has undermined \nthe faith of the people in our elections. By loosening the rules on \ncampaign spending, Citizens United has led to a torrent of negative ads \nfunded not by concerned citizens participating in democracy but by \nunlimited special interest money.\n  I don't think we thought we would see the day with all of the reforms \nthat had been made where one billionaire can write a $10 million check \nor $20 million check. Under the system, candidates have to report every \ncontribution that is $200 and over, and we have to painstakingly do our \nreports so the world, our constituents, and reporters can see them \nonline. We have literally hundreds of millions of dollars that are \nbeing spent where we cannot tell where that money came from. That is \nnot right.\n  This type of campaign spending moves the focus of our elections away \nfrom the real issues facing American families but, worse, this \nunprecedented involvement of special interests in our political process \nhas convinced the American people there is something wrong with how we \nconduct elections--and there is. Americans can see the increased role \nthat special interests and even individual billionaires are playing in \npolitics, heightening their suspicions that Washington works only for \nthe powerful.\n  I constantly hear from the people of my State who justifiably believe \nthe more money outside groups spend--secret money they are spending on \nthese campaigns--the less their voices are heard. We cannot continue to \nallow faith in our democratic process to be eroded by the secretive \ninfluence of outside money. That is why I am a cosponsor of the \nDISCLOSE Act.\n  The DISCLOSE Act heeds the wisdom of Justice Louis Brandeis that \nsunlight is the best disinfectant and will bring accountability and \ntransparency to the special interest money that is inundating our \nelections and inundating the airwaves. The act requires that certain \norganizations, including corporations, unions, section 527 political \ngroups, and so-called super PACs declare their campaign spending above \na certain dollar amount. The act will ensure that Americans can find \nout the sources of funding for advertising they seek. Most importantly, \nthey will prevent special interests from hiding behind the curtain as \nthey attempt to influence our elections.\n  By setting the reporting threshold at $10,000, this carefully crafted \nact we just voted to go ahead with--and, unfortunately, is blocked by a \nfilibuster--ensures that small businesses and other organizations will \nnot be unduly burdened and that only significant political players will \nhave to report their spending.\n  I know some people oppose the DISCLOSE Act on what they call first \namendment grounds, but this bill doesn't limit free speech in any way. \nI don't agree with the notion that contribution limits and other \nrestrictions on campaign spending are a threat to free speech. But even \nif we were to accept that argument, this bill does nothing to impact \nfree speech. It does not contain any limits on contributions or \nspending or make any changes to our campaign finance system, as much as \nI think we need to do that.\n  In fact, I think the best way to do that is a constitutional \namendment. But that is not what we are talking about today. We are \ntalking about a simple bill called the DISCLOSE Act, which will ensure \nmore transparency so we know what billionaire is spending how much \nmoney in each State on the ads we are seeing on TV.\n  In reality it is a modest bill in comparison to the size of the \nproblem, but it is a first step toward bringing some sensibleness back \nto the elections. This bill simply ensures the public has access to \ninformation about the funding behind television ads and other election \nmaterials. In fact, even the majority opinion in Citizens United \ndiscussed the constitutionality and important benefits of disclosure. \nThe opinion itself in Citizens United said this:\n\n       The first amendment protects political speech; and \n     disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the \n     speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This \n     transparency enables the electorate to make informed \n     decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and \n     messages.\n\n  The Supreme Court actually anticipated that Congress--in this \ndecision that I don't agree with--might put some disclosure rules in \nplace, but today we were blocked from doing that. Our campaign finance \nlaws already require that many individual contributions, as I noted, be \nmade public. I see no harm in holding outside groups and outside \nindividuals to the same level of accountability.\n  Finally, this should not be a partisan issue. Senators in both \nparties have been leaders on campaign finance reform. As everyone \nknows, Senators McCain and Feingold championed the most significant \nreforms in many years, and this bill is much less dramatic than those \nreforms.\n  I ask my colleagues to reconsider their vote. Our democracy literally \ndepends on this. We have to know who is spending money so we can figure \nout why they are spending the money so people will understand the true \nintent behind these ads. They can't do it if they don't have the \ninformation, if someone is just pulling a curtain over their heads so \nthey cannot see anything except the noise on the screen. They need to \nknow what is behind it.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nspeaking about the DISCLOSE Act and why this is so critically important \nfor our democracy. I appreciate the leadership of several of our \ncolleagues in this respect.\n  For the last 2 years our democracy has been hijacked by powerful \nspecial interests. Tonight we had the opportunity to begin repairing \nthe fabric of our Nation's democracy before permanent damage is done. \nUnfortunately, Republicans decided not to put our democracy back on the \nright track.\n  Out there, in this Presidential election season, murky special \ninterests are spending unlimited amounts of corporate money. It is even \npossible that foreign governments can determine it is in their \ninterests to funnel vast amounts of money to influence American \npolitical elections. Think about a country that does currency \nmanipulation, that violates trade agreements, that steals intellectual \nproperty rights. Those of us who oppose those types of actions taken by \nother countries that are against the national economic interests of the \nUnited States could easily see that money flow through U.S. \nsubsidiaries. That money could ultimately end up in campaigns to say: \nWe do not want this Member of Congress, who is standing up for the \ninterests of the American middle class and American businesses against \nour interests. We want to be able to continue to manipulate our \ncurrency, to be able to continue to steal intellectual property rights, \nto be able to continue with impunity to violate trade agreements.\n  That is possible as the law exists now. I believe we have a patriotic \nobligation to protect our electoral system from that kind of influence. \nThese anonymous secretive interests--mostly corporate--aren't spending \nmoney because they want to feel like a part of the process, they are \nspending money for a purpose. They have a reason and, no doubt, a self-\ninterest. One doesn't spend tens of millions of dollars without having \na self-interest. Is this what our Founding Fathers had in mind? We \nshould know who they are and what is their agenda.\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\n  Since the Supreme Court made its ruling in Citizens United allowing \ncorporate interests to spend money unlimitedly, the money has been more \nthan trickling in, the money has been a torrent, a tsunami of unlimited \ncash. According to the New York Times, independent groups have spent at \nleast $118 million since the start of the Presidential campaign. One \nsuper PAC alone has spent over $57 million.\n  If my colleagues do not believe me, listen to Michael Toner, the \nformer Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, who said: ``I can \ntell you from personal experience the money's flowing.'' The money is \nflowing. This begs the question, Where is this money flowing from and \nwhere is it going? Who is behind the cash and what is to prevent \nforeign government interests from influencing our elections? What is to \nstop foreign influence in American elections other than complete \ndisclosure?\n  If corporations are spending money to influence elections, it is for \nthe sole purpose of improving their own bottom lines. And this \nundermines the very essence of our democracy, where individual citizens \nare the ones who should determine the outcome of elections, not murky, \nshadowy, multibillion-dollar corporate interests or, worse, a foreign \ngovernment. Disclosure, full disclosure, is what we need, and that is \nwhat we should demand before the people lose control of our electoral \nprocess.\n  That is why I introduced another bill, the Shareholder Protection \nAct--a commonsense proposal that gives real people a say in the \nprocess. If the Supreme Court's position, which, obviously, is the law \nof the land, is that a corporation is a person and therefore can go \nahead and spend in Federal elections, then since the corporation's \nmoney belongs to the shareholders, it is only right that they have a \nvoice on how their money is going to influence elections.\n  My bill would require shareholder approval of corporate political \nspending. This basic step would ensure that corporations' political \nactivities actually reflect the will of their shareholders. If, as the \nSupreme Court ruled, corporations have free speech rights, then their \nshareholders should have control of that speech. The Shareholder \nProtection Act does that by giving shareholders the opportunity to \nexercise their free speech rights. But until we can reach consensus on \nmy proposal, the least we can give the American people is the right to \nknow who is trying to influence them.\n  I think these are basic principles of a democracy. There are basic \nprinciples in our democracy on which both parties should be able to \nagree.\n  Imagine the influence of the big five oil companies on American \nelections. In March, 47 U.S. Senators voted against repealing $24 \nbillion in oil subsidies over the next 10 years. We know from their \npublicly disclosed donations that these 47 Senators received over $23 \nmillion in donations from oil companies over the course of their \ncareers. So after the oil companies fought tooth and nail to protect \nthe taxpayer subsidies--the $24 billion they get, which costs us as \ntaxpayers $76 dollars every second--do we think they wouldn't spend \nmillions more in support of what they want? Now they can give unlimited \namounts of money to super PACs without ever disclosing the \ncontributions.\n  In another example, Alliance Resource Group, a coal company, gave \nover $2.4 million to Karl Rove's super PAC, American Crossroads, which \nthen turned around and funded advertisements targeting important \nenvironmental protection regulations. They are using unlimited \ncorporate funds to influence our elections and our Nation's energy \npolicy to protect their bottom line, regardless of the consequences to \nthe air we breathe and regardless that States such as mine suffer from \ntoo high of an incidence of respiratory illnesses and cancers. They \nbasically spend whatever it takes to buy their right to continue to \npollute the air we collectively breathe.\n  I could go on and on with examples of why special interests would \nvery well spend in Federal elections to dictate policies that \nultimately would hurt everyone but the special interests. That is what \nwe are fighting against. This legislation is the first step in undoing \nthat.\n  The American people deserve to know who is giving more than $10,000. \nI don't believe that is too much to ask. As a matter of fact, all of us \nwho run in this body for the Senate and all who run in the House of \nRepresentatives--all of our contributors are subject to disclosure. So \nif the donation of an average citizen back at home is subject to \ndisclosure, why can we not at least have that corporation disclose when \nthey give over $10,000 to one of these shadowy super PACs? The average \ncitizen has to disclose but the corporations don't. Isn't something \nwrong with that equation?\n  I see why we can't get a vote on the other side of the aisle because, \noverwhelmingly, they are receiving the benefits of this undisclosed, \nshadowy money. But is that truly the American way? Is that why we came \nto this institution? I thought we came for the very essence of what our \ndemocracy is about, which is clear, open transparency at the end of the \nday. Is that what the average voter wants to see in terms of this \ndemocracy? I don't think so.\n  I leave my colleagues with this simple message: Our democracy was \nfounded on the principle of an open and honest debate, but without \ndisclosure we get neither. All we get are commercials on television and \nwe don't know who is paying for them; we don't know what their \ninterests are; we only know the negativity that flows from it, but we \nget none of the people behind it, none of the corporations behind it.\n  Again, they will not spend tens of millions of dollars to just simply \nparticipate in the process. If they want to participate in the process, \nthey can disclose, as does every other citizen. There is no reason they \nshouldn't disclose. If there is a reason why any company is spending \nmoney to make a case for what they believe is good public policy, fine. \nLet them disclose. But to vote against disclosure as a simple element \nof preserving our democracy is beyond my comprehension.\n  I hope, as the electorate sees these advertisements without \ndisclosure, they will say to themselves: Who are the people behind \nthese advertisements? Where are all of these millions of dollars coming \nfrom, and what is it that they want for their money? When we ask those \nquestions, in the absence of simple disclosure, I think we will come to \nunderstand who these shadowy figures are and what they really want. \nThat is why we should pass the DISCLOSE Act, and I hope we get another \nchance to get our colleagues to reconsider.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I think Senator Menendez asked the \nright question in the absence of this Chamber doing the right thing, \nand that is staying consistent with what the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell, said some years ago. He said that sunlight is the best \ndisinfectant and that we should disclose everything. He wanted \nunlimited--mostly, I believe, if I recall, unlimited contributions but \nfull disclosure. He has changed his position. I assume it is to protect \nthe oil industry and perhaps the Chinese money that is coming in in \nthese elections or the big Wall Street banks that have opposed my \nelection, as well as the Presiding Officer because of his work on \nbanking issues, and will come in against him in Oregon.\n  I stand behind this idea Senator Menendez suggested, which is that if \nthe Senate won't move, voters will start asking the question, Who is \ngiving this money, and why are they putting in this kind of money?\n  I rise--and I thank Senator Shaheen for her leadership--because big \ncorporations and wealthy investors are flooding our elections with \ncampaign money. They are looking for gain. We don't really know whom \nthe money is from. We can guess. In my State, we think it is oil \ncompanies. We think it is Wall Street banks. We think it could be money \nfrom Chinese interests, whether it is money laundered from China \nthrough American corporations or directly from American corporations \nthat specialize in outsourcing jobs to China and making more money. \nLook what happened with the Olympics just recently, if that doesn't \nsort of beg the question.\n  We know that these dollars in Ohio are drowning out the voices of \nworking middle-class people in my State and\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\nacross the country. Consider this: The television market in Cleveland, \nOH, is the 18th largest media market in the country.\n  Lots of cities come to mind that are larger: Philadelphia, Houston, \nDetroit, New York, Chicago, L.A., San Francisco, Washington, DC, \nBoston. Many cities, many media markets are larger than Cleveland, the \n18th largest television market in the country, which includes about 1.5 \nmillion viewers. Cleveland is now No. 2 ranked in the country in \npolitical spending--again, larger than New York and Chicago and \nPhiladelphia and Houston and San Diego. Only Los Angeles has had more \nmoney spent in its TV market than has Cleveland.\n  The Columbus market--still significant but smaller than Cleveland's--\nis not far behind in political spending.\n  Why is that? The Presidential race in Ohio; the Senate race in Ohio; \na congressional race in Ohio with two incumbents, one a Democrat and \none a Republican, facing off, with most of the money spent by special \ninterest groups; undisclosed, secret money on Cleveland television and \nColumbus television, mostly against candidates, mostly against \nincumbents, mostly against people who have a history of standing for \nthe middle class against oil company interests, who have a history of \nstanding for jobs and against bad trade agreements where companies \noutsource to China--which they benefit from--standing for Wall Street \nbanks that have done significant damage to our country and to our \neconomy.\n  We do not know for sure where this money comes from. They will not \ndisclose it. The people paying for these ads are simply unwilling to \nstep out of the shadows. It is not hard to guess, but we simply cannot \nprove it.\n  At the same time, as to all these ads that have come into Cleveland \nand have come into Columbus and all over my State, nonpartisan fact-\ncheck organizations have discovered that many of these ads in my State \nare false. They have a rating--they have a ``true,'' ``mostly true,'' \n``mostly false,'' ``false,'' and the worst rating is ``pants on fire.'' \n``Pants on fire'' suggests that people running these ads or groups \nmaking these statements willfully disregard the truth or, to put it \nmore succinctly, simply lie. We are seeing, in many of these ads that \nare run by these special interest groups, they are simply lying. They \nget a ``false'' or they get a ``pants on fire'' rating from PolitiFact, \na national organization which won the Pulitzer Prize, is nonpartisan, \nand has no partisan leanings, no ideological leanings.\n  It is no surprise people paying for these ads do not want to be \nassociated with them. If they are an oil company, they do not want the \npublic to know how they are lying. If they are an American corporation \nthat outsources to China, they do not want the American people to know \nthey are the ones paying for these ads and lying.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. These wealthy, unnamed, \nout-of-State donors can get away with this--we know this by now--\nbecause the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision sweeps aside \ndecades' worth of established jurisprudence and allows corporations and \nvery wealthy individuals to spend as much as they like to defeat \npoliticians who do not do their bidding.\n  Big businesses and billionaires should not be able to buy elections \nand citizens should know who is behind the ads aimed at winning their \nvotes.\n  In one of his fireside chats--in a very different political \nenvironment, with very different media available to them--President \nFranklin Roosevelt said the ``use of power by any group, however \nsituated, to force its interest or to use its strategic position in \norder to receive more from the common fund than its contribution to the \ncommon fund justifies, is an attack against and not an aid to our \nnational life.''\n  In a nutshell, President Roosevelt said--he could have been speaking \nto this issue today--that he called them the ``malefactors of great \nwealth.'' He called them ``economic royals.'' He called them a lot of \nthings--very wealthy people who had disproportionate influence on their \nnational government, even with a President who was fighting for the \nmiddle class, who was fighting for the common man against these \ninterest groups.\n  That is why the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on \nSpending in Elections Act, the DISCLOSE Act, matters. We need to pass \nthis bill.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would ensure greater accountability and transparency \nin corporate political spending by requiring the disclosure of \ncampaign-related fundraising and spending by outside groups.\n  Over the course of the past 2 years, we have seen politics \nincreasingly influenced by millionaires and billionaires who secretly \ngive unlimited amounts of money to manipulate American politics. These \nmultimillionaires are trying to secretly buy elections.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would prevent these corporations and wealthy \nindividuals from using shell front groups to hide their donations from \ndisclosure.\n  By giving millions of dollars in secret money, these megadonors are \nlooking to cash in on policies that will benefit their business \ninterests.\n  I do not want to make this about my State. I mentioned the huge money \nin Cleveland, the huge money in Columbus. We are seeing it in the \nToledo market. We are seeing it in the Dayton market, the Cincinnati \nmarket, the Youngstown market, even those TV markets on the periphery \nof the State that serve other States: Wheeling, WV, Parkersburg, WV, \nCharleston, Huntington, WV, Fort Wayne, IN--States where you might buy \nthe television time that Ohioans will see.\n  I do not want to make this about my campaign. In my campaign, we have \nseen already, in Ohio, $2.5 million in special interest money, \nlaundered--and I use that term advisedly--laundered through groups such \nas the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, laundered through groups such as \nCrossroads--that is the group associated with George Bush's political \ndirector, whatever his title was--money coming through 60 Plus, money \nlaundered through Concerned Women for America--who decidedly are not, I \nmight add--money laundered through all kinds of organizations; \nundisclosed, secret money that comes in and does attack ads against \nelected officials.\n  I can stand on my own. I am not all that concerned about what it \nmeans to me. I am concerned that those groups, undisclosed, want to buy \nelections. Do you know why they want to buy elections? They want to buy \nelections so they can continue the subsidies they get and the tax break \nfor the oil companies. They want to buy elections so they can continue \nto outsource jobs to China and write trade rules that make it easier \nand more profitable to do that. They want to buy elections because they \nwant to stop our efforts to force the six largest banks in the \ncountry--the Wall Street banks--to divest some of their earnings. They \nare not just too big to fail, they are also too big to manage and too \nbig to regulate.\n  They want to buy elections, these outside groups, because they want \nto continue the preferential treatment they get in this Congress when \nthey are drug companies and to stop generic drugs and to stop \nnegotiation directly with the drug companies to save money for seniors \nfor their pharmaceutical drugs.\n  That is what they have at stake--always, frankly, against the public \ninterest, always an attack on the middle class, always an assault on \npeople who simply want an opportunity to get ahead in this country--\njust an opportunity, not a gift, not a handout but an opportunity to go \nto college, an opportunity to go to the local--to go to Lorain County \nCommunity College, an opportunity to go to school and be able to pay \nback their loans, an opportunity to get a decent job and stay in the \ntown they grew up in so they can raise children around their \ngrandparents--all the kinds of things most Americans agree with.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would prevent these corporations from continuing to \ndeceive the public and simply not informing the public of what is \nhappening. Their priorities erode protections and safeguards for \nmiddle-class workers and their families. They seek to extend tax \nshelters for the top 1 percent. This is not just an attack on the \nintegrity of our democracy. That is fundamentally what it is, but that \nis not why they do it. They do it because it is a direct assault on \nmiddle-class families and working Americans.\n  The 1 percent will do increasingly better because of Citizens United. \nThe 1\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\npercent is mostly behind these efforts and mostly behind the efforts to \ndefeat the DISCLOSE Act.\n  Democracy demands openness in the public square, in our public \nconversations, and in that most sacred democratic tool: our elections. \nUnder Citizens United, what we have is a sale--not a democracy--it is \nan auction going to the highest bidder. It is not an election.\n  Our Nation's highest Court took an issue that was not even presented \nto the Court and decided to overturn a century of legal precedent. Our \nlargest companies straddle the globe. They wield enormous influence \nalready. The top Fortune 500 companies reap billions in profits. The \naverage Ohio household struggles to break even, as does the average \nhousehold from Senator Whitehouse's Rhode Island and Senator Shaheen's \nNew Hampshire.\n  The largest corporations leverage their enormous economic power into \nseemingly unchecked political clout.\n  In 2011, corporations spent $3.3 billion lobbying Congress to \ninfluence legislation--$3.3 billion to lobby Congress--exerting far \nmore influence on our political process than they should.\n  We know they spent this $3.3 billion because they were required by \nlaw to disclose what they spent. My guess is, if that law did not exist \nthat they had to disclose what they were spending on lobbying, some of \nmy colleagues would vote against disclosure for them, what they are \nspending to influence elections. So they spend $3.3 billion to lobby. \nThey spend hundreds of millions of dollars on elections. They work to \nrepeal and roll back voter rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I will wrap up. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent \nfor 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. We have no idea, though, what these groups are \nspending as they try to undermine our electoral system. What we know is \nthat corporations and roving--if I could use that word--front groups \nare already pouring hundreds of millions into campaigns.\n  The DISCLOSE Act can help clear these murky waters. The question \nultimately is, if we cannot pass this, then our citizens need to ask \nus: Why are they spending all this money? Who are these people spending \nthis money? Who is spending it? Why are they spending tens of millions \nin my State and other States around the country? What is it they want? \nWhen voters start asking that question, I think the answer will be \npretty self-evident.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator Shaheen for their work on this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend Senator Whitehouse, \nSenator Shaheen, and all those who have worked so hard with them to \nbring this cause to the public forum.\n  The genius of our Founding Fathers was to establish a system of \ngovernment in which the governed determine who represents them. It is \neasy for us, more than two centuries removed from their achievement, to \nlose sight of just how remarkable that achievement was. They overturned \nuntold centuries of human history during which those with wealth and \npower made the decisions and everyone else had little or no chance to \ninfluence how they were governed.\n  The remarkable system the Founders created has endured through war, \ncrisis, depression, and doubt. But we should not mistake that endurance \nfor automatic permanence. Democracy requires that we maintain the vital \nconnection between the people and their elected representatives. It \nmust be the voters and not the influential few who choose our Nation's \nleaders. If the people begin to doubt their central role in our \ngovernment, it will be corrosive to democracy.\n  In recent months, there has been reason for just such doubt. A \nSupreme Court ruling has opened our system to a flood of unlimited and \nsecret special interest money. Inexplicably, a one-Justice majority of \nthe Court decided in the Citizens United case that such unlimited, \nanonymous donations ``do not give rise to corruption or the appearance \nof corruption.''\n  Many of us believed from the moment that decision was handed down \nthat the Court's majority was badly mistaken. But events since that day \nhave left little doubt. We have, in recent months, seen the dangerous \nconsequences of the Court's ruling: a deluge of unregulated funds that \nhas threatened to upend the election campaign for our Nation's highest \noffice, a flood whose organizers vow will upend congressional campaigns \nacross the Nation this summer and fall.\n  Through super PACs and through supposedly regulated but, in fact, \nactually unregulated nonprofit organizations, the conduits through \nwhich this flood of secret money flows, millionaires and billionaires \nalready have made massive donations to fund a barrage of attack ads, \ndrenching and smothering the voices of those who are to make the \ndecisions in our democracy--the people.\n  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent \nwatchdog group, as of mid-July, these super PACs have raised more than \n$244 million to influence elections. Individuals and corporations can \nmake unlimited donations to these super PACs whose donations are \nsupposed to be disclosed. But the Court's decision opened the door not \njust to individuals and corporations seeking to influence elections \nwith unlimited contributions, this ruling, combined with the IRS's \nfailure to strictly enforce our laws on the operation of nonprofit \ngroups organized as social welfare organizations under section \n501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, allows them to seek this \ninfluence with spending that is not only unlimited but is also secret \nbecause there is no requirement that donations to those 501(c)(4) \norganizations be disclosed to the public.\n  Donors can seek to influence an election with huge sums of money and \ncan do so now without even having to disclose their involvement. They \ndo so covered by the figleaf that the nonprofit groups to which they \ndonate are dedicated to ``social welfare,'' rather than partisan \npolitics. That fiction dissolves the moment one looks at these social \nwelfare attack ads that the IRS is, so far, blind to.\n  According to an analysis of TV ad spending data by the Campaign Media \nAnalysis Group, two-thirds of all ad spending by outside groups so far \nduring this election cycle has come from nonprofits subject to no \nFederal public disclosure rules. Much more is on the way as election \nday approaches this fall.\n  The organizations now spending millions of dollars to influence \nelections were set up for that explicit purpose, to campaign for \ncandidates they favored and against candidates they opposed. Yet they \npreserve their nonprofit status and their secrecy by relying on a \ncontradictory regulation and guidance from the IRS.\n  This is how it works. In order to keep their tax-exempt status and \nkeep donor names and donation amounts secret, organizations are set up \nas ``social welfare'' organizations under 501(c) of the Internal \nRevenue Code.\n  For example, 501(C)(4), which is a very popular section of the Code \nfor these organizations to claim, requires that an organization be \noperated ``exclusively''--I repeat--``exclusively for the promotion of \nsocial welfare''. Yet in the regulation implementing this statute, the \nIRS says: ``An organization is operated exclusively for the promotion \nof social welfare if it is primarily engaged in promoting in some way \nthe common good and general welfare.''\n  Under this regulation, according to the IRS, to qualify as \n``exclusively'' dedicated to social welfare, you need only be \n``primarily'' interested in social welfare. That does not fit any \nreasonable definition of ``exclusively'' that I know of.\n  I have expressed my concern to the IRS about this. I pointed out to \nthe IRS that the IRS took a stand on this issue once before. In 1997, \nit denied nonprofit status to an organization called the National \nPolicy Forum. The IRS position then was that ``partisan political \nactivity does not promote social welfare.''\n  Yet the IRS's determination of a group's tax-exempt status can take 1 \nyear. Therefore, even if the IRS determines that these organizations \nare not\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\nlegitimately ``social welfare'' organizations, it will likely be too \nlate. The secret money will have already been donated and spent. The \nelections will be over.\n  The contradiction in the IRS regulation is reflected in IRS \nliterature designed to guide the operation of nonprofits. IRS officials \npointed me to information on the agency's Internet that states: ``The \npromotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect \nparticipation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in \nopposition to any candidate.''\n  But in the very next sentence on that same Web site, the guidance \nsays, ``A social welfare organization may engage in some political \nactivities, so long as that is not its primary activity.'' So that \ncontradicts the plain assertion in the previous sentence that ``social \nwelfare advocacy does not include campaigning.''\n  It also then leaves open the question of the definition of \n``primary'' activity. An IRS publication on nonprofit organizations \ncontains the same contradiction. It says:\n\n       Promoting social welfare does not include direct or \n     indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns \n     on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public \n     office. However--\n\n  It goes on to say--\n\n     if you submit proof that your organization is organized \n     exclusively to promote social welfare, it can obtain an \n     exemption [from taxes] even if it participates legally in \n     some political activity on behalf of or in opposition to \n     candidates for public office.\n\n  That makes no sense. If partisan activity does not meet the IRS \ndefinition of ``promoting social welfare,'' how can an organization \nthat participates in partisan activity possibly be ``organized \nexclusively to promote social welfare''? So rather than providing \nclarity, the IRS is perpetuating ambiguity. It should promptly end this \nambiguity.\n  We also have a responsibility to act. The Senate and the Congress \nshould act to prevent these organizations from continuing to benefit \nfrom their tax-exempt status and hide their donor information. They \nshould be required to disclose the donor and contribution information \nand stop hiding behind their nonprofit status. The facade of these TV \nads not being partisan politics needs to be swept away. It is that \nsimple.\n  We have seen repeatedly the corrosive effects of secret money on the \npolitical process. We need to look to history, including modern \nhistory--the Watergate scandal, a single incident in U.S. modern \nhistory that most damaged public confidence in honest government \ninvolved burglaries----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Watergate scandal, which is the single \nincident in modern U.S. history that most damaged public confidence in \nhonest government, involved burglaries and dirty tricks that were paid \nfor using secret campaign donations. Even by the weak standards of the \ntime, much of the secret money was illegal.\n  More than 20 corporations and organizations were fined and some \nexecutives went to jail because their secret payments to the Nixon \ncampaign violated the law. Now a donor can make such secret donation \ndedicated to who knows what nefarious purpose and spend unlimited \namounts in secret with what has, to this point, been the acquiescence \nof the IRS.\n  Post-Watergate history warns us as well. We are all familiar with the \nrevelations about former Senator John Edwards. His personal failings \ngot most of the media attention, but let's not forget the financial \nheart of his problem: While running for President, he sought and \nreceived secret amounts of cash from a major campaign donor in order to \nconceal embarrassing facts that might damage the campaign. Yet huge \nsecret payments to campaigns at this moment in our history are rife.\n  We need to look no further than this capital city in which we work to \nsee the dangers of secret money. The residents of Washington, DC, have \nlearned in recent weeks that the current mayor benefited from what \nFederal prosecutors have called a ``shadow campaign'' of huge secret \ndonations from a major city contractor. The chief Federal prosecutor \nhas said: ``The 2010 mayoral election was corrupted by a massive \ninfusion of cash that was illegally concealed from the voters of the \nDistrict.'' If true, these charges mean that a campaign donor with a \nmajor financial interest in city government decisions sought to \ninfluence the election of the city's mayor using huge secret payments \nthat concealed his involvement.\n  Do any of us doubt that individuals and corporations with a vested \ninterest in Federal Government outcomes are spending huge sums of money \nto influence those outcomes without ever having to disclose their \ninvolvement to the public? People may go to jail for such spending in \nthe Washington, DC, election. Yet secret spending is common practice in \ncampaigns for the highest offices in our country.\n  This is not the democracy that men and women have fought to protect \nthroughout our history. It's not the democracy the Founders adopted in \nour Constitution. As Adlai Stevenson once put it: ``Every man has a \nright to be heard; but no man has the right to strangle democracy with \na single set of vocal chords.'' Yet this torrent of unregulated money \nthreatens to strangle the voice of the people.\n  Mistaken though it may have been, the Supreme Court's decision stands \nuntil it is reversed. We are committed to uphold the rule of law even \nwhen we disagree with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the law. \nBut we must be equally committed to the fight for a vibrant, open, \nrepresentative democracy, one in which elections are determined not by \nthe secret spending of billionaires, but by the will of the people.\n  The bill we seek to vote on would take an important step toward \nmitigating the damage of the Citizens United decision. The DISCLOSE Act \nof 2012 would help shine the light of day on what has been, since the \nCourt's ruling, an underground sewer flow of hundreds of millions of \ndollars. It would require nonprofits engaged in partisan political \nactivities to disclose their major donors and their expenditures. It \nwould not stop the flow of unlimited money, because we cannot under the \nCitizens United ruling, but it would at least ensure that the people \nknow who is trying to influence elections.\n  The Supreme Court has consistently maintained that requiring \ndisclosure is constitutional. Even in the Citizens United case, the \nCourt's majority said, ``Disclosure permits citizens and shareholders \nto react to the speech of corporate entities in the proper way. This \ntransparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give \nproper weight to different speakers and messages.'' Indeed, the \nmajority's reliance on disclosure is key to their argument that \nunlimited spending from corporations would not create corruption or its \nappearance. The same Supreme Court that has allowed this flood of money \nhas said Congress can require it to be disclosed. We should do so, and \nso promptly.\n  It is difficult to understand why Members of the Senate could oppose \nthese simple, straightforward disclosure requirements. It is difficult \nto imagine that we would be comfortable telling our constituents that \nwe voted to uphold the veil of secrecy that now shields this flood of \nmoney from public view. And it is even more remarkable that some of us \nwould vote, not just to maintain that secrecy, but to prevent the \nSenate even from debating it. The filibuster of this legislation, if \nsuccessful, will signal shocking acquiescence to a system in which the \nwealthy, fortunate few can seek to shape the outcome of elections in \nsecret, without the Senate even voting on whether to continue that \nsecret system.\n  There are those in this body who defend the flood of secret cash in \nour politics. It is hard for this Senator to understand how those \nSenators explain to their constituents that they do not deserve to know \nwho is spending millions to influence elections. But it is doubly \ndifficult to accept the refusal of my colleagues to allow us to vote on \nthis bill by filibustering the motion intended to let us proceed to \nthat vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, since the Supreme Court's decision 2 \nyears ago in Citizens United, we have seen a new system of campaign \nfinance emerge. Without limits on donations or limits on spending by \noutside groups\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\nsuch as super PACs, we have been inundated with mostly political \nadvertisements while candidates from both sides of the aisle struggle \nto raise more and more money just to keep up.\n  Nearly $170 million has been spent so far in this election cycle by \noutside groups, and that does not include much the candidates \nthemselves have spent. Just think what good we could do with that $170 \nmillion. The rising influence of donors and corporations is a problem. \nBut the larger issue, and the one we are here to talk about--and I wish \nto recognize the leadership of Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, \nwho has done such a great job of raising the importance of this issue. \nThe larger issue is the prevalence of secret money that is increasingly \nmaking its way into our campaigns. Millions of dollars of untraceable \nmoney have already been spent during this election. This spending is \nunacceptable because there is too much at stake in this election for \nAmericans who are struggling. By that, I am not talking about the \nsecret donors who can afford to spend millions of dollars on secret \npolitical ads. I am talking about middle-class families who are \nstruggling with their mortgages, trying to pay for college, fighting to \nget their credit card payments mailed in on time. These are the \nAmericans who need our attention.\n  They deserve to know who paid for the most recent negative ad they \nsee on their television. The truth is middle-class families will not be \nable to catch a break unless we start by reducing the influence of \nspecial interests, of big donors, and of corporate lobbyists, and that \nis what the DISCLOSE Act is about. That is why it deserves our support.\n  We have heard Senator Levin speak very eloquently to the 501(c)(4) \norganizations, those organizations that are allowed to keep their \ndonors secret. In many cases, they are actually allowed to deduct those \ncontributions. Those secret donors can deduct those contributions from \ntheir taxes. It is hard to understand why they should be allowed to do \nthat. It is not right. It is not fair. We need to change the system.\n  Some have objected to requiring disclosure of donors because they say \nit undermines free speech. Let me address that. Because our democracy \nis based on the free exchange of ideas--and political speech should \nenjoy the highest level of protection--we should recognize that \ncitizens always have the right to speak and be heard, especially on \nmatters as important as who should represent them in Washington.\n  That is not what the DISCLOSE Act is about. It is precisely because \nwe need to make sure citizens stay involved in the political process \nthat we need this reform, because freedom of speech does not mean \nfreedom of secrecy. Anonymous political speech by these organizations \nhas no place in our democracy. Accountability, transparency, and \ncredibility must be preserved in our political system.\n  When I talk to voters in New Hampshire these days, they are not \noptimistic about being heard in Washington. According to the Granite \nState Poll that is done by the University of New Hampshire, three-\nquarters of our New Hampshire adults think Members of Congress are more \ninterested in serving special interest groups. One-quarter of New \nHampshire adults think they have no influence at all on what the \nFederal Government does.\n  People throughout New Hampshire and throughout this country do not \nbelieve their interests are being represented. What they do support is \nthe kind of legislation we are talking about in the DISCLOSE Act. \nThree-quarters of New Hampshire adults strongly support a law that \nwould require corporations, unions, and nonprofit groups to disclose \ntheir sources of spending when they participate in elections, and this \nsupport is not limited to New Hampshire.\n  According to a Greenberg-Quinlan poll recently, 77 percent of voters \nnationwide, regardless of party, say reforming our campaign finance \nsystem is very important.\n  I get a lot of cards and letters from people. Most of the people who \nwrite to me and write to all of us sign their names. Because they sign \ntheir names, we know who they are and we can respond. We can correct \nmisunderstandings. We can engage in a discussion with them about \npolicies before the Congress. The same should be true for political \nspeech.\n  Justice Antonin Scalia once wrote--and we put this on poster board \nbecause I thought it was so apropos to what we have been talking about \nwith the DISCLOSE Act. He said:\n\n       Requiring people to stand up in public for their political \n     acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is \n     doomed.\n\n  It is important for donors to own their participation. That is what \nthe DISCLOSE Act is about. That is why we should all vote to support \nit.\n  I can't finish my remarks without talking about a New Hampshire woman \nwho really represents what we are talking about when we talk about \nparticipation in the political process. Her name was Doris Haddock, or \nGranny D, as we in New Hampshire knew her. Some people may remember \nthat when she was 89 years old, she started walking across America to \ncall attention to the importance of campaign finance reform. In the 14 \nmonths she took to walk across this country--and she turned 90 on the \nway--she traveled 3,200 miles, went through four pairs of sneakers, and \neverywhere she stopped, she talked about the importance of addressing \ncampaign finance reform so that ordinary Americans could be heard.\n  Well, Granny D died 2 years ago at the age of 100.\n  She left behind 2 children, 8 grandchildren, and 16 great-\ngrandchildren. She also left behind an incredible legacy that embodies \nthe importance of what the first amendment was designed to protect and \nwhat it need not protect.\n  We need to make sure people like Granny D can continue to be heard \nregardless of how much money they have. That is why we need the \nDISCLOSE Act. The first amendment doesn't protect the rights of shell \ncorporations and dummy organizations to flood our airwaves with \nnegative ads using money from anonymous donors. Let's take a lesson \nfrom Granny D and take a stand and pull back the curtain to see who is \nbehind all of this secret money. The DISCLOSE Act will allow us to do \nthat. That is why we should support its passage. I hope our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle will decide they should join us. It is \ncritical to our democratic process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of the \nDISCLOSE Act, legislation to shine some sunlight onto our elections, to \nrestore transparency and accountability into this Nation's political \ncampaigns.\n  The DISCLOSE Act is a responsible step toward making sure that people \ndecide the course of our future; that people make their own choices \nbased on good information; that people always have the ability to hold \nthis government accountable through transparency.\n  Right now, that's not the case.\n  On January 21 of 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court made a decision that \ngave power to corporations to spend unlimited money on political \ncampaigns--with no transparency whatsoever.\n  That includes foreign corporations, by the way. So, for example, it \nwould be pretty easy for a Chinese company to start spending a lot of \nmoney to influence American elections, again, with no transparency \nwhatsoever.\n  The Citizens United decision has already dealt a blow to our \ndemocracy. It is allowing a handful of billionaires, corporations and \nsecretive groups that represent special interests to try and buy votes.\n  That already happened in Montana once. And the people of Montana put \na stop to it one hundred years ago.\n  At the turn of last century, one of the world's wealthiest men \nliterally bought himself a seat in the U.S. Senate. His name was \nWilliam Clark. He was one of the mining barons of the Gilded Age. Mr. \nClark left his mark across this Nation. In fact, Clark County, Nevada, \nis named for him.\n  Back then, Montana's legislature got to choose who served in the U.S. \nSenate. So William Clark paid as many legislators as he could to send \nhim to Washington.\n  In fact, he spent a staggering $431,000 buying his Senate seat in \n1899. That's equivalent to about $11 million today.\n  This bold bribery was a national scandal back then. And it shaped \nMontana forever. Because of what William Clark did, Montana passed a \nlaw in 1912\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\nlimiting the influence of wealthy corporations over our elections.\n  And just as important, the scandal showed us that as Montanans, \ntransparency prevents corruption. Transparency allows for \naccountability.\n  Mr. President, transparency in government is a fundamental value in \nMontana.\n  A few weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Montana's \nimportant 1912 law to guarantee transparency and accountability in our \nelections.\n  Citing its own Citizens United decision--and the idea that \ncorporations somehow have the same rights as individual people--the \nU.S. Supreme Court tossed out Montana's century-old law.\n  Now the secretive special interests are taking full advantage of this \nuneven playing field. They are buying up millions of dollars of time on \nthe airwaves, blanketing Montana with lies and distortions in order to \ninfluence voters. And Montanans are getting sick of it.\n  Like 100 years ago, a few millionaires and billionaires are \nbankrolling secretive campaign spending.\n  And they are steamrolling our democracy, because they are doing it in \nsecret, with no accountability and transparency.\n  I support undoing the Citizens United decision by amending the U.S. \nConstitution. That's a heavy lift. But it's one I, along with many of \nmy colleagues, support. And in the meantime, let's make our elections \nmore transparent. I join most Montanans when I say that any money spent \ninfluencing voters ought to be transparent, no matter where it comes \nfrom.\n  That is exactly what this DISCLOSE Act does.\n  Mr. President, I don't think anyone here has heard complaints about \ntoo much transparency when it comes to political TV ads.\n  The DISCLOSE Act requires any organization or individual who spends \n$10,000 or more on a political campaign to report that expenditure \nwithin 24 hours.\n  No organization or type of organization is exempt. It applies to \nsuperpacs, unions, and so-called ``issue advocacy'' organizations.\n  That is not stifling free speech. That is responsibility. It is \naccountability.\n  The DISCLOSE Act strengthens our freedom to make' informed decisions \nabout our democracy.\n  And for folks in Montana, it's a chance for us to put our priorities \nback ahead of special interests, for Montanans to make their own \nchoices free from the influence of unlimited spending by multinational \ncorporations.\n  It's what the people of this Nation deserve. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote for that transparency.\n  A vote against the DISCLOSE Act is a vote to allow secretive special \ninterests to buy something that should never, ever be for sale--our \ndemocracy and the power to make our own decisions, with good \ninformation, full transparency, and full accountability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, before the Senator from Montana \nleaves, I want to ask him a question. Did he hear, earlier this \nevening, a Senator come out here and say he thought the DISCLOSE Act \nwould intimidate people from participating in the political process? Is \nthe fact of disclosing where the money is coming from supposed to be an \nintimidation?\n  Mr. TESTER. Well, anytime transparency and accountability is an \nintimidation, that means there is a different agenda behind that money. \nI say that I think the DISCLOSE Act is a well-crafted, smart bill that \nallows transparency and accountability in our election process. When \naccountability and transparency become a bad thing, we are in big \ntrouble in this country.\n  I thank the Senator for the question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes, indeed. I thank the Senator for his \ncomments. My comments will be very similar because the DISCLOSE Act is \na very simple piece of legislation, and it is about letting people know \nwho is spending money and how much in order to influence elections, and \ntherefore not to allow the democratic process of electing officials to \nbe taken over by a few superdonors who pay for these slash-and-burn \nnegative ads that are also, by the way, patently false.\n  I have had $8 million of negative attack ads run against me. Every \nindependent fact-checking organization has said they are either false \nor pants-on-fire false. Yet the public doesn't know where the money is \ncoming from in order to run these kinds of ads.\n  I really have never seen this kind of situation we are facing this \nyear because this 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision has left the door open \nfor these megadonors to secretly finance and propel the flow of false \ninformation. It is not just happening in my State; we are hearing that \nit is happening in a bunch of States. It is not just in Senate \nelections; it is happening in elections at all levels, including the \nPresidential election. What is happening is that these people and these \norganizations are donating so they can satisfy their own agendas, and \nthey do so in their own self-interest, to see that it is going to be \nprotected in Washington. The ones who are running ads in my State of \nFlorida clearly don't care about Florida; they care about their own \npolitical agenda. In essence, they are trying to buy elections.\n  So with this new crop of secretive donors seemingly popping up--new \nones every day--there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. That is why \nwe need a law like the DISCLOSE Act. Voters need to know who is \ninfluencing the elections. We as Federal candidates have to know \nbasically every dime of political contributions and--oh, by the way, we \nare limited in the amount of contributions per contributor that we can \ntake, and we can only take from people, not from a corporation. We are \nobviously seeing how distorted the implementation of this 5-to-4 \nSupreme Court decision is in this law. That is why we have to pass a \nbill to at least bring it out into the sunshine.\n  In this Citizens United 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision which allows \nthese unlimited donations, the Supreme Court even said in a part of the \nopinion that there is a need for transparency. Well, that is what we \nare trying to accomplish with this legislation. The Supreme Court, in \nits opinion, said that voters should be well informed about the group \nor the person who is speaking in what they consider free speech. Well, \nthat is exactly what this legislation intends to do. It informs the \nelectorate, makes sure they have the information they need to judge the \nmessage for themselves.\n  This onslaught of unlimited, anonymous contributions puts everyday \nfolks at risk of having their voices drowned out by the billionaires \nand the corporations. If the campaign law says the average person has \nto disclose their contribution to a candidate, why shouldn't \nbillionaires and millionaires have to do so as well? It is a question \nof fairness. There should not be two sets of standards for political \ncontributions.\n  That is why we are here on the Senate floor well into the night \nsupporting the DISCLOSE Act. We ought to pass this bill. Yet you see \npartisan politics at its worst when the votes are being recorded. It is \nsimple. It says what has already been described: The person who wants \nto donate $100, even $1,000, if they are going through a super PAC, \nthey don't have to disclose that, but if they are donating $10,000 or \nmore, then that ought to be disclosed and we ought to know where that \nmoney is coming from and what their agenda is by virtue of us knowing \nwhere the money is coming from.\n  This legislation will stop the special treatment for the super PACs \nby making sure they play by the rules everybody else has to play by.\n  Mr. President, there is going to be a lot of commentary tonight. I \nthank the Chair for the opportunity, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank \nSenator Whitehouse for heading up this campaign finance task force. I \nthink this has been a real solid effort by a number of Senators. \nSenator Whitehouse, whether it is at Netroots or on the Senate floor, \nhas been participating this evening, and we appreciate all of his help. \nThe Presiding Officer, Senator Merkley, has also been a key member of \nthe task force. Senator Bennet, who is going to be speaking after I \nhave finished, is another member of the task force. So we appreciate \nbeing allowed to get together.\n  What we need to be reminded of this evening is where we are. We just \ntook\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\na vote to try to get onto the DISCLOSE Act, and 51 Democrats said let's \nget onto the bill, with 44 Republicans--not a single Republican--voting \nnot to allow us to move to the bill.\n  Basically, as Senators Bennet, Whitehouse, and Merkley know, the \nSenate is now in the mode of a full filibuster. We are on a motion to \nproceed and have not been allowed to move to the bill. So people should \nrecognize that is the posture we are in right now, so we are going to \nbe down here talking about this issue.\n  I have joined my colleagues to talk about this serious problem of \ncampaign finance reform, one that threatens the very nature of our \ndemocracy. That threat is the unprecedented flow of money into our \nelections. We need to look at this dangerous torrent of money and \nconsider how to stop it. I believe a step in the right direction is the \nDISCLOSE Act.\n  In January 2010 the Supreme Court issued its disastrous opinion in \nCitizens United v. FEC. Two months later, the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals decided the SpeechNow v. FEC, which the Supreme Court upheld. \nThese two cases gave rise to super PACs. They opened the floodgates of \nsecret cash. Super PACs have poured millions of dollars into negative \nand misleading campaign ads, and, as they often do, under the cover of \ndarkness--quiet, stealthy, without disclosing the true source of the \ndonations.\n  It is ironic. They make all this sound and fury on the airwaves, but \nthey are silent on who is paying for it. Why? Why the silence? Why the \ncat and mouse? The American people are blessed with common sense. They \nknow usually when someone will not admit to something it is because \nthere is something to hide. They have seen where all that shadowy \ncampaign money can take us--to corruption, to scandal, to places like \nWatergate, dark days where we have been before. And believe me, I don't \nthink the American people want to go back to the era when we had big \nsuitcases of cash, with the President keeping cash in his White House \nsafe. The American people don't want to return to that time.\n  The Citizens United and SpeechNow decision sparked a renewed focus on \nthe need for campaign finance reform. But let's be clear, the Court \nlaid the groundwork for this broken system many years ago. In 1976 the \nCourt held in Buckley v. Valeo that restricting independent campaign \nexpenditures violates the first amendment right to free speech. That \nruling established the flawed precedent that money and speech are the \nsame thing--another nail in the coffin of common sense. The result: \nelections based too much on the ability to raise money and too little \non the quality of ideas, too much on a dedication to fundraising and \ntoo little on the public good.\n  Money and free speech are not the same, and it is a tortured logic to \nsay they are. They may seem comparable in the rarified hallways of the \nSupreme Court but not in the rough and tumble streets of political \ncampaigns. We know this. The super PACs writing these huge checks know \nit too, and they must be chuckling all the way to the bank. But the \nAmerican people do not find this funny--infuriating perhaps but \ndefinitely not funny.\n  I don't think we can truly fix this broken system until we undo the \nfalse premise that spending money on elections is the same thing as the \nconstitutional right of free speech. That can only be achieved if the \nCourt overturns Buckley or we amend the Constitution. Until then, we \nwill fall short of the real reform that is needed. But we still should \ndo all we can in the meantime to make a bad situation better, and that \nis what we have been trying to do with the DISCLOSE Act. That is what \nwe must do with the DISCLOSE Act. It is not the comprehensive reform I \nwould like to see, but the perfect should not be the enemy of the good, \nand the DISCLOSE Act is the good we can do now. It is a step forward, a \nvital step forward, even with the flawed Supreme Court precedents that \nconstrain us.\n  The DISCLOSE Act is a step out of the shadows, and that is exactly \nwhere we need to be headed. The DISCLOSE Act of 2012 asks a simple \nquestion--an important and eminently fair question: Where does the \nmoney come from and where is it going?\n  If we don't start asking that question, we may soon be asking another \none, one we heard when scandal shook this country in years passed: What \ndid he know and when did he know it? It is a simple question that \nfollows the money because the American people have a right to know who \nis writing the checks.\n  Under the bill any covered organization, including corporations, \nlabor unions, nonprofit organizations, and super PACs that spend \n$10,000 or more on campaign-related disbursements during an election \ncycle, would have to file a report with the Federal Election Commission \nthat discloses all donations above $10,000.\n  It also requires the disclosure of any transfer made to a third party \nfor the purposes of campaign-related expenditures. This addresses the \ngrowing problem of using so-called social welfare organizations to \nfunnel anonymous money to super PACs.\n  This is a practical, sensible measure. It doesn't get money out of \nour elections, but it does shine a light into the dark corners of the \ncampaign finance system. A similar bill in the last Congress had broad \nbipartisan support, with 59 votes in the Senate and passing the House. \nSince then we have all watched a flood of money raining down during \nthis election year. We are seeing the real impact of the Citizens \nUnited and SpeechNow decisions on our elections. The need for this \nlegislation has become even more apparent.\n  I serve on the Senate Rules Committee, and in March Chairman Schumer \nheld a hearing on the DISCLOSE Act. We heard several concerns about the \nbill, both from our Republican colleagues on the committee and their \nwitness. At the hearing, the minority witness claimed there were many \nprovisions in the bill he disliked. He said:\n\n       I think perhaps the most radical is the government-mandated \n     disclaimer.\n\n  While I disagree with his assertion that standing by your ad is a \nradical idea, that is no longer an issue in this bill. We have taken \nthe disclaimer provision out. I still believe it is an important \nprovision, but we listened to the minority's concerns and revised the \nbill.\n  Another concern raised at the hearing was the effective date of the \nlegislation. Senator Alexander is our ranking member on the committee, \nand I think a great deal of him and appreciate the work he and Chairman \nSchumer have done on this and many other issues. At the hearing on \nDISCLOSE, Senator Alexander said the following:\n\n       This hearing is as predictable as the spring flowers in the \n     middle of an election. My friends on the other side of the \n     aisle are trying to change the campaign finance laws to \n     discourage contributions from people with whom they disagree, \n     all to take effect on July 1, 2012.\n\n  Well, guess what, Senator Alexander. We have also addressed this \nconcern. The bill has been changed so that the disclosure requirements \ngo into effect at the beginning of next year. So the shadow groups can \nstill do everything in their power to buy this election. They can still \nhide their faces from the voters, but they will have to step to the \nplate the next time around. They can still write the checks, they can \nstill try to buy future elections, but they will finally have to say \nwho they are at the checkout stand.\n  The bill we are considering is as simple and straightforward as it \ngets: If you are making large donations to influence an election, the \nvoters in that election should know who you are. That is not a radical \nconcept.\n  What is disappointing is that this type of disclosure, and campaign \nfinance reform more generally, used to have broad bipartisan support. \nNow that conservative super PACs are raising huge sums of cash and \nhiding many of their donors, disclosure has suddenly become another \npartisan issue.\n  If we look at past reform efforts, they have always been bipartisan. \nIn 1972, the Federal Election Campaign Act passed with strong \nbipartisan support from both parties. After Watergate, Democrats and \nRepublicans came together, again to strengthen the act and set limits \non independent expenditures. More recently, in 2002, we passed the \nbipartisan Campaign Reform Act, also known as McCain-Feingold. That \nbill passed in the Senate with broad support. Five of our current \nRepublican colleagues voted for it.\n  The constitutional amendment that Senator Bennet and I introduced \nthis Congress also used to be bipartisan.\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\nSenator Fritz Hollings was the lead sponsor for many years, but the \namendment was always bipartisan. It had the support of respected \nRepublican Senators such as Ted Stevens, Arlen Specter, John Danforth, \nThad Cochran, and John McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has utilized 10 minutes.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nI be allowed an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. So we can see why I am disappointed with the \npartisanship that has taken over this important issue. It is not like \nthe problem of money influencing our elections has been solved. The \nrecent Supreme Court decision struck down laws my Republican colleagues \nvoted for. I hope they will be willing to work with us now to pass \ndisclosure laws that will withstand judicial scrutiny.\n  And unless we take action, I fear things will only get worse. Earlier \nthis year, my friend Senator John McCain said the following at a panel \ndiscussion on campaign finance reform:\n\n       What the Supreme Court did [in Citizens United] is a \n     combination of arrogance, naivete and stupidity the likes of \n     which I have never seen. I promise you, there will be huge \n     scandals because there's too much money washing around, too \n     much of it we don't know who's behind it and too much \n     corruption associated with that kind of money.\n\n  I think Senator McCain is right. I recall the debate when we \nconsidered the DISCLOSE Act in the last Congress. Many of our concerns \nthen were still hypothetical. We could only guess how bad it might get. \nWell, now we know. Unfortunately, our worst fears have come true.\n  The toxic effect of the Citizens United and SpeechNow decisions has \nbecome brutally clear. The floodgates of campaign spending are open and \ngushing and threaten to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens.\n  Look at what we have seen already. Huge sums of unregulated, \nunaccountable money are flooding the airwaves. An endless wave of \nattack ads, paid for by billionaires, is poisoning our political \ndiscourse 501c4 social welfare organizations are abusing their non-\nprofit status. They shield their donors and then funnel the money into \nSuper PACs.\n  The American public, rightly so, looks on in disgust.\n  A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that nearly 70% of \nregistered voters would like Super PACs to be illegal. Among \nindependent voters, that figure rose to 78%. Supporters of Super PACs \nand unlimited campaign spending claim they are promoting the democratic \nprocess. But the public knows better--wealthy individuals and special \ninterests are buying our elections.\n  Our nation cannot afford a system that says, ``come on in'' to the \nrich and powerful, but then says ``don't bother'' to everyone else.\n  The faith of the American people in their electoral system is shaken \nby big money. It is time to restore that faith. It is time for Congress \nto take back control.\n  There is a great deal to be done to fix our campaign finance system. \nI will continue to push for a constitutional amendment that will allow \ncomprehensive reform. But, in the interim, let's at least shine a light \non the money. The American people deserve to know where this money is \ncoming from. And they deserve to know before, not after, they head to \nthe polls. That is what the DISCLOSE Act will achieve.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank my neighbor, the Senator from New \nMexico, for his kind words and his leadership on this issue. I have \nbeen privileged to have the chance to cosponsor a constitutional \namendment that I think responds very nicely to what he hears from his \nconstituents, as I hear from mine, whether they are Republicans, \nDemocrats, or Independent voters. I also want to thank the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse, for organizing this time tonight and for \nhis leadership over these many months.\n  It is 8:45 p.m. tonight in Washington, DC, as we debate this bill. We \nare not actually debating the bill because we weren't even allowed to \nmove to a debate on the bill. I can't tell you the number of times we \nhaven't been able to do that.\n  I am often struck by the fact that I think the Founding Fathers would \nhave wanted us to debate all these bills and to vote up or down on each \none and then to go home and explain to our constituents why we voted \none way or why we voted another way. But here we are, not technically \ndebating a bill, once again, because we haven't even been able to move \nonto a piece of legislation that historically has been and I hope will \nagain become bipartisan.\n  As I mentioned, it is 8:45 here. At home in Colorado, it is 6:45. It \nis dinnertime. Families are sitting around having dinner with their \nloved ones, much as I did when I was a boy. I can remember my parents, \nwho followed public affairs closely, turned on the evening news every \nnight about this time, and Walter Cronkite would be on the television. \nI remember that the ads, as probably does the Senator from New Mexico, \nwere things like Geritol, things that cleaned your dentures. I remember \none ad in particular--I never could believe they could get the cherry \nstains out of those pearls, but every single night they were able to do \nit. And if there was a political ad on television, the candidate had to \nget on at the end and say: My name is Michael Bennet, my name is Jeff \nMerkley, my name is Tom Udall or Dick Durbin or Harry Reid or Sheldon \nWhitehouse, and I approve this message. That is what we saw when I was \na child.\n  Tonight, families all over my State, which is a swing State, are \ngoing to have to endure advertisement after advertisement that is not \nadvertising those consumer products I described but are advocating for \ncandidates and political ideas. And many of them will have phony names. \nThe Committee for a Strong America or Tall Children or Strong Teeth is \nwhat they are going to see. Now, because of what the Supreme Court \nruling did, they can't even find out, if they wanted to, who is \ndonating to those in many cases fake committees.\n  I wish to start out tonight by making clear what is not at issue with \nthis bill. This is not a constitutional question we are debating here \ntonight. There is not a question that disclosure and disclaimer--which \nthis bill doesn't even do--is constitutional. Eight of nine Supreme \nCourt Justices have not only said it is constitutional but some have \nsaid that is a desired result.\n  Justice Scalia said:\n\n       Requiring people to stand up in public for their political \n     acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is \n     doomed.\n\n  For my part, I do not look forward to a society that, thanks to the \nSupreme Court, campaigns anonymously and even exercises the direct \ndemocracy of initiative and referendum hidden from public scrutiny and \nprotected from the accountability of criticism. This does not resemble \nthe home of the brave. It takes courage to put your name on something, \nto stand for something that is unpopular. It doesn't take a lot of \ncourage to let somebody use your money in a way that keeps you \ncompletely anonymous and imposes something on families in our States \nwho are trying to make a fundamental American decision to vote in a \ndemocracy. That doesn't take courage. That is the point Justice Scalia \nwas making because Justice Scalia, I believe, thought Congress would do \nits job and enact what is constitutional, require disclosure, require \ndisclaimer.\n  This issue is one that has been well understood in this country since \nits founding. Here is Patrick Henry in 1788:\n\n       The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, \n     secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed \n     from them.\n\n  Accountability and transparency--that is what this legislation is \nabout, and it is emphatically constitutional. So if somebody comes and \ntells you this is about the Constitution, tell them that eight of nine \nSupreme Court Justices have already ruled on this question. They have \nalready ruled that what is in the content of this act is \nconstitutional.\n  What is happening out there as a consequence of a decision that was \nmade by the Supreme Court on the one hand and the failure of the \nCongress to act in a timely manner on the other? Well, these super PACs \nhave come into being, these anonymous folks who have been able to give \nmoney.\n  There is an owner of a casino in Las Vegas, and he has actually given \nmore\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nmoney to super PACs in 2012 than anybody else in the country--at least \nthat is my understanding--but to him this is chump change. So far he \nhas given $35 million, and he says he is going to give more than that. \nThat is a lot of money to most people, but it is not a lot of money to \nthis guy because he has a net worth of $23.9 billion.\n  We did some math at home, and what we figured out is that in Colorado \nand in America, the average family's net worth is roughly $77,000. So \nif they were to spend the same percentage of their net worth that this \none casino owner in Las Vegas has spent of his net worth, that would be \nabout $108, which is about what people spend a week on groceries who \nare making this kind of money. To them, that would be a little bit of a \nsacrifice, $108, but if they knew they could control the outcome of \nelections in State after State, if they could influence the election of \nthe very President of the United States by spending .0001 of their net \nworth, $108, they might do it.\n  This is pocket change for him. These numbers get so big it is hard \nsometimes to think about what it means. This one person's net worth is \n332,000 times the net worth of our average family.\n  Think about it this way: The median household income in Colorado is \nroughly $56,000. A family earning $56,000 in Colorado every year, year \nin and year out, who never paid any taxes--and is probably paying a \nhigher rate, by the way, than this guy in Las Vegas--but who never paid \nany taxes, who never spent one penny of their salary--$56,000 a year, \nyear in and year out and didn't spend a nickel of it--would have to do \nthat for 441,000 years before it added up to what this guy has. Just to \ngive you a sense of perspective, human beings made their appearance on \nthis planet 200,000 years ago--less than half of what it would take for \nthis diligent and prudent family to raise what this fellow is worth. It \ngives you a sense of the order of magnitude.\n  As some of my colleagues have said, one aspect that is really \ninteresting about this super PAC phenomenon is it is a very small group \nof very wealthy people who are contributing to it. It is not most \ncorporations. It is not some people who have some means. This is a \ntiny, tiny group of people who are committed to a set of political \noutcomes in their economic interests that I am not sure are in the same \ninterests of most of the folks who live in my State.\n  Again, we are not saying they can't do it. This bill doesn't say they \ncan't do it. This bill just says: If you are going to do it, you need \nto tell us who you are. We want to know who you are. Step up and say \nwhy it is you are doing what you are doing.\n  It is not surprising, by the way, that this problem has become \nenormous since this decision was made. In 2006, 1 percent of donors \nwere undisclosed; that was it. Ninety-nine percent were disclosed, and \n1 percent was not disclosed. It is even worse today.\n  This is 2010, the year I was running and a year when Colorado saw \nmore outside money on television than anybody should deserve to see, \nmore outside money than any State in the United States of America, and \n44 percent of the money that was spent was not disclosed. The identity \nof the people who gave the money was not disclosed. That is virtually \nhalf of what was spent, and it is going to be worse this year.\n  I have three daughters who are 12, 11, and 7, and everybody who has \nbeen a parent would know this intuitively. Not surprisingly, as the \nspending has become more anonymous, the advertising has become more \nnegative. If one of my kids thinks they can get away with doing \nsomething negative to one of their sisters--which is not often, but it \nhappens--if they think they can get away with it without anybody \ncatching them, they are a lot more likely to do it than if they know \nsomebody is watching.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has utilized 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNET. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  So you can see that the portion of positive advertising here is much, \nmuch higher than the negative.\n  Today it is almost entirely negative. And between the hours of 6 p.m. \nand 9 p.m. tonight in the State of Colorado and across the United \nStates of America, those graphs are going to be borne out by negative \nad after negative ad.\n  We face enormous structural issues in the economy in this country. We \nfaced them for a while, and we are facing them again because, as you \ncan see from this chart, GDP growth, our economic output, has decoupled \nfrom wage growth and job growth. That is what has happened in the \nUnited States. And the job of this Congress and the job of this \nadministration and our generation's job is to recouple this so that we \nhave a rising middle class. And that is what we should be spending our \ntime on as we think about reforming our Tax Code and our regulatory \ncode and our statute books. But there are some folks around who aren't \nnecessarily all that interested in that because the current system \nworks pretty well for them.\n  I can't tell you the number of times I have heard people say in this \nChamber that the government shouldn't pick winners and losers. That is \nreally easy to say when you are on the winning side. We ought to have a \nset of rules that are responsive to the needs of the vast majority of \nAmerican people--whether Republicans, Democrats, or Independents--who \ntogether, no matter where they are in the economic spectrum, all want \nessentially the same thing, which is to make sure we are not the first \ngeneration of Americans to leave less opportunity, not more, to the \npeople who are coming afterwards. I believe that anybody who wants to \ncome to that debate, anybody who wants to play in that game is welcome, \nbut they ought to tell us who they are.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Illinois is \nhere, and I look forward to his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \nremarks, and a special thanks to my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSheldon Whitehouse, for gathering us here this evening.\n  It is almost 8:30 Washington time. The Chamber is otherwise empty. \nSenator Stabenow from Michigan is preparing to speak.\n  This is not really a Senate debate. That happens almost never in this \nbody, which is unfortunate. I had hoped that perhaps some Members from \nthe other side would come and defend their position, but they haven't. \nIt is their right to go home, and they have done it. We think it is \nworth a few minutes of our time to come even this late at night to talk \nabout this issue.\n  Lyndon Johnson was a pretty famous Senator and President, and back in \nthe day he used to say that when he was looking for advisers, he wished \nhe had someone near him who would run for sheriff. What President \nJohnson was saying is that the practical experience of politics is \nsomehow a lot different from what many people imagine.\n  I thought of that when I reflected on this Supreme Court currently \nsitting--the same Court that decided Citizens United--and the fact that \nnot one of them has ever stood for election, none of them has gone \nthrough a campaign. When they addressed Citizens United, it was \nstrictly from a legalistic academic viewpoint, and the decision \nreflected it because it was such a gross departure from where we have \nbeen as a nation.\n  A Presidential candidate may argue that corporations are people. Our \nSupreme Court, in Citizens United, said the views of corporations \nshould be treated like the views of people, like the free speech every \nAmerican is guaranteed under our Constitution, and with just that twist \nof a phrase they have literally changed the face of politics in America \nin a negative fashion.\n  I would say the Citizens United case from the Supreme Court was as \nnegative on the political process of America as the Dred Scott decision \nby the same Supreme Court was on the social fabric of America. What \nthey have unleashed with Citizens United is a force we have never, ever \nseen before in American politics. It is the force of anonymous, secret \ndonors--people, oligarchs, millionaires and billionaires who are \ndetermined to impose their political will on the body politic and will \nspend whatever it takes to achieve it.\n  We are seeing it all across the country. There is not a single \ncontested Senate race in which these super PACs\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\nhave not arrived and spent $5, $10, $12, $15 million already in \nnegative advertising across this country--most of it unaccounted for.\n  The DISCLOSE Act, which brings us together this evening, is very \nbasic in that people who give more than $10,000 must disclose their \nidentity. It applies to labor unions, corporations, everyone--it is \nacross the board. Disclosure used to be one of the tenets, one of the \npillars of the Republican position. They used to say: Don't limit what \na person can give as long as they disclose it in a timely fashion.\n  They amended their decision after Citizens United and lopped off the \nend of it: Don't limit what a person can give--period. They do not call \nfor timely disclosure anymore.\n  The DISCLOSE Act does. Why is it important? It is important because \nAmericans have good judgment, and they know if a person--for example, \nthe Koch brothers, the Koch brothers of Pennsylvania, if I am not \nmistaken, wherever their home is--they are interested in energy and oil \nproduction. If they invest millions of dollars on behalf of a certain \ncandidate, many voters will say: I wonder what that candidate's \nposition is on the issues of the tax treatment of oil companies, on \nenergy tax credits, and the like. So Americans will ask the right \nquestion as long as they know who is behind the issue. Under Citizens \nUnited there is no compulsion.\n  Senator Bennet of Colorado said just moments ago the Supreme Court \nmade it clear in the Citizens United decision that though they were \nunleashing the opportunity to contribute, they expected there would be \naccountability--like the DISCLOSE Act. Unfortunately, they did not \nanticipate it would become a partisan issue, and virtually no \nRepublicans have supported us. Today when the vote was cast, not a \nsingle Republican would vote to bring this bill to the floor for \ndebate.\n  We are now in the midst of a Republican filibuster on the DISCLOSE \nAct, another Republican filibuster. Not one single Republican Senator \nwould join us in this effort to bring this bill to the floor for \ndebate, amendment, and a vote. We have seen so many Republican \nfilibusters. Now we see this one.\n  The reason this is more important than most is it gets to the heart \nof our political process. It isn't a matter of who spends what and how \nmuch in a campaign. I look at it in a little different perspective. I \nam concerned about who will run for office. I used to put myself in the \ncategory--I think it still applies--of mere mortals who decide to get \ninvolved in politics. I do not come from wealth. I am not a wealthy \nperson. I have never relied on my personal wealth to get me elected. If \nI did, it wouldn't last very long.\n  I wonder if people like me will ever get engaged in politics after \nCitizens United. They have to stop and think: No matter how many doors \nI knock on, no matter how many hands I shake, no matter how often I \nstudy the issues and take the positions I think are meaningful and \nwould resonate with voters, the fact is some super PAC could arrive \ntomorrow, spend $1 million, and blow me away. That is a humbling \nthought for someone deciding to engage in a race for public office for \nthe first time.\n  I think this gets to the heart of what is wrong with politics in \nAmerica--the cost and nature of our political campaigns. It is a fact--\nwe hear it every day on the floor of the Senate--people measure the \ngravity and importance of votes in terms of their political impact. How \nmany times have I heard someone cast a vote here and afterwards say: \nThat will be a good 30-second spot. We think about that because we know \nthat is what our life experience translates into--messages that can be \ndelivered through the media to the voters. Now this outside force comes \nalong and spends enormous amounts of money, dramatically increasing the \namount that has been spent.\n  As was said earlier, in 2006, outside groups spent $70 million to \ninfluence Federal midterm elections; 4 years later super PACs, outside \ngroups, spent $294 million, four times as much. Trust me, it is on its \nway up.\n  What will the average family think about this? I said to my \ncolleagues at lunch a few weeks back: I think the average voter looks \nat this enormous wash of money coming into American politics much the \nway they view gangland killings. As long as they want to kill one \nanother off and I don't have to hear the gunfire and my family is not \nin danger, let them have at it. Spend whatever you want, politicians \nversus politicians.\n  But the fact is this is going to be gunfire they are going to hear \nbecause the net result of these super PACs and the money they spend \nwill be decisions on critical issues. Trust me, the people who are \npouring the money into the super PACs have an agenda. It is an agenda \nabout the role of government, what the Tax Code will look like, whether \ncertain corporations and special interests will be treated in a better \nway by the candidates who are benefited by super PACs.\n  So though the average family may think it is just politicians \nsquabbling and wasting their own money, it is much worse. It, \nunfortunately, brings us to the point where we have to worry about not \nwho runs for office but, once elected, who will stay in office.\n  How about those in office? I have thought about it myself. I am sure \nmy colleagues have. You cast a vote and you think: I just opened the \ndoor for a super PAC to come in the next time I am up for election and \nnail me because I took them on.\n  If we have reached the point where Members of the Senate are quaking \nand quivering about the prospect of super PAC money being spent against \nthem, we are going to lose something very important and fundamental in \nthe American body politic.\n  I also want to say something about those who are defending the \nsecrecy of the super PACs. In my hometown newspaper and the newspapers \nin Chicago, after they print an article, they usually give local people \na chance to anonymously comment. Occasionally, I read the banter back \nand forth. It is amazing, the chest thumping, fire breathing they get \nin these comments from these anonymous pipsqueaks who do not have the \ncourage to disclose their own names. I would say it should be a \nstandard in American politics that if someone feels strongly enough to \nput their money on the line in a super PAC, they ought to have the \ncourage, and the law should require, that their identity be disclosed \nas well.\n  I see Senator Stabenow is here, and I know she has a busy life of her \nown. I am going to yield the floor to her. But I will say one more \nthing.\n  I was invited to go on ``The Daily Show,'' which a lot of people \nfollow closely, and I enjoy every time I watch. Jon Stewart asked a \nquestion of me: If you could pass one law that would change politics \nfor the better in America, what would it be?\n  I said: It may be a little egotistical of me, but it would be a bill \nI have for public financing of campaigns. I honestly believe if we move \nto a stage where we have public financing, shorter campaigns, positive \nmessages, real debates, it would enhance not only our reputations with \nthe voters of America, it would enhance the institutions we are running \nfor.\n  Currently, we don't have that. We don't have public financing. Maybe \nwe never will. But while we have the current system of money being \nspent, let's at least demand, as the DISCLOSE Act does, that there be \ntransparency and accountability for the good of our democracy and for \nthe good of the voters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first thank Senator Whitehouse for his \nleadership. I am proud to join him and so many of my colleagues in \nsupporting and cosponsoring the legislation in front of us. I thank the \nmajority leader for his comments, and all of those who care deeply \nabout, frankly, our democracy, which is what we are talking about this \nevening.\n  I strongly believe in the DISCLOSE Act and think it is critical as \nstep 1. I think there is much more that needs to be done even as we go \nforward to add to this. But this is a very important, basic standard of \ntransparency. If someone spends $10,000 on ads trying to affect an \nelection, people should know who they are. It is just as simple as \nthat.\n  I think it is important for us to emphasize the fact that the \nmajority of the Senate this evening voted for this bill. The reason we \ndid not pass the bill tonight is that the Republicans, colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, are putting us in a situation where we\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nhave to reach 60 votes and therefore, by not doing that, they are \nfilibustering the bill. So they are blocking the bill. They are \nfilibustering the bill. We have a majority. All we want is a vote. Give \nus a vote. If we had an up-or-down vote on this bill, this bill would \nhave been passed. I think it is incredibly important for everyone to \nunderstand that. It is not that we do not have the support. We have the \nvotes. It was demonstrated this evening.\n  At the moment what we do not have is the supermajority to get past a \nfilibuster. I urge everyone listening or watching tonight to contact \ntheir Members, to urge them to support the effort to stop the \nfilibuster--which is what we are talking about right now.\n  Unfortunately, for everyone in America, we know this is going to be \nthe most negative campaign cycle in the history of the country. \nSecretly funded negative ads with ominous music and shadowy figures and \nvicious attacks are going to fill our living rooms for the months \nbetween now and the election. In fact, in many States that has already \nbeen happening very intensely.\n  We know why. We have been talking about that--a Court decision that \nhas tied money to free speech, corporations are people, money equals \nfree speech. That creates a situation where now we are being told \nthrough the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United that we, in fact, \ncannot put limits on corporate money or union money or any other kind \nof dollars coming in because it is under the category of free speech.\n  It has opened the floodgates for secret money allowing special \ninterests--and that is who is spending the money, special interests \nwith their own agenda--to spend unlimited funds to essentially buy \nelections, buy a U.S. Senate that works for them, a U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, a Presidency that works for them. It is not the \nmajority of Americans, not the folks who got up this morning and went \nto work. Maybe they took a shower before work, but maybe they took a \nshower after work--the folks working very hard every day, trying to \nhold it together, who have been through the toughest recession we have \nseen since the Great Depression, who have most likely struggled with \ntheir house underwater and credit card debt too high and trying to \npiece together one or two or three part-time jobs to hold things \ntogether for their families. They are not the ones who are funding \nthese secret ads. It is not their secret money.\n  What we know so far is that over half the money that has come in has \nbeen from 17 multimillionaires in our country. When we think about \nthat, it is pretty worrisome. When we think about the fact that 17 or \n18 or 20 people in our country could decide to buy a form of government \nthat works for them, that is certainly not a democracy. I think this \nbill is part of an effort that we are all working to achieve, to \nprotect the basics of our democracy.\n  It is not about making judgments for people about whom they should \nvote for, whom they should support, how they should be involved in \nelections. It is about making sure we all know--that the American \npeople know--who is spending the money so each American can make their \nown judgment about the agenda of the people who are spending the money \nand whether that reflects their own agenda and their own values.\n  This is simply about shining the light of day, opening up a process, \ntransparency, so each of us can make our own judgments about whom we \nchoose to believe and not believe in this political process.\n  When we run TV ads, the law requires us to disclose. We go on at the \nend of the ad and say: I am Senator Stabenow, and I approved this \nmessage. Personally, I don't see why someone else running it should not \nbe doing that too. I know the sponsor of this bill agrees with that as \nI know do my colleagues on this side of the aisle. But we are not even \nasking that. We are simply saying if someone spends $10,000 or more, \nthey need to disclose it. They need to put it on a Web site so the \npublic has the opportunity to know who they are and how much they are \nspending.\n  There are a couple of brothers we talk about a lot now because of the \nmoney they have been openly talking about spending. It has been in the \npapers. Certainly, it has been in the media for months--two gentlemen \ncalled the Koch brothers who have been spending millions and millions \nof dollars. I don't know what the final numbers will be. I have seen \nnumbers that show each of the two of them say they want to spend $200 \nmillion, $400 million together.\n  I don't know, maybe more to impact the elections. I think it is a \nimportant for the people in Michigan, the people of Rhode Island, the \npeople in Colorado, and across the country to know they are doing that. \nThey should know who they are and how much is being spent in order to \nmake a judgment about how they are choosing to spend their money. If \nsomeone, whoever it is, is spending $10,000 on influencing elections \nthrough ads, Americans have a right to know.\n  We know right now from the way we have been able to piece together \nwhat is happening that we are talking about big, wealthy, special \ninterest. It is no surprise as to who is spending the money. What is \ntheir motivation? What are they trying to buy? I know there are those \nwho would like to keep special tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas. \nWe are going to have a chance, once we complete this debate, to vote on \nlegislation of mine called the Bring Jobs Home Act. There are those who \ndon't want us to eliminate the tax break that allows folks who are \nshipping jobs overseas to write it off their taxes, which I find \noutrageous. There are folks on the other side shipping jobs overseas \nwho want to keep that tax break, and they may very well want to spend \nmoney against candidates and against Members who vote for my bill.\n  We know big oil companies want to keep taxpayer subsidies even though \nthey are the most profitable companies in the history of the world. \nProbably when the tax incentives started in 1916, it made a lot of \nsense for new and emerging companies. It doesn't make sense today, from \na taxpayer standpoint, to be paying high prices at the pump from one \npocket and subsidies to companies out of the other. We know they may \nvery well want to spend money to be able to keep those subsidies. \nSeventy-three percent of Americans want to end oil and gas subsidies, \nbut the special interests are fighting to keep them. We know there is \nmoney being spent in the elections, secret money, to support people who \nwill keep those tax subsidies.\n  So the question is: Why is this in the public interest? In America, \nthe greatest democracy in the world, why in the world are we letting \nthis happen? Our democracy is not for sale. It should not be for sale, \nand we are fighting to make sure it is not for sale. The people of our \ncountry are the ones who have the power to decide who represents them, \nand it should not be a group of anonymous billionaires somewhere who \nare able to do that.\n  So when those billionaires want to buy attack ads and influence our \nvotes, the least they can do is have the courage to come forward and \nsay how much they are spending and put their name to it and be able to \nhave to disclose that to everybody. The American people have a right to \nknow. The people in Michigan have the right to know. We have already \nseen millions of dollars being spent in Michigan, and people have the \nright to know who is spending that money. What is their background? \nWhat is their interest? They need to know so they can make their own \njudgment about whether it has any credibility.\n  The 2010 midterm election saw a more than 400-percent increase in \nspending from what has been called the super PAC. That is a 400-percent \nincrease in spending 2 years ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might just have 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let me indicate also that in the first 4 months of this \nyear, 90 percent of all outside money being spent on this coming \nNovember Presidential election was secret. Again, that is 90 percent of \nwhat was spent in just the first 4 months of this year was secret. This \nis about openness, transparency, and whether everyone in our country is \ngoing to have the opportunity to have information to make their own \njudgments. We need to be allowed to pass this bill. We need an up-or-\ndown vote on this issue. We need to stop the filibuster that is \nhappening by\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\nthe Republicans on the other side of the aisle. Stop blocking the bill. \nLet us vote on it. We have the votes to get it passed. The American \npeople deserve to have this passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I know we have Senator Hagan, Senator \nBennet, and Senator Franken all here waiting, but I would like to do \nsome quick parliamentary business that needs to be accomplished.\n\n\n                      Resolutions Submitted Today\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration en bloc of the following \nresolutions which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 520, 521, 522, \nand 523.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenate will proceed to the resolutions en bloc.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, with no intervening action \nor debate, and any statements related to the resolutions be printed in \nthe Record at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 520\n\n  (Commending the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \n            People on the occasion of its 103rd anniversary)\n\n       Whereas the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``NAACP''), originally known as the National Negro Committee, \n     was founded in New York City on February 12, 1909, the \n     centennial of the date on which President Abraham Lincoln was \n     born, by a multiracial group of activists who met in a \n     national conference to discuss the civil and political rights \n     of African-Americans;\n       Whereas the NAACP was founded by a distinguished group of \n     leaders in the struggle for civil and political liberty, \n     including Ida Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Henry Moscowitz, \n     Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, and William \n     English Walling;\n       Whereas the NAACP is the oldest and largest civil rights \n     organization in the United States;\n       Whereas the NAACP National Headquarters is located in \n     Baltimore, Maryland;\n       Whereas the mission of the NAACP is to ensure the \n     political, educational, social, and economic equality of \n     rights of all people and to eliminate racial hatred and \n     racial discrimination;\n       Whereas the NAACP is committed to achieving its goals \n     through nonviolence;\n       Whereas the NAACP advances its mission through reliance on \n     the press, the petition, the ballot, and the courts;\n       Whereas the NAACP has been persistent in the use of legal \n     and moral persuasion, even in the face of overt and violent \n     racial hostility;\n       Whereas the NAACP has used political pressure, marches, \n     demonstrations, and effective lobbying to serve as the voice, \n     as well as the shield, for minorities in the United States;\n       Whereas after years of fighting segregation in public \n     schools, the NAACP, under the leadership of Special Counsel \n     Thurgood Marshall, won one of its greatest legal victories in \n     the decision issued by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of \n     Education (347 U.S. 483 (1954));\n       Whereas in 1955, NAACP member Rosa Parks was arrested and \n     fined for refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus in \n     Montgomery, Alabama, an act of courage that would serve as \n     the catalyst for the largest grassroots civil rights movement \n     in the history of the United States;\n       Whereas the NAACP was prominent in lobbying for the passage \n     of--\n       (1) the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (Public Law 85-315; 71 \n     Stat. 634);\n       (2) the Civil Rights Act of 1960 (Public Law 86-449; 74 \n     Stat. 86);\n       (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352; 78 \n     Stat. 241);\n       (4) the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.);\n       (5) the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, \n     Cesar E.

Garcia Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and \n     Amendments Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-246; 120 Stat. 577); \n     and\n       (6) the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.);\n       Whereas in 2005, the NAACP launched the Disaster Relief \n     Fund to help hurricane survivors rebuild their lives in the \n     States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and \n     Alabama;\n       Whereas in the 110th Congress, the NAACP was prominent in \n     lobbying for the passage of H. Res. 826, the resolved clause \n     of which expresses that--\n       (1) the hanging of nooses is a horrible act when used for \n     the purpose of intimidation;\n       (2) under certain circumstances, the hanging of nooses can \n     be criminal; and\n       (3) the hanging of nooses should be investigated thoroughly \n     by Federal authorities, and any criminal violations should be \n     vigorously prosecuted;\n       Whereas in 2008, the NAACP vigorously supported the passage \n     of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007 \n     (28 U.S.C. 509 note), a law that puts additional Federal \n     resources into solving the heinous crimes that occurred \n     during the early days of the civil rights struggle that \n     remain unsolved and brings those who perpetrated those crimes \n     to justice;\n       Whereas the NAACP has helped usher in the new millennium by \n     charting a bold course, beginning with the appointment of the \n     youngest President and Chief Executive Officer in the history \n     of the organization, Benjamin Todd Jealous, and its youngest \n     female Board Chair, Roslyn M. Brock;\n       Whereas under the leadership of Benjamin Todd Jealous and \n     Roslyn M. Brock, the NAACP has outlined a strategic plan to \n     confront 21st century challenges in the critical areas of \n     health, education, housing, criminal justice, and the \n     environment;\n       Whereas on July 16, 2009, the NAACP celebrated its \n     centennial anniversary in New York City, highlighting an \n     extraordinary century of ``Bold Dreams, Big Victories'' with \n     a historic address from the first African-American President \n     of the United States, Barack Obama;\n       Whereas as an advocate for sentencing reform, the NAACP \n     applauded the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 \n     (Public Law 111-220; 124 Stat. 2372), a landmark piece of \n     legislation that reduces the quantity of crack cocaine that \n     triggers a mandatory minimum sentence for a Federal \n     conviction of crack cocaine distribution from 100 times that \n     of people convicted of distributing the drug in powdered form \n     to 18 times that sentence: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 103rd anniversary of the historic \n     founding of the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People; and\n       (2) commends the National Association for the Advancement \n     of Colored People on the occasion of its anniversary for its \n     work to ensure the political, educational, social, and \n     economic equality of all people.\n\n                              S.

In conclusion, I note that S. Res. 520 recognizes the \n103rd anniversary of the founding of the NAACP, which for reasons I \nwill discuss later, is an interesting irony in today's debate coming \nfrom the Republican side.\n  I will now yield to Senator Bennet of Colorado, and he will be \nfollowed by Senator Hagan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I wish to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his \nleadership and my other colleagues who are out here tonight.\n  I wish to be clear again about what this bill is. First of all, it is \nvery clear it is constitutional. In the Supreme Court, eight of nine \nJustices have said that. As I listen to the debate tonight, I also \nthink people at home should know this is about a few actors in the \ncountry who have been allowed to spend wild amounts of money without \nsaying who they are. This doesn't prevent them from spending the money. \nIt simply says they need to say who they are.\n  My sense, having spent time with people who are often asked to \ncontribute to these campaigns, is that people who have the means to \nspend $10,000 on political activity, by and large, would actually like \nthis disclosure requirement. The reason they would like this disclosure \nrequirement is so they can say to people who are trying to list them \nand distorting our politics and having them pay for negative attack ads \nthey don't agree with and they don't think are true, could say no \nbecause they know they could say to the people: I am not going to sign \nup for that because I don't want to put my name on that.\n  There is an enforcement mechanism I think virtually everybody in \nAmerica would support and certainly at home would support. I would \nargue the only place in America that anybody would think that spending \nvast amounts of money by a small group of people without having to tell \nus who they are makes sense, and that is right here in Washington, DC. \nMaybe some people will benefit from making the ads or those who are \npaid to place the ads on television. But otherwise, it is hard to find \nanybody who would think this wasn't in their interest and certainly not \nin their children's interest.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Senator \nCoburn's column in the op-ed page of the New York Times where he lays \nout in a very succinct and compelling view some of the things that are \nwrong with this place.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Norquist's Phantom Army\n\n                            (By Tom Coburn)\n\n       When the antitax lobbyist Grover G. Norquist made a visit \n     to Capitol Hill recently, leading Democrats welcomed the \n     chance to build up their favorite boogeyman. Harry Reid, the \n     Senate majority leader, said Mr. Norquist has ``the entire \n     Republican party in the palm of his hand.'' A spokeswoman for \n     Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Mr. Norquist--\n     who is famous for getting lawmakers to pledge not to support \n     tax hikes or deficit reduction that is paired with revenue \n     increases--was coming to give the G.O.P. its ``marching \n     orders.''\n       But this story is utterly false. Senate Republicans--and \n     many House Republicans--have repeatedly rejected Mr. \n     Norquist's strict interpretation of his own pledge, a reading \n     that requires them to defend every loophole and spending \n     program hidden in the tax code. While most Republicans do, of \n     course, oppose tax increases, they are hardly the mindless \n     robots Democrats say they are.\n       What the narrative does, however, is let Democrats off the \n     hook. If they can make out Republicans as uncompromising \n     ideologues, they can continue refusing to offer detailed \n     plans to reform entitlement programs. That is the real \n     obstacle to a grand bargain on spending, not Mr. Norquist's \n     pledge.\n       Consider the evidence: I recently proposed amendments to \n     end tax earmarks for movie producers and the ethanol \n     industry. Mr. Norquist charged that those measures would be \n     tax hikes unless paired with dollar-for-dollar rate \n     reductions. And yet all but six of the 41 Senate Republicans \n     who had signed his pledge voted for my amendments.\n       Those 35 Republican pledge-violators are hardly soft on \n     taxes. Rather, they understand that the tax code is riddled \n     with special-interest provisions that are merely spending by \n     another name. If asked to eliminate earmarks for things like \n     Nascar, the tackle-box industry or Eskimo whaling captains--\n     all of which are actual tax ``breaks''--most of my colleagues \n     would be embarrassed to demand dollar-for-dollar rate \n     reductions, and rightly so.\n       As a result, rather than forcing Republicans to bow to him, \n     Mr. Norquist is the one who is increasingly isolated \n     politically. For instance, while his organization, Americans \n     for Tax Reform, was calling my ethanol amendment a tax hike, \n     the Club for Growth, which is far more influential among \n     conservative lawmakers, endorsed my amendment outright.\n       What's more, my colleagues have repeatedly rejected Mr. \n     Norquist's demand that Republicans walk away from any grand \n     bargain on the deficit that includes even a penny of new \n     revenue. Speaker of the House John A. Boehner, who calls Mr. \n     Norquist ``some random person,'' offered to trade revenue \n     increases for entitlement reform in talks with the White \n     House last summer. Republicans on the National Commission on \n     Fiscal Responsibility and Reform made a similar offer, as did \n     Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, during last \n     year's deficit supercommittee negotiations. My colleagues, by \n     and large, know that doing nothing to confront our fiscal \n     challenges would mean an automatic tax increase and a cut to \n     entitlement programs.\n       The problem with the pledge is that it is powerless to \n     prevent future automatic tax increases and has failed to \n     restrain past spending. The ``starve the beast'' strategy to \n     shrink the size of the federal government by cutting revenue \n     but not spending was a disaster. Every dollar we borrow is a \n     tax increase on the next generation.\n       And in a debt crisis, higher interest rates and the \n     debasement of our currency would be additional tax hikes. In \n     that sense, no one is doing more to violate the spirit of the \n     pledge than Mr. Norquist himself, who is asking Republicans \n     to reject the very type of agreement that could prevent \n     future tax increases.\n\n[[Page S5025]]\n\n       What unifies Republicans is not Mr. Norquist's tortured \n     definition of tax purity but the idea of a Reagan- or \n     Kennedy-style tax reform that lowers rates and broadens the \n     tax base by getting rid of loopholes and deductions. It's \n     true that Republicans would prefer to lower rates as much as \n     possible, and it's true that Republicans believe smart tax \n     reform will generate more, not less, revenue for the federal \n     government. But Republicans would not walk away from a grand \n     bargain on entitlements and tax reform that would devote a \n     penny of revenue to deficit reduction instead of rate \n     reduction.\n       Free-market conservatives have repeatedly given openings to \n     Democrats that they have chosen to ignore. The president, for \n     instance, knows that his calls to raise taxes on earnings \n     over $250,000, which follows his gimmicky Buffett Rule, is a \n     nonstarter unless paired with fundamental tax and entitlement \n     reform.\n       The majority of Democrats and Republicans understand the \n     severity of our economic challenges. They know they have to \n     put everything on the table and make hard choices. \n     Legislators who would rather foster political boogeymen only \n     delay those critical reforms.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. It also calls for the kind of principled leadership we \nare going to apply in order to solve the challenges we face with \nrespect to our debt and deficit to get this economy moving again. It \nincludes recoupling rising wages and job growth to our economic growth, \nenergy policy, educating our kids in the 21st century. It is all the \nthings people at home want us to be working on.\n  In a State such as mine that is one-third Republican, one-third \nDemocratic, and one-third Independent, there is not that much \ndifference in opinion about what the solutions ought to be.\n  The reason I support the DISCLOSE Act is that I think it is one \nimportant step. It is certainly not the only step, but it is one \nimportant step toward recoupling the conversation we are having in \nWashington and to recoupling the priorities that are in Washington. \nMaybe it is better to say it this way: to recouple the priorities the \npeople have at home to the work being done or not done in Washington, \nDC.\n  We should pass this bill and get on with the people's business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Colorado \nthat in an environment in which the bulk of the political spending is \nbeing done by outside groups and the bulk of the outside spending \ngroups is secret, what is the likelihood of those goals being \naccomplished with the best interests of the American people in mind and \nnot with the best interests of the special interests behind those \nsecret donations in mind?\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator for his question. I think it is going \nto be made much more difficult. There are plenty of people I know at \nhome who watch the stuff going on, on TV, and they don't recognize \nthemselves and the cartoon that is playing. Sometimes they don't \nrecognize their priorities playing out on the Senate floor. They don't \nrecognize the convictions they have or the aspirations they have for \nthe communities or the debate they are having. It is a natural reaction \nfor people to say: I don't want any part of that.\n  As Dick Durbin was saying, somehow this is a knife fight that has \nnothing to do with me, and I am not going to pay attention to it. The \nproblem is, as with any fight such as that, what we end up doing is \nducking and covering because that is what we have to do in order to \nstay out of the way. That isn't going to put us in the position of \nbeing able to deliver on the promise of generation after generation of \nAmericans to make sure the folks coming after us actually have more \nopportunity, not less, than we had.\n  Remember, this is a tiny proposal. This is simply requiring \ndisclosure. It is not even requiring a disclaimer. Frankly, if it were \nup to me, I would want people who funded these committees to have to \nstand up at the end of the ads to say: I am John Smith or I am Mary \nJones, and I paid for this ad. But this bill doesn't even do that. All \nit says is they have to say who they are. I think poll after poll shows \nthat 90 percent of Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, \nagree with that.\n  This is one issue where the sort of optical issues that happened \nsomehow on the beltway ought to not lead us to a place where we obscure \nthe vision of the American people, which on this issue is as clear as \ncan be. We have to get this done and get on to the rest of the business \nat hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I too echo the comments of the Senator \nfrom Colorado, and I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for bringing \nthis bill forward and for putting together what the American people \nexpect from people who donate to campaigns.\n  Today, I join my colleagues, as I did 2 years ago, to discuss the \nstate of campaign finance and reflect on what I think is a dark cloud \nthat has been cast over our Nation's election system.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United created a watershed \neffect in our elections process. The decision eviscerated decades of \ncampaign finance law that was in place for the purpose of making sure \nthe American people, not special interests, decided our elections. It \nwas 2 years ago that I expressed my deep concern that this ruling would \nweaken the voice of the American people in elections, and I am afraid \nmy fear and the fears of many others have come true.\n  Since the ruling, many political operatives have established \nnonprofit proposed social welfare organizations under 501(c)(4) of the \nTax Code. These groups utilize a loophole in the Tax Code to receive \nhuge, secret donations intended solely to influence political campaigns \nrather than promote the social welfare of our citizens.\n  In 2006, outside groups spent $69 million on political campaigns. \nOnly 1 percent, $690,000 in 2006, of that funding came from undisclosed \nsources.\n  By comparison, in 2010, the amount of outside group spending on \npolitical campaigns skyrocketed to $305 million, and the sources of 44 \npercent of that money were not disclosed. So in 4 years' time, the \namount of undisclosed dollars grew exponentially from 1 percent to \nalmost half of all outside political spending.\n  This year, outside group spending is projected to rise at an \nastounding rate, and we are certainly seeing it now. Of the $140 \nmillion raised by super PACs thus far, 82 percent has come from secret \ndonors. That is shocking, and we know it is growing.\n  In North Carolina, the story is no different. Last week, the \nCharlotte Observer reported that ``more than any congressional battle \nin the south . . . North Carolina's 8th District has become a magnet \nfor money.'' And that is outside money. In that same article, the \nnewspaper reported that only two other districts in the entire country \nhave seen more outside spending than the $1.6 million poured into the \neighth congressional district. The two candidates themselves have only \nspent $1 million through the end of June.\n  Let me point out that this level of spending is for a runoff primary \nelection in a mostly rural part of North Carolina. I cannot imagine \nwhat the general election race will look like.\n  The level of secret, anonymous money influencing our political \nelections is breathtaking. America's campaign finance process should \nand must be transparent. Of course, every American, including the \nwealthiest among us, has the right to have his or her voice heard, but \nthose spending huge amounts of money to influence elections should not \nhide their activities. Information on who is funding political advocacy \nshould be available to the public so voters can ultimately make fully \ninformed decisions.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would take a step in the right direction to ensure \naccountability in our system. The bill would institute comprehensive \ndisclosure requirements on corporations, on unions, and other \norganizations that spend money on Federal election campaigns. By \nincreasing the transparency of campaign spending by these groups, the \nDISCLOSE Act seeks to prevent unregulated and unchecked power over our \nelections by a handful of wealthy corporations and individuals.\n  Right now, the voices of ordinary Americans--of ordinary North \nCarolinians--are being drowned out by secret money. North Carolina \ndeserves better and our country deserves better. That is why I am \ncosponsoring the DISCLOSE Act. The voices of North Carolinians--not the \nvoices of a few wealthy companies and individuals--should determine the \noutcome of our elections.\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues here in the Senate to \nprotect the integrity of the elections process. We came very close last \ntime, with 59 votes. We were one vote away. I hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will join this effort to achieve a fair and \ntransparent elections process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, Senator Coons will be joining us very \nshortly. He was on the floor a moment ago and will be back very \nshortly. I wish to take a moment before he returns--here he is. I will \nnot take a moment before he returns.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Delaware. I await hearing from \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to join the chorus of voices \nfrom our caucus who have tonight spoken to the value, to the importance \nof transparency in elections. Transparency, as we all know, is critical \nfor free and fair elections and for democracy to function, because the \npeople of this country--the voters, the constituents, those whom we \nserve and those who hire and fire all who serve them at Federal and \nState and local offices--need to know who they represent, who is \nfunding their campaigns, what goals they will pursue in office, and \nwhether the ends serve their interests. Tonight, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows all too well, colleagues have joined to speak in support \nof the DISCLOSE Act--a bill that would make important progress toward \nclearing away the clouds that have been laid on the face of the \nAmerican body public because of the decision of Citizens United.\n  The integrity and the fairness of our elections is at the very heart \nof American democracy. It is in some ways the proudest legacy of our \nFounding Fathers and, in my view, a beacon to the rest of the world. A \ndifficult, a regular part of modern electioneering, of modern \ncampaigns, is campaign ads. In fact, many of us spend a huge amount of \nour time raising the money and delivering the content to connect with \nour constituents through television. I am blessed to represent a small \nState--roughly 800,000 souls--so we actually get to campaign door to \ndoor, to go door-knocking, to meet people in person in my State. But, \nstill, television ads play a very important part. In other larger \nStates, folks will often never even meet in person the candidates for \noffices in the House and in the Senate or for President, and television \nads there dominate the whole campaign election process. No one likes \ncampaign ads, but they are a part of our politics, and an effective \nand, sadly, a powerful part as well.\n  For most of our modern political history, voters at least knew who \nthe ads were coming from--the candidates and the parties that supported \nthem--and could make judgments accordingly. If someone thought an add \nwas too nasty, they could vote against the candidate who ran it. That \nis the whole point, forcing us as candidates to own our ads, to say, \n``I am Chris Coons and I approved this ad.'' We all know as candidates \nwho have stood before our electorate how it feels to put our personal \nname, our face, to an ad that might be hitting a little too hard, and \nthat pulls us back from sometimes overreaching.\n  But what we are here to talk about tonight is the whole new world \nthat has been unleashed by a Supreme Court decision. In my view, the \nbasic right of every American to free and fair elections has been \ncompromised by a new flood of tens of hundreds of millions of dollars \nfrom wealthy individuals, from corporations, from shadowy national \nspecial interest groups, since the Supreme Court, through Citizens \nUnited, opened these floodgates to unlimited secret campaign \nactivities, threatening to overwhelm the fundamental trust of our \nconstituents and the transparency so essential to our democracy.\n  As a lawyer, Citizens United was one of the most surprising Supreme \nCourt decisions of my life, because it radically upended settled \nconstitutional understanding as well as bipartisan agreement that had \nbeen reached here in the Senate regarding appropriate limitations on \ncorporate speech. When the McCain-Feingold law passed in 2002, 6 years \nprior, it showed a strong bipartisan intent to rein in corporate \nspending, to rein in and manage spending by interests of all kinds in \npolitics. That is why I was shocked when, in the opinion in Citizens \nUnited, it was joined by the so-called ``originalist'' or ``strict \nconstructionist'' members of the Court. The originalist mode of \ninterpretation of the Constitution attacks every question by asking a \ncommon question: Would the Framers have thought the action or law being \nchallenged before the Supreme Court is constitutional?\n  That is why, if one had asked me in 2008, looking at Citizens United \nand at the issues presented to the Court, whether an originalist \ninterpreting the first amendment would have found the corporate \nelectioneering regulations this body had adopted in McCain-Feingold to \nbe valid, it seems to me there was only one possible answer, and that \nwas yes.\n  Our Founding Fathers recognized corporations are creatures not \nendowed, as the rest of us are, with inalienable rights. They are, \nrather, fictional, legal creatures--creatures of legislative grace. \nWere this not the case, the corporation by the name of Citizens \nUnited--the corporation that was at issue in this decision--wouldn't \nhave stopped at simply making a movie attacking Hillary Clinton, but \nwould have actually cast a vote against Hillary Clinton. Of course, it \ncouldn't. Corporations don't have bad hair days; corporations don't \nhave tasteless ties; corporations don't have moods and opinions. \nCorporations are not people. They exist as people only in legal \nfiction.\n  I would note the first amendment states: ``Congress shall make no law \n. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.'' If freedom of \nspeech included fictional entities, nonhuman entities such as \ncorporations, there would have been no reason to separately affirm that \nthe press also enjoyed that freedom granted to real, living, breathing \nindividuals. In my view, then, Citizens United was wrongly decided.\n  As shown through a long line of legislative and judicial \ninterpretation, a view of corporations as having first amendment rights \nthat are limited, and can and should be limited more than can be \nlimited for real, living, breathing individuals, has remained the \ndominant one throughout our modern history.\n  In 1907, the Tillman Act prohibited campaign contributions by \ncorporations. In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited expenditures and \nthe application of this law further. It was upheld by the Court in 1957 \nin U.S. v. Automobile Workers. When the Supreme Court first made the \nleap from the expenditure/contribution distinction in Buckley v. Valeo \nin 1971, even then it left intact the longstanding distinction between \nthe first amendment rights of living, breathing individuals and \ncorporations--legal fictional entities.\n  In the 1982 case of FEC v. National Right to Work Committee, Justice \nRehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court that it was proper to treat \ncorporations more restrictively than people. Oh, how I wish that were \nthe majority opinion of the Court today.\n  The further analysis in 1986 in FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for \nLife, though striking down restrictions on speech by a pro-life \norganization, actually underscored the original understanding that when \nthe Constitution protects corporate speech, it only does so as a proxy \nfor the underlying free speech rights of real, living, breathing \nindividuals. In that case, a nonprofit organized and funded \nspecifically for the purpose of bringing about a political goal--pro-\nlife policies--was seen as having free speech rights only because of \nthe rights of those individuals who funded it and organized it. When we \ntalk about a corporation's first amendment rights, then, we should be \nusing shorthand for the first amendment rights of those who are its \nshareholders or who own it or who control it.\n  The corporate/individual distinction was even again affirmed as \nrecently as 1990 in the Austin case.\n  The constitutional history of limitations on corporate speech was so \nclear that the Supreme Court had upheld the McCain-Feingold Act in \n2003, just 6 years before they struck it down. What possibly could have \nchanged in those intervening years that would be so convincing to an \noriginalist mindset? I don't know. In my view, this decision did not \nmake sense. But I do know that\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\ncampaign finance, which was a bipartisan issue in this Chamber in 2003, \nwhere Senator Feingold and Senator McCain, a Democrat and a Republican, \nled a strong bipartisan coalition to rein in the negative influence of \nspecial interest money--that has changed. That has shifted to today, \nsadly, a starkly partisan issue.\n  As we have seen today, Senator after Senator of the other party has \nrisen to speak about lots of issues, but none has addressed head-on why \ndisclosure is no longer in the best interests of our citizens, why \ntransparency is no longer essential to democracy. Yet Democrat after \nDemocrat, Senator after Senator from my side of the aisle, has risen to \nstand firmly with those organized by Senator Whitehouse who has led so \nably this discourse on the floor today, who view the DISCLOSE Act not \nas curing the errors of Citizens United but as striking one important \nblow, to ripping the cover off the millions of dollars in secret \ncontributions that today I think threaten to swamp our electoral ship.\n  If the Citizens United case has tilted elections toward those with \nthe money to buy them, the DISCLOSE Act is to me an opportunity to \nlevel the playing field a little bit. Instead of with money, it arms \nvoters with information.\n  The DISCLOSE Act does just what its name suggests: It requires \ndisclosure. It requires any covered organization, including unions, \ncorporations, and super PACs, which spends $10,000 or more on certain \ncampaign activities to promptly file a report with the FEC--to file a \nreport with the Federal Election Commission--within 24 hours. This \nbrings some measure of fairness and transparency back to our elections \nso voters can make informed decisions instead of simply being pushed \nand prodded and ultimately duped by a flood of negative ads.\n  I am confident it does not restrict or limit free speech of any kind. \nThis bill simply allows voters--those who are in the driver's seat or \nshould be in our system, those who hire and fire us--to see who is \nspending money to influence their decision at the ballot box.\n  The DISCLOSE Act imposes the minimum possible burden on organizations \nspending vast amounts of money on elections, while still requiring the \nkind of prompt and timely disclosure voters deserve and expect in this \nelectronic, in this digital age, where the ads that flood the airwaves, \nthat push for a decision, happen so close to an election that it is \nimportant to have disclosure real time.\n  We voted on the DISCLOSE Act earlier tonight, but my colleagues \nacross the aisle lined up in lockstep against it. Sadly, every Member \nof the other party voted against it. What is so wrong with voters \nhaving information about who is trying to influence their vote? Why is \nthis basic information so important to hide from the American people? \nPublic disclosure of campaign contributions and spending should be \nexpedited, should be swift, should be available so voters can judge for \nthemselves what is appropriate.\n  I could not agree more. I agreed when the esteemed Republican leader \nsaid those exact words in 1997, and I agree with them today. \n``Disclosure'' he said, ``is the best disinfectant.''\n  Earlier today I had the honor of presiding, as you do now, Mr. \nPresident, and I got to listen to the Republican minority leader speak \nagainst disclosure. There are many other issues to which we can and \nshould turn. There are many other important issues before our country, \nand he raised them all in turn. But the thing I had the hardest time \nwith was his leading the other caucus, one after the other, to speak \nagainst, to vote against disclosure--something he himself, the \nRepublican leader, spoke so forcefully in favor of as recently as 1997: \n``Disclosure is the best disinfectant.'' Back then, the talking points \nfor the other caucus were: Spend all you want. There should be no \nlimits on campaign contributions as long as there is disclosure. \nDisclosure will keep things open and fair.\n  Sadly, today, even that small measure of rationality has been openly \nabandoned. Voters in my home State do not want secret spending clouding \nthe legitimacy of our elections. They want to exercise this most basic \nAmerican right out in the sunshine--with knowledge, with information \nabout who backs whom--just as, I believe, our Founders intended.\n  Let's face it, folks. These super PACs are not raising hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to run campaign ads that are updates on the latest \nsports scores, that are filled with YouTube videos of sneezing pandas \nor yawning kittens. These super PACs are gearing up to run the most \nnegative possible campaign ads--the sorts of ads that can change hearts \nand minds because they have no accountability, because they have no \none's name at the bottom line, because they feel free and are free to \nmake the nastiest and most unfounded personal attacks.\n  Four years ago, at this point in the campaign cycle, just 9 percent--\n9 percent--of the political ads on TV were negative, according to the \nWesleyan Media Project, which has scored ads by their negativity or \npositivity. Just 9 percent.\n  What do you think that number is this year? At this stage, this still \nearly stage in campaigning, 70 percent. Seventy percent of the ads have \nbeen negative, and it is only July. It is not even August.\n  At the same point in 2008, 3 percent for the ads came from outside \ngroups like super PACs. This year, 60 percent have been paid by outside \ngroups. Campaigns themselves have inevitably, as a result, taken on a \nmore negative tone, a more caustic aspect. There is no doubt in my mind \nthat the primary mission of most super PACs is to fund the sorts of ads \nthat destroy candidates and campaigns, that tear them down, that \ncontribute to the steady pollution and degradation of our political \ndiscourse. They are raising money to buy television ads that assault \nthe fame and destroy the candidates they do not like.\n  This same study from the Wesleyan Media Project bears that out. It \nfound that 86 percent of the ads the super PACs and interest groups \nhave run during this cycle have been negative. Is there any wonder then \nthat our campaigns, our politics, our culture has become more steadily \ndivisive and on this floor more consistently divided?\n  There are no centrist super PACs. There are no (c)(4)s that are \ndetermined to fund a message about bringing America together. These \nsuper PACs are designed to divide us, and they are doing a great job.\n  At the end of the day, one of the questions we have to have for the \ncitizens of America is, what does this mean for you? What does it mean \nto have tens or hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into negative \nads, driving the outcome of elections at the State and Federal level \nthat simply divide us? It means more partisanship. It means more \nrancor. It means less progress. It means fewer problems solved.\n  If the intentions of these super PACs, of these special (c)(4)s, were \nso positive, then why would they need to hide whom they were \nsupporting? Why would they need to conceal the purposes of the ads they \nsupport?\n  Let me, if I might for a few moments, respond to some things I heard \nearlier today from Republicans while I was presiding and while I was \nwatching in my office.\n  One of my Republican colleagues earlier today claimed the DISCLOSE \nAct does not apply to labor unions and suggested that this was a big \nwet kiss to organized labor from my side of the aisle. This suggestion \nwas made by several in leadership. It is a ludicrous claim. Every \nprovision in the DISCLOSE Act applies equally to covered organizations, \ncorporations, business associations, membership organizations, and \nunions.\n  Why have a $10,000 threshold? To reduce the burden on all membership \norganizations of all kinds; the $10,000 threshold is enough to cover 93 \npercent of the money raised by these super PACs and thus does not \nneedlessly burden national membership organizations, with thousands of \nmembers who contribute $25 or $50 or $100.\n  It is these handful of folks, who are contributing huge amounts of \nmoney, whose contributions we hope to expose to the sunshine, to make \npositive contributions to allowing voters to know who is contributing \nto whom and why.\n  One other thought I want to add to tonight's debate is, as the Africa \nSubcommittee chair on the Foreign Relations Committee, I often have the \nopportunity to hear from and meet with legislators and heads of state \nfrom Africa who come to meet with us here in\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nWashington. They come to the United States to listen to us and to hear \nfrom us how our democracy functions, because for much of the world we \nare considered the gold standard of how to run free, fair, and open \nelections, of how to deliberate as an open and positive body, of how to \nbe accountable to and serve the people of the United States.\n  We already have some challenges making progress, listening to each \nother, and getting past the partisan divide. But if we already have \nchallenges, if the folks listening wonder whether the Senate of the \nUnited States listens to our citizens enough, just wait until another \nbillion dollars of secretive special interest money pours into our \ncampaigns.\n  In my view, one of the things we can hold up to the rest of the world \nis that we have clean, fair elections. This decision by this Supreme \nCourt, in Citizens United, threatens that at its very core. This flood \nof money suggests that what is our greatest accomplishment in many ways \nas a nation is at very real risk. We cannot, in my view, lose the moral \nhigh ground of being a country that has fought so hard for so long to \nbe a place where every person--every real person--has an equal vote and \nan equal right to be heard.\n  The unfortunate reality is we are not going to be able to amend the \nConstitution to repeal the Citizens United decision this year. I wish \nwe could. But it is not going to happen on that timeline. As we saw \nearlier today, this Senate is apparently not even willing to require \nthe slightest bit of transparency and accountability by passing the \nDISCLOSE Act, as we should. Maybe we will get the votes tomorrow. Maybe \nafter listening to this tonight, after hearing from us, our \nconstituents will be moved to contact other Members of this body.\n  But I am concerned. I am concerned that the Congress is not going to \nbe able to stem the massive influx of cash into our elections this year \nor this cycle. It may, in fact, be too late for that. There is a reason \ncampaigns and super PACs fund these negative ads. They work. They are \ndesigned to go around your head and target your heart. They move you to \nvote on what you are afraid of, not what you aspire to. And they can be \nso highly effective.\n  I do not like negative ads. The Presiding Officer does not like \nnegative ads. Our citizens and our constituents do not like negative \nads. We still have a choice, though. We may not yet be able to amend \nthe Constitution. We may not be able to persuade the other side to pass \nthe DISCLOSE Act this time. But we can allow ourselves instead to say, \nwe will not listen to these craven, destructive ads. We can change the \nchannel. We can ignore the ads. We can learn about candidates and their \nrecords. We can vote from a place of power instead of fear. Each and \nevery one of us, each and every citizen, can be more powerful than the \nSupreme Court, can be more powerful than the billionaires and \ncorporations who are trying to sway our votes by deciding to be better \nwith our politics, by deciding to listen past the smear campaigns and \nthe negative attacks.\n  It is my hope we will be able someday to pass the DISCLOSE Act and to \namend the Constitution. But until then, I am left with this: With the \nencouragement of my colleagues, with confidence in our citizens, and \nwith optimism that somehow through this smear campaign of super PAC ads \nthe truth of the American system will still be shown to the world.\n  Thank you. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Coons for his \nremarks, echo one point he made, and make an announcement.\n  The point I wish to echo is that the importance of American democracy \nand of clean American elections does, indeed, extend beyond our \nborders, as Senator Coons mentioned from his role as the chair of the \nSubcommittee on Africa in the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I grew up in the Foreign Service and served on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I have traveled pretty widely in that role. There is a \nreason Presidents have talked about our Nation as a city on the hill. \nThere is a reason Presidents have described our Nation as a lamp raised \nin the darkness, that the glow from what we accomplish lights the \nworld. There is a reason the hymn ``America The Beautiful'' talks about \nhow our ``alabaster cities gleam.'' There is not much gleam on those \nalabaster cities tonight, not after this vote. There is a lot of mud on \nthe walls of those cities, and it is going to get worse unless we pass \nthis vote.\n  And people get it, which brings me to my announcement, which is that \nup to this evening, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee has had \n34,269 Americans sign its petition supporting the DISCLOSE Act. Demand \nProgress has had over 50,000 Americans sign up for its petition \nsupporting the DISCLOSE Act. CREDO Action, as I mentioned earlier, has \nhad 213,000 Americans--213,000 Americans--sign up as citizen cosponsors \nof the DISCLOSE Act. This stack of papers I have in the Chamber has 57 \nnames to a page--213,000 Americans who really put their name down \nthere, something that, evidently, the big, sneaky donors are not \nwilling to do and our colleagues are not willing to force them to do.\n  And DISCLOSEAct.com has 320,378 signatures supporting the DISCLOSE \nAct. That Web site got so much activity earlier tonight, as we rolled \ninto this vote, that the Web site crashed from the activity of \nAmericans trying to be a part of the debate we are having here, trying \nto make their voices heard because they perfectly well understand that \nthese big special interests--the ones that do not want how and why they \nspend their money in politics to be known to anybody--they do not have \nAmericans' best interests at heart, and they see this coming, and they \nwant to fight back.\n  That total is 617,000 Americans who have signed up to have our backs \nand to support this bill.\n  So as we go forward into the remarks from Senator Pryor, Senator \nBlumenthal, and then Senator Franken, we should know that it is not \njust the one, two, three, four, five, six of us who are now in this \nChamber. For each one of us, there are 100,000 Americans who are behind \nus and want this to happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for \nhis great leadership not just on this issue but many issues. But this \nis certainly a very important issue.\n  I rise today to the lend my voice to support campaign finance reform \nand specifically the DISCLOSE Act. I want to come back to the phrase \n``lend my voice'' in just a minute. The DISCLOSE Act--a lot of times, \npeople back home hear about these bills that are 500 pages long or \n2,000 pages long. This one is barely 20 pages long. It is really about \n19 pages and 4 lines long. This is a short bill, very concise, very to \nthe point. I am for it.\n  I am for even broader campaign finance reform, and let me give you \none example of why I support campaign finance reform. There has been \ntoo much money in Federal politics for a long time. This did not just \nstart last year or even 5 years ago, this has been building over a long \nperiod of time.\n  When I ran for attorney general in my State in 1998, I raised and \nspent somewhere around $800,000. That may not sound like a lot of \nmoney, and certainly in a Federal race it is not a lot of money, but \nthat got the job done. I had a Republican opponent. We fought it out. \nShe was a very worthy opponent. We had debates, and we sort of \nbarnstormed around the State. It was wonderful.\n  In 2002, 4 years later, I decided to run for the Senate. That year I \nhad to raise somewhere in the neighborhood--I do not have the figures \nin front of me but a little bit over $4 million. So same State, \nbasically the same population, same voters; nothing had really changed \nexcept I went from a State race, statewide race, for which I raised and \nspent for the campaign about $800,000, to about five times that amount \nin 2002. That was before there were super PACs. That was before money \nreally took over, the way you see in 2012. And money really has taken \nover the system. It is not good. It is not good at all.\n  I am for the DISCLOSE Act, but I also think we should do larger \ncampaign finance reform based on transparency. Actually, I am \nsupportive of lower giving amounts instead of higher giving amounts.\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\n  I support something we used to do in Arkansas. I have not looked at \nthe State law in a while. I assume it is the same, where PACs have to \nplay by the same rules everybody else does. They are subject to the \nsame limits. I think that takes away a lot of the funny business that \ngoes on with PACs.\n  I think that when we do campaign finance reform, we have to reform \nmore than just the campaigns themselves because right now the campaigns \nare very regulated. There is a lot of transparency. There is a lot of \ndisclosure. There are a lot of limits and requirements on campaigns. If \nit is Mark Pryor for U.S. Senate or whoever it may be, there are lots \nof rules that govern that. That is the way it should be. The problem is \noutside the campaign, the extracurricular activities. That is where the \nreal challenge is.\n  That takes us to Citizens United. I must say, with all due respect, \nthat I think it is naive to hold that money does not have a corrosive \neffect on politics. It does. We have seen it for two centuries in this \ncountry. We have seen that money has a corrosive effect on politics. \nThere have been various reform movements that have been designed to \ncurb that corrosive effect, but unfortunately the Citizens United case \njust kicked the door open wide, as wide as it has ever been kicked in \nAmerican history.\n  I do not want to criticize the Supreme Court, but I certainly hope \nthat after the 2012 elections they will have an opportunity to revisit \nthat decision. I hope they are looking at the press reports where these \nsuper PACs and other groups are saying they are going to raise and \nspend hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, one tabulation I saw is \nthat just against President Obama's reelection campaign--just to make \nsure he does not get reelected--there is well over $1 billion they \nclaim they are going to raise and spend to defeat this President. That \nskews the whole political system in this country. It is not healthy. It \nis not good.\n  I see these pages here who are with us today. They are learning about \nour democracy. I am so proud of them for being here and being here late \nnight, both on the Democratic and Republican side. I am so glad they \nhave this opportunity. I hope it is the opportunity of a lifetime for \nthem. But I do not want the lesson to be that money owns politics, \nbecause that is kind of where we are today. We are going to find out in \n2012 how much of an impact it has.\n  Let's go to the first amendment. Again, I do not want to get too \ndeeply into the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United because I \nhope they revisit it. But we as citizens have rights that are protected \nby the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution calls us persons. They call \nus people. Unfortunately, in this recent decision, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has basically said that corporations are people and persons and \nare given that same right. I disagree with that. Corporations cannot \nvote; they cannot be drafted into the military; they do not have a \nreligion to be protected. There is a lot of difference in corporations. \nThere has always been this legal understanding that a corporation can \nbe a person for certain purposes--everybody agrees with that; we \nunderstand why--but not for all purposes and not for political \npurposes.\n  One of the truths that we hold self-evident in our system of \ngovernment is that our rights are inalienable. They do not come from \nthe State. Our rights come from some higher authority than just the \nConstitution or just the U.S. Government or just the Congress. Our \nrights are inalienable. Well, corporations are created by people. They \ndo not have inalienable rights. It is ridiculous to think they do.\n  Again, I hope the Supreme Court will take an opportunity, based on \nwhat they saw in 2012, to revisit that decision.\n  Let me talk about the current state of affairs. I know I have \ncolleagues waiting. I want to wrap this up as quickly as I can. The \ncurrent state of affairs is that we have unlimited money coming into \nthe political system and secret money coming into the political system. \nThat is a bad combination. That is not good for the public's welfare. \nIt is not good for the average voter and the average citizen.\n  Again, we have a first amendment right to free speech. There is no \ndoubt about that. And we should. And we should zealously and jealously \nprotect that. But in the political situation we have today, if I have a \nperson in Arkansas who wants to give $100 for a campaign--say, a local \ncongressional campaign, he wants to give $100--well, somebody else can \ncome along--it may be an individual, it may be a corporation; we do not \nknow who it is--and they can give $1 million or they can give more. It \ncan be unlimited, but I want to use round figures here so we can talk \nabout this in a concise way. So $100 from the voter in the State who is \nactually voting in that election and $1 million from who knows where. \nWell, I would say this. I talked about it earlier. I want to lend my \nvoice to this. I want that voter to have a voice. I do not want that \noutside or that secret money or whomever is offering that to have a \nvoice that is 10,000 times louder than that person in Arkansas. It \nwould be like right here. If I were here speaking today and talking \nabout being for the DISCLOSE Act and I turned around and there were \n10,000 other people crammed in this Chamber talking about the same act \nbut talking against the act, whose voice is going to be heard by the \npublic? It is not going to be mine. That is the problem with the \ncurrent state of affairs.\n  So let's say a television spot--I will just pick a number--costs \n$500. That is the cheap spot. That is a laughably cheap spot in a lot \nof markets, but let's say it is a small market and it is not in prime \ntime. Let's say it is $500. I will just pick that figure. So if that \nperson gave $100, they bought one-fifth of a TV ad--one-fifth. That is \nabout a 6-second TV ad. If that corporation or outside person--whomever \nit is--gave $1 million, they have bought 2,000 TV ads--2,000 compared \nto 6 seconds. No comparison at all. It is unfair. It grounds out and \ndilutes our first amendment right that is protected in the \nConstitution.\n  This is the last point I wish to make on this unlimited money, and \nthen I would like to make my final point in just a second. On the \nunlimited money, you need to ask yourself: Why are they doing this? Why \nare they giving this money? Is it out of the goodness of their hearts?\n  No, that is not it. That is not it. Elections have consequences. They \nwant to influence the election because they want the consequence to be \nthat they have influence, they have power, they have control. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  We talk about it in terms of 30-second ads and negative ads. What \nthis is about ultimately is who makes decisions in this country. Is it \nthe general public? Is it elected officials who are here because \nsometimes they go through bruising campaigns to get here, but they are \nhere and they are trying to put the public interest first or are those \ndecisions going to be made by people whose elections were bought lock, \nstock, and barrel with unlimited and secret money? That is what is at \nstake today. That is what is at stake tonight. That is why I am for the \nDISCLOSE Act. I do not think it goes far enough. But I do want to \nfinish on that last point.\n  The DISCLOSE Act is about transparency. That is a major step in the \nright direction. I do not think it is the whole ball game; it is a \nmajor step in the right direction. I think this is a good piece of \nlegislation.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who are here tonight and who are talking \nabout this and bringing awareness to the American public about this \nbecause I think it is important. And I think this is something we do \nhave to get right, and we need this reform. This is a great place to \nstart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for his leadership on this and so many other issues. I thank the \nSenator from Arkansas for his comments. I recommend them to anyone.\n  Minnesotans are proud of our participation in civic life. We believe \nvery strongly in hearing each other out. In the last Presidential \nelection, 78 percent of eligible voters in my State turned out to \nvote--well above the national turnout of 64 percent of voting-age \ncitizens in 2008. In fact, Minnesota has led the Nation for voter \nturnout in the last six elections. This is really remarkable. It is one \nof the reasons I am\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nso proud to represent my State here in the Senate. But when the Supreme \nCourt upended 100 years of law with Citizens United, it yanked the \nmicrophone away from average Minnesotans and turned it over to a \nhandful of millionaires and billionaires and corporations intent, as \nSenator Pryor said, on controlling the outcome of our election and \ncontrolling the decisions that are made that affect the men, women, and \nchildren in my State.\n  A single person writing a check for $1 million or $10 million or $100 \nmillion can drown out the voices of everyone else, and they can do so \nin total secrecy. We have heard about a handful of millionaires and \nbillionaires who have written fat checks to bankroll Presidential \ncandidates, but what is most terrifying about this is that we only know \nabout those people because they decided to let us know. For every \nbillionaire who tells us he is writing a check to a candidate, there \nare probably 10 or 100 or 1,000 corporations and ultrawealthy \nindividuals who are writing similar checks in secret. Even one of the \nones we know about because he decided to let us know now says he is \nalso going to give secretly.\n  I was listening to C-SPAN radio in my car. That is right, I listen to \nC-SPAN in my car. They had a woman on who was a journalist. Her beat is \nmoney and politics. She writes for a major American daily paper. C-SPAN \nwas talking calls, and one caller basically said all of this is about \nprivatizing Social Security and Medicare so Wall Street folks can get \ntheir hands on the money from those programs and so insurance programs \nget their hands on Medicare money. You know there is truth to that. So \nthe expert says in the answer--and I am paraphrasing--that is what we \nthought. Most people thought it was going to be corporations giving us \nmoney, but it turns out it is just ultrawealthy people who are doing \nit. Then she paused and said: Of course, we don't know that because so \nmuch of the money is secret.\n  I thought to myself, here is a woman whose whole area of expertise--\nthis is what she thinks about 10, 12 hours a day--money and politics--\nand yet, even she, because this money is secret--even she is capable of \nbeing confused or not understanding the implications of all this secret \nmoney--even if it was just for her for a moment or a couple of moments.\n  That is the purpose of why we are up here tonight to talk about the \nproliferation of secret money post-Citizens United and its implications \non our democracy. Americans may not like it--I sure don't--but the \nSupreme Court has ruled. At least for now Citizens United is here to \nstay. The Supreme Court isn't final because it is right; it is right \nbecause it is final. So we need to accept that. Absent a constitutional \namendment, Congress can no longer limit corporate contributions or \ncampaign contributions to outside or independent groups--so-called \nindependent groups. As much as we may want to, we can't stop \ncorporations and ultrawealthy individuals from flooding our elections \nwith massive amounts of money. We can't stop it. But the Supreme Court \nsaid we can shine light on the shadowy interests behind those \nunprecedented contributions. We can force these organizations and \nultrawealthy individuals to disclose.\n  Justice Anthony Kennedy said this in his majority opinion in Citizens \nUnited:\n\n       Prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders \n     and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations \n     and elected officials accountable for their positions and \n     supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their \n     corporation's political speech advances the corporation's \n     interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether \n     elected officials are in the pocket of so-called moneyed \n     interests.\n\n  Justice Kennedy went on to say:\n\n       The First Amendment protects political speech, and \n     disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the \n     speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This \n     transparency enables the electorate to make informed \n     decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and \n     messages.\n\n  I could not have said it better myself. This is in his majority \nopinion of Citizens United. My colleagues and I have simply taken \nJustice Kennedy's words to heart, and we have drafted a bill that will \nbring transparency and accountability to the electorate so they can \nmake the decisions about who should lead our country. That is critical \nbecause elections matter.\n  Elections determine who is going to get to Washington, who is going \nto get here to make decisions on behalf of the rest of the Nation. \nAmericans need to know who is spending tons of money to get candidates \nelected.\n  That is why we are here today to talk about the DISCLOSURE Act. This \nbill is not a panacea. It will not overturn Citizens United, and it \nwill not stop the tsunami of money pouring in from corporations. But it \nwill require that all that special interest money be disclosed \npublicly, and that will have tremendously beneficial effects for this \ncountry.\n  We may not be able to stop the tidal wave of unlimited cash, but we \ncan, and we should, at a minimum know who is writing those big checks. \nNot only will this type of disclosure discourage backroom deals \nconducted under a cloak of secrecy but, more importantly, it will \ndiscourage donors from unleashing negative, misleading, and deceptive \nads against politicians who are trying to do the right thing.\n  But that is not our world today. Companies don't want us to know they \nare giving lots of money to elect or defeat someone. So they do \nsomething that looks a lot like money laundering, but it is legal.\n  They might create and give money to a shell corporation, which in \nturn donates to a super PAC. When we look at the records for the super \nPAC, we will see the shell corporation but not the original source of \nthe money.\n  A company might give money to one shell corporation, which in turn \ngives money to a PAC or another shell corporation, and so on, until it \nfinally reaches the ultimate super PAC. It is nearly impossible to \ntrace it back to the original corporation. That is in the super PACs.\n  The company can just give money to a 501(c)(4)--a so-called social \nwelfare organization--which is under no obligation to disclose a single \nthing. Of course, there are rules in place to make sure these \nnonprofits are truly social welfare organizations and deserving of \ntheir privileged tax-exempt status. Specifically, they must spend less \nthan 50 percent of their money on political activities. Unfortunately, \nthe IRS has not been aggressively enforcing this rule. We suspect that \nmany of these 504(c)(4)s are not spending more than 50 percent on \nnonpolitical ads.\n  But no matter how companies or wealthy individuals secretly funnel \ntheir money into elections, we all lose. We lose because we don't know \nwho is paying for the negative attack ads that are constantly \ndominating our TV or the newspaper ads or the Web ads online or the \nrobocalls that interrupt dinner or the misleading mailers or the field \noperatives who knock on our door or call us on Saturday mornings.\n  Minnesotans believe strongly in hearing each other out, and they want \nhonest, informed debate. They want to hear all sides of an issue before \nthey make up their minds. This is why we have such a high voter turnout \nin our State. They want to listen to the competing priorities for our \nState and our Nation because these issues are not simple. They want to \nhear all sides before deciding who to vote for at the polls.\n  Unfortunately, Minnesotans cannot listen to all sides when worthwhile \ndebate is being drowned out by a tsunami of corrosive, negative, and \noften deceptive ads paid for by outside special interest groups. These \ndays, especially if one is in a swing State, people can't turn on a \ntelevision without seeing them.\n  But it is not just volume that drowns out legitimate debate and turns \noff voters; it is what the ads are saying. More and more are negative, \ndeceptive or both. According to the Annenberg Public Policy Center--\nlisten to this--85 percent of the dollars spent on Presidential ads by \nthe four top-spending 501(c)(4)s--or so-called social welfare \norganizations--were spent on ads containing at least one deceptive \nclaim--deceptive. No wonder people are disenchanted with our political \nsystem.\n  Anonymity fuels this. It is easy to pay for ads that deceive voters \nwhen they don't have to attach their name to them, and so they have no \naccountability. It is easy to launch personal attacks when they are \ndoing so in secret--under the cloak of anonymity. It is these so-called \nsocial welfare groups that are responsible for so many of\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\nthese deceptive ads that have absolutely no requirements to disclose \ntheir donors.\n  The public doesn't know when they watch political ads whether they \nare true or deceptive. That is a problem because there is no question \nthat advertising works. People watch TV. They love TV. I love TV. I \nmade a living in TV. When we watch TV, there are commercials, and \ncommercials work. Do you know the show ``Mad Men''? It is popular and \nit is about advertising in the early 1960s and it is about how \nadvertising works. They discovered this a long time ago, and it is \ntrue; it works. Advertising helps influence what we buy, what we eat, \nwhat we drink, where we shop and, yes, which politician we will support \nwhen we go to the polls.\n  Most Americans don't watch or listen to C-SPAN in their spare time. \nMost Americans aren't engrossed in politics, keeping track of every \nvote we take in Congress. That is why political ads can make or break \nhow Americans feel about a candidate come election day.\n  The Supreme Court recognized this in Citizens United when it noted it \nhad previously upheld disclosure laws in order to address the problem \nof purportedly independent groups running election-related ads while \n``hiding behind dubious and misleading names.''\n  It is these generic and sometimes misleading names for outside \ngroups--with nice words such as ``America'' ``freedom'' or \n``prosperity'' in their titles--that are manipulating the public now. \nIn the 2010 election, these outside groups spent more than $280 million \non campaign ads, which was more than double what they spent in 2008 and \nmore than five times what they spent in 2006. Even more shocking, there \nare estimates that outside groups will spend more than $1 billion on \nindependent expenditures this election cycle.\n  The public has every right to know who is bankrolling these ads, so \nit can better understand what motivates these messages and take what \nthey say in some context and with a grain of salt.\n  As important, what we are not seeing, what has been drowned out by \nall these negative deceptive ads is debate and discussion about the \nissues most Americans care about: How am I going to pay my mortgage? \nHow am I going to put my kids through college? How am I going to find a \njob in this difficult economy? Will I be able to retire and enjoy my \ngolden years?\n  Why is this happening? Why aren't ads focused on these issues? The \nanswer is quite simple. Ads that dominate the airwaves are expensive, \nand they are being bought by corporations and ultrawealthy individuals \nfor their own interests.\n  Corporations aren't evil--far from it. There are many great \ncorporations in Minnesota. But it is their duty to maximize shareholder \nprofit. Their focus is on cutting costs or consolidating their position \nin a market or on reducing the number of regulations they need to \ncomply with to keep their workers safe, in some cases, or maybe to keep \nour air and water clean. Their first priority isn't helping the middle \nclass, and they are not going to spend money from their general \ntreasuries on ads urging candidates to keep college affordable or push \nfor funding for Pell grants, Head Start or for medical research.\n  But the bigger issue--and the reason why disclosure matters so much \nin our political system--is that corporations don't just buy ads to \nmake their views known; they use them as a weapon against politicians. \nThis is a real problem. It is happening today, and it is only going to \nget worse and worse now that corporations can spend what they want, as \nmuch as they want, whenever they want, with absolutely no transparency.\n  Candidates know if they do not support the policies that corporations \nare pushing, they are likely to face a torrent of negative ads funded \nby that corporation or industry when they are running for election or \nreelection. All those ads will come from a shell organization with a \nname such as the American Prosperity Fund for America's Prosperity in \nthe Future in America. The public will not know that a corporation or \nwealthy individual is buying these ads, but the candidate will, and the \ncandidate will be powerless to stop it.\n  This is why I think the Supreme Court got it wrong in Citizens \nUnited--and this is a quote from the Supreme Court--when it found \n``independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do \nnot give rise to the corruption or the appearance of corruption.''\n  Wow. That is what the Court said. They made that statement without \nany citation to legal authority, without any citation to evidence. This \nstatement was plucked from thin air. It doesn't pass the smell test. \nAny Minnesotan knows intuitively that is just flat-out wrong.\n  The reality is, unfortunately, money does equal power in this \ncountry. Elections cost money--a lot of money. With each election cycle \nit is costing more and more. When a corporation or wealthy individual \ncan spend a truckload of cash to support its favorite politician and \nkick out a courageous politician who may have hurt its bottom line, our \nentire democratic system is undermined. If this continues, we risk \nbecoming an oligarchy, which would undermine our already undermined \nmiddle class and would quash the working poor's aspirations for \nentering the middle class. It would be harder to get a wage that could \nput a roof over your head, harder to afford child care, and harder to \nsend a kid to college. There will be an even greater disparity between \nthe rich and everyone else.\n  Already, since the 1970s, our Nation has been growing apart as the \nrich get richer and the poorer and middle class fall further and \nfurther behind. They have seen little or no return on their increased \nproductivity and longer working hours. If money and power continue to \naccumulate among a few individuals and companies, it will only get \nworse. There will be less money for education, less money for \nunemployment insurance, and less money for basic research to cure \ndiseases. It will be harder to get health insurance, if health care \nreform is repealed, and they might even be successful in pushing to \nprivatize Social Security or Medicare. This will not benefit working \nfamilies.\n  Your power to sway elected representatives should be the same \nregardless of whether you are the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a \npolice officer in a small town. Unfortunately, we are careening toward \na world where that is no longer the case and where the average \nAmerican's voice is drowned out by all the special interests \nmonopolizing our public discourse.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said:\n\n       The end of democracy and the defeat of the American \n     Revolution will occur when government falls into the hands of \n     lending institutions and moneyed incorporations.\n\n  I fear, Mr. President, we are on the brink of just that.\n  The DISCLOSE Act will not fix all the harms of Citizens United, but \nit is certainly a step forward. It will bring much needed sunshine to \nour political system which will go a long way toward reducing the \nnumber and dishonesty of negative attack ads that further corrode our \npublic dialogue and ultimately threaten our democratic system.\n  I am disappointed my colleagues do not recognize just that, and they \nhave refused to even let us have a full debate on this important bill. \nI understand we may be taking up a motion for reconsideration, and I \nurge my colleagues to reconsider and join me in supporting this \nimportant piece of legislation and join those of us who are here \ntonight. If it is allowed to come up for an up-or-down vote, I am \nconfident this body will pass it, and that would be cheered by the \nAmerican public.\n  In closing, I would like to remind this body of an exchange Benjamin \nFranklin had with one of the delegates at the closing of the \nConstitutional Convention in 1787. When asked whether we have either a \nrepublic or a monarchy, Dr. Franklin responded: ``A Republic, if you \ncan keep it.''\n  Our Founders created the greatest Nation in history. It is our job to \nkeep it that way and make sure a nation premised on equality and \nfreedom does not become a nation beholden to just the rich and the \npowerful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis very powerful and eloquent words, and I particularly want to thank \nmy distinguished friend and colleague from\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\nRhode Island for his leadership on this issue. I also thank others who \nhave been at his side and working with him. I have been proud to be a \ncosponsor of this measure.\n  I would like to thank Senator Schumer, who introduced a similar \nmeasure in 2010. The DISCLOSE Act of 2010 has been, in fact, \nconsiderably narrowed and tailored to target the anonymity of huge \ndonations--increasingly large donations today--and it is the kind of \ntailoring and narrowing that reflects the care and precision and hard \nwork that my colleague from Rhode Island and others--and I am proud to \nbe among them--have given to this matter.\n  As I rise at this late hour, we can't know--we can only hope--that \nAmerica is listening or that our colleagues are listening, but I do \nknow we should be listening to America. I am listening to Connecticut, \nand what I hear from Connecticut, the people of my State--as so many of \nmy colleagues are hearing from their constituents and citizens--is they \nare losing trust in the greatest democracy in the history of the world. \nThe greatest country in the history of the planet is losing the \nconfidence and faith of its people.\n  I am hearing from people such as Catherine Sturgess of New Canaan, \nCT, who says:\n\n       Undisclosed campaign money influences candidates, elections \n     and undermines the role of the voter. In turn, the election \n     process is corrupted. Only a few cannot be allowed to impact \n     a system which is intended to represent us all.\n\n  Lawrence Poin of Fairfield tells me, and I am listening:\n\n       Right now, foreign governments, oil tycoons, and Wall \n     Street banks can spend millions to buy our democracy, and the \n     American public will never know.\n\n  And I am listening also to Garrett Timmons of Brooklyn, CT, who says:\n\n       I think campaign and election reform should go much further \n     and include a constitutional amendment in light of Citizens \n     United, but I know how unrealistic that is. At least this \n     act--\n\n  He is referring to the DISCLOSE Act of 2012--\n\n       is a step in the right direction, and I hope a no-brainer \n     for our Congress. The people of this country are losing their \n     representation in government to special interests and the \n     funders of political campaigns. And to make matters worse, we \n     don't even know who are stealing our elections.\n\n  I am listening to those people who are watching. They are watching \nwhat is happening in this country, and they are losing faith because \nthey believe Washington is failing to listen to them. There are \nmillions of other hard-working families who are struggling to put food \non the table, stay in their homes, and find jobs who believe the system \nis not working for them and not listening to them as much as it is to \nthe people who can afford to give to political campaigns, let alone who \ncan afford to give tens of millions.\n  If we listen to the people of America--and I am listening to the \npeople of Connecticut--we will pass the DISCLOSE Act of 2012.\n  All this bill requires is openness and disclosure and accountability. \nIt places no limits on what can be contributed, on what can be done, on \nwhat can be said. It is completely consistent with Citizens United. I \nam not here to relitigate that case.\n  The Supreme Court, in the Bullock decision, recently indicated it \nwould not relitigate that case anytime soon. It invalidated a Montana \nState law that prohibited corporations from making independent \nexpenditures. We are not going to relitigate whether a corporation is a \ncitizen or whether any of these entities can contribute or in what \namounts.\n  The DISCLOSE Act of 2012 is completely consistent with Citizens \nUnited. In fact, in a certain very true sense, Citizens United, in its \nmajority opinion, presumed disclosure. The Supreme Court, in the \nmajority opinion in that case, made clear the first amendment protects \npolitical speech when it said:\n\n       . . . and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to \n     react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way.\n\n  The framework, the reasoning, the logic of Citizens United is no \nlimits on speech but disclosure of who is speaking and who is funding \nand supporting that speech. That basic premise is one that runs through \nthe precedence of this Court and of others who have litigated these \ncases. It is not too much to say that the DISCLOSE Act of 2012 is an \nessential predicate to the framework, the legal framework, that \nCitizens United presumes.\n  I would rather go further as well. As one of my constituents said, I \nwould favor a constitutional amendment that would enable some limits \nconsistent with the Constitution. Money is corrosive. Too much money in \nthe system corrupts. But, again, we are not here to set limits, we are \nhere to deal with secrecy, with anonymity. Secrecy and anonymity not \nonly corrode, they destroy the essence of our democracy. By opening the \nsystem to the sunshine that will eliminate that secrecy, we are helping \nto restore trust and faith in government, and we would be showing that \nWashington will listen to the American people, including the people of \nConnecticut.\n  The Supreme Court decisions, like elections, have consequences, and \nCitizens United certainly has shown that it has consequences. During \nthe 2010 midterm elections, the first election season after Citizens \nUnited, outside groups spent nearly $300 million--four times as much \nmoney as in the 2006 midterm election before the Citizens United \ndecision. Nearly half of the money spent in the 2010 election after \nCitizens United was spent by just 10 groups. Think about it. Ten groups \nspent more than half of that $300 million.\n  As spending has quadrupled, transparency has been lessened. Nobody \nknows where this money is coming from. In 2006, only 1 percent of \npolitical spending by outside groups was anonymous. In 2010, 44 \npercent--nearly half--was anonymous. We know anonymity on the Internet \nor in the public sphere breeds negativism, it breeds deception, and \noften it breeds outright lies.\n  Accountability is one of the watch words of our democracy, and the \nanonymity of this spending, of these contributions of tens of \nmillions--indeed, hundreds of millions of dollars that are contributed \nby a handful of people and entities, whether it is corporations or \nbusiness associations or unions, is corrupting to the process.\n  The majority opinion in Citizens United dismissed concerns about \nunlimited political spending by claiming that prompt disclosure would \nmake these entities and individuals accountable to shareholders, \nvoters, consumers, and the public at large. Yet elections have been \ninundated with secret money.\n  Citizens United had consequences unintended and unanticipated by the \nSupreme Court. People may say: Well, the Justices were naive. But the \nfact is this body, the Congress, must compensate to ameliorate and \nremedy the unintended consequences of that decision. The American \npeople have shown in polls as well as those letters I mentioned earlier \nthat they expect us to do so. Seven in ten Americans believe super PACs \nshould be illegal, including majorities of Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents. This issue is not partisan. It should be bipartisan. It \nhas been bipartisan in the past and must be again. More than seven in \nten Americans feel there is too much money in politics, including, \nagain, the majority of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Seven \nin ten Americans, including majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents, believe there should be limits on contributions to \npolitical campaigns. One in four Americans say they are less likely to \nvote because of the super PACs and these anonymous donations. Finally, \nseven in ten Americans agree that ``new rules that let corporations, \nunions, and people give unlimited money to super PACs will lead to \ncorruption.''\n  Let the Senate listen to the people of Connecticut and America. Let \nthem say: We respect what you are saying again and again, and we will \nact in a bipartisan way to protect our democracy.\n  Americans want their choice of candidates to be an election, not an \nauction. At the very least, we should tell them and make possible for \nthem to know who is doing the bidding in those auctions, who is doing \nthe buying, and who is doing the selling. Nobody wants there to be an \nauction, but if contributions are not limited, the auction at the very \nleast should be in the open so that the public can see who is buying, \nwho is selling, and who is bidding. That view of American democracy may \nnot\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nbe a very elevating one, but we deal with practical reality, and as we \nspeak, tens of millions of Americans are watching what we will do. \nMaybe not tonight, perhaps not at this hour, but at the end of the day, \nat the end of this debate, they will hold the Senate accountable for \nwhat it does or what it fails to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider and approve the DISCLOSE Act of \n2012.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupporting the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I commend Senator Blumenthal for his extraordinarily insightful and \narticulate words with respect to this critical issue. I particularly \nwish to commend the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse. He has \nbeen the driving force to bring this issue to the floor, to educate all \nof us in the Senate and the American people about what is at stake, and \nin many respects, it is our democracy. It is the presumption that every \nAmerican has their vote count just as much as anybody else's vote, that \nelections are decided based upon issues and ideas and not by the sheer \nvolume and the sheer magnitude of 30-second advertisements that are \ndesigned more to divert than to inform, designed more to excite than to \ninform. Most people believe in a system that is based on thoughtful \nconsideration of ideas and issues and in a system in which everyone's \nvote counts.\n  Senator Whitehouse is an extraordinarily gifted attorney. He \nunderstands these issues perhaps as well as anyone in this body. He was \na Federal attorney and our state's attorney general, and he has brought \nnot just knowledge of the Constitution but this passion for justice and \nfairness and decency and democracy to the forefront of our debate \ntoday, and this will not be the last day we will be debating this \nissue. So let me begin by commending his efforts.\n  A fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution is the right to \nvote. Each citizens gets one vote, and this right represents a critical \npillar of our democracy because we treat everyone equally, allowing \neach citizen to have this crucial and critical say in who governs, on \nthe issues, and ultimately what is the course of this great country.\n  But because of the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, I worry \nthat our political and civic conversations now advantage those who \nflood our airwaves, papers, and Web sites by talking--if not shouting--\nlouder simply because they have more money and resources to do so.\n  The New York Times recently included the following in an article, \ngiving us one indication of how much money is awash in our political \nsystem, and it reflects what my colleague from Connecticut said.\n\n       During the 2010 midterm elections, tax-exempt groups \n     outspent PACs by a 3-2 margin, according to a recent study by \n     the Center for Responsive Politics and the Center for Public \n     Integrity, with most of that money devoted to attacking \n     Democrats or defending Republicans. And such groups have \n     accounted for two-thirds of the political advertising bought \n     by the biggest outside spenders so far in the 2012 election \n     cycle, according to Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis \n     Group, with close to $100 million in issue ads.\n\n  And the clock is still ticking and the amount is accumulating.\n  That electioneering in the shadows is not what most Americans want. \nThey want robust debate. They want candidates to engage as candidates, \nnot the witting or unwitting beneficiaries or victims of anonymous \nadvertisements in their race.\n  This is not, I believe, what the creators of the Constitution thought \nwould happen or hoped would happen. They envisioned a country in which \nthe best ideas and the best arguments prevailed regardless of how \nloudly one spoke; that it was the quality of the argument, not the \nvolume of the speaker, that mattered.\n  What should be important is this quality of speech, not the quantity, \nand, frankly, there is a direct correlation between the amount of money \nyou have today and the quantity of your speech in the media. That is \njust the reality of paid advertisement, which dominates political \ncampaigns.\n  But I think this vision, because of Citizens United, has been turned \non its head. Now those with the greatest resources, the most money, \nhave been given a disproportionate advantage.\n  By allowing corporations and unions to unleash the full power of \ntheir treasury funds and explicitly advocate for the election or defeat \nof candidates in Federal or State elections in the name of protecting \nand promoting free speech, I think the Supreme Court missed the mark. \nIt missed the mark about the centrality of an individual's vote and the \nsubstance of a campaign being about ideas, not about derogatory \nadvertising, not about anything else except the issues. That is the \nideal. That is what our Founding Fathers were hoping for and, indeed, I \nthink expecting, and I think that has been terribly distorted by this \nopinion.\n  There is an interesting situation going on here. In the attempt to \ncreate, under Citizens United, what the Supreme Court, I expect, was \nhoping to do--create an atmosphere in which speech is free--they \ncreated a situation in which speech is no longer free. Effective speech \nis no longer free; it actually comes with a very high cost and goes to \nthe person who is the highest bidder. That is not free speech, not \neffective free speech; it is purchased speech. And if our elections are \ngoing to be decided not by free speech but by purchased speech, they \nwill be won always by the highest bidder, by the person with the \nbiggest wallet, the person who is willing to spend as much as necessary \nto prevail. And it will raise and it does raise the specter of, is this \nabout the future of the country or is this about the narrow self-\ninterest of someone who is willing to invest a great deal of money into \na particular race? And I think most people would conclude that it is \nprobably about the narrow self-interests of someone who invests a great \ndeal of money in a race.\n  Simply put, I think Citizens United is deeply flawed, and more than \none expert has voiced their frustration and disappointment with this \ndecision.\n  Shortly after the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Citizens \nUnited in 2010, Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, \nwhich is a center-right--more right than center, perhaps--organization, \nwrote, in a column in Roll Call called ``Court Way Oversteps its \nAuthority With the Citizens United Case,'' these words:\n\n       I hoped Citizens United would be decided narrowly but \n     feared that the court would take a meat ax to a century of \n     settled law and policy. My worst fears were realized.\n       This decision equates corporations, which have one goal, to \n     make money, with individual citizens, who have many goals and \n     motives in their lives, including making a better society, \n     protecting their children and grandchildren and future \n     generations, and so on . . .\n       This was a case never raised by the plaintiffs and never \n     formally brought before the Roberts Court. We do not have an \n     instance where an actual for-profit corporation has \n     complained that it has been barred from its ability to get \n     its message across in the political process. The cases \n     overturned and the laws struck down were considered carefully \n     by judges and Congresses past, including in the McConnell \n     decision barely six years ago. Only one thing has changed \n     since--the political and ideological complexion of the \n     Supreme Court brought on in particular by the retirement of \n     Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\n  Additionally, Richard Posner, a respected Conservative Judge on the \n7th Circuit Court of Appeals, who was appointed to the bench by \nPresident Ronald Reagan, recently stated the following on his blog:\n\n       [T]he Court, rather naively as it seems to most observers, \n     reasoned in the Citizens United case that the risk of \n     corruption would be slight if the donor was not contributing \n     to a candidate or a political party, but merely expressing \n     his political preferences through an independent organization \n     such as a super PAC--an organization neither controlled by \n     nor even coordinating with a candidate or political party. . \n     . .\n       It thus is difficult to see what practical difference there \n     is between super PAC donations and direct campaign donations, \n     from a corruption standpoint. A super PAC is a valuable \n     weapon for a campaign, as the heavy expenditures of Restore \n     Our Future, the large super PAC that supports Romney and has \n     attacked his opponents, proves; the donors to it are known; \n     and it is unclear why they should expect less quid pro quo \n     from their favored candidate if he's successful than a direct \n     donor to the candidate's campaign would be.\n\n  Judge Posner, I think, is making the case very effectively. If there \nare limits on direct individual donors' contributions because you do \nnot even want to create the appearance of a quid pro quo, the idea a \nsuper PAC, whose\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\ndonors are known, has less of an ability to influence a candidate and \nmore--I think, significantly, not only a candidate but perhaps an \nelected official--that does not follow. I think Judge Posner's comments \nare very on point in that this also invites the perception and perhaps \nthe reality of inappropriate influence on candidates and on elected \nofficials. That was a great deal at the heart of why we passed campaign \nreform legislation decades ago.\n  Even these points of view by Norm Ornstein and by Judge Posner have \nnot, unfortunately, convinced my Republican colleagues to join us in \neffect in trying to correct a deficiency which my able colleague from \nConnecticut pointed out was the fact that the case of Citizens United \npresumes disclosure. We have tried to debate this legislation and \nvariations many times before. I think we have taken even much stronger \naction in previous versions, but today we are here in a good-faith \neffort to meet our colleagues more than halfway.\n  There are those who opposed previous versions of the DISCLOSE Act on \nthe grounds that there were provisions unrelated to disclosure. But \nthese concerns are addressed head on in this legislation crafted by my \ncolleague because it focuses solely on disclosure, and it is effective \nafter this fall's elections. So I ask my colleagues, especially those \nwho have said they are all for disclosure, to join us. Join us to pass \nthis legislation because it is all about disclosure.\n  Let me go back to the language of the Supreme Court opinion quoted by \nSenator Blumenthal because they presume in the decision there would be \nfull disclosure, and that is what we are asking for tonight on this \nfloor: Give the Court what it thought it had, a system by which the \nAmerican public can know immediately who is putting all this money into \nthe elections.\n  In the words of the Court in Citizens United:\n\n       [P]rompt disclosure of expenditures can provide \n     shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold \n     corporations and elected officials accountable for their \n     positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether \n     their corporation's political speech advances the \n     corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can \n     see whether elected officials are ``in the pocket'' of so-\n     called moneyed interests.\n       The First Amendment protects political speech; and \n     disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the \n     speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This \n     transparency enables the electorate to make informed \n     decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and \n     messages.\n\n  That is what the court said. Yet, if we do not pass this legislation, \nthere will not be enough disclosure; because corporate shareholders \ncannot make judgments about what their corporate directors and managers \nare investing in, in terms of political activities. Individuals cannot \nmake judgments about the commercials they are seeing because they don't \nknow who is behind them, really.\n  If we want to create the context which presumably undergirded the \nSupreme Court's decision, we have to pass this legislation. If you do \nnot want to ignore, indeed, what the Court has said, do not want to \nignore what our constituents have said, and do not want to allow this \nanonymous money to flood our elections, to not raise doubt about the \nprocess, to not undercut what people traditionally think is the \nAmerican way--one person, one vote;--then let's start by passing this \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to join what so many have \nspoken of tonight, which is our system of electing officials to various \nlevels of government. In the case of the Federal Government we are \nalways concerned about how that process plays out. We live in a country \nwhere for generations now we have urged people to come to the public \nsquare, in a sense, to vote, to participate, to use their free speech \nrights, their freedom of association--the rights they have to \nparticipate in elections.\n  What we are confronted with now, without the passage or in the \nabsence of the passage of this legislation, is what I would say are \nspecial rules for secret money--or maybe better said, special rules for \na small group of individuals or entities to spend secret money.\n  We, in Pennsylvania, as one of the buildings in the Capital area, \nhave the finance building. It is a building I worked in for a decade. \nWhen it was built in the 1930s, they had as inscriptions around the \nborder, the perimeter at the top of the building, precepts about \ngovernment, what it should be, so people who worked in that building \nwould aspire to higher ideals.\n  One of the inscriptions says the following:\n\n       Open to every inspection. Secure from every suspicion.\n\n  A pretty simple precept. I think we all understand what that means. \nIf we have a system or a candidate or an organization or a process that \nis open to inspection, the chances of there being suspicion about that \ncandidate or about that process or about that organization would be \ndiminished. So more disclosure, more scrutiny.\n  We all know the old direction--I am not quite sure who said this, but \nwe have all used this--the idea of sunlight being the best \ndisinfectant, to make sure we keep our political process open.\n  It is baffling to me why someone would not want to vote for this \nlegislation when we consider the language. It is legislation which \nbarely gets to the 20th page. It is not very long. I was looking at \npage 5 of the authors of the bill--Senator Whitehouse from Rhode \nIsland, who has done great work on this, and so many others who worked \nwith him--the language on page 5 says as follows: It is under the title \n``Disclosure Statement.'' It is very simple language:\n\n       Any covered organization that makes campaign-related \n     disbursements aggregating more than $10,000 in an election \n     reporting cycle shall--\n\n  And this is the mandatory part--\n\n       not later than 24 hours after each disclosure date, file a \n     statement with the [Federal Election] Commission made under \n     penalty of perjury that contains information described in \n     paragraph (2).\n\n  Then it goes on to describe what you have to disclose. It is very \nsimple. I don't know how you could be opposed to that if you believe in \ndebates in the public square. It is not as if we say to people: Come to \nthe public square, but a few of you can go into a corner. We are going \nto cloak you in secrecy. You are going to be in the shadows. Everyone \nelse in the public square is going to know who is on the square, is \ngoing to know what your point of view is, what is your position in the \nlight because there are a couple of others who we are going to be put \nin the shadows, but the rest of you don't worry about it.\n  It sounds strange, doesn't it? It doesn't sound very American.\n  I think when people see what happened in the last couple of years, \nthey are very concerned that we have a system now that has too much of \nthis secret money. There is too much money in the shadows without the \nsunlight providing the disinfectant.\n  When you consider what we are doing now and compare it to what has \nhappened over the last generation where candidates not only file \nreports about who has contributed to their campaigns but even their \nadvertising--they have disclaimers at the bottom of the advertising. \nNow in the more recent period the candidate, himself or herself, has to \nidentify themselves by name and say that they paid for the ad.\n  This legislation doesn't get to that. It focuses on the basic \nquestion of disclosure so a citizen can say: This organization made \nthis assertion in an advertisement, and I am going to find out who they \nare so I can make a judgment about the advertisement before I vote.\n  It is very simple. It is how our system works. People go to the \npublic square, they have a debate, there is a lot of sunlight, a lot of \ndisclosure, and the debates are freewheeling. They are tough, but they \nare in the open, and they comply with that precept I started with. They \nare open to every inspection, and therefore the chances of suspicion \nare lessened because everything is out in the open.\n  That is all this is. It is providing a measure or degree of sunlight \ninto that process, into that public square. So if all these generations \nof reform have told us--which I think they have told us, and I know \nthis is true in Pennsylvania--that more disclosure, more sunlight, more \nscrutiny is going to lead to better elections and better participation, \nI don't think we should run counter to that history.\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\n  I am not trying to assert that everything else about our elections is \nperfect. We still have a lot of other reforms we could institute. But \nat least we can give people some measure of confidence that when they \nhear an assertion in that public square they are going to know where it \ncomes from. They are going to know the origin of that statement. They \nare going to know the bias or point of view, and they are going to make \na judgment about that before they exercise their right to vote.\n  We should allow people that opportunity to maybe be a little bit \nsuspicious, but it is hard to be secure in your knowledge about \ninformation if you do not know where it comes from, if you do not know \nwho is the real speaker, and you do not know their point of view.\n  I think there are a lot of Americans who know our system is not \nperfect even with passage of this legislation, but they at least say to \nus: Let's at least remove the possibility, which I think is evident \nnow, that you have a small group of people who are allowed to spend \nthis secret money and, therefore, elevate or raise suspicion, and maybe \neven cynicism, about our system.\n  Let's be open to every inspection and to every measure of scrutiny, \nand let's bring our points of view to the public square as we have for \nso many generations. Let's pass the DISCLOSE Act and make sure that at \na minimum, as tough as times are for a lot of people right now, at \nleast they are going to have the information they need about point of \nview before they vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank all my colleagues \nwho have been so diligent, hardworking, and prescient on this issue. Of \ncourse, Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, the leader of our task \nforce, led us to this point. Senator Merkley has been very active and \ninvolved, as have you, Mr. President, as well as Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Bennet. There have been so many people on the task force who \ndid a very good job, including Senator Udall and so many of our \ncolleagues.\n  The fact that we have been on the Senate floor now for close to 5 \nhours and there hasn't been a moment's pause says something. It talks \nabout the broad support that this modest but powerful act has on our \nside of the aisle. The fact that no one, unfortunately, on the other \nside of the aisle has come to debate this issue says something as well. \nThe only debate, in fact, we heard was the Republican leader in a brief \nspeech that was almost 1984ish. His reason we shouldn't disclose is \nthat people who give would be harassed.\n  If we go by that, we should probably have everything be in secret \nbecause, of course, in an open democracy, when we do things in the \npolitical arena, we are subject to criticism. That is what freedom is \nabout. To come up with this inside-out argument that we shouldn't \ndisclose because people might be criticized for the contributions they \nmake or the ads they fund is the most antidemocratic, anti-U.S. \nConstitution argument I have heard. It just doesn't even pass the laugh \ntest. I am surprised. My colleague is one of the most brilliant \npolitical minds we have around here. Even when I disagree with him, I \nrespect his mind. But this argument is--to say sophistry is kind. I \ndon't think it is going to catch on with people.\n  Anyway, we have had very few comments, other than that made by \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle tonight, and that is truly \nunfortunate. We should have a debate on this issue, but I have a \nfeeling most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle realize by \ntheir previous statements, by the previous position of the Republican \nParty, and by knowing them, we are right.\n  Disclosing contributions is only fair and only right and American and \nin keeping with our democracy and our Constitution. I think the reason \nso few people have shown--or no people on the other side have shown is \nthat the reason they are not supporting us is not out of conviction but \nout of short-term political advantage. Obviously, the super PACs, large \nmultimillion dollar contributions are coming mostly from the other side \nand may indeed benefit them in the election. In the long run, it is bad \nfor our democracy. In the long run, it is bad for the Republican Party \nto shy away from not only debating this issue but supporting this bill \nbecause the issue of disclosure is so simple, so easy, and so right. \nThe issue of disclosure is one that is now wracking the Presidential \ncampaign. You can run, but you can't hide. The argument of disclosure \nwill, in a sense, chase you down and beat you so you may as well join \nin now and do the right thing.\n  I would like to make a point. The two top advertisers in this \nelection cycle are predictably the two candidates' campaign. What is \nthe third just after the Obama campaign and the Romney campaign? It is \nsomething called Crossroads GPS. In the last week alone, Crossroads GPS \nannounced almost $25 million in advertising against the President and \nthe Senators. The group, Crossroads GPS, has a name, and it doesn't \nmean much. They don't have to disclose a single one of their donors. In \nfact, reports indicate that Crossroads GPS raised $77 million in its \nfirst 2 years of existence, and 90 percent of that came from, at most, \n24 donors. That is an average of $2.9 million per donor.\n  So far in this election cycle, as of May 31, super PACs have spent \n$135.6 million in an election year. Twenty percent comes from 501(c)(4) \norganizations, ``social welfare organizations'' that don't have to \ndeclare their donors at all thanks to the decision in Citizens United. \nMany of the donors behind the other 80 percent of super PACs could also \nbe anonymous. That is because people can donate to the 501(c)(4)s that \nrequire no disclosure and then the 501(c)(4)s can donate to the 527s \nwhich requires some disclosure. The level of disclosure under our \npresent law isn't just inadequate, it is laughable. The voters deserve \nto know the truth, ugly or not, of who is behind the super PACs. If the \nwealthy special interests want to invest hundreds of millions of \ndollars in our government, then they should pay their fair share of \ntaxes rather than fund candidates who will give them special tax breaks \npaid for by middle-class Americans.\n  Yet because of the flawed Citizens United ruling, the corporations \nthat can't vote in our elections are trying to buy the electoral \noutcomes that benefit them, and it is all in secret. Our solution is \nsimple: The DISCLOSE Act simply restores transparency and \naccountability. There are many of us who would limit what people can \ngive and how they can give it.\n  I believe, frankly, that Buckley v. Valeo is not as bad a decision as \nCitizens United, but it is a bad decision. I introduced legislation, a \nconstitutional amendment, to undo it years ago. Two years ago, I joined \nmy colleague from New Mexico who had spearheaded this drive in the \nHouse to support his legislation.\n  I believe there ought to be limits because the first amendment is not \nabsolute. No amendment is absolute. A person can't scream ``fire'' \nfalsely in a crowded theater. We have libel laws. We have \nantipornography laws. All of those are limits on the first amendment. \nWhat could be more important than the wellspring of our democracy? \nCertain limits on first amendment rights that if left unfettered, \ndestroy the equality--any semblance of equality in our democracy of \ncourse would be allowed by the Constitution. The new theorists on the \nSupreme Court who don't believe that, I am not sure where their \nmotivation comes from, but they are so wrong. They are so wrong.\n  I hope we are going to move to change this law. I hope we are going \nto pass first this DISCLOSE Act and then the broader bill that has been \nintroduced, which also has disclaim. I hope eventually we will find a \nSupreme Court that allows reasonable limits on campaign contributions. \nThat is so important for the future.\n  I have to tell the Chair I am an optimist, and I love this country. \nWe had our DSCC retreat this weekend, and we heard stories about people \nwho had risen from poverty to now run for the U.S. Senate after having \ncareers of great accomplishment. I am not going to name specific \nindividuals, but you heard them. They were moving. It is what America \nis all about, being there. It made me so proud to be an American. Most \nof our families are examples\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\nof this. My father was an exterminator. He didn't go to college. I am \nhere. What a place.\n  Despite my love for this country and my fervent belief in its future, \nthe thing that worries me most is the effects of the Citizens United \ncase. To have 17 people contribute half of the money to Republican \nsuper PACs and to have the vast majority of that money undisclosed is \nfrightening.\n  I know maybe our Supreme Court Justices do think in absolute terms. \nAfter all, this is the first amendment. But I am sure of one thing: \nNone of them have run for office. They have no idea of the power of \nthese negative undisclosed ads, the corrosive effect it has on our \ndemocracy, and the influence that those who offer these ads have. It \nmakes me worry about the future of this country if we continue along \nthis path. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court seems to have very little \ndoubt based on the Montana case where they even refused to hear it. We \nhave to worry about the fundamental fairness of how our system \nfunctions.\n  We are not a pure democracy. We are a Republic, if we can keep it, \nand a Republic says there ought to be some intermediation. There is an \nunderstanding in a Republic that the Founding Fathers were very much \naware of it. I guess Alexander Hamilton, my fellow New Yorker, leading \nthis part of it, that those who have achieved success in America \ndeserve some influence--maybe a little more influence than others--they \nbelieved that; that is how our Republic is set up.\n  The pendulum has swung so far that I truly, for the first time in my \nlife, worry about the future of this democracy. If a small group of \npeople can control the entire political process through the powerful \nvehicle of undisclosed ads shown on television time and time again. If \nwhen people run for office they are afraid to offend those who have \ngreat wealth or power because these ads may be run against them, it \npresents one of the greatest dangers to this democracy that we have had \nin over 200 years.\n  Maybe one of those nine--particularly one of those five--on the \nSupreme Court are watching so they have some understanding of the \ndamage this decision is doing to our democracy. Do they understand that \nwhen they write: We are not against disclosure, and that as long as \nCitizens United continues to exist it is almost a catch-22--the way our \npolitical structure works, the heavy money that comes in on the other \nside--and then not a single Republican, even many of those who probably \nagree with us in their hearts are willing to vote even for disclosure--\nmeans we will never get it and it is an empty promise. Do they \nunderstand the so-called independence of independent expenditures has \nbecome a joke, that the very underpinnings of their decision in \nCitizens United does not square at all with reality? Do they understand \nwhat every 1 of the 100 of us here and the 435 Members of the House on \nthe other side and Presidential candidates are living with? Do they \nhave any understanding of that?\n  So here we are. What else can we do? We are here late at night \ndesperately trying to either persuade our colleagues whose self-\ninterests mitigate against them joining us to persuade the people--\nalthough the issue of campaign finance is often an abstract one at a \ntime when people are so busy working hard paying the bills, raising \ntheir families, and experiencing the vicissitudes that life and that \nGod gives and visits on each and every one of us. In fact, maybe one of \nthe Justices on the Supreme Court is sort of living in a fantasy world \nas their decisions undo the very democracy they are supposed to \npreserve.\n  We are trying. That is all we can do. The one thing I want to assure \nmy colleagues of on both sides of the aisle, the American people, and \neverybody else who is involved in this issue is we are not going to \nstop trying until we succeed.\n  Dr. King, one of the great men of America, said that ``the arc of \nhistory is long, but it bends in the direction of justice.'' He was \ntalking about justice for people of color. There also has to be a \njustice for average folks who can't reach into their checkbooks and \nspend $1 million on an ad, undisclosed, that excoriates, often \nunfairly, someone they disagree with. They need justice too, those \naverage folks. They are not going to get it until this simple measure, \nand others that are stronger than it, start succeeding.\n  We are going to keep at it. We are not going to stop until we \nsucceed. Under the leadership of many who are here tonight sitting in \nthis Chamber, we will keep working and working and working until our \ngovernment is truly one of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, this is a very interesting night on the \nSenate floor as many of us keep coming down and talking about what it \nmeans, the money involved in politics, and the corrupt system that is \nnow plaguing us with these super PACs and these 501(c)4s. I bet if we \nasked the average person what is a 501(c)4, they would have no idea. We \nwould say, turn on the TV in one of those swing States and see 1 of \nthose 1,000 ads in a week; that is a 501(c)4 running those ads.\n  I know it is late here. It is not too late from Alaska's perspective; \nit is late here. It is around 11 o'clock in Washington, DC. In Alaska \nit is about 7 o'clock, the sun hasn't set, and here we are in the \nSenate talking about what is important not only to my folks in Alaska \nbut also to the rest of the folks in this country.\n  It is just July and we are already up to our elbows in negative and \ndirty and distorted attack ads. Imagine what it will be like by \nNovember. These kinds of negative ads are cheap-shot ads, many of them \nfunded by anonymous donors who make outrageous negative claims based on \nhalf truths at best and outright lies at worst, all paid for by secret \nfat cats and unlimited deep pockets--money that no one knows where it \ncomes from. Alaskans tell me when I am back there--and I try to get \nback there at least twice a month or more and I hear from Alaskans all \nthe time. They are fed up with it. I know we are fed up with it. I \nthink the American people are fed up with it. So I am happy to join my \ncolleagues tonight to stand up and fight back, demanding transparency--\nsomething so simple. That is all we are asking for tonight: \ntransparency, openness, and honesty.\n  I don't know what they are afraid of. If you contribute money, you \nshould be proud and excited about who you are supporting. For some \nreason they hide. They don't want people to see who they support.\n  I want to take a few minutes--I know many people have heard tonight, \nwho have been watching and listening, and maybe it has been through C-\nSPAN or through news clips or whatever else might be going on, through \nour own Web sites--to describe how we got here, why we are in this \ndilemma. The Citizens United case expanded free speech rights to \ncorporations as if they are free people. Whoever thought ``corporate \npersonhood'' would become part of our vocabulary?\n  In fact, Alaskans are very concerned about this. Just last week, the \ncity and borough of Sitka passed a resolution about the opposition to \ncorporate personhood. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this resolution from a small community in Alaska that is \nconcerned about the issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Resolution 2012-15\n\n\n A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY AND BOROUGH OF SITKA TO SUPPORT AMENDING THE \n   UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION TO RESTORE THE PEOPLE'S POWER TO LIMIT \n           CORPORATE INFLUENCE IN ELECTIONS AND POLICYMAKING\n\n       Whereas, Due to the incorrect interpretation of the \n     Constitution and the adverse impact on the rights of people \n     in our democracy in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \n     Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission (FEC), local, \n     state, and federal elected officials must take action to \n     restore the authority of the American people to restrict the \n     undue influence of corporations on our elections and public \n     policy; and\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Citizens \n     United v. FEC broke away from the legal precedents that \n     acknowledged the power of citizens through their elected \n     representatives to limit corporate influence in elections \n     because the interests of corporations do not always \n     correspond with the public interest and therefore, the \n     political influence of corporations should be limited; and\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court's radical rewrite of the First \n     Amendment's protections will permit even greater corporate \n     influence over our political process by allowing unlimited \n     spending from corporate profits to favor or oppose \n     candidates; and\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court's decision will allow the free \n     speech rights of a corporation to dilute and outweigh the \n     free speech rights of ordinary citizens, because of the vast \n     financial resources corporations have for spending money to \n     influence elections compared with regular people; and\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court's elevation of corporate \n     ``rights'' may have constitutional repercussions that go far \n     beyond this one case and will undermine the ability of the \n     people to regulate corporations in numerous policy areas \n     affecting people's health, wealth and opportunities; and\n       Whereas, THE American people, through their local, state, \n     and federal governments must reclaim their rightful place as \n     sovereigns in our democracy and protect the electoral process \n     from corporate domination; and\n       Whereas, fair elections are fundamental to the health and \n     well-being of our democracy, and\n       Whereas, the City and Borough of Sitka Assembly stands in \n     agreement that corporations are not entitled to the same \n     first amendment rights in our elections as people and further \n     urge our state legislators to adopt and send to the United \n     States Congress a resolution in support of amending the \n     Constitution to restore the ability of the American people to \n     limit corporate spending in our elections. Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the elected officials of the City and Borough \n     of Sitka that: the City and Borough of Sitka, strongly \n     condemns the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United vs. \n     FEC and supports amending the U.S. Constitution, to limit \n     corporate influence and restore democracy in our elections \n     for the benefit of the American people.\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. I also want to talk about the solution to a growing \nproblem, and that is the DISCLOSE Act. As I presided, sitting where the \nPresiding Officer is now, and now down on the floor, I noticed no one \nfrom the minority is here in this Chamber countering or debating what \nwe are talking about tonight. They are at home away from the TV cameras \nbecause earlier this evening they voted in a bloc against moving the \nDISCLOSE Act forward. That is kind of interesting because I don't know \nhow many times I hear from the other side: Please let us have the right \nto have a debate on a subject matter. Don't filibuster it; don't \nrequire 60 votes. Let us vote. Let us amend these kinds of issues. So \nall we are saying is, Let's get to the vote. They would get a chance to \namend it if they want, if they don't like pieces of it, but they won't \nlet us do that. They voted in favor of unlimited negative political \nads. They voted against transparency, openness, and honesty. They voted \nagainst the American people. They should be ashamed. They should be in \nhiding.\n  So what exactly is Citizens United? The Citizens United ruling by the \nSupreme Court--again, that many of us have spoken about already--2 \nyears ago opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate and special \ninterest money in elections. As a result, corporations and other \nwealthy interests exert vast influence in our political system through \nsecret, anonymous, untraceable money. Individuals, ordinary Americans, \nare having their voices drowned out. Super PACs--we hear that phrase \noften--disclose their donors, but these 501(c)4s--that is what they are \ncalled, 501(c)4 groups, which is a code underneath the IRS code--they \nare actually called--this is what is amazing--social welfare \norganizations, 501(c)4s. They don't have to disclose anything. They can \nrun their own negative ads or they can give unlimited money to super \nPACs without any disclosure. Either way, they don't have to disclose \ntheir donors.\n  The era of secret money is here, and it is a lot of money. We have \nheard the numbers. This year, we estimate almost $1 billion will be \nspent in negative ads no one has to know who is paying for. If they \nlove these ads, if they think they are so great and they are so \nfactual, all we are asking is to tell us who you are, tell us what you \nare doing.\n  When I was mayor of Anchorage, I had to deal with a group like this \nin one of my reelection campaigns. They ran an ad. No one knew who they \nwere, but I had a pretty good idea. I started talking about it. I will \ntell my colleagues what happened. In Anchorage, people rejected those \nads. I won my reelection. I won the largest margin in my city's \nhistory. But they started running these secret ads. They didn't want to \ndisclose themselves. They didn't like a decision I made and then they \nnever came forward, but we knew who they were.\n  Again, we think it will be up to $1 billion. They have already spent \na quarter of a billion dollars.\n  The last time we had an issue such as this in this country around \nelectioneering in the sense of elections being bought by very special \ninterest groups was around 1972. Some people may not remember the \nhistory, but all I have to say is a couple of words: Scandal. \nWatergate. That is what happened. It was election money--more money \nthan people could ever imagine. The rules were unlimited in 1972. As a \nmatter of fact, it got so bad that it was truly a constitutional \ncrisis. The President had to resign. Think about it. That was the last \ntime we did election reform in the sense of campaign financing. And \ncampaign financing reform came in fast and furious after that, because \nit was corruption with the money of a very few people. It brought down \nour President at that time and almost brought down this country.\n  Things have changed quite a bit since then. I want to give a couple \nof stats because I think it is important to know where we have been and \nwhere we are in the sense of this debate. Forty years ago was the last \ntime we had meaningful, aggressive election reform in the sense of \ncampaign financing. Back then we could buy a gallon of gas for 55 \ncents. Imagine that. HBO was launched as the first paid-for cable \nnetwork channel, or TV station. Today, cable is everywhere and the \namount of money flowing into it is enormous. Digital watches were \nintroduced. Everything is digital now. Back then it was just beginning, \nbut it was a different era. It was a crisis that occurred with the \ncorruption of money that tried to buy our governments, buy every \nelected official they could get their hands on, and in that case the \nPresidency. That was 40 years ago.\n  Now here we are. When we think about the money that will be spent \nthis time--$1 billion--almost 70 percent of the money so far has been \nused for negative ads. Poll after poll, I don't care if it is a \nscientific poll or sitting at the coffee shop, or when I am traveling \naround Alaska--people hate negative ads. But they continue to buy them \nand they never want to tell anyone who is paying for them. Again, if \nthey are so proud and they are factual, step to the plate.\n  The election is 4 months away from now and we are going to see an \nenormous amount of ads. When I think about how this affects my State of \nAlaska--not so long ago, Alaska had some of the strictest campaign \nfinance laws in the country. Alaskans said we don't want outside money \nor a few rich locals buying elections.\n  Let me give an example. Five hundred dollars is the maximum amount \none can contribute to a candidate in a calendar year. Individuals, \nnonresidents, the maximum amount for a Governor's race is $20,000, \ntotal. Corporations, business organizations, unions in Alaska, \nprohibited. Groups from outside, not based in Alaska, prohibited. \nNongroup entities based outside of Alaska, prohibited. We have some of \nthe toughest laws.\n  But now this effort is stepping on what citizens did through an \ninitiative. They put at risk our State laws. Now corporations can make \nindependent expenditures on behalf of State candidates in Alaska, which \nthey could not do before. Our own campaign financing agency in Alaska \njust issued an opinion that will allow for unlimited spending. This \nwill allow outside groups and money to influence Alaskans in Alaska \nelections--exactly what we didn't want, through our own citizens \ninitiative.\n  There is one thing we don't like in Alaska and that is outsiders \ntelling us how to do our business. They did that for decades and took \neverything they could out of Alaska. Every dime, every inch of land \nthey could take in the sense of ownership of mineral resources, they \ntook it all for their benefit--for a few. Alaskans said, No more. Not \nonly did we change our laws that govern, we also changed our elections \nlaw. Citizens did this.\n  What can we do in Congress? It is so simple: disclosure and \ntransparency.\n  Members of both parties have said for decades that sunlight, as we \nheard tonight, is the best disinfectant. We need more transparency. I \nam a huge advocate for transparency. I post my own schedule. I post my \nfinancial statements. I disclose my wife's income, which is not \nrequired. I called for crop insurance transparency. I cosponsored the \nSTOCK Act.\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\n  People just want to know what we are up to. And these corruptive \nsystems of a few, a dozen or so, who are trying to buy this election \nfor their own personal gain--we just want to know who they are. They \ncan spend the money they want, but we want to know who they are.\n  Transparency, disclosure, used to be a bipartisan idea. Senator \nMcConnell said himself many times--we heard this earlier; I want to \nrepeat it because sometimes what happens around this place, I have \nnoticed after only 4 years here, is memories get very vague of what \npeople said before and suddenly they change their ideas based on the \npolitics, not the policy--here is his direct quote from 15 years ago:\n\n       I think disclosure is the best disinfectant. I think it \n     gives our constituents an opportunity to decide whether or \n     not we're in the clutches of some particular interest group \n     and whether or not that's a voting issue for them. I'm \n     certainly in favor of enhanced disclosure.\n\n  That is from the minority leader. Nearly every Senator in this body, \non both sides of this aisle, has said they want more transparency. \nPolls show Americans want to know exactly who spends money to influence \nelections--they want to know it--because they want to have more faith \nin their representatives. Maybe this explains why they are angry at us, \nwhy Congress has such a low rating.\n  The bill is very simple. I know people have said it over and over \nagain, but sometimes I think we have to repeat it. The bill is very \nsimple. It requires any organization that spends $10,000 or more on \ninfluencing politics to file a simple--simple--disclosure report with \nthe FEC, the Federal Elections Commission. It is not complicated. Every \ngroup is treated the same. I have received a few e-mails. I have to \nsay, the e-mails on this issue: all for it, except for only one \nagainst, so far. I know once I have said this, tomorrow I will see a \nream of them because five or six of these special interest groups will \nbe churning out stamped-out letters.\n  But this treats everyone the same: corporations, nonprofits, labor \nunions, 501(c)(4)s, 527 organizations. They only have to disclose money \nspent on elections, and only from individuals giving more than $10,000.\n  Under this bill, money given to these groups for other purposes does \nnot need to be disclosed, despite what you read in the papers and the \nblogs--the misinformation that is put out there or by the undisclosed \ngroups that tell you the misinformation, that will not tell you who \nthey are but want to give you more misinformation.\n  This is a new and improved version of the DISCLOSE Act that failed on \nthe Senate floor 2 years ago by just one vote. Under that bill, the \ncutoff for disclosure was $600. Now, in this bill before us tonight, \nthe threshold is $10,000. That is not too much to ask. If you give \n$10,000 or more for negative political attack ads that distort the \ntruth, the American people deserve to know who you are. And if you are \nso proud of those ads, you should disclose who you are.\n  The bill will not force groups to release their member lists. Some \npeople have e-mailed me. I want to make it very clear, if you belong to \nthe NRA--and I belong to the NRA. I am a lifetime member. Actually, I \ndo not have any problem with the NRA releasing my name. If they want to \nput it on their Web site that I am a lifetime member, go for it, I am \nall for it. I am proud to be a member. Put my name up there. But this \ndoes not require us--if you are a dues-paying member to a group such as \nthe NRA, your name will not be listed. So that misinformation from some \ngroups out there, shame on them.\n  This bill is not an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. The \nDISCLOSE Act puts no restrictions on speech and is fully consistent \nwith the Supreme Court decision.\n  The bill also incorporates the Court's ``effective disclosure'' \nrules.\n  Let me sum it up. This bill--and I think the Senator from Arkansas \nspoke to this, and I thought it was great because we always hear that \nthese bills are so big, they are pages--this is it. If you look at it, \nit is double-spaced. It takes only half the page, each one. It is not \ncomplicated, pretty simple.\n  The bill is narrowly tailored and very simple. It does not prevent \nany special interest group or any corporation from donating any amount \nthey want. All we are asking is, tell us who you are. When I say \n``us,'' not us here--the American people, who want to know.\n  The bill will give Americans faith that their elected representatives \nare not being bought and sold by hundreds of millions of dollars of \nsecret untraceable money.\n  So I hope we vote on the DISCLOSE Act again, and as soon as tomorrow. \nAnd I hope my colleagues from the other side come back to this. Maybe \nthey will have something to say. I do not know. It has been a long \nnight. We have not heard a word from them. It would be nice to have a \ndebate on this. But also let's do what I know Alaskans are asking me \nevery day: Clean up the system. The best way you can do that is to tell \npeople where the money is. Show me the money. Follow the money. And \nwhen you follow the money, as in 1972 they did, you know exactly who is \ntrying to buy the government. In this case, we just want to know.\n  If you are so proud of these ads you run--and I am sure we all sat \naround a little bit talking about this. As soon as we come to the floor \nand say these things, people will be--I am sure 2 years from now when I \nam up, they will be thinking: I am going to run those ads against that \nBegich guy. My view is, hey, if you want to run them, run them. People \nwant to know who you are. But if you will not disclose, then you pay \nthe consequence of what I think Alaskans will feel; that is, these \npeople who hide behind this money, secret money, do not disclose \nthemselves, basically what they are pitching, what they are selling is \nhogwash.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to join so many of my \ncolleagues in speaking out tonight at this late hour to try to call \nattention to a very serious issue before the body; that is, whether \npolitical contributions of over $10,000 should be disclosed.\n  As Senator Begich eloquently stated, I think people are concerned and \nvery troubled by the fact that we are even having this debate; it so \ndefies common sense. I think people at home are saying to themselves: \nWhy is this even an issue? Why are we debating this? Why didn't one \nRepublican step up to join a group of Democrats to say: Obviously, if \nyou are contributing to the political process $10,000 or more, you \nshould make yourself known.\n  I think Senator Begich, the Senator from Alaska, listed many \nimportant points. I wish to underscore the point he made about \ntransparency.\n  Our government is far from perfect. It is the oldest democracy, but \nit is the best we know of. What are the reasons our democracy is the \nbest and it works most of the time pretty well? It is because it is, \nmost of the time, transparent. The press can come here anytime and \nwrite about what we speak. Every word is written in a public record. \nAll the records, vital records of the United States, are public. We \npublicize our real estate transactions in almost every jurisdiction I \nknow of. There is so much public information available. It is one of \nthe reasons our democracy works pretty well.\n  So this is a real step backward. And it is a dangerous step backward \nto have a democracy that prides itself on transparency and here we have \nhalf of this Chamber running out the door after they basically voted to \nkeep contributions secret. What is it they are ashamed of? I mean, what \nis it they are trying to hide? If they are proud of who they are \nsupporting, if they believe in the causes to which they are investing, \nwhy not let people know? As the Presiding Officer said, he is a member \nof the NRA. All of us are members of different organizations. I most \ncertainly do not mind the organizations--I am chair of the Adoption \nCaucus. I love to see publicity about the members and what we do, and I \nam proud of what our organization does. It is nonpartisan, of course. \nBut I believe in and we advocate for those principles.\n  I am alarmed at the stubbornness and the position our friends on the \nother side of the aisle have taken to not want to let their \nconstituents know who is contributing and for what reason. So I believe \nthat transparency clearly is in jeopardy tonight over this DISCLOSE \nAct, and I hope we can have\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\nanother vote and persuade more people to join us, to open up, let the \nsunshine in, let people see what is actually going on.\n  The other point I wish to make is that the middle class in this \ncountry is under assault. There was a very startling article in the New \nYork Times last week that talked about in the last 2 years the income, \nthe net worth of the average American has fallen by 40 percent because \nof secret deals on Wall Street, because of secret collusion of some of \nthe largest financial institutions in the world, because of a lack of \ntransparency in our financial system, and a number of other reasons; \nbut that was primary--and the lack of enforcement, of having good \nregulations and the enforcement of good regulations. You would think \npeople would be moving forward to open the process to make it more \ntransparent. This is going in the opposite direction.\n  The middle class is under assault. Congressional rating is at an all-\ntime low. So what do we do? We say it is OK to give tons of money to \nelections, and to cover it up, and to be secret about it, and to not \ntell anyone who is giving and for what purpose.\n  Our poll numbers for Congress are down. I think they were down to 3 \npercent or 13 percent or something. It is going to go negative. And I \nwould not blame people. We will be a negative number in the polls. \nBecause people are losing confidence in the system. This is an example \nof why they should lose confidence in the system.\n  I am disappointed it is just those of us on our side of the aisle who \nseem to be concerned about this. And the other Members, I am not sure \nwhat their points are in the debate because not one single person has \ncome to the floor, at least in the last several hours. I know the \nminority leader made some weak attempts at explaining their position \nearlier in the night. If they felt so strongly about this being a \npillar of our democracy, they most certainly should be on the floor \ntalking about why, but they are not. They ran out of the Chamber, and \nthey are not here.\n  And so with the middle class under assault, with people understanding \nand thinking and seeing special interests having their day in \nWashington, letting some sunshine in most certainly would not hurt.\n  The DISCLOSE Act is a necessary piece of legislation to respond to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United.\n  This legislation, as we said, does not limit the amount of money \noutside interest groups can spend on campaign expenditures. It simply \nrequires disclosure. We are doing a better job of disclosing our \nincome, our stock transactions. I think our records should be public, \nour tax returns. I have submitted many of my own in elections. I hope \nMitt Romney steps forward to submit more than 1 year of his tax \nreturns. I think it helps to build confidence when those of us who hold \npublic office have full and complete disclosure.\n  But the money that is being spent in these campaigns is exorbitant. \nIt is billions and billions of dollars. I think this campaign cycle is \nsetting records--and to have this all done in secret. So you are being \nattacked on television or positions are being taken, and no one \nwatching the ads has any idea who is behind them because there is no \nrequirement for disclosure.\n  I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership. Senator \nMerkley has also been very active, other Senators. Senator Schumer has \ntaken a leadership role as well. I appreciate the committee that has \ncome together, and I am happy to be of assistance to them in this \neffort.\n  But again, this does not limit the amount of money anyone can give to \na campaign. It just says, if you give over $10,000, you should disclose \nit. It does not limit free speech. It does not limit the amount of \nmoney that can be spent by an outside organization. It simply says that \nduring this election cycle, you would have to report expenditures of \nover $10,000.\n  Of the more than $140 million that has already been spent during this \nelection cycle, the first Presidential election cycle since Citizens \nUnited--more than $140 million has already been spent. Why would these \ngroups be spending this much money if they were not going to ask for \nsomething? What is their motive? What are they expecting? These are \nwealthy individuals. These are not organizations of thousands and \nthousands and thousands of people. Many of these are individuals who \nare contributing and want to hide behind the recent ruling of the \nSupreme Court.\n  So I am proud to lend my voice to the DISCLOSE Act. I am proud to be \na cosponsor and want to join my colleagues in asking our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle: Do we not need more transparency in \ngovernment? Do you not think the middle class is under enough assault? \nDo you not think this would build some confidence that our government \nwould be more transparent, people could see what was actually happening \nand understand why some of those contributions are being made?\n  So we have some time. We have opportunities to cast another vote. I \nhope our colleagues will, and the public will, demand that we have \nadditional votes until we get the required votes necessary to pass such \na commonsense solution to a real problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for \nher remarks. Would the Senator be able to engage in a question or two?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I think back to the period when our forefathers and \nforemothers came here and said: We are going to set up a new set of \ncolonies, a new set of rules.\n  One of the things at the very heart of that was the notion that we \nthe people, we the settlers, we are colonists. We are going to decide \nhow things run rather than having kings and queens or other very strong \nfolks handing down the laws from now on. That was a powerful concept \nthat got integrated into the first three words of our Constitution, \n``We the people.''\n  Does the Senator have any sense whether this flood of secret, this \nmassive flood of secret money coming from powerful individuals, \nbillionaires and companies, does damage to this concept of ``we the \npeople''?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. The Senator is correct. As I said, the \nrecent polling I have seen has the opinion of Congress and the way \nWashington government is operating at an all-time low. People do not \nbelieve they are getting the whole story, the full picture. This is \ngoing to contribute in a very negative way to that opinion, which is \ndetrimental to the foundation, the essence of this democracy. I think \nour Founding Fathers would be horrified to actually think a small group \nof individuals can, through campaigns, buy the outcome of the election \nor buy the attention of the candidate or the cause, and not even have \nto disclose their identity or why they might be interested.\n  Everyone is entitled to free speech. I do not think people are \nentitled to secret speech or secret attacks. If you are going to get \ninto a fight, you would like to know with whom are you fighting. \nIdentify yourself. This system obscures the truth, which I think people \nhave a right to know. I think it does cut at the heart of some of the \nstrongest principles of our democracy.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I was thinking back to a book that a friend gave me to \nread. It was called ``Treason of the Senate.'' When I first heard him \nspeak about it over the phone, I think he was saying he had a book \nabout the reason of the Senate. It turned out to be not the reason, but \nthe treason. It was a series of articles, I believe about 20, that were \nwritten during the muckraker period.\n  It was each month taking a different Senator, how they had basically \nbeen put in office through a particular company in a different State--\ndifferent powerful interest. This set of articles apparently was one of \nthe things that led to a constitutional amendment because it helped the \npublic mobilize against the indirect election of Senators and pushed \nfor the direct election.\n  So here was the public saying: You know, we the people have this \nsystem, and it has been violated. So we have to try to change the \nsystem so we can reclaim it.\n  I think that is maybe some evidence of the role of excessive power \nand money and its corrupting influence or its corrosive influence on \nthe electoral process.\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is perfect to point that out and is an \nexcellent student of history. He has demonstrated his understanding. \nBefore Senators were directly elected, they were elected by the \nlegislators of their States, and oftentimes literally sent to \nWashington by special interests--for instance, the railroads.\n  Instead of the laws being written to help people, average citizens or \nhomesteaders or people trying to get a hand up and a helping hand, some \nof these Senators came, basically bought, sold, delivered, and packaged \nto Washington, DC, to argue on behalf of one special interest.\n  It is tough to keep things in balance here right now without us going \nback to these times. That is what is so frightening. I see Senator \nWhitehouse on the floor. He has been studying this and has many \ndocuments he is referring to, but that is what is alarming. I do not \nthink people realize--I mean this is really moving backwards in time.\n  When Washington operates in secrecy, there is no way to get the \ninformation. Why would we want to do this at a time when the middle \nclass is under assault? They have lost 40 percent of their net worth. \nAt a time when our popularity and trust with the people is at an all-\ntime low, this does not make any sense to me. I do not understand any \nbenefit that would come from it.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I follow up on the points that Senator Merkley \nmade. The comparison he made to the constitutional change that took the \nSenate from election by State legislators to direct election by the \npeople is very much a model for what is happening here. There was a \ndesire to get the vote away from the special interests and put it in \nthe hands of the actual people.\n  Here it is a desire to get the spending, the money behind the vote, \nout of the hands of the special interests and back to the people. What \nCitizens United did was to go backwards, open the flood gates of \nspecial interest money, and allow it to be secret. Try to put ordinary \nvoters up against that kind of a force. It is not fair to ordinary \nvoters. It is not right. In some respects it puts the right they are \ntaking up inside out, and that is the right of freedom of speech.\n  I think we all have seen the four freedoms, the posters by Norman \nRockwell. Perhaps the most famous of those posters is the one of the \nfellow in the tan windbreaker jacket, a thin guy. He is standing up \ntall surrounded by people, clearly at a townhall meeting. Why is he \nstanding and what is he doing? He is speaking. He is having his say.\n  The way Citizens United worked out, they are basically saying we do \nnot have a constitutional right to speak. We have a constitutional \nright to listen. We have a constitutional right to listen when big \nmoney speaks. It is essentially a shut-up-and-listen-to-the-big-money \nversion of the first amendment. When money is speech, which is the \nprinciple of Citizens United, guess what. Those with the most money get \nthe most speech.\n  Those who do not have a lot of money do not get a lot of speech, and \nthose who have no money get no speech. That is not what the Founders \nintended. So there is a strong similarity between the move to take the \nvote and put it in popular hands and what we are trying to do with \ndisclosure, which is put the money in popular hands. We cannot do that \nunder Citizens United.\n  With the DISCLOSE Act, at least you know what is going on. You can \nlook at the game that is being played. It is cards up on the table. If \nyou are being denied the ability to speak on even terms with the CEO or \na billionaire or a major corporation or some big lobbying group, at \nleast you have the right to know what they are doing, what they are \nsaying, what is going on. You can keep score. When you get together, \nyou can get mad and do something about it.\n  Behind the veil of secrecy you cannot even keep score. You do not \nknow what is going on.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Just a moment ago our colleague from Louisiana was \nnoting that we have important work to do to shore up the American \nfamily. Families have lost--the number is, on average, $100,000 of \nequity in their house per family. That is a phenomenal amount. If we \nlook at the equity held by our Hispanic families, our African-American \nfamilies, they have been virtually wiped out by a system of \nderegulation, predatory mortgage, leading to a housing bubble.\n  We have a desperate need for jobs. I think what I hear the Senator \nsaying is that in the face of these needs, allowing unlimited spending \nby the most powerful interests in the country to pursue the interest of \nthe most powerful is not going to help us create those living-wage jobs \nAmericans so desperately need. It is not going to help us fund those \nhealth care clinics that are the front door for folks who do not have \nthe big salaries and the big benefit packages. It is not going to help \nput food on the table for those out of work and hungry, and in that \nsense this process of us working by and for the people is being \ncorrupted by these vast pools of secret spending?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. That is why I said the Senator is correct; \nwhy I am astonished that people on the other side of the aisle who talk \nabout good government, government for the people--you know, that is \nwhat the tea party movement is supposed to be about. It is supposed to \nbe about taking government back. This is not taking government back to \nthe people; this is giving it away to people who have the most power \nand the most money, and you do not even know who you gave it to because \nyou did not have disclosure.\n  I think this is going in the opposite direction of what the American \npeople want us to do right now. If the middle class is not angry \nenough, they really should be angry about this because the consequences \nof secret, undisclosed, unlimited amounts of money puts the average \nperson at risk. It disenfranchises them.\n  We have worked for over 230-something years to go through a process \nof perfecting our democracy to where every man, every woman, every \nperson 18 and older has a right to vote and participate.\n  Now what do we do? Just wake up after 230 years and say: That is not \nworking. Let's just give the government back to the rich, the few, and \nthey do not even have to say who they are. They do not have to disclose \nanything about themselves.\n  This is absolutely going in the wrong direction at the wrong time. I \nhope people listen to this debate and not say, well, there they go \nagain, but I hope they really understand the consequences of this kind \nof secret money in the system. It is corrupting. It is not right.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I was a prosecutor for many years. I \nwas the U.S. attorney for our State. I was the attorney general for our \nState. When you are prosecuting crimes, there is one very important \nthing that you always look for. Motive. You look for a motive. And I \nthink one of the things that is obvious to all Americans is that the \nfolks who engage in unlimited election spending do so because they have \na motive. Someone may give $1,000 here or there because they are \npassionate about an issue. They may give $20 because they know the \ncouncilman who is running. But these folks who are giving $4 million at \na hike, they are doing it because they have a motive, and it is \nimportant for the public to know what that motive is.\n  So now you take the next step. If it is unlimited, it is to open the \ndoors for the people who have a motive. If it is secret, what does it \ntell you about that motive? If it is secret, what it tells you about \nthat motive is that it is a bad motive for the American people.\n  This goes back to the point Senator Landrieu and Senator Merkley were \nmaking, whether it is trying to help get your kids through college, not \nhaving to pay the increased interest rates, to be able to get a Pell \ngrant or whether it is paying to put food on the table or trying to get \na decent job--and Rhode Island still has 11 percent unemployment--you \ncan name your issue.\n  If this special interest, unlimited, secret money was aligned with \nwhat the American people want, they would not be fighting about this. \nThey would not care whether it was secret. They need it to be secret. \nThey filibustered this bill because they know those special interest \nmotives are against the public interest, against the interests of the \nAmerican people. There is no other logic.\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\n  There is no reason people would give that much money in a race--\nunlimited money--if they didn't have a motive. There is no reason they \nwould want their behavior to be secret unless that motive was bad. \nThere is no other explanation.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask the Senator, when the company gets involved in \nthat manner or a billionaire gets involved in that manner and their \nmotive is largely to advance their financial interests, do they use \nthat to fund ads that are an accurate representation of the facts?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is a fascinating development. I don't remember \nthe numbers off the top of my head, but I will try. My recollection is \nthat before the super PACs kicked off with all this, 9 percent of the \nads were negative in the last election cycle, at a time when 78 \npercent, I want to say, were negative--or 70 percent. It went from 9 \npercent being negative the cycle before--the Presidential cycle \nbefore--to 70 percent being negative now. That is nearly eight times as \nmuch negativity--more than half, nearly three-quarters, where it was \nless than 1 in 10 before--an explosion of negativity.\n  So we know that is happening. The other thing we know is happening is \nit is misleading. It is not accurate. It is deceptive. The Annenberg \nInstitute has done a study of the top four outside spenders--outside \npolitical spenders that aren't campaigns or parties--these special \ninfluence manipulating machines. The top four--they looked at their ads \nand, if I remember the figure correctly, 76 percent of them contained \ninformation that was deceptive.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. While the Senator is on that topic, I have the Annenberg \nchart here, I believe.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. There it is, 85 percent. I underestimated it.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. It was 85 percent deceptive and 15 percent accurate. To \nthe other point, this is taking one of the contests between Gingrich \nand Romney. You can see the red bar, the negative ads, benefiting \nRomney for attacks on Gingrich. Positive ads for Romney was zero. Over \nhere, Gingrich didn't have very much super PAC money in this race and \nso it kind of was wiped out completely.\n  So what we see is not just a flood of money on behalf of the powerful \nspecial interests, but it is being spent to attack people--the negative \nside--and through lying. Can this in any possible way be healthy for a \ndemocracy?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will respond to that, if I may. The Senator hit the \nnail on the head. Some people--I am one of them--believe there is \nliterally an effort to discourage people generally from believing that \ngovernment can work at all by being so negative either to an individual \nor to the concept of government that it discourages people from voting \nand participating, and the end result of that is that a small group can \nmanipulate the system.\n  If people think the system is rigged, which it seems like it is \ngetting more and more because of laws and rules such as this that we \ncannot seem to get straight, what happens is people get despondent and \nturned off, and then the special interests can run the show if people \ndon't vote and contribute. So it is a part of a whole strategy to kind \nof take the government away from the people and hand it over to a group \nof special interests with unlimited money, secret attacks to basically \nfashion and write the laws that benefit the few as opposed to the \nmasses. It is completely against the concept of our democracy.\n  Again, I know there are people who have a lot more money than others, \nand they should be free to make decisions about what they do with it. I \ndon't have a problem with that, although I have supported campaign \nlimits. But it is the disclosure--the lack of disclosure, I should say, \nthat is frightening here and the secret nature of this--to go on \ntelevision night after night and tell people how this person is either \nwrong or the system is broken and people stay home and less and less \npeople vote and the few people who have the power, access, and \nprivilege write the rules even more in their own favor.\n  This is taking our democracy, in a dangerous way, in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I can add an additional point that Senator McCain \nand I made in our brief to the U.S. Supreme Court opposing the Citizens \nUnited decision and asking for its reconsideration. It is terrible what \nthese negative ads filled with deception do to the American public, and \nit is discouraging to people about the participation we expect of \nAmericans and government and, ultimately, it leads to corruption, as \nthe Senator points out. At least in the example Senator Landrieu gave, \nyou see the spending. There is at least a dirty, deceptive, negative \nattack campaign up on the air. So it is not completely invisible. You \njust don't know who is behind it.\n  What that leaves open--again, this is the prosecutor in me talking--\nis the threat of that same campaign--the visit from the lobbyist who \ncomes in to the Congressman and sits him down in a quiet room and says: \nHave a look at this and places a 30-second commercial--negative, \ndeceptive, slashing, vitriolic, vile, all against him, and says, you \nknow what, under Citizens United, we have the right to spend $5 million \nplaying that ad against you all through the next election, and we are \nthinking about doing it. You know what, under Citizens United, we have \nthe right to put up phony shell corporations so they will never see our \nfingerprints. The only thing the public will see is Americans for \npeace, puppies, and prosperity. That will be the phony name we are \ngoing to use. If you vote right, this will be the last time you hear \nfrom me. If you don't vote right, you are going to hear $5 million \nworth from me through my shell companies. How are you going to vote?\n  If the Congressman gives way to that kind of pressure--pressure that \nwas never possible before Citizens United and is not as possible if it \nis not secret--then you have no clues and you have actual corruption \nand the system is even worse than what we see out there.\n  In some respect, as awful as what we see is that it might be the \niceberg that you see above the water and the 90 percent that is under \nthe water that you don't see could be worse still.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. To my colleague from Rhode Island, I ask this: How is it \npossible for 5 members of the Supreme Court to look at this issue of \nunlimited, secret spending and knowing that can be used to intimidate \nand corrupt the electoral process and corrupt the debate by the threat \nof future activities, future secret activities, secret negative, lying \nactivity, and not see the corruptive or corrosive effect on the \nAmerican democracy?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is an interesting question. One would have to \nlook into the hearts of those five Justices to get the answer to it. \nBut why they would be willing to make such a dramatic, activist move \nwithout working with four other colleagues to try to bring them along--\nwhy it is always those five making these activist steps toward the \nRepublican agenda is a question I can't answer. What is their motive? \nThey know that in their hearts. I don't.\n  One can observe that over and over again, the five Justices who are \nperforming the Republican role on that Supreme Court are delivering the \ngoods and doing things that advance the Republican agenda. That is not \nme talking, those are people who have followed this Court for decades--\nthe most prominent writers about the Supreme Court--who noted that \nfact.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. May I expand on the Citizens United? The Senator from \nRhode Island and Senator McCain wrote a brief to the Supreme Court \nsuggesting the detrimental impact of the decision the five Justices \nhave made. Did they, in that decision--how did they treat corporations? \nDo they treat corporations as people? Is that what they did, on equal \nfooting with Citizens United, or was it more of just there should not \nbe limits on contributions? Did they say that corporations are like \npeople and should be allowed to contribute unlimited amounts?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In effect, that is what they did. The famous \nexpression that ``corporations are people, my friends,'' is the \nexpression actually of Governor Romney. But it sort of attached itself \nto the Citizens United decision, which doesn't actually use those \nwords. But it does treat corporations as having the same rights in the \npolitical process as human beings do. They don't have consciences \nbecause they are not human.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. They don't have hearts, and they don't have minds.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. They don't have children. They don't have \naspirations.\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nThey don't have souls because they are not human. They don't have \ngoals. They don't have all the things that make us different and make \nus human. But, evidently, they have the same rights. Because they don't \ntruly exist, it is a legal fact that they are a legal fiction. What \nthat is doing is empowering the people behind the corporation, the \npeople who control the corporation, ultimately.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is actually giving more power to the people who \ncontrol the corporation. Not only do they control their own vote and \npersonal opinion, which is fine, but it gives them extra power because \nthey have access to wealth and influence in the business structure.\n  It also occurs to me that if the tiny State of Delaware would take \nthis one step further, they might be able to expand their congressional \ndelegation in Washington because I think they have quite a few \ncorporations that are evidently alive and well and walking around in \nDelaware. Since they have many corporations that are there, they should \npress this issue a little further and they might only be stuck with two \nSenators, but who knows how many House Members they could get--maybe \nequal to California.\n  This issue or decision the Court made is mind-numbing, doesn't make \nsense, and it flies in the face of what is good for our democracy and \nin the face of decisions that courts have made. That aside, which is \ntroubling enough, then you take the next step, as the Senator from \nOregon knows, and say that not only are corporations people and have \naccess to their own vote and if you happen to run a corporation, you \nget a vote for that corporation as well and all the people who run it, \nthen you can do it all in secret. It is very troubling.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Even the corporation itself doesn't know what it is \ndoing; that is, the corporation might have 10,000 shareholders and they \nare the cooperation. The corporation is a legal fiction, as our \ncolleague says, that allows a board of directors to make decisions on \nbehalf of those thousands of people who own stock. So they are not \nspending their own money, they are spending money that belongs to the \nstockholders. But those stockholders have no idea how that money is \nbeing spent under Citizens United. So it is not just corporations \nspending money that is secret from the rest of us, it is the officers \nspending it secretly from the corporation itself, and that is the \nstockholders.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It makes no sense. We can stay here all night, and I am \nnot sure we can get anybody to understand it. We have to reverse this \nlaw and get transparency back into our electoral process.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. To the Senator's point about the distinction between a \ncorporate forum and an individual justice, John Paul Stevens addressed \nthis in his dissent. He said:\n\n       In the context of elections to public office, the \n     distinction between corporate and human speakers is \n     significant. Although they make enormous contributions to our \n     society, corporations are not actually members of it. They \n     cannot vote or run for office because they may be managed or \n     controlled by nonresidents. Their interests may conflict in \n     fundamental respects with the interests of eligible voters. \n     The financial research, legal structure, and instrumental \n     orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about \n     their role in the electoral process.\n       Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if \n     not also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to \n     guard against potentially deleterious effects of corporate \n     spending in local and national races.\n\n  So here is the esteemed Justice saying not only--not only is there a \ncompelling constitutional basis but probably a democratic duty. And \nwhat is he talking about? He is talking about ``We the People,'' the \nfirst three words of our Constitution--the vision that we have a \ndemocracy, that we have a representative form of government, we have a \nrepublic, and that it is centered around, as President Lincoln so aptly \ndescribed, ``a government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.'' We have a duty to protect that.\n  Montana had a duty to protect that 100 years ago. Earlier this \nevening, Senator Tester was here on the floor, and he was speaking \nabout the 100-year present the Supreme Court delivered. Montana said \n100 years ago that companies, through a variety of means, have taken \nover our State, that it is no longer a government by the people, and so \nwe are going to take it back. We are going to exclude corporations from \nthe electoral process. And they have done that for 100 years with the \ndirect purpose of people, not companies, controlling their State. That \nis the democratic duty Justice John Paul Stevens was speaking to.\n  So the people of Montana were very upset about Citizens United. Some \nfolks said: Well, Citizens United is a case. Surely Montana can't \ncontinue to keep companies or corporations out of their electoral \nprocess, so we will challenge that. And that challenge went all the way \nto the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basically issued a summary \njudgment--a judgment in which they said: We are not going to look at \nthe facts from Montana. We are not going to look at the 100-year \nhistory of why the people of Montana chose to fight for ``We the \nPeople.'' We are not going to consider any information at all. We are \njust going to summarily decide that this case will not stand, and we \nare going to throw out the Montana law.\n  Well, that was some gift to the people of Montana who are fighting \nfor ``We the People.'' And this is why I thought I might summarize \nCitizens United in the following way:\n  In Citizens United, five Justices of the Supreme Court have taken the \nfirst three words of the Constitution and they have X'd out ``people'' \nand have written in ``powerful,'' so it is now ``We the Powerful.'' \nThat is what Citizens United is all about.\n  Now, I am deeply disturbed that our Supreme Court made a finding of \nfact in Citizens United that unlimited secret money--not just dark \npools of unregulated cash but vast oceans of unregulated, undisclosed \nsecret money--can be utilized in the electoral process without the \npeople having any right to know. That is what the Supreme Court said is \njust fine, and that is what attacks ``We the People'' in favor of ``We \nthe Powerful.''\n  Now, not a single member of the Supreme Court has run for office, to \nmy knowledge. Not a single member of the Supreme Court has served in \nelected office, to my knowledge. I am happy to stand corrected if any \nof my colleagues know otherwise. So perhaps they didn't have the \npersonal experience to understand the types of things my colleague from \nRhode Island was speaking about, that folks who can wield huge sums in \nelections not only can affect the outcome of elections, but they can \nuse it as a lever to corrupt the very process we are in tonight--the \ndebate and voting on bills. So one would think, at a minimum, the nine \nJustices, knowing they may not have the personal experience but who \nneed to make a finding in order to proceed, would want to hear all the \nevidence. But instead what the five Justices did in summarily \ndismissing the case from Montana was to cover their ears, cover their \neyes, and say that facts don't matter, corruption doesn't matter, the \ncorrosive influence, the vast oceans of secret money--none of it \nmatters. And that is simply wrong.\n  I must say, when I think about what we are doing here on this floor, \nfighting to have a Senate and a House that are all about what President \nLincoln described as ``of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople,'' and across the street we have a Supreme Court determined to \ntear down the fundamental heart of our Constitution, it is completely \nwrong, and yet they won't even listen to the facts in order to \nunderstand the issue they are addressing.\n  It is so important for Americans across this Nation on the right and \non the left to understand that this is an attack on their power as \ncitizens to chart the course of their community, their State, and our \nNation.\n  I think I will conclude my remarks. I have a lot of facts and history \nhere that I thought about presenting tonight, but I think the \ndiscussion we have been having is really at the heart of this; that is, \nas we wrestle with the fundamental challenges facing our Nation--a \nshrinking middle class because we are losing manufacturing jobs--and we \nneed to understand why that is happening and how we can create living-\nwage jobs in this Nation, where health care is becoming more and more \nexpensive and an enormous challenge for families, where for the first \ntime in the history of our country we are becoming the first group of \nparents whose children are getting less education than we got--as \nparents, we are seeing our children get less education--those problems, \nas we tackle them, are not served\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\nby vast oceans of secret money weighing in on elections because that \nmoney does not come from the point of view of fighting for the health \nand welfare of the citizens of our Nation.\n  Our forefathers and foremothers talked about, in order to create a \nmore perfect union and enable citizens to pursue happiness and provide \nfor the general defense, and none of these fundamental things were the \npoint or the goal of these entities with vast pools of money. That in \nitself shows how corrosive and corrupting that money is.\n  So I say to my colleagues across the aisle, each of us came here and \nwe swore an oath to this constitution. And at the heart of this \nConstitution is not ``We the Powerful.'' At the heart of our \nConstitution is ``We the People.'' So before we vote a second time on \nwhether to proceed to this bill, I ask my colleagues to examine their \nhearts and their responsibility to their citizens, their responsibility \nto the Constitution, their responsibility to ``We the People,'' and to \nfind that we do have a responsibility to debate this bill in this \nChamber, and for that reason to vote yes when we again vote on whether \nto proceed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I will be the last speaker for \ntonight. Let me close with a number of thank-yous.\n  First, let me thank the Presiding Officer, Senator Landrieu of \nLouisiana, for staying past the midnight hour to help keep the Senate \nopen. Let me thank Senator Merkley, who has been--to the extent one can \nbe enthusiastic about staying until this hour, there he is, smiling. \nYes, ``enthusiastic'' is the right word. He was part of a group Senator \nSchumer organized himself, along with Senator Michael Bennet, Senator \nTom Udall, Senator Al Franken, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Jeff \nMerkley, and myself, who worked together to redraft this legislation, \ntrim it down, and to organize today's vote and events and tomorrow's \nvote. So I thank all of them for their enormously hard work.\n  I thank the pages, who have had to stay very late, and the floor \nstaff, who have had to stay very late. I appreciate the fact that we \nhave put a burden on them and on their families, and we would not be \ndoing that if we didn't consider this to be a very important issue.\n  I wish to thank the entire Democratic caucus for their support. Our \ncolleague Bill Nelson has had a unique experience. He has actually \nridden a rocket up into space. He has been up with the NASA program as \nan astronaut. In some respects, I feel that I and others who were \nleading this were really doing nothing more than riding a rocket of the \nenthusiasm of our caucus to get this thing done for the sake of our \ncountry.\n  I thank the American people, who went out of their way to have their \nvoices heard in this debate. We know the public is strongly behind \nthis.\n  Six in ten Americans say the middle class isn't going to catch a \nbreak while the big lobbyists and big donors control things in \nWashington. Americans get that you don't spend this kind of money \nwithout a motive, and they get that if you will only do it in secret, \nit is probably not a good motive. They can figure this out, so they \nunderstand. Seven out of ten believe super PACs should be outright \nillegal--not secret, but illegal. Seven in ten agree with the statement \nthat new rules that let corporations, unions, and people give unlimited \nmoney to super PACs will lead to corruption. Seventy percent of \nAmericans agree with that. Seventy-seven percent want to reform the \ncampaign finance laws and consider that to be very important. As a \nnumber of my colleagues have said, one in four Americans is so upset by \nwhat this has done to degrade American democracy. They think it makes \nthem actually less likely to go out and vote because they figure, why \nbother, this is just a racket at this point.\n  These numbers really should be a call to arms for the people who \nbelieve America is, in fact, a city on a hill, the American \nexceptionalists--of which I consider myself to be one--the lamp held up \nto other nations, the alabaster city is gleaming. That is all for real, \nbut the Citizens United decision and the failure to support us on \nDISCLOSE does nothing for that.\n  But it wasn't just the polling that brought that up to a lot of \npeople. People came online in a very big way to participate in this \ndebate--617,000. Mr. President, 617,000 Americans have signed up as \nsupporters of the DISCLOSE Act now on a variety of different Web sites, \nincluding DISCLOSE Act.Com. DISCLOSE Act.Com got so much activity just \nbefore the vote that the public interest in it actually crashed the Web \nsite. So the American public is really paying attention. I thank those \nfolks who paid attention, and I thank those who set up the \nopportunities for those Americans to have their voices heard. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  I want to thank some of the leading newspapers in this country for \ntheir editorial support in the past few days. I have already spoken \nbefore about the New York Times' editorial, so I won't go back and \nrepeat it at length, except for the phrase they used:\n\n       Corporations love the secrecy . . . because it protects \n     them from scrutiny by nosey shareholders and consumers.\n\n  The Washington Post had a very strong editorial entitled ``Expose the \nFat Cats.'' It said the following things:\n\n       Not a single Republican in the chamber has expressed \n     support for the Disclose Act . . . It should be interesting \n     to hear how the Republican senators justify this monumental \n     concealment of campaign cash.\n\n  They allude to the Watergate break-in and the bad old days of \nunregulated cash contributions and describe what has happened recently \nafter Citizens United as, ``We seem to have created the political \nequivalent of secret Swiss bank accounts.''\n  They asked the question, Who is writing checks for $10 million or $1 \nmillion at a single throw? And what do they want? We don't know. This \nshadowy bazaar undermines our political system. They note that until \nrecently Republicans supported full disclosure. Now that the tide of \nmoney is running in their favor, they don't. They described this \nDISCLOSE bill as a reasonable bill that would, among other things, \nrequire identification of donors of $10,000 or more to certain \norganizations that spend money on political campaigns, and they close \nwith this question and this observation: There is a very good chance \nthat when some government decision or vote comes along next year, \nresponsible politicians will find themselves haunted by the secret \nmoney of the 2012 campaign.\n  Is it really worth it? The Washington Post asks: Do these donors \ndeserve to remain hidden? Why can't they handle a little sunshine?\n  I want to thank USA Today for a July 6 editorial supporting this: \n``Freed by the Supreme Court from spending limits,'' they observed, \n``all manner of special interests are opening the spigots to buy \ninfluence.''\n  ``Especially worrisome,'' USA Today points out, ``are secret \ndonations, which are proliferating. A corrupting influence in any \ncampaign, secret money is even more dangerous in less expensive races \nwhere it can buy a seat in Congress or a state legislature, without \nvoters knowing who the buyers are or what their agenda is.''\n  USA Today folks said:\n\n       Citizens United left the public only one way to protect \n     itself from the rising threat disclosure. At the federal \n     level, this would be achieved by the Disclose Act. . . . \n     Today's version, scheduled for Senate debate this month, \n     requires that all groups--social welfare, union and \n     business--report all expenditures and all donations more than \n     $10,000.\n\n  They fear that ``the inevitable result is that come November, voters \nin many closely contested races will make their decisions based on a \nlate flood of ads of dubious credibility paid for by people whose names \nand motives are unknown. How long it will take voters to realize \nthey're getting conned and demand disclosure is anyone's guess.''\n  I will briefly point out that the claim that the DISCLOSE Act favors \nunions is a complete nonstarter as a criticism. The bill is very short. \nIt has very big print. You can read it very quickly. There is nothing \nin the bill that gives unions any advantage over any other form of \norganization. It is just not there.\n  I have challenged Republican colleagues to point to a single \nprovision or make a single counterproposal, and they have done neither. \nThe DISCLOSE Act applies equally to all corporations, period, end of \nstory.\n  The $10,000 threshold eliminates another problem, which is this \nbusiness\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\nthat membership organizations are going to have to disclose their donor \nlist. As recently as today, the Republican leader said this will force \norganizations to disclose their donor lists. It won't. Not at a $10,000 \nthreshold. You can get a lifetime membership in the National Rifle \nAssociation for $1,000. If you are a cat and you have nine lives, you \ncan get nine lifetime memberships in the NRA and still not break the \n$10,000 threshold. It will catch 93 percent of the money that goes into \nthe super PACs because it goes in in such big chunks.\n  So it is a good number to use. It protects the small membership \norganizations but hits virtually all the big donors. Clearly, it is not \nan attack on the first amendment. This charge has its roots only in the \nopponents' imagination, not in the U.S. Constitution. It contains no \nrestrictions or limitations on speech of any kind. None. Pure \ndisclosure legislation, plain and simple, as my Republican colleagues \nhave heretofore usually supported.\n  The Court, in Citizens United, fully supported disclosure. Prompt \ndisclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with \nthe information needed to hold corporations and elected officials \naccountable for their positions.\n  An important point, going back to the words that began this vote, \nfrom our Founding Father James Madison: A popular government without \npopular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a \nfarce or a tragedy, or perhaps both. The Supreme Court recognized this, \nand clearly it is constitutional.\n  The last is the argument that this bill in some way will intimidate \nthe big spenders. First of all, the idea of the billionaire Koch \nbrothers or gigantic coal barons or ExxonMobil--the largest corporation \nin the world--being intimidated by the unkind words of some blogger is \npreposterous on its face.\n  Second, Justice Scalia has said: Requiring people to stand up in \npublic for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which \ndemocracy is doomed.\n  May I point out that it is a rather small courage. On the way here \nthis afternoon, I passed through the trolley lobby. Down in the trolley \nlobby was a young marine from Pennsylvania who had lost both his legs \nto an IED explosion in Afghanistan. We can ask our young men and women \nto travel the roads of Kandahar and to risk blowing off their legs and \ncoming home like that young man, but we can't ask billionaire big \nspenders to even show who they are even though, clearly, the link to \nmotive and influence and control and corruption is apparent? It is a \nridiculous proposition, and I hope my colleagues will not persist in \nfollowing it.\n  They have even compared themselves to the NAACP during the civil \nrights movement--Black families burned out of their homes, and they \ncompare the Koch brothers being criticized by bloggers to that. It \nsimply isn't so, and it simply isn't right.\n  I will conclude by saying that we are not done. This is too \nimportant. It is too important for what America stands for. It is too \nimportant for the middle class who are going to be losers in the \ndebates that are influenced and corrupted by special interest money. It \nis too important for the world which depends on the example that \nAmerica provides.\n  So we didn't have any luck today. We are going to vote again \ntomorrow. I urge my colleagues to vote with us. But even if we don't \nwin tomorrow, we will be back again and again and again.\n  When Joshua took the Israelites around the city of Jericho, they went \naround and around blowing their rams horns so that those walls would \ncome tumbling down. It didn't happen on the first circuit, it didn't \nhappen on the second. According to the Bible, Joshua had to go around \nthe city of Jericho seven times before the walls came tumbling down. I \ndon't care if we have to do this 7 times or 77 times; we are going to \ndo this because it is right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/16/senate-section/article/S5044-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, today I am privileged to honor Mrs. \nVirginia Ruth Long of Owsley County, KY. Mrs. Long, wife of Booneville \nmayor Charles Long, passed away at age 92 on March 27, 2012. A lifelong \nresident of Owsley County, Mrs. Long, a mother, beautician, and \nhomemaker, was truly beloved by the Booneville community. It is with \ngreat respect that I recognize the First Lady of Booneville and her \nlifetime of commitment and service to Booneville and the people of her \ncommunity.\n  Mrs. Long was born in Indian Creek, KY, on October 1, 1919. She \ngraduated from Owsley County High School in 1938. Upon her graduation, \nshe attended cosmetology school in Lexington. After completing her \nschooling, Mrs. Long returned to her home, Owsley County, where she \nopened the first beauty shop in Booneville.\n  In 1939, she married Charles Long. The two were married for 73 years \nand had two children: Charlotte and Charles Edwin. Mrs. Long not only \nraised her children and maintained the home but also worked for 62 \nyears in her beauty parlor. She quickly became a staple of Booneville, \nand many women in Owsley County recall her being the first person to \never style their hair professionally.\n  Ruth's contributions to the Booneville community stemmed from running \na business, raising a family, and playing a major role in her husband's \npublic career. A World War II veteran and mayor of Booneville for 54 \nyears, Charles Long is no stranger to public service. Through the many \nyears that Charles has served the Booneville community, Mrs. Long \nremained a constant partner to him and accompanied him on many trips he \nmade as Booneville mayor.\n  Though Ruth was a source of strength for her husband, Mr. and Mrs. \nLong equally relied upon one other. During one of Mr. Long's trips as \nBooneville mayor, Mrs. Long fell and broke her hip. Despite the demands \nof his public post, Mr. Long extended his trip by 3 weeks to help her \nrecover from her injury. The couple was again tested in 2010 when their \ndaughter, Charlotte, passed away. Though this tragic time was very \ndifficult, as it would be for any parent who loses a child, Mr. and \nMrs. Long's faith and reliance upon each other helped them to cope with \nsuch a great loss. Ultimately, Ruth was able to still find joy in her \nlife through her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  Apart from being loved by her family, Mrs. Long was beloved by the \nOwsley County community. She was a faithful member of the First \nPresbyterian Church of Booneville. She was also famed for having the \nbest angel food cake in the county. However, more importantly, it was \nher warm, inviting nature that caused members of the community to come \nto love and admire Mrs. Long. An avid storyteller, she was a friend to \nall. After her death, many members of the community said they became \nbetter people by knowing Mrs. Long.\n  I am honored to memorialize Ruth today as a lifetime servant of \nOwsley County. Without holding public office, she dutifully served her \nBooneville community through her devotion to her husband, Mayor Charles \nLong, and her life of friendship with its citizens. Kentuckians who \nlive dedicated, humble lives of service like Mrs. Long are what make \nour Commonwealth strong. Today I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate \nto join me in remembering Mrs. Virginia Ruth Long, the First Lady of \nBooneville, KY.\n  Mr. President, an article was recently published by the Booneville \nSentinel, an Owsley County-area publication, recognizing the life of \nMrs. Long. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Booneville Sentinel, May 10, 2012]\n\n              Tribute for the ``First Lady of Booneville''\n\n       Virginia Ruth Long was born in Indian Creek in Owsley \n     County on October 1, 1919. She later moved to Cow Creek, also \n     in\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\n     Owsley County, where she went to school at Athlenia Grade \n     School. She graduated from Owsley County High School in 1938.\n       Ruth attended beauty school in Lexington, Kentucky. After \n     graduating, she came back to Booneville, where she opened the \n     first beauty shop and worked until she retired at age 62. \n     Even after Ruth retired, her previous clients would talk \n     about what a talented hairdresser she was. A lot of women say \n     that she was the first person who styled their hair.\n       She married in 1939 to Charles Long, who retired at age 62 \n     also. There are three days difference in their ages. They \n     have been married for 73 years. Her husband Charles has been \n     mayor of Booneville for 54 years, and Ruth accompanied him on \n     many trips he made as mayor with the Kentucky River Area \n     Development District.\n       They went to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., and \n     many other meetings and events together. On one particular \n     trip to Salt Lake City, she fell in the Mormon Temple and \n     suffered a broken hip, where she and Charles stayed for \n     almost 3 weeks. Ruth always had many stories and had a way of \n     making them sound exciting. Ruth lived a life that most women \n     don't understand. When WWII started December 14, 1942, \n     Charles was called to active duty. Daughter Charlotte was \n     only 3 years old. Ruth had a son, Charles Edwin, on February \n     14, 1943. She cared for their home and children until he \n     returned home at the port in San Diego where she met him on \n     December 14, 1945. Ruth traveled to meet Charles whenever he \n     was close enough.\n       Ruth said it kept her busy cooking and keeping Charles's \n     clothes clean. Ruth was always awfully proud of their two \n     children. Charlotte, their daughter, taught school for over \n     36 years in Owsley County until she passed away on April 8, \n     2010. Their son, Charles Edwin Long, has a barber shop in \n     Frankfort, Kentucky, where he lives. They have three \n     grandchildren, one deceased, and now they have five great-\n     grandchildren that they loved to be with. I remember when \n     Charlotte passed that Ruth had said that a child should never \n     go on before the parent. This was a difficult time for both \n     Ruth and Charles, but they were there for each other as they \n     had been many other times over the years.\n       Ruth has been a faithful member of the First Presbyterian \n     Church of Booneville for over 60 years and enjoyed going to \n     church to listen to Joe Powlas and to visit with friends \n     following. She had the name of having the best angel food \n     cake around. At all her dinners at home and away, they wanted \n     her to bring her angel food cake, and also her dressing at \n     Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n       Ruth was 92 years old when she passed away in the morning \n     on March 27, 2012. She had been in the Owsley County Health \n     Care Center for over a year. She was a strong lady and was \n     always proud to say that she had led a very fulfilling and \n     happy life. Many people have expressed how she had touched \n     their lives just to offer her friendship. She will be greatly \n     missed by her friends and family greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/16/senate-section/article/S5045-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Hunter D. Hogan\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marine \nLCpl Hunter ``H.D.'' Hogan, who was killed by sniper fire in Helmand \nProvince, Afghanistan on June 23, 2012.\n  Following in the footsteps of his father, Steve, Lance Corporal Hogan \njoined the Marines in 2009 immediately after graduating from Brownstown \nCentral High School in Norman, IN. He served admirably and was assigned \nto 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine \nExpeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  Lance Corporal Hogan grew up in Indiana, where he and his childhood \nfriend, Chase Plumer, built an arena at the Plumer family farm in order \nto host rodeos. His classmates and friends remember him being ``tough \nas nails,'' owing in part to his avid love for rodeo. Lance Corporal \nHogan was a Marine with the heart of a cowboy and dreamed of finishing \nhis military service, then hitting the road as a professional rodeo \ncompetitor. He avidly competed in bull and bareback bronco riding.\n  By all accounts, everyone who ever met Lance Corporal Hogan liked \nhim. His kind personality and compassion for others translated into him \nmaking the personal choice to enter the military and defend his fellow \nAmericans. Lance Corporal Hogan served his country honorably, and his \ncourageous choice to protect our country and to help the people of \nAfghanistan achieve peace and security represents all that we can be \nproud of about our Armed Forces.\n  The numerous family members residing in my home State of Nebraska, \nincluding Lance Corporal Hogan's father, Steve, and his grandfather, \nJim, gave him a beautiful and touching memorial service, incorporating \nhis love of all things relating to rodeos and cowboys. Not only was his \nlast ride in a beautiful refurbished wagon drawn by two bay draft \nhorses, a white horse less a rider led the procession, displaying the \ntrue heart and soul of this Marine cowboy.\n  I commend Lance Corporal Hogan's bravery and selflessness, while \noffering my deepest condolences to his wife, Brittney, of New Bern, NC; \nfather, Steve, and grandfather, Jim, both of York; his numerous \nfriends; and the fellow servicemembers he left behind. It is a small \ncomfort for those who must now go on without one they loved so dearly, \nbut they take some solace in knowing he gave his life for a noble goal.\n  LCpl Hunter Hogan made the most of his short life, and the greatest \ntragedy is that now it is impossible to know what more this promising \nyoung man might have accomplished. I join all Nebraskans in mourning \nthe loss of Lance Corporal Hogan. His heroism and his life remain an \ninspiration for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/16/senate-section/article/S5045-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5045-S5046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BILL HYBL\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to \nacknowledge a great Coloradan--Mr. William J. Hybl--on the occasion of \nhis 70th birthday. The epitome of a public servant, Bill has spent the \nbetter part of his career tirelessly working to improve the lives of \nColoradans. It is only appropriate, therefore, that I take this \nopportunity to honor his tremendous contributions to our home State and \nexpress my profound appreciation.\n  Raised in Pueblo and educated at the Colorado College and the \nUniversity of Colorado School of Law in Boulder, Bill is a true product \nof Colorado--and he began giving back almost immediately upon \ngraduation. After serving as a captain in the U.S. Army, Bill was \nelected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1972 and continued \nto stay involved in the public sector, serving as Special Counsel to \nPresident Ronald Reagan in 1981.\n  In 2010, Bill served as the cochairman of Colorado Governor-elect \nJohn Hickenlooper's transition team, but his history of working across \nthe political divide reaches further into the past. Appointed to the \nU.S. Commission on Public Diplomacy by President George H.W. Bush in \n1990, Bill was reappointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. After 4 \nyears as the committee's vice chairman, President George W. Bush \nappointed Bill as chairman in 2008 following confirmation by the \nSenate, and he was reappointed by President Barack Obama in 2011. I \nthink all of us would agree there are not many public servants who are \nappointed over this many years--by Presidents of both political \nparties. But that is a testament to Bill and his leadership.\n  Bill serves as the civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army, having \nserved in this role for 25 years. Additionally, President George W. \nBush appointed him as U.S. Representative to the 56th General Assembly \nof the United Nations, and was chairman of the board of International \nFoundation for Electoral Systems from 2003 to 2009, currently serving \nas vice chairman of the board and executive committee chairman.\n  Despite all of this success, Bill's impact is better measured by \nlooking at the countless lives he has touched and improved. His \ncontributions to our country's Olympic athletes provide a great \nexample. He served twice as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, \nleading team delegations at the 1992 Olympic Winter Games in \nAlbertville, France, and the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. In \n1998, he again led the U.S. Team at the Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, \nJapan, and, in 2000, at the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Bill \nwas a member of the International Olympic Committee from 2000 to 2002. \nHe serves as president emeritus of the USOC and is chairman of the U.S. \nOlympic Foundation. Especially noteworthy, Bill was inducted into the \nColorado Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.\n  Bill Hybl's reach stretches far beyond sports, though--his \nphilanthropic accomplishments have forever changed the State of \nColorado. As chairman and CEO of El Pomar Foundation, he has overseen \none of the largest and oldest private foundations in the Intermountain \nWest. Since his arrival in\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\n1973, El Pomar has granted millions of dollars to worthwhile projects \nand continues to grant approximately $20 million annually. Bill has \nexpanded the general-purpose foundation, creating many programs that \nfocus on excellence in individual and organizational leadership. \nBecause of his service, communities across Colorado are more empowered \nto improve their quality of life. The fact that the Association of \nFundraising Professionals recognized El Pomar in 1998 as the National \nFoundation of the Year is a testament to Bill's strategic vision and \nleadership.\n  Bill is also vice chairman of the board of BROADMOOR Hotel, Inc--a \ntrue Colorado landmark--and is president of the Air Force Academy \nFoundation and the Hundred Club of Colorado Springs. In 2009, Bill \nreceived the Outward Bound Compass Award for a lifetime of outstanding \nservice to America's young people. And in 2005, Bill was reelected to \nthe Colorado College Board of Trustees and in 2003 named Citizen of the \nWest. Additionally, he serves on the boards of directors for Garden \nCity Company, in Garden City, KS; FirstBank Holding Company of Colorado \nin Denver, CO; and Mountain States Employers Council in Denver.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Bill and his wife Kathleen have two sons \nand six beautiful grandchildren.\n  Colorado is fortunate to be home to a citizen like Bill Hybl. I would \nlike to congratulate him for all of his accomplishments, thank him for \nhis endless service, and honor him on his 70th birthday. I look forward \nto many more years of Bill's leadership in the Centennial \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/16/senate-section/article/S5046-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on July 13, 2012, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing the \nSpeaker had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3902.
