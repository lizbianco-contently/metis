Mr. President, I rise today to speak about today's guest \nChaplain, the Reverend Dr. Jeffrey Carter of Manassas Church of the \nBrethren, located in Manassas, VA. I am pleased to welcome Dr. Carter, \nhis wife Kim, and their three young daughters--Anna, Grace, and Julie--\nto the U.S. Senate today.\n  Dr. Carter is a 1992 graduate of Bridgewater College, located in \nBridgewater, VA. He received his Master of Divinity from Bethany \nTheological Seminary in 1998, and his Doctor of Ministry from Princeton \nTheological Seminary in 2006. In 2003, at the age of 33, he was \nappointed senior pastor of Manassas Church of the Brethren. Since 2005, \nhe has also served as lead chaplain for the Prince William County, VA, \nFire and Rescue Squad. In addition to his duties with his home church, \nDr. Carter also serves as the Church of the Brethren's representative \nto the World Council of Churches, and is a member of the board of \ndirectors for the Brethren Housing Corporation.\n  Manassas Church of the Brethren was established in 1895, and has \nserved the greater Manassas community for the past 116 years. They \noffer a wide variety of fellowship opportunities and outreach \nministries to their large congregation and residents of the Manassas \ncommunity.\n  Through the dozens of missions and ministries at Manassas Church of \nthe Brethren, Dr. Carter has made a profound impact on the lives of \nmany members of my constituency. I am certain that he will continue to \nguide his congregation for many years to come, and I look forward to \nseeing the direction of Manassas Church of the Brethren under his \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2215-6", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, approximately 1 hour ago, I was at the White \nHouse with Speaker Boehner. We had made a joint statement to the press \nduring the nighttime there at the White House, and at that time I was \ncautiously optimistic that we could complete the work on the people's \nbusiness to fund the government until the end of this fiscal year--\nOctober 1. Now we are 38 hours away from this deadline of the \ngovernment shutting down, so it is clear from the math that in less \nthan 2 days a decision must be made as to whether the government closes \nor stays open, whether we put the American people first and reach an \nagreement, or have, as I will explain in a few minutes, issues having \nnothing to do with government funding cause the government to shut \ndown.\n  We met last night, the Speaker and I, with the President for quite a \nlong time, 1\\1/2\\ or 2 hours. The meeting was initially one where the \nPresident, the Vice President, Speaker Boehner, and myself were present \nto try to work through these issues. We then went into a meeting with \nour staffs to try to work through these issues. The numbers are \nbasically there. That is where we are. My staff, the President's staff, \nand the Speaker's staff worked through the night to try to come up with \nan appropriate way to end this impasse.\n  I repeat, the numbers are basically there, but I am not nearly as \noptimistic--and that is an understatement--as I was 11 hours ago. The \nnumbers are extremely close. Our differences are no longer over how \nmuch savings we get on government spending. The only thing--the only \nthing--holding up an agreement is ideology. I am sorry to say that my \nfriend, the Speaker, and the Republican leadership have drawn a line in \nthe sand not dealing with the deficit--which we know we have to deal \nwith and where we have made significant cuts--not with the numbers that \nwould fund the government to the end of this fiscal year. That is not \nthe issue. The issue is ideology, not numbers.\n  There are a number of issues, but the two main issues holding this \nmatter up are reproductive rights for women and clean air. These \nmatters have no place on the budget bill. This is a bill to keep the \ngovernment running with dollars, and they want to roll back the Clean \nAir Act. The bottom line is this: If we are going to sit down at the \nnegotiating table, as we have, and fund the government, it should be \nbased on government funding.\n  I know there are some rambunctious new Members of the House of \nRepresentatives over there, and there are probably some who have been \nthere a long time who are more senior and who believe, as Republicans, \nthis is their time to shine. But they should do that on a legislative \nmatter, not on a spending bill. They can send the stuff, and we will \nget to it when we can, to show we can get to things. We have done it on \nthis clean air bill and the very difficult issues dealing with 1099--a \ngovernment issue relating to the health care bill. It was tough, but we \ndid it. We had a bunch of votes yesterday on EPA funding. We can \nlegislate, and we can do that on issues that are difficult. We showed \nthat this week in the Senate. But no one can realistically think we can \nwalk out of a room and suddenly agree on or focus on an issue that has \nbeen around for four decades--this issue relating to women's choice. \nThis is a legislative matter. We can't solve in one night \na disagreement this country has been having for four decades. There are \nvery definite sides that have been taken.\n\n  I served in the House of Representatives with Henry Hyde, where this \nall got started. Henry Hyde was the man who started, more than anyone \nelse, the public debate on women's choice. He was dug in as to what he \nfelt was right; others disagreed with him. But the Hyde amendment \nprevailed, and we have been basically working off that for four \ndecades. For 40 years, we have been focused on that issue. We can't \nsolve in one night a disagreement this country has been having for four \ndecades. It is not realistic to shut down the government on a debate \ndealing with abortion. It is not realistic, and it is not fair to the \nAmerican people. We haven't solved the issue in 40 years, and we are \nnot going to solve it in the next 38 hours.\n  Now is the time to be realistic. We should not be distracted by \nideology. We have been distracted by ideology. This is a bill that \nfunds the government. It isn't a bill that should deal with changing \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's rules and regulations. That \nshould be done legislatively. We can't now, on a bill that focuses on \nthe spending of this country, suddenly decide there is going to be a \nbig breakthrough on one side or the other on abortion. It can't happen. \nIt won't happen.\n  Speaking of distractions, the House is now going to pass a short-term \nstopgap. It is a nonstarter over here. Doing that is a sure way to \nclose the government. There are no more short-term extensions unless it \nis a clean continuing resolution to allow us a few more days to work on \nmatters relating to funding the government. The President has told the \nSpeaker that, I have told the Speaker that, and Republicans in the \nSenate have told the Speaker that we can't pass another short-term CR. \nIt is not only bad policy, it is a fantasy. As I said last night, this \nis a nonstarter in the Senate. The President told the Speaker that last \nnight. He called and talked to him 20 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago, and \ntold him the same thing. I talked to the President at a quarter to 10, \nand he told me the same thing.\n  We have moved so far, and we have given everything we can give. The \nPresident is absolutely right, we can't keep funding this government \none paycheck to the next, one stopgap measure after another. The United \nStates of America, this great country of ours, shouldn't have to live \npaycheck to paycheck.\n  I repeat, this debate that is going on today deals with money; it \ndoesn't deal with ideological issues where both sides have drawn a line \nin the sand. If the House of Representatives wants to send us matters \nregarding Wall Street reform, we can debate them here. If they want to \nsend us measures dealing with health care, we can debate them here. If \nthey want to send us measures dealing with EPA, we can debate them \nhere, just as we did yesterday. If they want to send us something here \non title X, which is reproductive health for women, we can debate that \nissue. But it should not be on a stopgap funding measure. So if this \ngovernment shuts down--and it looks as if it is headed in that \ndirection--it is going to be based on my friends in the House of \nRepresentatives, the leadership over there, focusing on ideological \nmatters that have nothing to do with the funding of this government. I \nthink that is a sad day.\n  As a predecessor of my friend the Republican leader said many years \nago--the great Henry Clay--``All legislation is founded upon the \nprinciple of mutual concession.'' He was known as the ``great \ncompromiser,'' Henry Clay was. He served in this body and served three \nseparate times as Speaker of the House of Representatives. That is what \nhe said. Isn't this the time to do that? Remember the two words that \nare so important in what Henry Clay said: mutual concession. We have \ndone far more than anyone ever thought we would do, and we have done it \nbecause we believe this government should not shut down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2216-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my good friend mentioned Henry Clay. He \nwould approve very much of the bill the House will be sending over \nlater today. And the abortion provision my good friend refers to is one \nDemocratic leaders have previously supported. It is a measure that has \npreviously appeared in appropriations bills and a measure that has been \npreviously signed by the President. So obviously that is not what this \nmatter is about.\n  As the majority leader indicated, the talks are continuing. But two \npositions\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\nhave emerged that are very clear. Throughout this debate, Republicans \nhave consistently said that we prefer a bipartisan agreement that keeps \nthe government running and provides critical funding and certainty for \nour troops. This is exactly what we have been working toward all along, \nand that is exactly what the bill the House Republicans are expected to \npass today will do.\n  Importantly, this bill will also include a modest reduction in \nWashington spending--a reduction well within the range that even \nDemocratic leaders have described as reasonable.\n  In fact, the bill House Republicans will send over to the Senate \ntoday is nothing more than a smaller version of the larger bill that \nDemocrats say they want. So let's be specific, very specific.\n  The Obama administration and the Secretary of Defense have said they \nneed an annual defense bill. The House bill we will get today does \nthat. It passes the Defense appropriations bill. Senate Democrats have \nsaid they want the Government to keep running. The House bill we will \nget today does precisely that. Democratic leaders have identified a \nnumber of cuts they believe are reasonable. The spending cuts in the \nHouse bill we will get today go no farther than that. Democratic \nleaders have said they want no controversial policy riders. That is \nwhat we just heard our majority leader talking about. But the policy \nprovisions in the bill we will get today are provisions that members of \nthe Democratic leadership have already voted for and that the President \nhimself has previously signed into law. It will be pretty hard to argue \nthat is controversial.\n  Here is the bottom line: The bill does everything Democrats have \npreviously said they want. It cuts Washington spending by an amount \nthat Democratic leaders believe is reasonable. The policy prescriptions \nit contains have been previously agreed to by Democratic leaders and \nsigned by this President. Most important, this is the only proposal out \nthere that keeps the government open, the only one that is coming over \nfrom the House.\n  In other words, if a shutdown does occur, our Democratic friends have \nno one to blame but themselves because they have done nothing \nwhatsoever to prevent it, since they have produced no alternative to \nthe bill the House is sending over today. This is the only proposal \ncurrently on the table that will keep the government open.\n  There are two options at this point. Democrats can either take up and \npass this reasonable bill that falls well within the bounds of what \ntheir own leadership has defined as acceptable or shut down the \ngovernment. That is it, that is the choice. So rather than talking \nabout a shutdown, I hope our Democratic friends join us in actually \npreventing one. There is only one way to do that, by quickly passing \nthe House bill and sending it to the President for his signature before \ntomorrow night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2217-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              COLOMBIA FTA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the President will meet today with \nColombia President Juan Manuel Santos. We understand they will announce \nagreement on a long overdue free-trade agreement with this important \ntrading partner and our best ally in South America. Republicans have \nbeen urging the President to act on this and on other critical trade \ndeals for over 2 years.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that trade deals with \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea can provide up to 380,000 U.S. jobs. \nWe know this deal alone would create tens of thousands of new jobs here \nin this country. At a time when millions of Americans are out of work \nand businesses are looking for opportunities to hire, there was no \nexcuse to slow walk these deals.\n  We hope today's meeting marks a real step forward in concluding this \ntrade agreement with Colombia. We expect this announcement means the \nPresident will be submitting all three trade agreements--Korea, \nColombia, and Panama--in the very near future. We look forward to \nworking with him to clear them through the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2217-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership, as best they \ncan, going into greater detail on the mutual effort to avoid a \ngovernment shutdown. I know all Members are vitally interested in this, \nas is the American public. I do happen to agree--probably no surprise--\nwith the Republican leader in his description of the situation, \nespecially in regard to our national security, which I think is \nexceedingly important.\n  I have asked for this time now to discuss a related subject. Some may \nthink it is not related but I think it is. It is related to a \ngovernment--or an economic shutdown, if you will, on many businesses \nthroughout the country, that is already occurring. This is something we \nhear about from time to time from various industries or businesses or \noccupations--almost everybody up and down Main Street. I would describe \nit as a shutdown by regulation or almost strangulation by regulation. \nThat is what I wish to talk about for a moment.\n  I come to the floor to highlight another area where regulation is \nhaving a negative effect on business in my State and all across the \ncountry. To date, I have spoken about the impact of regulations on \nhealth care and on agriculture and on energy. Today I am here to talk \nabout the regulation of our financial sector. I want to emphasize I am \ntalking about the impact of regulation on our community banks, those \nbanks in each of our towns, often home owned and operated.\n  Our community banks share the common concern I have heard from \nbusinesses in all industries all across my State. The volume and pace \nof regulations that are coming out of Washington are unmanageable and \nthey add to the costs and divert resources that would otherwise be used \nto grow their businesses or serve their customers or help the economy \nin its recovery.\n  As I have noted in previous remarks, I was very encouraged that \nPresident Obama signed an Executive order. I credit him for that. He \ndirected the administration to review, to modify, to streamline, \nexpand, or repeal those significant regulatory actions that he called \nduplicative and unnecessary, overly burdensome, or that which would \nhave had significant impact on Americans. He even, in an offhand \nremark, said some of these regulations are actually stupid. I agree \nwith the President and I gave him credit for that.\n  I was originally encouraged by the President's commitment to a new \nregulatory strategy. But after reviewing the Executive order I was left \nwith some concerns. Here is why. The Executive order states:\n\n       In applying these principles, each agency is directed to \n     use the best available techniques to quantify anticipated \n     present and future benefits and costs as accurately as \n     possible.\n\n  Nobody could possibly disagree with that. It is a good statement.\n\n       Where appropriate and permitted by law, each agency may \n     consider (and discuss qualitatively)--\n\n  I am not sure if I understand that in very clear language, but at \nleast I have been trying to figure that out, along with a lot of the \npeople who are on the receiving end of regulations. Then this is the \npart which I defy anybody to comprehend. ``values that are difficult or \nimpossible to quantify, including equity, human dignity, fairness and \ndistributive impacts.''\n  As the Wall Street Journal captured in their response to the \nPresident's editorial, ``these amorphous concepts are\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\nnot measurable at all.'' How on Earth do you make such a determination? \nThis language is, in fact, if anybody could understand it, a very large \nloophole. Coupled with an exception for the independent agencies such \nas the FDIC and the EPA, and the subagencies and other regulatory \nagencies, it has the potential to result in no changes at all.\n  Here you have an Executive order but you also have an Executive order \nthat has a lot of loopholes in it. That is why I have introduced \nlegislation to put teeth into this Executive order. My bill is called \nthe Regulatory Responsibility For Our Economy Act, and it strengthens \nand codifies the President's order. Like the Executive order, my \nlegislation ensures that the regulators review, modify, streamline, \nexpand, or repeal the regulatory actions that are duplicative, \nunnecessary, overly burdensome, or would have significant impact on \nAmericans. But it requires that Federal regulations put forth do \nconsider the economic burden on American businesses, ensure stakeholder \ninput during the regulatory process, and promote innovation.\n  Today, 46 Members of this body have signed on as cosponsors. That is \na testament to the concerns that my colleagues are hearing from their \nconstituents about how the unrelenting tide of regulations now coming \nfrom Washington is harming their businesses and our economy. It could \nbe described, actually, as another government shutdown, as I have \nindicated, by strangulation.\n  Today I want to call attention to the impact of regulations on the \nfinancial services sector, in particular the impact on our community \nbanks. I might add, in discussing this before on agriculture, energy, \nand health care, we talked to the stakeholders involved in Kansas, the \npeople who are actually involved. It is their suggestions I am \nrepeating and that I have tried to encompass in my legislation.\n  The financial services sector of our economy is already the focus of \nsubstantial regulation. I think everybody understands that. We all \nsupport commonsense financial regulations. However, it is important \nthat financial regulations do not become undue burdens, especially on \nour community banks that are the backbone of Main Street and finance \nthe economic growth in our communities. While I appreciate that many of \nthe agencies with responsibility for regulating the industry are \nindependent of the executive branch, I am hopeful that these agencies \nare receptive to the President's effort.\n  While the economic crisis focused attention on the financial services \nindustry leading to the passage of the Dodd-Frank bill, our Nation's \ncommunity banks that are already shouldering an undue regulatory burden \nwill now bear a greater burden when the hundreds of regulations from \nthis law are implemented. Our Nation's community banks are often small \nbusinesses. On average a community bank has 37 employees and \napproximately $154 million in loans and other assets. The majority of \nbanks in Kansas have an average of fewer than 14 employees. However, \nthey currently comply with 1,700 pages of consumer regulations alone. \nThat is incredible. They must also comply with hundreds of additional \npages of regulations regarding lending practices and other banking \noperations.\n  According to a summary of the Dodd-Frank act by Davis Polk, this \nlegislation mandates that 11 different agencies now create at least 243 \nmore regulations; issue 67 one-time reports or studies and 22 new \nperiodic reports. Many of these new rules are required to be issued in \nthe next year or two, and financial regulatory agencies have the \ndiscretion to issue additional rules on top of those and those required \nunder Dodd-Frank.\n  This is incredible if not unbelievable. Regulators have already \nissued more than 1,400 pages of regulatory proposals. Up to 5,000 pages \nof regulations are expected.\n  Many will be proposed by a new bureaucracy that is created in the \nDodd-Frank act, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Remember \nthat name. The acronym is CFPB, and it will undoubtedly suffocate a lot \nof businesses. It will have broad authority to monitor, regulate, and \ndirect the activity of banks. These actions will create additional and \nsignificant compliance costs that will impact the ability of every bank \nto serve its community. These actions have real costs to banks.\n  According to recent testimony before the House Oversight and \nInvestigation Subcommittee, the CBO Director--the Congressional Budget \nOffice Director--Douglas Elmendorf, said the Dodd-Frank act is expected \nto impose nearly $27 billion in new private sector fees, assessments, \nand premiums. This amount includes more than $14 billion in new fees on \nbanks. Guess where that money is going to end up in regards to consumer \ncosts. Our community bankers and their customers are worried about the \nimpact of these new requirements. That has to be the understatement of \nmy remarks. They are frustrated, they are angry, they are upset.\n  Now, while not every regulation will apply to the community banks, \nthey tell me the rapid pace and volume of new regulations being put \nforth are placing a strain on many banks' compliance capabilities and \nare adding significantly to their operating costs. Many banks tell me \nthey are reevaluating whether they can afford to offer some products \nand services such as mortgage lending. Yes, you have that right. If you \nlive in a small community, and you go to your local bank and you would \nlike to get a loan in regards to financing a mortgage, sorry, they may \nbe out of the business.\n  It is important to understand that banks do not oppose commonsense \nregulations. They are necessary to ensure that banks are doing their \njobs and that consumers receive the proper information and disclosures \nthat are beneficial to them. The problem is that unlike bigger \nfinancial institutions, our community banks do not have a large staff \nof attorneys or compliance officers to help them navigate wave after \nwave of these new regulations.\n  By one estimate, for the typical small bank, more than one out of \nevery four dollars--one out of four--of operating expenses is used to \npay for the cost of complying with government regulations. With Dodd-\nFrank we can only expect that cost to go higher.\n  One community banker tells me they have five compliance officers out \nof a staff of less than 100 employees. In speaking with compliance \nofficers, they tell me regulations that are being put forth to \nimplement a range of new requirements are being written too quickly, \nwithout sufficient specifics and guidance for banks to implement as \nintended.\n  They point to regulations that are duplicative or contradictory but \nwhich they must comply with, even if the banker or consumer does not \nview the regulation as having any value or benefit to the consumer--I \nmight add, even if they can understand it.\n  Such compliance efforts cost time and money and it is vital that \nFederal regulators consider the total impact of all regulations, not \nmerely each regulation in isolation, and work to reduce unnecessary \nregulatory burdens on an already heavily regulated industry.\n  With these concerns in mind, I would like to call attention to \nseveral regulations that highlight the impact of an overly burdensome \nregulatory environment. I encourage regulators to join the President's \neffort to pursue solutions to regulations that make it difficult for \nour community banks to serve their customers, support businesses in \ntheir communities, and help grow our economy.\n  The Dodd-Frank act requires the Federal Reserve to issue a rule for \ndebit interchange fees. Basically, interchange fees are swipe fees that \na merchant bank pays to a customer's bank when the customer uses their \ndebit card. In December I joined a bipartisan group of Senators in \nwriting to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke expressing our \nconcerns with the interchange provision and to encourage the Federal \nReserve to ensure that our consumer interests are protected in rate \nstandards that are set.\n  Our letter outlines ``concerns with the consequences of replacing a \nmarket-based system for debit card acceptance with a government-\ncontrolled system,'' as well as concerns that the provision will make \nsmall banks and credit union debit cards more expensive for merchants \nto accept than those cards issued by larger banks, and it would likely \nput them at a disadvantage compared to the large banks that issue those \nother cards.\n  In addition, the rule does not consider all of the costs incurred by \na bank in actually providing the service,\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\nsuch as all the costs for fraud control and prevention, network \nprocessing fees, card production, and issuance costs, and fixed costs, \nincluding capital investments. These are all significant costs for many \nbanks and will be one of the factors they will have to look at when \nconsidering whether they even continue to offer any debit card service.\n  During debate on the debit interchange amendment, supporters \npresented it as a proconsumer provision, maintaining that the reduction \nin interchange fees would be passed on to the consumer. Yet there is \nnothing, nothing in this Dodd-Frank act that requires retailers to pass \non any savings from debit interchange fees to their customers. On the \ncontrary, the debit interchange rule will likely result in higher bank \nfees, a loss of reward programs, or banks may ultimately, as I have \nsaid, decide not to offer debit cards to their customers. Some steps \nare already being considered.\n  Higher fees or limited choices as a result of such government price \ncontrols does not benefit any consumer. That is why legislation I am \nsupporting calls for the Federal Reserve and other Federal financial \nregulators to slow down and fully study this issue, carefully evaluate \nthe 11,000 comments that were received on this proposed rule.\n  I am particularly concerned about the estimated costs of the debit \ninterchange rule for our community banks, which is not insignificant. \nSupporters of the interchange rule say our community banks will not be \nimpacted. Well, I beg to differ.\n  Consider what I am hearing from the community banks in my State of \nKansas. One community banker in a town of just 1,000, whose bank began \noffering debit cards a few years ago, tells me the interchange proposal \nwill cost his bank $19,000 a year. Two other banks that serve multiple \nrural communities will see increased costs per year of more than \n$46,000 and $100,000, respectively. Other banks, including banks in my \nState, estimate the cost to be in the millions. Ultimately, the loss of \nincome for banks will mean less capital available to lend to borrowers.\n  I also want to mention the concerns I am hearing about the patchwork \nof mortgage disclosure requirements. Taken together, existing \nregulations and anticipated regulations as a result of Dodd-Frank may \nwell have the effect of making it more difficult and costly to provide \nmortgages to qualified borrowers, reduce lending capacity, and may push \nsome lenders to simply stop offering mortgages.\n  One example is the SAFE Act. It creates a nationwide mortgaging \nlicensing system and registry for mortgage loan originators. This \nregistry is intended for use by regulators to identify mortgage brokers \nor lenders who seek to work in a State after being banned from working \nin a different State. That sounds all right. However, each mortgage \nloan originator will be required to register with a national registry, \nobtain a unique identification number, and submit fingerprints for the \nFBI to conduct a criminal background check.\n  So if you are in the business of trying to be a mortgage loan \noriginator, you are going to get fingerprinted. Our community bankers \ntell me their cost to meet the new requirements is roughly $1,000 to \n$2,000 per loan officer. I know that might not seem like a lot of money \nto Washington regulators, but it is a tidy sum in rural America.\n  The cost of compliance will take time and money away from the \nbusiness of lending and may ultimately be passed on to the consumer in \nthe form of higher prices for a mortgage loan. That is what will \nhappen.\n  Finally, I want to mention the recent guidance on the overdraft \npayment programs put forth by the FDIC. At some point most of us have \nhad experience with overdraft programs, perhaps when we forgot to \nbalance our checkbook. In the guidance, the FDIC stated:\n\n       The guidance focuses on automated overdraft programs and \n     encourages banks to offer less costly alternatives if, for \n     example, a borrower overdraws his or her account on more \n     than six occasions where a fee is charged in a rolling 12-\n     month period. Additionally, to avoid reputational and \n     other risks, the FDIC expects institutions to institute \n     appropriate daily limits on customer costs and ensure that \n     transactions are not processed in a manner designed to \n     maximize the cost to consumers.\n\n  So while banks offer overdraft protection programs now and take other \nsteps to aid customers in avoiding overdrafts, many are concerned that \nthis guidance put forth by the FDIC is overly prescriptive and goes \nfurther than amendments on overdrafts put forth by the Federal Reserve.\n  Further, banks note that the guidance seems to contradict the intent \nof the President's Executive order that requires agencies to propose or \nadopt regulations only upon a reasoned determination that its benefits \njustify its cost, recognizing that some benefits and costs are \ndifficult to quantify. Banks are concerned that the FDIC guidance is \nbased on outdated information and that the impact of the Federal \nReserve's rules on overdraft programs should be reviewed before moving \nforward with additional guidance in this area.\n  So while the FDIC is not subject to the Executive order, I certainly \nhope they would adopt the spirit of the order. In addition, when a \ncustomer has a pattern of excessive use of automated overdraft \nprograms, the FDIC states that ``(banks) should contact their customers \nabout a more appropriate and lower-cost alternative that better suits \ntheir needs.''\n  I can remember a bank scandal back in the House of Representatives. \nIf only that bank would have had this protection from the FDIC, none of \nthat scandal would have ever happened.\n  The FDIC recently provided additional clarification on this guidance \nthat provides some flexibility about how banks reach out to customers \nand permits them to contact customers by mail as well as in person and \nby telephone. However, the requirement that banks contact customers who \nincur six overdrafts in a rolling 12-month period remains a broad \noverreach of the FDIC's authority, putting the burden on the banks \nrather than the customer who ultimately bears the responsibility for \nensuring that they have sufficient funds in their account to cover \ntheir transactions.\n  In fact, one study shows that 77 percent of customers paid no \noverdraft fees in the previous 12 months. That same study also showed \nthat for those 21 percent of customers who paid an overdraft fee, 69 \npercent say they were glad the payment was covered.\n  Another survey found that 94 percent of those surveyed said they \nwould want a transaction to be covered by their banks even if it \nresulted in an overdraft fee. This guidance seems to be a clear example \nof where an agency is overreaching, with little evidence of the need \nfor or effectiveness of such additional guidance.\n  In closing, I thank, again, Obama for taking the step in the right \ndirection to review Federal regulations that place undue burdens or our \nNation's economic growth and recovery. I hope financial regulators will \njoin in this effort to examine rules and regulations that pose \nsignificant barriers to our small community banks and their ability to \nserve their customers and contribute to the growth of their \ncommunities.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, if another Senator wishes to speak, I \nwill be succinct. I will try to do mine in a less period of time. I \nthank the Chair for its courtesy.\n  I wish to speak on two subjects. First, there has been a good deal of \ndiscussion in Washington about making sure we continue to operate the \ngovernment over the weekend and on into next week while we get about \nthe important business of reducing our debt. Our national debt is an \nurgent problem. Members on both sides of the aisle understand this, and \nhave said this.\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\n  We have 64 Senators who have written the President to say we are \nready to go to work on reducing the debt on the whole budget. We have a \nproposal from Congressman Ryan. We have a proposal from the Bowles \ncommission. We are ready to go to work. The House of Representatives \nhas made a proposal to, for the time being, continue the government \nwhile we work on that, and that is eminently reasonable.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Wall Street \nJournal op-ed from April 4 by Gary Becker, George Shultz, and John \nTaylor that points out that the numbers in the House of Representatives \nproposal would have the Federal Government spend for the rest of the \nyear basically what we spent in 2008, plus an allowance for inflation. \nThere is no reason, the authors say, why government agencies, from \nTreasury and Commerce to the executive office of the President, cannot \nget by with the same amount of funding they spent in 2008 plus \nincreases for inflation. This would be a reasonable first step as we \nget to the larger issue of how we reduce the debt over a longer period.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 4, 2011]\n\n                     Time for a Budget Game-Changer\n\n       Assurance that current tax levels will remain in place \n     would provide an immediate stimulus.\n       House Republican budget planners are on the right track.\n\n        (By Gary S. Becker, George P. Shultz and John B. Taylor)\n\n       Wanted: A strategy for economic growth, full employment, \n     and deficit reduction--all without inflation. Experience \n     shows how to get there. Credible actions that reduce the \n     rapid growth of federal spending and debt will raise economic \n     growth and lower the unemployment rate. Higher private \n     investment, not more government purchases, is the surest way \n     to increase prosperity.\n       When private investment is high, unemployment is low. In \n     2006, investment--business fixed investment plus residential \n     investment--as a share of GDP was high, at 17%, and \n     unemployment was low, at 5%. By 2010 private investment as a \n     share of GDP was down to 12%, and unemployment was up to more \n     than 9%. In the year 2000, investment as a share of GDP was \n     17% while unemployment averaged around 4%. This is a regular \n     pattern.\n       In contrast, higher government spending is not associated \n     with lower unemployment. For example, when government \n     purchases of goods and services came down as a share of GDP \n     in the 1990s, unemployment didn't rise. In fact it fell, and \n     the higher level of government purchases as a share of GDP \n     since 2000 has clearly not been associated with lower \n     unemployment.\n       To the extent that government spending crowds out job-\n     creating private investment, it can actually worsen \n     unemployment. Indeed, extensive government efforts to \n     stimulate the economy and reduce joblessness by spending more \n     have failed to reduce joblessness.\n       Above all, the federal government needs a credible and \n     transparent budget strategy. It's time for a game-changer--a \n     budget action that will stop the recent discretionary \n     spending binge before it gets entrenched in government \n     agencies.\n       Second, we need to lay out a path for total federal \n     government spending growth for next year and later years that \n     will gradually bring spending into balance with the amount of \n     tax revenues generated in later years by the current tax \n     system. Assurance that the current tax system will remain in \n     place--pending genuine reform in corporate and personal \n     income taxes--will be an immediate stimulus.\n       All this must be accompanied by an accurate and simple \n     explanation of how the strategy will increase economic \n     growth, an explanation that will counteract scare stories and \n     also allow people outside of government to start making \n     plans, including business plans, to invest and hire. In this \n     respect the budget strategy should be seen in the context of \n     a larger pro-growth, pro-employment government reform \n     strategy.\n       We can see such a sensible budget strategy starting to \n     emerge. The first step of the strategy is largely being \n     addressed by the House budget plan for 2011, or H.R. 1. \n     Though voted down in its entirety by the Senate, it is now \n     being split up into ``continuing'' resolutions that add up to \n     the same spending levels.\n       To see how H.R. 1 works, note that discretionary \n     appropriations other than for defense and homeland security \n     were $460.1 billion in 2010, a sharp 22% increase over the \n     $378.4 billion a mere three years ago. H.R. 1 reverses this \n     bulge by bringing these appropriations to $394.5 billion, \n     which is 4% higher than in 2008. Spending growth is greatly \n     reduced under H.R. 1, but it is still enough to cover \n     inflation over those three years.\n       There is no reason why government agencies--from Treasury \n     and Commerce to the Executive Office of the President--cannot \n     get by with the same amount of funding they had in 2008 plus \n     increases for inflation. Anything less than H.R. 1 would not \n     represent a credible first step. Changes in budget authority \n     convert to government outlays slowly. According to the \n     Congressional Budget Office, outlays will only be $19 billion \n     less in 2011 with H.R. 1, meaning it would take spending to \n     24% of GDP in 2011 from 24.1% today.\n       If H.R. 1 is the first step of the strategy, then the \n     second step could come in the form of the budget resolution \n     for 2012 also coming out of the House. We do not know what \n     this will look like, but it is likely to entail a gradual \n     reduction in spending as a share of GDP that would, in a \n     reasonable number of years, lead to a balanced budget without \n     tax rate increases.\n       To make the path credible, the budget resolution should \n     include instructions to the appropriations subcommittees \n     elaborating changes in government programs that will make the \n     spending goals a reality. These instructions must include a \n     requirement for reforms of the Social Security and health-\n     care systems.\n       Health-care reform is particularly difficult politically, \n     although absolutely necessary to get long-term government \n     spending under control. This is not the place to go into \n     various ways to make the health-care delivery system cheaper \n     and at the same time much more effective in promoting health. \n     However, it is absolutely essential to make wholesale changes \n     in ObamaCare, and many of its approaches to health reform.\n       The nearby chart shows an example of a path that brings \n     total federal outlays relative to GDP back to the level of \n     2007--19.5%. One line shows outlays as a share of GDP under \n     the CBO baseline released on March 18. The other shows the \n     spending path starting with H.R. 1 in 2011. With H.R. 1 \n     federal outlays grow at 2.7% per year from 2010 to 2021 in \n     nominal terms, while nominal GDP is expected to grow by 4.6% \n     per year.\n       Faster GDP growth will bring a balanced budget more quickly \n     by increasing the growth of tax revenues. Critics will argue \n     that such a budget plan will decrease economic growth and job \n     creation. Some, such as economists at Goldman Sachs and \n     Moody's, have already said that H.R. 1 will lower economic \n     growth by as much as 2% this quarter and the next and cost \n     hundreds of thousands of jobs. But this is highly implausible \n     given the small size of the change in outlays in 2011 under \n     H.R. 1, as shown in the chart. The change in spending is not \n     abrupt, as they claim, but quite gradual.\n       Those who predict that a gradual and credible plan to lower \n     spending growth will reduce job creation disregard the \n     private investment benefits that come from reducing the \n     threats of higher taxes, higher interest rates and a fiscal \n     crisis. This is the same thinking used to claim that the \n     stimulus package worked. These economic models failed in the \n     1970s, failed in 2008, and they are still failing.\n       Control of federal spending and a strategy for ending the \n     deficit will provide assurance that tax rates will not rise--\n     pending tax reform--and that uncontrolled deficits will not \n     recur. This assurance must be the foundation of strategy for \n     a healthy economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2220-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2220-S2221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRIVATE SECTOR JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last month marked the 1-year \nanniversary of President Obama signing the health care bill into law. I \nbelieve it was an historic mistake. We have talked about the health \ncare law in a variety of ways. One thing we have said is that at a time \nwhen our country needs to make it easier and cheaper to create private \nsector jobs, the health care law makes it harder and more expensive to \ndo so. Someone might ask: How could that happen? This morning I wish to \nmention a few examples of how it actually is happening, how the health \ncare law actually is making it harder and more expensive to create \nprivate sector jobs.\n  Last September I met with about 35 chief executive officers of chain \nrestaurant companies. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the \nretail and hospitality industries are the largest employers in the \nUnited States, second only to the U.S. Government. Food services and \ndrinking places provide roughly 10 million jobs. Most of these are \nfirst-time job seekers and low-income employees--the young and the poor \ncompanies that provide a huge number of jobs to low-income Americans.\n  One of the chief executive officers I met with said his company had \nbeen operating with 90 employees on the average, and as a result of the \nhealth care law, their goal was to operate with 70 employees. That is \nfewer jobs. There were many other examples of that around the room.\n  Many of the attendees are on the National Council of Chain \nRestaurants. They have significant concerns about the law, and they \nprovided me with specific examples.\n  One restaurant chain based in Tennessee with worries about the law is \na\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\ncompany called Ruby Tuesday. Ruby Tuesday has 24,000 full-time \nemployees and 16,000 part-time employees.\n  According to Ruby Tuesday, the employer mandate will cost them \nroughly $47.5 million--$2000 penalty/per employee/minus the first 30 \nemployees--yet their annual net income last year was just over $45 \nmillion. In other words, the cost of the health care law to them equals \nthe entire profits of this multibillion dollar company. Ruby Tuesday \nsays as a result, it will have to reduce its workforce by 18 percent in \norder to hold their profits even. The company will increase the hours \nfor their full-time employees and reduce their overall workforce in \norder to reduce the number of people for which coverage would be \nrequired.\n  The problem we are talking about is that the new law requires \nemployers who don't provide acceptable coverage to pay a ``fair share'' \npenalty of $2,000 per full-time employee. A full-time employee is \ndefined as someone who works 30 hours a week instead of 40. We can see \nthat a company such as Ruby Tuesday, with that many employees, would \nhave a big cost, $47.5 million, which equaled its entire profits for \nthe year.\n  Another restaurant chain, White Castle, is also concerned. It said \nthat according to their internal estimates, the health care law's \nprovision imposing penalties for employer-sponsored health plans, whose \ncosts to the employee exceeds 9.5 percent of that employee's household \nincome, would be particularly punishing. In its present form this \nprovision alone would lead to an approximate increased cost of over 55 \npercent of what White Castle currently earns in net income. This \ndevastating impact would cut future expansion and job creation by at \nleast half. The impact would be predominantly felt in low-income areas \nwhere jobs are most needed.\n  A representative of the National Retail Federation testified in \nFebruary about another large chain quick service restaurant--QSR--and \nits potential job loss. This company preferred to remain anonymous, but \nthe chain estimates that the incremental cost to comply with the new \nlaw is $10 to $15,000 annually per affected restaurant which across the \nentire system could be $50 to $75 million in incremental costs a year. \nThis would wipe out one-third of that system's profits per year, \npotentially eliminating 10 percent of its stores, which means hundreds \nof restaurants and the potential elimination of 12,500 jobs.\n  There was another example, a large franchise system with multiple \ncasual dining restaurant concepts and projects.\n  They estimated the average cost per restaurant in their system of the \nnew health care law would be $237,000, which equates to a systemwide \ncost of providing health insurance benefits to full-time employees of \nalmost $806 million per year. If all of this chain's small business \nfranchisee owners elected to pay the employer penalty instead of \nproviding insurance, the cost would be reduced but to just over still \n$84,000 per restaurant or a savings of $286 million systemwide. So to \ncope with the increased costs of the health care law, the employers who \nare restaurant owners--and these are the largest employers in America, \nthey employ the most people in America except for the U.S. Government--\nare seeing their costs go up and, as a result, there are fewer jobs for \nAmericans.\n  Republicans believe it would be better to reduce health care costs \nstep by step so more people can afford to buy insurance instead of \nexpanding a system that costs too much, and we will continue to \nadvocate that position.\n  The important thing to remember about the law--we have heard it said \nit hurts Medicare, it adds regulations, raises taxes, and individual \npremiums are going up--is that it makes it harder and more difficult \nand more expensive to create private sector jobs at a time when our \ncountry should be dedicated to making it easier and cheaper to create \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2221-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2221-S2222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TAX SIMPLIFICATION\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Wyden-Coats-\nBegich bipartisan Tax Fairness Simplification Act. It is that time of \nthe year again, tax time. Across our Nation, small businesses and \nfamilies are struggling to unravel the annual nightmare of paperwork \nrequired to file their taxes. Across our Nation, small businesses and \nfamilies are struggling. My wife and I are small business owners so I \nespecially understand how burdensome and expensive the Tax Code and \nfiling process can be for folks at this time of year.\n  This process is costly and burdensome. The IRS estimates that \nAmericans spend 6.1 billion hours each year filling out tax forms and \nroughly $163 billion each year on tax compliance. Small businesses are \nthe engine and the backbone of our still recovering economy. We should \nallow them to spend more time doing what they do best--creating jobs \nand growing the economy--not filling out burdensome paperwork. This is \nwhy I have joined my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, Senators \nWyden and Coats, to introduce the bipartisan Tax Fairness and \nSimplification Act.\n  Tax reform has been a long priority of mine. I am happy to be moving \nforward on this important piece of legislation today. In a nutshell, \nour legislation simplifies the Tax Code and alleviates many of the \nburdensome paperwork and costly requirements that are bogging down \nAmerican families and businesses. Our legislation will allow most \ntaxpayers to file their taxes using a straightforward and shortened 1-\npage 1040 IRS form. This is an example of exactly what it would look \nlike. Also individuals and families will be able to request that the \nIRS prepare a tax return for them to review, modify, and sign.\n  The Wyden-Coats-Begich bill reduces the number of tax brackets for \nindividuals from six to three: 15 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. \nIt eliminates the alternative minimum tax which forces millions of \ntaxpayers to calculate their taxes twice and pay the higher amount. In \norder to make capital investments more cost effective for small \nbusiness owners, the Wyden-Coats-Begich bill will allow 95 percent of \nsmall businesses--those with gross receipts of up to a million \ndollars--to expense all equipment and inventory costs in a single year. \nThese changes may seem simple and commonsense, but they make a world of \ndifference to our middle-class families and small businesses.\n  Let's talk specifically about small businesses for a second, people \nwho are keeping our economy going, such as my friend John Brower from \nAnchorage. John owns and operates Alaska Laser Printing in Anchorage. \nJohn works tirelessly, 365 days a year, and is proud of the business he \nbuilt. When new technology is developing in the printing business, it \nis always bringing on needs for new equipment. This legislation would \nallow him to expense all those equipment costs and would truly make a \nworld of difference for John and save him thousands and thousands of \ndollars in taxes.\n  I am here to speak for the John Browers and the other small \nbusinesses all across Alaska and the country. My view is very simple: \nLet's quit giving tax breaks to multimillion-dollar corporations. Let's \nclose the corporate loopholes and help small businesses such as John \nBrower's.\n  Right now we are facing a $14.3 trillion deficit. We are hours away \nfrom a potential government shutdown rather than continuing on a path \ntoward long-term economic recovery.\n  Our new bill actually promotes economic growth because it allows \nbusinesses to spend more time growing and less time worrying about the \noverly burdensome tax system which we all know only enables tax \navoidance. As all of us around here know, tax avoidance means \noutsourcing jobs overseas. Instead, our legislation incentivizes and \nenables companies to invest in America rather than incentivizing them \nto invest overseas.\n  The legislation also promotes responsible retirement savings and \ninvestments by expanding tax-free savings opportunities.\n  The American Dream Account, whether it is for a new home, education \nfor your children, or health care, provides a unique opportunity to \ninvest in the American dream. Families and individuals alike can make \ncontributions to an account that functions much like\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\na retirement savings account, an RSA, to work toward purchasing their \nAmerican dream.\n  Right now the U.S. corporate income tax rate is the second highest in \nthe world. That puts American corporations at a competitive \ndisadvantage globally. To resolve that, the Wyden-Coats-Begich \nlegislation cuts the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 24 percent. \nThat means American corporations will pay a more competitive rate than \ncorporations based in trading partner countries such as Canada, \nGermany, and France.\n  To make the Tax Code fairer and reduce opportunities for individuals \nand businesses to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, the Wyden-\nCoats-Begich bill ends a number of specialized tax breaks that favor \none business sector or some special interest that has been fortunate to \nbe here lobbying in years past and getting their special deals, making \nsure everyone is treated fairly but ensuring we are competitive in the \nglobal economy in which we now compete.\n  Our legislation protects and extends important tax deductions for \nfamilies. The Wyden-Coats-Begich bill retains many of the most commonly \nclaimed individual tax credits and deductions, including deductions for \nmortgage interest and charitable contributions, credits for children \nand earned income. Preferences for the Armed Forces, veterans, and the \nelderly and the disabled will be retained, as will those that help \nAmericans pay for health care and higher education and save for \nretirement.\n  The Wyden-Coats-Begich bill also permanently extends the enhancements \nof the Child tax credit, the earned-income tax credit, and the \ndependent care credit. The legislation eliminates the current law \nphaseout of itemized deductions and personal exemptions, allowing all \ntaxpayers to benefit fully from their deductions and exemptions.\n  Finally, our legislation requires banks to identify all individuals \nwho benefit from foreign accounts by name and nationality and to \nwithhold 30 percent of all passive income, such as interest on capital \ngains, sent to any individual who disguises his or her identity.\n  Tax reform is a bipartisan issue, hands down. Republicans, Democrats, \nour President, the OMB Director, and many others all across this \ncountry have called for it. So let's do it. Let's stop punching holes \nin an outdated system and make real tax reform happen. Tax reform is \nabout creating jobs, growing the economy, and supporting our families \nand businesses for the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Alaska. I do \nnot know the particulars of his bill, but as I listened to his \ndescription of it, it is long overdue. Simplifying this Tax Code so the \naverage American believes it is fair and understandable is essential \nfor the integrity of our tax system.\n  I have always said there is one law we can pass which would result in \ntax simplification overnight, and that would be a requirement that \nevery Member of the Senate and House prepare and file their personal \nincome tax returns. It is a humbling experience. A few years ago, in \nSpringfield, IL, when my accountant passed away, I decided, as a lawyer \nand a Senator: I will do it myself. I spent the whole Sunday afternoon, \nand then Monday went begging for help. I thought to myself: Mine is not \nthat complicated. It should be a system that is much simpler and more \ndirect and fair.\n  I thank the Senator for stepping in to meet that challenge. The \nBowles-Simpson Commission talked about tax reform as one of the central \nelements to dealing with our deficit and expanding our economy. I think \nI might add to that: fairness in the way our taxes are treated. So I \nthank the Senator for his leadership on that issue.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2222-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2222-S2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are now in the countdown phase as to \nwhether this government of the United States of America--the most \nprosperous Nation in the world--is going to shut down, turn out the \nlights, close its doors, and walk away. That could happen tomorrow \nnight at midnight. If it does, it is an unmitigated disaster. There is \nno winner. No political party can claim they come out ahead in this \nexercise. It makes us all look bad--deservedly so.\n  So this morning I called into a local radio station in downstate \nIllinois, and the host said: You ought to hear the phone calls, \nSenator.\n  I said: I can guess what they are saying. What is wrong with those \npeople in Washington that they can't sit down and reach an agreement? \nThey are supposed to be our leaders. They are supposed to work out our \nproblems. They are not supposed to throw up their hands and throw a \ntantrum.\n  That is, frankly, what will happen if we close down this government. \nNow, I think there are ways for us to reach an agreement. There are \ncertain issues on which we all agree. Let me tell you what they are.\n  Our deficit and debt are serious national problems. They threaten our \nfuture, and they leave a legacy to our children and grandchildren we \ncannot defend. In order to reduce our deficit and our debt, we need to \nchange in Washington. We need to cut spending, we need to be honest \nabout it, and we need to tell the American people, whom we represent, \nwhat it means. Some of it will require sacrifice, but on both sides of \nthe aisle there is no argument over what I just said. We need to cut \nspending, and we need to reorder the priorities of government.\n  But there is something more we need to do, and I credit two Minnesota \nlegislators who wrote a letter to the New York Times a few weeks ago, \nwho, I thought, in a few words put it together. This Democrat and \nRepublican wrote in and said: We are facing a fiscal crisis in our \nState, and what we have discovered is, we can't tax our way out of it. \nWe can't cut our way out of it. We need to think our way out of it. We \nneed to find ways to deliver essential services to the American people \nin a more cost-efficient way. We need to stop the duplication, waste, \nand inefficiency that are clearly part of our government today.\n\n  So where are we? We are involved in negotiations, primarily between \nthe majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Speaker John Boehner of \nOhio. They are trying to work out an agreement so we can move forward \nand finish this year's funding. It is 6 months and a few days, but it \nis critically important we get it done. They are close. In fact, I \nwould say--and I just asked Senator Reid if this was a fair \nrepresentation--the dollar amount of this negotiation is all but \ncompleted. The dollar amount is all but completed, meaning that both \nsides have agreed how much we will cut spending for the remainder of \nthis year.\n  To give credit where it is due, to Speaker Boehner and the House \nRepublicans, there are significant cuts in their initiative in this \narea they can point to as part of the agreement. On the other side of \nthe ledger, I think at the end of the day we will be able to say, as \nDemocrats: Yes, we supported spending cuts, but we drew the line where \nwe thought it was important for the future of this country. We made \nsure the cuts were not too deep in job training programs for unemployed \nand new workers in America. We made certain the cuts were not too deep \nwhen it came to education, particularly for children from low- and \nmiddle-income families. We made certain the cuts were not too deep when \nit came to medical research and the basic competitive research \nnecessary for the American economy and businesses to expand--and a host \nof other things. But those three major areas of job creation, \neducation, and research we fought for, and at the end of the day I \nthink we can point with pride to the fact that most of those are going \nto be largely protected.\n  So we can both walk out of the room with some satisfaction that after \nall of this time, we have reached the point where the dollar amounts \nare in basic agreement--I am not going to say in total agreement but in \nbasic agreement.\n  So why am I not standing here saying with certainty that the \ngovernment will not shut down? Unfortunately, now the House Republicans \nhave decided this is no longer a battle over the\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\nbudget deficit; it is a battle over issues--issues that do not relate \ndirectly to the spending of our government or the size of our deficit.\n  One of the things they are insisting on is a group of riders that are \npart of H.R. 1, their budget bill, which restrict the authority of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency in Washington to deal with \nenvironmental issues.\n  I totally disagree with the House Republican position on this, and \nthey are insisting on it. I would commend to them to pick up that \nalways scintillating volume, the Congressional Record, from yesterday \nand read what happened on the Senate floor. Yesterday, on the Senate \nfloor the Democratic majority agreed with the Republican minority, and \nwe called four amendments on the EPA. In fact, we said to the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell: Write your own amendment. We will \ncall it to the floor, and we will vote on it. It was a sweeping \namendment which took the authority away from the EPA when it came to \ngreenhouse gas emissions. I think that is the wrong position, but \nSenator McConnell had his right to offer it.\n  He got 50 votes in favor, 50 votes against. It failed, but we had the \ndebate. We are not ducking this issue, I say to Speaker Boehner. We \nhave faced it. We have voted on it. This Chamber has spoken on that \nissue and had three other debates and votes yesterday on EPA. None of \nthose proposals got more than a dozen votes, but we have had the \ndebate. We are not running away from it.\n  So to insist now, as part of any budget agreement, we accept the \nHouse position on the EPA is to ignore the obvious. The Senate has \nspoken. The Senate has debated and voted, and it is clear where we \nstand.\n  The second issue Speaker Boehner insists has to be part of this \npackage is one that troubles me because it goes to the heart of some \nbasic health programs for people across America. It is the title X \nfamily planning program.\n  Speaker Boehner's approach would eliminate the entire title X family \nplanning program. How big an expense is this? Mr. President, it is $327 \nmillion.\n  Since 1970, title X funding has provided men and women in every State \nwith basic primary and secondary health care, including annual exams, \ncancer screenings, family planning, and testing and treatment for \nsexually transmitted infections. In 2009, title X-funded providers \nperformed 2.2 million pap tests, 2.3 million breast exams, and over 6 \nmillion tests for infections, including HIV. Title X services prevent \nnearly 1 million unintended, unplanned pregnancies each year, almost \nhalf of which would otherwise end up in an abortion.\n\n  Family planning programs such as title X not only give men and women \ncommand over their lives, they save us money. Every public dollar \ninvested in family planning saves us almost $4--$3.74 to be exact--in \nMedicaid-related expenses. If we ended title X, as Speaker Boehner and \nthe House Republicans insist, it would result in more unintended \npregnancies and, sadly, more abortions, and it would result in more \nthan 5 million women losing access to basic primary and preventive \nhealth care.\n  We are prepared to debate this. If the House Republican position is \nthat we need to close these clinics across America and we need to \neliminate access to basic primary health care to literally millions of \nwomen and men across America, I am ready for the debate. But to hold up \nthis budget negotiation, to insist that unless the House Republican \nposition of eliminating title X is accepted, we can't reach an \nagreement--we have to shut down the government? Does Speaker Boehner \nreally propose we shut down the government of the United States of \nAmerica unless we are willing to cut title X family planning programs \nand health clinics and close the doors of health clinics across \nAmerica? Is that what the last election was about? I don't think so. I \nthink the American people said in the last election: Get serious about \nthe deficit and start working together and stop your squabbling. Those \nwere the two basic messages I took out of it. Well, we are getting \nserious about the deficit because we are nearly in full agreement on \nthe dollar cuts necessary for the remainder of this year.\n  I don't remember the last election being a referendum on whether poor \npeople and children in America would have access to health care at \ntitle X clinics. H.R. 1 included an amendment from a Congressman from \nIndiana that barred Planned Parenthood from receiving any Federal \nfunding, including Medicaid reimbursements, CDC grants, and teen \npregnancy prevention program funding. Planned Parenthood health centers \nprovide comprehensive care to millions of low-income and uninsured \nindividuals each year. Forty-eight percent--1.4 million--of their \npatients are on Medicaid and would lose access to their primary care.\n  This provision is presented as a means to prevent Planned Parenthood \nfrom using Federal funds for abortion. However, Federal law already \nprohibits the use of Federal dollars for abortion--that is not the \nissue--except, under the Hyde amendment, which goes back decades now, \nin cases of rape, incest, or if the life of the mother is threatened by \nthe pregnancy.\n  Abortion counseling represents 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's \nservices. Yet this amendment, this rider from Congressman Pence, would \nignore that. Ninety percent of the care provided at Planned Parenthood \nis preventive care--cervical and breast cancer screening, family \nplanning, sex education, and the treatment of infection.\n  If this amendment were enacted, most of the 800 health centers in the \nUnited States and 23 centers in Illinois, including in my hometown of \nSpringfield, would be forced to close.\n  This prohibition on Planned Parenthood funding is a rider on the \nHouse budget bill that is now the stumbling block for an agreement on \ndeficit reduction for the remainder of the year and keeping the \ngovernment open. It is ridiculous that Planned Parenthood, which \nreceives title X funding, should be such a target and should be an \nobstacle to an agreement.\n  We understand the conscience clause restrictions that are in the law \nwhen it comes to the issue of abortion. That is not what this is about. \nThis is about family planning. And those of us who personally oppose \nabortion believe women should be given the information and opportunity \nto take care of themselves and make their own family decisions. That is \nwhat Planned Parenthood is about. This amendment would close down those \nclinics across America. I believe that is a move in the wrong \ndirection.\n  We can work together, and we should, to deal with this budget \ndeficit.\n  Paul Ryan is a Congressman from Janesville, WI. I know him. I like \nhim. We worked together for almost a year on the deficit commission. He \nis a bright, hard-working young man and chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee. He has proposed a plan for the budget for the next 5 to 10 \nyears. It is not a plan I agree with, but I respect the fact that he \nput the time in to prepare it. The reason I don't agree with it is \nthat, unlike the Bowles-Simpson commission, the budget plan Congressman \nRyan has proposed does not really deal in a comprehensive and fair \nfashion with the challenge of the deficit. Here is what I think and the \ncommission believed: If we are serious about the deficit, we need to \nput everything on the table--everything.\n  What Congressman Ryan has done on the Republican side is to say we \nare not going to put on the table any savings from the Pentagon over \nthe next 10 years. That is hard to imagine--$500 billion-plus a year we \nspend at the Pentagon and no savings? While we are cutting programs in \nevery direction, we can't find a way to protect our men and women in \nuniform, keep America safe and secure, and eliminate the obvious waste \nof money that goes on with much of the contracting in the Pentagon? Of \ncourse we can. I am sorry Congressman Ryan doesn't see that. I do, and \nI believe it should be part of the conversation.\n  Secondly, there is no suggestion of any revenue at all as part of the \nsolution. In fact, Congressman Ryan goes in the opposite direction and \ncontinues the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. If we are \nworried about explaining to our children and grandchildren how we can \nleave them this debt, how can we explain Congressman Ryan's position \nthat would have us borrow over $1 trillion over the next 10 years to \ngive tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America? How can we explain \nto our children that we are going to go to China to borrow money to \ngive tax\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\ncuts to wealthy people in America as we cut our deficit? That is his \napproach. I don't think it is complete and balanced.\n  There is a better way. We need to look back to the Bowles-Simpson \ncommission, the deficit commission, and we need to move forward, after \nwe finish this debate on the budget for the rest of the year, in a \ncomprehensive and bipartisan fashion.\n  For months--literally for months--I have been engaged in a bipartisan \neffort with some colleagues in the Senate. We are trying to come up \nwith something. I don't think everyone will applaud it. I know some of \nmy colleagues will hate it. But it is going to be an honest approach to \ndealing with the deficit for the next 10 years. It is going to have the \nsame Bowles-Simpson goals of $4 trillion in deficit reduction and will \ninclude all of the major elements of our government in the \nconversation. I think that is the only way to honestly approach this. \nWe can reach that debate once we get this immediate problem resolved.\n  So the point I wish to close with is this: We are at a moment here \nwhere we can resolve this issue, keep our government open, and move \ninto the larger debate about our deficit in the years to come. It is \nmorally a historically imperative debate, but in order to get beyond \nit, I hope Speaker John Boehner, whom I respect as well, will accept \nthe obvious. His riders on the Environmental Protection Agency were \ndebated and voted on in principle already in the Senate yesterday. It \nhas happened. We are not avoiding it. Second, their rider relating to \nzeroing out funding for Planned Parenthood under title X funding is one \nwe will take up at some point. We are not running away from it. But it \nis one that shouldn't stop the function of this government. It would be \nimpossible to defend closing down our government, and all of the \nhardship that would follow, over that one rider--or two riders--they \nare insisting on.\n  Let's move toward reducing the deficit, but let's also reduce the \npolitical rancor. Let's put some of these issues, which have been \naround for decades, off to another day. Let's make sure we consider \nthem--and we will--but let's move forward now to keep this government \nopen. Let the American people at the end of this week look at us and \nsay: In the end, they got it right. We didn't like the way they reached \nthis point, but they didn't do the irresponsible thing and walk away \nfrom their responsibilities. They accepted their duties, they kept the \ngovernment functioning, and now they can roll up their sleeves and deal \nhonestly with this deficit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to describe to the \nAmerican people and actually Members of both bodies of Congress what is \ngoing to happen to our troops and their families if the collapse of the \nbudget negotiations forces the government to shut down. We look at \ncharts and graphs and numbers, but let's talk about the reality.\n  While I am sure many understand that most government services will \nhalt, it is also important to understand that some government \noperations will not shut down. In particular, our men and women on \nActive Duty and in the National Guard and Reserves will continue to \nserve, but they will do so without pay. At a time when we ask them to \nfight two wars, to help stay the slaughter in Libya, and to keep peace \naround the world, another burden is going to be added to their \nshoulders: They are going to be asked to do it without a paycheck.\n  Some of those in our Armed Forces--many of them--do not have savings \nto fall back on in hard times. Many family members are overseas \nfighting for America while their families are living back here. They \nare living paycheck to paycheck to pay for their groceries, to pay the \ncar payments or the bills for a sick child or rent or a mortgage, while \nthe other member of the family, the one who earns the paycheck, is over \nfacing the possibility of dying on the field of battle. And now we tell \nthem: Oh, stay right out there and fight. By golly, we are proud of you \nfor fighting. Sorry we can't pay you. Because Members of Congress and \nthe White House can't come together and deal, we can't pay you.\n  You and your family may not be able to buy groceries, or your child \nmay not get the medical care needed, but, boy, are we proud of you; if \nyou get killed, we will give you a medal.\n  Come on. Like so many Americans, some of those who serve in the \nmilitary live paycheck to paycheck. They depend on their pay each month \nto put food on the table and keep a roof over their families' heads. \nCertainly, mortgage lenders are not known for accepting excuses when \nthe monthly payments come due. But excuses are all that some Members of \nCongress can offer for why they will not come to the table and make \nsure our men and women in uniform get the pay they have earned.\n  This is not bumper sticker sloganeering government. This is what \nhappens. It is so easy for people to stand up and sanctimoniously state \nthat we are doing this for the good of the country. You are doing it \nand you are harming the families of our men and women in harm's way.\n  It is especially disturbing that the hard times that now are in \nprospect for our troops have been completely avoidable. The possibility \nof a government shutdown is very real because a relative few are \nwilling to play politics and brinkmanship at a time when the public \nwants basic, unadorned statesmen. They want Republicans and Democrats \nto act as though they also have a stake in the course of our \ngovernment. The American people want Congress to do its job, and that \nis certainly not too much to ask. Those who are insisting on their way \nor no way should pause to reflect on what their intransigence means to \nour troops and their families and, in fact, to every American.\n  The decision to put politics ahead of the American people is reckless \nand imposes real hardship on real people. It is crueler still knowing \nthat some of our troops, already facing fears of death or injury and \nsleepless nights in forward operating bases, must now add paying the \nelectric bill and feeding their families to their list of daily \nworries.\n  I have been with some of those troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. They \nhave enough on their minds. They have enough they face every single \nhour of every single day--especially every single night. They should \nnot have the added worry of whether their families will be able to pay \ntheir bills.\n  Naturally, as cochair of the National Guard caucus, I worry \nespecially for the Vermont National Guard troops who are currently \nforward deployed to locations throughout the world. Many of them come \nfrom our small towns and cities in Vermont and they face these very \nfears.\n  In shutting down the government, an ideologically motivated faction \nin Congress is willing to breach our most fundamental pact with these \nmen and women. We have always said, ``protect our Nation overseas, and \nwe will protect your loved ones at home.'' Who can justify violating \nthat pact with the men and women in uniform?\n  Some in Congress are already seeking cover, claiming they have put \nforward plans to fund the Pentagon and our troops. But, of course, even \nthese transparent political ploys would not pay many of our \nintelligence personnel, our brave and dedicated forward deployed \nconsular staff and officers and others--many of whom work side by side \nwith our troops. Not to mention the vast number of individuals working \nin communities across the Nation to support our overseas operations. \nEvery one of these dedicated public servants and every one of our \ntroops deserves to be paid for a day's work. Our troops, their \nfamilies, and those supporting them have enough to worry about without \nneedlessly being pushed to the brink of a costly government shutdown.\n  I hope that, as we sit here in our plush offices, with our staff and \neverything we ever want, being well paid as Members of Congress, we let \nthe reality sink in. The distinguished Presiding\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\nOfficer has spoken about this many times. The reality is that men and \nwomen--the families throughout our country--are being severely hurt. \nLet's not forget that.\n  Mr. President, we are seeing some in the other body, reacting to the \nire of a minority of vocal, anti-government extremists who make no \nsecret of their desire to shut down the government even while \ncomplaining that the government is not doing enough for them, proposing \nreckless cuts in programs that are vital to job creation and to \nnational security.\n  Many in the other party are masters at blaming others for a budget \ndeficit and debt they created during the last administration--self-\nproclaimed fiscal conservatives who, in a few short years, racked up a \ntrillion dollar deficit by borrowing the money for two wars, something \nthat was never done before in the history of this country. Their idea \nwas to cut taxes for millionaires, cut taxes for companies that ship \njobs overseas, cut corporate taxes, and borrow the money to pay for the \nwars while causing the debt to skyrocket. They burned through the \nClinton era surpluses and embarked on a massive borrowing binge--and \nthey think they can lecture us on fiscal conservatism.\n  Any mention of the consequences of what is being proposed is \ncarefully avoided, but the American people should know the facts.\n  There are many examples. The catastrophic earthquake and tsunami and \nthe nuclear crisis in Japan, as well as the popular uprisings and \nviolence in North Africa and the Middle East, demonstrate once again \nthe essential role that our Embassies and consulates and our foreign \nassistance programs play in protecting the safety and security of \nAmerican citizens and our allies.\n  Our Republican friends have been urging drastic cuts to our \ninternational operations and programs, even though they, in total, \ncomprise a mere 1 percent of the Federal budget--1 percent--and have no \nappreciable impact on the deficit.\n  Yet when a natural or manmade disaster occurs overseas and Americans \nare affected or an American is arrested and locked in a foreign jail, \nthose same critics of these programs immediately expect the State \nDepartment and the U.S. Agency for International Development to leap \ninto action.\n  In Egypt alone, at least 75,000 Americans were living, working and \nstudying when that country erupted in civic unrest and airports and \ntrain stations were jammed with throngs of frantic people trying to \nleave the country. Thousands of Americans turned to the U.S. Embassy in \nCairo. Our consular officers worked around the clock to help them, \nincluding a group of Vermont students, one of whom had lost his \npassport.\n  Just last week, another Vermont student was released after 2 weeks in \na Syrian jail, thanks to the persistent diplomacy of U.S. Ambassador \nRobert Ford and other U.S. Embassy officials, as well as the Syrian \nAmbassador to the United States, Imad Moustapha, who helped convince \nhis government that a mistake had been made. My office worked closely \nwith them, as is customary when a constituent is in trouble in a \nforeign land.\n  As every Member of Congress knows, there are countless examples such \nas these, involving Americans from every State, which are not reported \nin the press.\n  As the international affairs budget faces deep cuts in fiscal year \n2011 and in the future, it is important to be reminded of the \ninvaluable assistance provided by the State Department and USAID to \nAmerican citizens abroad, their families in the United States, and \nothers impacted by foreign crises.\n  It is also important to be reminded that Members of Congress and the \nAmerican people cannot have it both ways. You cannot on the one hand \nsupport drastic budget cuts, and at the same time expect the agencies \nthat are losing personnel and resources to be able to respond as needed \nto help Americans when disaster strikes.\n  Today the crushing demands on the State Department for American \ncitizen services are unprecedented. In the past month alone, the \nDepartment has issued travel warnings and alerts related to political \nunrest or natural disasters in six countries. Americans rely on their \nState Department for current, accurate travel information.\n  Since the earthquake and tsunami, U.S. consular officers in Japan and \nWashington have worked ceaselessly to assist Americans in Japan, and \nthe U.S. Embassy in Tokyo deployed teams to the Tohoku region to locate \nAmerican citizens and help them find transportation away from the \ndevastated areas. USAID sent search and rescue teams and emergency \nresponse experts to Japan.\n  They were doing the same thing a little over 1 year ago in Haiti, \nafter the catastrophic earthquake there.\n  As much of the world's attention has shifted to Libya, the State \nDepartment continues to closely monitor the situation in Japan, \nincluding the impact of the damage to the nuclear powerplant, and to \nprovide updated detailed travel warnings and information for Americans \nconsidering travel to Japan.\n  Throughout North Africa and the Middle East, to prevent chaos and \nsuffering at borders and surrounding areas, the State Department and \nthe USAID have provided food, water, and other humanitarian aid to \nrefugees and internally displaced persons.\n  It is regrettable that despite these realities, so many in Congress \nsupport reckless cuts in operations for the State Department and USAID. \nIt makes no sense to wait until these agencies can no longer function \neffectively before we recognize that we cannot ignore events beyond our \nborders, and that the services Americans expect from their government \ncost money. In fact, the cost of everything--fuel, transport, rent, \ncommunications, and security--is going up, while budgets are being cut.\n  An unfortunate trend is taking hold here. Demand cuts in spending and \nin the taxes to pay for it, while expecting that it will not affect the \ngovernment services you take for granted.\n  The world is a dangerous place and unanticipated disasters of every \nkind are occurring with remarkable frequency. American citizens are \nspread far and wide around the globe, and they rely on the State \nDepartment and USAID to protect their livelihoods and their security \nevery day. For that, the people who serve in these agencies deserve our \nthanks and our support.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2225-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2225-S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to speak this afternoon about \nan issue that I believe is of paramount importance to our efforts to \nrestore America's economic vitality and to control our debt and our \ndeficit. I would like to talk about jobs.\n  I wish to begin, however, by telling you a little bit about my home \nState of North Dakota. That is because today, while much of the Nation \nis greatly challenged by recession and joblessness, North Dakota is \nstrong--arguably the strongest we have been at any time in our history. \nThe reason is jobs.\n  Last week, we learned that North Dakota--at 3.7 percent--once again \nhas the lowest unemployment rate in the Nation, a distinction we have \nheld since June of 2008. Nationally, the picture is much different. As \nI speak, nearly 14 million Americans are still out of work, and the \nrate of unemployment is hovering at nearly 9 percent, where it has been \nfor many months. Another 8 million Americans are underemployed, working \npart-time because their hours have been cut or they haven't been able \nto find a full-time job. Sadly, 1 million more have stopped looking.\n  Make no mistake, America has a budget problem because of too much \nspending but also because America has a jobs problem. I ask you: How do \nwe generate revenues to help balance our budget, pay down debt, and \nprovide the essential services people need without raising taxes? Jobs. \nHow do we empower people to access affordable health insurance and \nquality health care without intrusive government programs? Again, jobs. \nHow do we help secure Social Security and Medicare for our seniors and \nfuture generations? Jobs.\n  If we put 10 million of those 14 million unemployed workers back on \nthe job, at the average national wage of about $45,000, it would \ngenerate more than $50 billion in additional revenues\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\nfor the Social Security trust fund and an additional $13 billion for \nMedicare every year. Obviously, that would make a huge difference for \nboth those programs.\n  Clearly, to fully address our current economic predicament, we need \nto create jobs and lots of them. Those jobs will be created by the \nprivate sector--not by government, by the private sector. But to help \nour entrepreneurs and businesses create them, we must build the best \nbusiness climate possible.\n  Ten years ago, in North Dakota, we set a course to do that. Beginning \nin 2001, when I first took office as Governor of North Dakota, we made \nconscious policy decisions that would, over time, grow and diversify \nour economy and create thousands of jobs for our citizens. First, we \nset out to build the best business climate possible, forging a legal, \ntax, and regulatory climate that would attract investment and stimulate \ninnovation.\n  Second, we developed a roadmap for success--an economic development \nstrategic plan that targeted industries where North Dakota holds \nnatural advantages owing to our resources and our people.\n  As part of our larger strategy, we also developed a comprehensive \nenergy policy, called Empower North Dakota, which worked aggressively \nto develop all of our State's natural resources and energy resources, \nboth traditional and renewable. We even established a North Dakota \nTrade Office, a public sector-private sector partnership that helps \nmarket North Dakota products and services around the world to bring new \ndollars into our State.\n  As a result of these efforts, between 2000 and 2009, North Dakota's \neconomy grew at an annual average GDP growth rate of 6.4 percent, so \nthat by the end of the decade we had grown by 75 percent. That compares \nto a national growth rate over the same time period of 41 percent.\n  All that work to cultivate overseas markets worked too. Our exports \nof farm machinery, aircraft parts, biotech products, and other North \nDakota goods grew by more than 300 percent in 10 years. That compares \nto a national growth rate of just over 60 percent. As a result, we \nbalanced our budget year in and year out. Today, we have no general \nobligation debt, we have a substantial surplus, and strong reserves to \nsecure our economic future.\n  Furthermore, to get there, we not only held the line on taxes, but we \nreduced them. We reduced property tax and we reduced income tax. Over \nthe decade, we generated nearly 15 percent growth in total employment, \nencompassing almost every sector of our economy and every region of our \nState. At the same time, we boosted per capita income from 84 percent \nof the national average in 2000, well below the national average, and \ntoday we are above the national average--at 103 percent--in per capita \nincome. We have moved up from 37th among all the States to 17th in \nterms of our ranking among the 50 States.\n  The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, the New York Times, USA Today, the \nEconomist, Forbes, Money magazine, even the London Times, all have \nwritten about North Dakota's progress. Joel Kotkin, in a recent Wall \nStreet Journal piece, called North Dakota's approach ``sensible \nthinking'' about the economy. Last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nranked North Dakota as No. 1 among all 50 States as the Nation's top \noverall economic growth performer and job creator and not for the year \nbut for the decade.\n  The things we did in North Dakota are not unique to our State. The \nprinciples we used are based on common sense and a belief that the \nAmerican economy is the engine that drives the car. We can create jobs \nand lift our Nation out of the financial quandary we are in if we have \nthe will to act and if we focus tirelessly on the kinds of things that \ncreate jobs and opportunity for our people.\n  To do that, I would like to propose a three-part strategy to get \nAmerica working again. First, we need to create a legal tax and \nregulatory climate that gets business investment off the sidelines and \ngets people back to work. Second, we need to rein in spending and \ncontrol our debt and deficit. Third, we need a comprehensive, progrowth \nenergy policy to fuel our economy, reduce our dependence on foreign \nenergy, and create good jobs for American workers.\n  Let's go through each of these very straightforward recommendations, \nstarting with the need to create a strong business climate for America \nwith the kind of legal tax and regulatory certainty that investors need \nto create jobs. That means passing legislation that will eliminate or \nmodify unwarranted or misguided regulations that are impeding business \ninvestment and stifling innovation in our country.\n  That effort is already underway in the Senate. Senator Pat Roberts of \nKansas has offered a bill called the Regulatory Responsibility for Our \nEconomy Act, which I am proud to be a cosponsor of. This bill will give \nthe force of law to a Presidential Executive order issued earlier this \nyear that proposes to review ``rules that may be outmoded, ineffective, \ninsufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, \nexpand or repeal them,'' in some cases.\n  If passed, our bill will make sure we will take a clear-eyed look at \nthe rules and help restore regulatory certainty to the markets.\n  When we talk about unwarranted laws and regulations, however, we \ndon't need to look too far into the past; we need only look to recently \nenacted laws that impede job creation and sap economic vitality.\n  Last year's Federal health care bill, for example, included a 1099 \nreporting provision that introduced a new level of bureaucracy and \nexpense for America's nearly 28 million small businesses--the very \nengines of job creation in this country. Small businesses have created \n64 percent of all the new jobs in this country over the past 15 years, \nand they account for more than 97 percent of all employers.\n  If we expect them to create jobs and get our economic engine going \nagain, we need to reduce their regulatory burden, not bury them under \nburdensome new mandates such as the 1099 reform. That is why I and a \nbipartisan group of Senators, led by Mike Johanns, signed on to a bill \nthat just this week eliminated this onerous provision in last year's \nhealth care law and sent it off to the President for signature. I wish \nto commend my good friend, Senator Johanns, for his leadership and his \nhard work on this important issue.\n\n  But that is not the only feature of last year's health care bill that \nis undermining our business climate, driving up health care costs, and \nlimiting choice for consumers. Punitive lawsuits and defensive medicine \nare inflating the cost of health care for American consumers by as much \nas $100 billion every year. Yet the health care bill that is now being \nimplemented across our country doesn't reduce these costs. We need tort \nreform that will help make health care more available and reduce costs.\n  Similarly, we need to expand competition among health insurance \ncompanies. More competition will give consumers more choice and expand \nthe pool of the insured, thus creating further downward pressure on the \ncost of premiums. Just as important, by reducing health care costs and \nthe regulatory burden on American businesses, we can help them reduce \ncosts and do what they do best--create jobs.\n  Competition works to our advantage not only in markets at home but in \nglobal markets as well. Another way to strengthen our economy and get \njob creation going again is by promoting more international trade. \nSmart trade agreements can restore America's competitive edge, create \nmore income for American citizens, more opportunities for American \nentrepreneurs, and more foreign dollars to help balance our trade \ndeficit and our budget.\n  They can also help us turn around our trade imbalances with countries \nsuch as China, South Korea, and the European Union. We have \nmultibillion dollar trade deficits with all of them--$23 billion with \nChina in January alone.\n  We can start the process of turning these deficits around by \nratifying impending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and \nPanama that have been languishing for 3 years.\n  Our trade imbalance with South Korea alone last year was $10 billion, \nbut the agreement awaiting approval right now could create up to \n250,000 American jobs. On the other hand, if we fail to act, we stand \nto lose 380,000 jobs to the European Union and Canada, which have \nalready completed\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\ntheir own trade agreements with those countries.\n  With bipartisan support for these agreements, there is no reason for \nfurther delay. We need to act.\n  Empowering American businesses and entrepreneurs to do business \naround the world is just common sense, and that common sense is \nprecisely what we need to apply to all our Nation's challenges. I can \ngive you a good example in my home State of North Dakota. Right now, we \nare facing serious flooding in the Red River Valley, and for some time \nwe have been working to fight chronic annual flooding in the Red River \nValley, which includes the city of Fargo, one of our region's most \ndynamic economic engines.\n  Part of government's role in creating private investment and economic \ndevelopment is securing and protecting infrastructure so businesses can \nthrive. In the case of Fargo and the Valley, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency--FEMA--has found it necessary to buy out houses in \nthat area because it is more cost effective than protecting them year \nin and year out.\n  When the Agency buys out a property, however, it has a hard-and-fast \nrule prohibiting building structures on that property--even flood \nmitigation structures--to prevent development that might require future \nprotection from flooding. It is a reasonable ban in some, maybe in \nmany, cases but certainly not in all.\n  As a consequence of the rule, every year the Federal Government helps \nto pay to build temporary levees to protect homes along the Red River, \nand every year we are compelled to tear those levees down again after \nthe flood, at great expense to the government and, ultimately, of \ncourse, great expense to the taxpayer. Everyone knows that permanent \ndikes would clearly be more cost effective and save money for the \nlocal, State, and Federal Government. Residents know it, FEMA knows it, \nlocal officials know it. But under current law, there is nothing they \ncan do about it.\n  That is why I will be introducing legislation called the FEMA Common \nSense and Cost-Effectiveness Act of 2011, to give the Agency the \nflexibility it needs to make commonsense decisions in these cases. \nBuilding those levees once and leaving them in place will provide \nbetter flood protection for people and for property, better fiscal \nstewardship, and save taxpayer dollars.\n  That is important. Because good fiscal stewardship is now a matter of \npressing, decisive consequence for America's future. That is why the \nsecond thing we need to do, of no less importance than building a good \nbusiness climate, is to reduce spending.\n  We need to control spending by the Federal Government. Here, the \nnumbers speak more clearly than words. Revenues this year are projected \nto be--revenues, now--$2.2 trillion. At the same time, current spending \nby the Federal Government is more than $3.7 trillion, leaving a deficit \nof $1.5 to $1.6 trillion.\n\n  To meet that shortfall, we are borrowing 40 cents of every single \ndollar we spend, and our debt is growing at the rate of $4 billion a \nday. Every dollar used to service the national debt is a dollar that \nwill not be used to build America's infrastructure, that will not be \nused to keep Social Security solvent, that will not be used to reduce \ntaxes on American businesses so they can create jobs and raise the \nstandard of living for American workers. That is why I and 63 other \nSenators--32 Republicans and 32 Democrats--sent a letter to President \nBarack Obama earlier this month urging him to show leadership in those \nefforts to achieve comprehensive deficit reduction.\n  It is also why I and 46 other U.S. Senators announced last week that \nwe were cosponsoring a bill to create a balanced budget amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution. I thank our leader, Senator McConnell, for \nleading that effort. Nearly all States have been bound for years by a \nconstitutional provision to keep spending within their means. This \namendment requires that the Federal Government do no less. It would cap \nspending and balance our budget, but it also allows an appropriate \nexception for times of war. At the same time, it provides a \ntransitional pathway to implement the law and protect programs such as \nSocial Security and Medicare for our seniors and future generations of \nAmericans.\n  To put this into perspective, the cost of serving America's debt over \nthe next 10 years under the President's proposed budget--$992 billion--\nis more than the entire Social Security deficit for the decade, which \nis about $600 billion. In fact, fixing our debt and deficit involves \nnot only setting priorities and cutting discretionary spending, which \nwe are already working hard to do and we need to work hard to do, but \nalso addressing the three entitlement programs: Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid, which account for more than 60 percent of \nFederal spending. We need to undertake a bipartisan effort to reform \nthese important programs in a way that safeguards our seniors and other \nvulnerable individuals now while protecting the solvency of these \nprograms for generations to come. We need our President to engage with \nus in this process. We can do it, we must do it, and we need to start \nnow.\n  My third recommendation is that we begin the process of building a \ncomprehensive energy policy for the Nation, an ``empower America'' \nplan, if you will, that promotes the development of all of our Nation's \nvast energy resources, both traditional and renewable. Creating a \ncomprehensive energy policy is especially important because our entire \ncountry--our entire economy and consequently job growth--depends on \naffordable and abundant energy.\n  A few weeks ago, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce released a study \nidentifying 351 stalled energy projects nationwide that are costing the \nAmerican economy $1.1 trillion in lost economic impact and, more \nimportantly, nearly 2 million jobs annually. By impeding our energy \nindustry, we are impeding one of the most potent areas of prospective \njob growth. Yet Congress has not passed a comprehensive energy policy \nin our country in years, and frankly I don't know that we can wait any \nlonger for that single sweeping master plan that will do it all at \nonce. We need to build it as expeditiously as we can.\n  In North Dakota, we built Empower North Dakota over a decade, piece \nby piece, and saw firsthand the power of energy development to boost \nour economy. By embracing Empower North Dakota, our State alone has \nrealized $12 billion in new energy-related investments since 2005. With \nthe right kind of energy policy, imagine what the impact would be for \nour Nation.\n  To expedite the process of building that energy policy on a national \nlevel, I am working with Leader McConnell and the entire Republican \nConference to create the kind of legal and regulatory climate our \ncountry needs to jump-start America's energy sector and create jobs. \nFor example, this week, I, along with other Senators, cosponsored an \namendment introduced by Senator McConnell to the small business \nauthorization bill. Based on legislation offered earlier this month by \nSenator Inhofe, which I and others cosponsored, this legislation sought \nto curb the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas and encourage \ndomestic energy development. A permanent measure such as this is needed \nto provide the certainty businesses need to make billion-dollar \ninvestments in new energy projects and, more importantly, create the \ngood-paying jobs a robust energy sector can provide our country. Our \nmeasure won 50 votes yesterday but failed to gain the 60 necessary for \npassage.\n  We need to continue to work with our colleagues across the aisle to \npass this legislation or legislation like it because impeding the \nenergy industry is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem, it \nis an American problem. It is a challenge we need to step up to and \nsolve. That is why, in a similar bipartisan effort, I am working with \nSenator Joe Manchin to support the EPA Fair Play Act to create more \ncertainty and more energy investment for our country.\n  I have also asked the Energy Information Administration to conduct a \nfocused analysis of regulations that could be impeding the development \nand growth of the Nation's domestic energy production in an effort to \nfind more ways to create rules of the road that will encourage energy \ncompanies to invest billions and to build our energy future in America. \nIncreased domestic energy production is a three-fer. We not only \npromote economic vitality, but we reduce our dependence on foreign \nsources of energy and we create jobs.\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n  The reality is that we can do all of these and more. We can provide a \ncommonsense legal and regulatory environment, a favorable business \nclimate for our industries. We can build a comprehensive energy policy \nthat leverages all of our vast energy resources together with good \nenvironmental stewardship. We can reduce spending, and we can live \nwithin our means. We can pay down our debt and leave our children a \nstrong financial legacy instead of a large debt. These are all things \nwe can do and we must do for our Nation. We need to work together, my \nfellow Senators, to do just that, for the strength and financial well-\nbeing of our country today and for the benefit of future Americans for \ngenerations to come. The future is truly in our hands.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I congratulate the junior Senator \nfrom North Dakota for his initial speech here in the Senate and say to \nall of our colleagues that it should be no surprise that he was sent \nhere by the people of North Dakota by an overwhelming margin. During \nhis 10 years as Governor, the State enjoyed extraordinary success. At a \ntime when many States were struggling financially, North Dakota had \nbulging surpluses and low unemployment, almost entirely as a result of \nthe outstanding job then-Governor Hoeven did in representing the people \nof North Dakota. So, as I say, it is no surprise that they sent him to \njoin us here in the Senate by an overwhelmingly large majority, and I \ncongratulate him on behalf of all of our colleagues on his initial \nspeech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I, too, rise in congratulating the \nSenator from North Dakota on his maiden speech. I have known then-\nGovernor Hoeven for quite some time. His wife and my wife have been \nvery good friends.\n  What you heard is basically a background of the success he has had in \nthe leadership of his great State. What you don't know is his ability \nto reach across the aisle in a bipartisan manner.\n  I can only say that John is a dear friend, and John is the type of \npersonality we need in this body to mend this partisan gridlock in \nwhich we find ourselves. I cannot tell you how pleased I am to still be \na colleague of his, and I look forward to many years of success working \ntogether, reaching out, finding the problems we have, addressing the \nproblems, and then, like a good Governor, taking them on and making \nsome good decisions, as he has done so well in North Dakota.\n  So, my good friend, it is so good to have you here. Congratulations.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2228-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2228-S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, this week I got an e-mail from a first \ngrader in Missoula, MT, 7 years old. Her note read:\n\n       Senator Tester, please pass a budget so that I can go to \n     Yellowstone National Park this weekend, or at least wait \n     until Monday to shut down the government.\n\n  I get a lot of letters and calls reminding me what is at stake. Yet \nsome of our colleagues continue to put politics ahead of doing what is \nright. I will always remember that e-mail from Missoula. Even 7-year-\nolds expect us to get our job done. They expect us to work together to \npass a budget. They expect us to work together to make responsible \ncuts. They expect us to make sure we don't put our government and the \nentire economy on life support. That is exactly what will happen if \nsome in Congress let the government shut down. They will fail all of \nus.\n  If drawing a line in the sand becomes more important than working \ntogether, I think that is a shame. Of course, we can't afford the \nstatus quo either. We all know the problem. Everyone wants to point \nfingers. I could spend my time pointing at those who thought it was a \ngood idea to put two wars we are fighting on the taxpayers' credit card \nor those who squandered a $128 billion budget surplus in a matter of \nmonths about 10 years ago. But I will leave it at this: Our debt and \nspending problem is not something that we got into overnight, and it is \nnot something we will get out of overnight.\n  It is not going to be fixed by slick talking points ginned up by \nWashington, DC, consultants. It will not be fixed by symbolic gimmicks. \nIt certainly will not be fixed by irresponsible decisions such as \nending Medicare as we know it. It will not be fixed by gutting student \nfinancial aid or physical infrastructure. Those create jobs now when \nour economy needs it the most.\n  Our spending and debt problem will be fixed by embracing a \nresponsible, credible, long-term strategy to cut our debt; to cut \nspending, discretionary and mandatory--right now we are talking about \ncuts to only 12 percent of the budget known as discretionary spending--\nto strengthen our entitlement programs so they work for future \ngenerations; to reform our Tax Code so it is fair and sustainable; and \nto cut our defense where we can afford to cut.\n  We owe it to all Americans to get the job done. But we owe it to them \nto get the job done responsibly, and that is going to require some buy-\nin. But we have done it before.\n  During the Great Depression, people endured incredible sacrifice. But \nthey had inspirational leadership to challenge them to grow their way \nto prosperity. In World War II, they worked together and made \nsacrifices at home to build the machinery that helped us win victory. \nThat momentum also created a powerful middle class. The attacks of \nSeptember 11 brought us together again, and again we grew strong.\n  When we work together, we succeed. It is in our DNA. It is what makes \nus the strongest, most innovative nation in the world. Now we have to \nsummon that strength and determination again, to lead our way out of \nour economic challenges. It will not happen with gimmicks. It is going \nto take responsible decisionmaking, compromise, and shared sacrifice.\n  Several of our colleagues in the Senate are already leading the way. \nI compliment Senators Chambliss, Coburn, Conrad, Crapo, Durbin, and \nWarner. They are working on a bipartisan strategy to cut debt and cut \nspending. Their plan will include cuts to discretionary spending. It \nwill make our entitlement programs stronger. It will propose cuts to \ndefense spending. And it will include tax reform.\n  Last year, Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles led a bipartisan \ncommission in outlining a smart, long-term, credible strategy for \ncutting debt and spending. Senator Simpson and Mr. Bowles say they had \n14 reasons for volunteering their time on the Debt Commission. Between \nthem, they have 14 grandkids.\n  While I may not embrace every component of their plan, I applaud \ntheir hard work, their leadership, their patriotism. Their hard work is \na solid blueprint we are already building from. I am ready to join \nthem, and so are many of us in this Chamber. We need to do it.\n  Montanans are patriots. They are ready and willing to follow our lead \nin providing a fair Tax Code that provides certainty and fairness. They \nare willing to share in the pain of responsible spending cuts that will \nnot take our economy backwards. They know we can afford to make cuts in \ndefense. They know we need to fix--but not dismantle or privatize--our \nentitlement programs.\n  What is the alternative? Well, we may find out the hard way if folks \nare not willing to work together to reach agreement by midnight \ntomorrow. Shutting down the government means our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan will not get their paychecks on time--even though they will \nstill be serving us.\n  This week, I heard from a soldier deployed in Afghanistan. He said he \nwould be OK in a short shutdown because he has some savings. But if \ntheir paychecks stop coming, a lot of his fellow soldiers will be hurt. \nMany have lower ranks. Many have pressing financial obligations such as \nmortgages and car payments, kids to take care of. They would get the \nshort end of the stick.\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\n  We have a duty to make sure the people who fight for us in harm's way \ndo not have to worry about something as simple as getting a paycheck. \nThat is why today I signed on to an important piece of legislation to \nensure American troops on active duty continue getting paid if the \ngovernment shuts down.\n  But Members of Congress are a different story. If the government \nshuts down, we do not deserve to get paid, plain and simple. I want to \nsay thanks to my colleagues for unanimously approving our measure to \nprevent congressional pay during a shutdown. Now the House needs to \nfollow our leadership. If they fail, and if I still get a paycheck, I \nam going to give it back.\n  A shutdown also means the government does not honor business \ncontracts. That would cost jobs. It means the IRS suspends refunds. A \nRepublican shutdown means new home loan guarantees will stop. It means \nthe SBA stops approving business loans. Patent processing will be \nsuspended. And it means Social Security, Medicare, and veterans' \nbenefits checks could be delayed. Right now, in Montana, there are \n1,240 veterans' benefits claims that are outstanding. If the government \nshuts down, those 1,240 veterans' claims cannot be addressed, and a 7-\nyear-old in Missoula, MT, will not be able to see her national parks \nthis weekend. We cannot afford that. Nobody deserves it. We can do \nbetter, and we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, as we were debating \nwhether to move to this bill now on the floor, I sent a letter to the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, and I was joined by \nseveral of my colleagues. We made a real simple point. The simple point \nwas this: We have a spending and a debt crisis. We need to act and we \nneed to act now. So rather than continue to bring up various cats and \ndogs bills, various matters that aren't related to that crucial, \ncentral spending and debt question before us, we should focus on the \ntask at hand. We should focus on our greatest challenge: meeting this \nspending and debt challenge.\n  Unfortunately, the distinguished majority leader did not heed that \ncall. He proceeded with this bill. For the reasons I outlined, I and \nthe other signatories of the letter voted against moving to this bill. \nUnfortunately, now, as we are on the eve of a potential government \nshutdown, I believe what has transpired has sort of made my point \nagain. Why haven't we been focused on that crucial spending and debt \nchallenge like a laser beam, to come together, to offer sensible \nsolutions to avoid these eleventh or even twelfth hour negotiations? \nBecause here we are and here we go again: Another crisis, another \neleventh or twelfth hour negotiation; another potential government \nshutdown.\n  While I am sorry we didn't focus like a laser beam on this central \nchallenge sooner, now that we are here, I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to do what is reasonable and sensible and adopt what the \nHouse of Representatives is about to adopt, which is a plan to at least \nkeep the government functioning smoothly for another week as we try to \nresolve the situation for the entirety of the remainder of the fiscal \nyear.\n  So I strongly support this 1-week continuing resolution that I \nbelieve will very soon pass the House. We all say we are against an \nunnecessary government shutdown. I certainly say that and mean it. If \nwe all say it, and if we all mean it, I believe we will support this \nsensible measure as we try to come to an agreement--all of us--on a \nplan for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n  This 1-week CR would keep the government functioning smoothly. It \nwould avoid those disruptions and threats that are concerning to many \nAmericans. That sensible, commonsense plan would also offer significant \ncuts to the current level of spending, $12 billion of cuts.\n  What is important is those cuts are not very controversial. They come \nout of proposals mostly from the Democratic side. They mostly come out \nof the President's own budget proposal or the Senate Democratic plan \nfor cuts or a series of nonpartisan suggestions made by the \nCongressional Budget Office. So I think it is reasonable to look to \nthose sources of proposed cuts and work from those lists, and that is \nwhat this proposal does.\n  The only other matter included in the proposal is two relatively \nnoncontroversial so-called riders: one about Guantanamo Bay, which is \npretty much current law right now because of language in the Defense \nauthorization bill, and a second regarding abortions performed in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  With regard to that second rider, again, this should be relatively \nnoncontroversial, particularly since this very language was in full \nforce and effect from 1996 until 2009. It was the law for that extended \nperiod of time. President Bill Clinton signed that ban into law six \ntimes. President Barack Obama signed that very language into law in \n2009. Vice President Joe Biden voted for the legislation, including \nthis DC abortion funding ban language, seven times since 1995. Even \nminority leader Nancy Pelosi on the House side voted for legislation \nincluding this language 14 times. Here, the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Reid, voted for legislation including this language 10 \ntimes since 1995.\n  So, again, this is not extremely controversial, and it is certainly \nno reason to shut down the government. So, in summary, I am sorry we \nhaven't been focused on this central challenge and this central issue \nfor the last 2 weeks as I had urged along with my colleagues. I think \nwe should focus like a laser beam on spending and debt, and I think we \nshould have been doing that for the last several weeks rather than \nbringing the bill before us onto the floor. But we are where we are.\n  Given that, I hope we will do the reasonable, commonsense thing and \ncontinue negotiations for the rest of the fiscal year, but, in the \nmeantime, pass the 1-week measure about to be passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. It continues the operations of the government. It also \nfunds the Department of Defense for the entire fiscal year. It takes \nwhat should be beyond politics off the table. It protects our military. \nIt gives full funding for our military men and women. It gives them \ncertainty. We should all be for that. It cuts $12 billion from current \nfunding levels but takes the vast majority of those cuts, again, from \nthe President's own list, from Senate Democrats' own list, and from a \nnonpartisan list from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  It only includes two so-called riders which have been granted wide \nacceptance in the past, including being passed, voted on, and supported \nby Senator Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and others \nmultiple times since 1996. That is a reasonable path forward. That is a \nresponsible way to prevent a government shutdown as we continue to \nnegotiate for an overall resolution of this matter for the remainder of \nthe fiscal year.\n  I hope all of us, Democrats and Republicans, will listen to the \nAmerican people and do the reasonable, commonsense thing and move \nforward in a reasonable way as we negotiate on broader issues in good \nfaith. I hope we will pass this 1-week measure at a minimum right now \nas we continue to look for an overall resolution for the rest of the \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. President, with that I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong concerns \nabout the direction Republicans and the tea party want to take our \ncountry, beginning with an irresponsible\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\nGovernment shutdown simply for the sake of pursuing a social agenda and \ncontinuing their reckless budget plan that will devastate seniors and \nthose most vulnerable over the next decade while rewarding millionaires \nwith even more tax breaks. I look at this Republican budget put out by \nChairman Ryan and it is a proposal that takes $1.5 trillion out of \nhealth care for seniors and children and gives it to the wealthiest, \nbut it does not even limit subsidies for special corporate interests or \nbig oil. In so doing, it fundamentally resets our values and turns back \nthe clock on the progress we have made to protect our parents and \ngrandparents, seniors and children in this country and keeps the \nplaying field reasonably level.\n  But even before that discussion, I wish to make a few things clear \nabout the implications of shutting down the Government and what we on \nthis side have already cut from the President's budget to reach an \nagreement. We started this year with $41 billion less in spending than \nthe President requested. Plus, in March we cut another $10 billion \nbelow last year's funding levels, including the complete elimination of \n33 Federal programs. In total, we have offered $33 billion in cuts for \nthe remainder of the current funding year, which ends in September.\n  But the most radical elements of the Republican Party will not take \nyes for an answer. They say we have not come far enough, which in tea \nparty terms means we have not given them everything they want. So they \nwill shut down the Government rather than take yes for an answer.\n  I saw a picture on the front page of one of the papers with a tea \nparty banner that said: ``Shut her down. Shut her down.''\n  I thought we were here to make sure we kept the Government going. It \nis clear their real reason for shutting down the Government is to \npromote a social agenda that is not acceptable to the broader part of \nthe country. They are willing to shut down the Federal Government, put \nour economy, our small businesses, our veterans at risk and potentially \ndelay tax refunds for millions of American families, all simply to make \na political point and to try to impose the social agenda of a minority \non the majority.\n  Shutting down the Federal Government over a woman's right to choose \nor the Federal Government's ability to enforce laws that protect our \nchildren's health, in my view, takes irresponsibility to a whole new \nlevel. Even the Speaker of the House himself has said a shutdown will \n``end up costing more than we save.'' The Speaker is right. It would \ncost about $8 billion every week or .2 percent of GDP every week the \nGovernment is shut down.\n  The Speaker is right on the substance, but he has not yet been \nwilling to lead and deal with the tempest in the tea party on his \nright, threatening to cut this economic recovery short to satisfy a \nnarrow, rightwing political agenda.\n  At a time when small businesses are just beginning to get access to \ncapital they need to create jobs for American families, a shutdown will \nresult in $400 million in capital each week not going to small \nbusinesses through the SBA loan program and will throw the engine of \nsmall business job growth into neutral when we want it to be in \noverdrive.\n  In the last shutdown, more than $1 billion in small business loans to \n5,200 businesses were delayed, so we know what small businesses are in \nfor if we have another shutdown. This is not the time in our recovery \nefforts to say no to helping small businesses put people to work.\n  In housing, the FHA loan process, which accounts for 30 percent of \nthe housing market, will be interrupted just as we enter the height of \nthe spring home-buying season in my State of New Jersey. With prices \nlow and so many houses on the market, this is not the time to prevent \n15,000 homeowners from getting a home loan every week, more than half \nof which are for new home purchases that would reduce the inventory of \nthe surplus properties.\n  Now, because Social Security is a mandatory funding program, seniors \nand the disabled will continue to receive their checks. But if we let \nthe tempest in the tea party shut down the government, interruptions at \nthe Social Security Administration could delay changes in people's \nbenefits and payments. In just 4 days of the last shutdown, 112,000 new \nclaims for Social Security retirement and disability benefits were not \ntaken and over 800,000 callers were unable to reach the Social Security \nAdministration. Certainly in this economy, this is not a time to leave \nthose who rely on Social Security with nothing.\n  With the tax season upon us, it is certainly not the right time to \ndelay tax refunds families are anxiously awaiting in order to make ends \nmeet, put into the economy, and help the recovery keep going.\n  It is not the time to shut down 368 National Park Service sites, the \nSmithsonian, the Statue of Liberty, the monuments, museums, and \nnational parks across the country which, in the last shutdown, lost 9 \nmillion visitors and the tourism revenues to those communities. Given \nthat our last shutdown occurred in the dead of winter, we can expect a \nshutdown in the midst of spring breaks and high tourist season to have \na much larger impact on tourism revenues and the wallets of families \nwho have already booked trips to national parks and planned visits to \nnational monuments and museums. To put it in context, if we shut down \nthe government for 5 weeks, we could lose up to $1.2 billion based on \nthe $12 billion visitors brought to the national park communities last \nyear.\n  If the tea party continues to insist on a government shutdown, \nmilitary paychecks would be delayed at a time when military families \nare struggling with multiple deployments and struggling like everyone \nelse to make ends meet. They will ultimately get paid but only when the \nshutdown is finished. In the last shutdown, more than 400,000 veterans \nsaw their disability checks delayed. Now, let's not repeat that mistake \nwhen more of our wounded sons and daughters are returning home from two \nwars raging abroad every day.\n  If the tea party continues to insist on a government shutdown, \nclinical trials of lifesaving drugs will be halted and new patients \nwill not be accepted into clinical research programs at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  If the tea party continues to insist on a government shutdown, they \nwill put our entire economy at risk. As a matter of fact, business \nleaders have said that a shutdown could result in higher interest rates \nand chaos in the markets. Every week, 350 import licenses could be \ndelayed, resulting in holding up billions of dollars in American \nexports at a time when we need those exports to help fuel the recovery. \nDuring the 1995 shutdown, $2.2 billion in U.S. exports could not leave \nthe country because thousands of export licenses could not be issued.\n  Ivan Seidenberg, the CEO of Verizon, who is also the chairman of the \nBusiness Roundtable, said:\n\n       I don't think any of the CEOs would welcome a government \n     shutdown. Problems for business would run from contracts \n     being postponed to disruptions in the supply chain.\n\n  John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable, said:\n\n       Business would face the danger of the law of unintended \n     consequences. Interest rates could rise and there could be \n     turmoil in financial markets.\n\n  This would all happen because Republicans, being held hostage by tea \npartiers, have rejected $33 billion in spending cuts for this year \nbecause they did not get all they wanted, because they are not getting \ntheir way on unrelated, extraneous social issues such as women's \nreproductive rights and enforcing laws on our books to protect our \nchildren's health. They simply will not take yes for an answer because \nyes on spending cuts is not really their only goal. Spending cuts is \nnot why they are trying to shut the government down.\n  I would remind our colleagues that democratic governments are not \nabout total victory. Authoritarian governments do that, not \ndemocracies. In democracies, we are all fairly elected to represent our \nconstituents. We all have a view. We all have a vote. We all have an \nobligation to govern and legislate for every American, not just for \nthose who hold the views of the tea party. With all due respect, tea \npartiers claim to love our right to free speech and yet clearly do not \nbelieve anyone's views other than their own are acceptable.\n  I say to our colleagues, we all have deeply held beliefs. Defending \nthem and shouting them from the rooftops is\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\neasy, but listening to those who disagree with us and working on the \ndifferences is the hard work of government.\n  I remind my colleagues on the other side that the word ``congress'' \nis derived from a Latin verb meaning ``to walk together.'' We have \nalready made cuts to the President's budget. We have already made real \ncuts in this year's spending. We have offered a reasonable compromise \nthat seeks even more cuts but, more importantly, a compromise that \nseeks common ground, not capitulation, and neither should our \ncolleagues expect capitulation. All we ask is that those on the other \nside do what is right and act in the broader interests of the Nation, \nnot shut down the government, disrupt services, and put the economic \nrecovery at risk, all to satisfy a narrow political agenda.\n  I know there was a lot of fanfare on the Republican budget proposal \nthat was put out as we look to the next fiscal year. In my view, it is \nby far one of the most partisan, ideological, and fundamentally \ndestructive budgets I have seen in my time in Congress--destructive of \nfundamental protections for every American and for what we have come to \naccept as fundamental protections that are uniquely American.\n  It fundamentally takes $1.5 trillion out of health care for seniors \nand children, and it gives it to the wealthy. It would take health care \nfrom seniors and children rather than take subsidies from special \ncorporate interests such as big oil companies. If Republicans got their \nway, New Jersey residents would lose $34 billion in health benefits, \nand almost 400,000 New Jerseyans would see their coverage cut entirely.\n  The Republican proposal talks about cutting taxes, but in reading it, \nI find only two groups whose taxes would be cut: the rich and those who \nare even richer. Corporations and millionaires and those soon-to-be \nmillionaires will keep all of their recent tax giveaways and would \nactually see their tax rates slashed by 30 percent. This proposal loses \n$700 billion on the revenue side over the next 10 years by extending \nthe Bush tax cuts, particularly to the wealthiest in the country, and \ntrillions more by slashing tax rates for corporations and millionaires. \nThose making more than $1 million a year will see tax cuts of $125,000 \neach from the tax cuts and tens of thousands of dollars more from \nproposed rate cuts, while people in my State would lose $34 billion in \nhealth benefits, and 400,000 New Jerseyans end up without health \ncoverage at all.\n  This budget proposal shifts the balance to the wealthy and makes cuts \nthat do not reflect our values as a people and as a nation. At the top \nof the list of Draconian Republican cuts is Medicare. Let's for a \nmoment look at the logic of the Republican budget proposal when it \ncomes to Medicare, a program that since 1965 has protected seniors and \nmade sure no older American would be without health care when they need \nit the most.\n  In 1965, we passed Medicare. Why? Because senior citizens could not \nget health insurance. And the reason health insurance companies would \nnot take the risk of insuring older Americans, who, logically, would \nneed to see doctors and receive treatment more often than younger \nAmericans, is rather clear. Even if there were such a plan, the cost \nwould be prohibitive for a senior on a fixed income. So we created \nMedicare, and today it is one of our most successful programs. No \nsenior is left without access to lifesaving, life-enhancing drugs or \nthe care they need.\n  What are the Republicans proposing in this budget? They are proposing \nto end Medicare as we know it. In fact, they want to privatize \nMedicare, and they say their privatization plan is just a way of asking \nwealthier seniors to pay more. But let's ask ourselves, logically, how \nmuch do we think an insurance company will charge in premiums to a 65-\nyear-old American male who may have had a heart attack or heart ailment \nor suffers from diabetes. How outrageous do we suppose the premium will \nbe, and how much of a voucher will that 65-year-old American need to \npurchase even a minimal health care plan? That logic escapes me. Today, \nbuying a private plan on the open market for a self-employed, middle-\nage couple can cost as much as $18,000 a year. The average retiree in \nAmerica is living on about $19,000 a year. So, again, the logic escapes \nme. The fact is, this proposed privatization plan for Medicare \ncompletely overlooks the history of why we needed Medicare in the first \nplace. It illogically assumes insurance companies will provide quality \nhealth care coverage at a huge discount to older Americans. If that is \nnot wishful thinking, I don't know what is.\n  Let me close by simply saying that it is time to make sure this \ngovernment stays open, it is time to make sure we don't thrust the \neconomy backward, and it is time to ultimately ensure that those who \nhave given service to this country, such as the men and women in \nuniform, don't get hurt, and that we do by coming together on a \nreasonable budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2231-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, I could not agree more that we should not \nhave a government shutdown. I could not agree more that we need to take \nsteps to protect and improve our economy. I could not agree more that \nwe need to take steps to make sure our brave uniformed men and women \nare fairly compensated and otherwise treated. I must, however, express \nmy profound, albeit respectful, disagreement with my colleague, the \njunior Senator from New Jersey.\n  This is not a possible shutdown that we are facing as a result of the \nRepublican Party or as a result of the tea party. As a lifelong \nRepublican and as a founding member of the Senate Tea Party Caucus, I \ncan tell you unequivocally that there is not one member of this body, \nnor is there one member of the Senate Tea Party Caucus who wants a \ngovernment shutdown, certainly no Republican. From the outset, \nRepublicans have attempted to bring forward proposals to make sure we \ndo not get into a shutdown.\n  The question we need to ask ourselves is, Why does the President of \nthe United States, President Barack Obama, want a government shutdown? \nLet's ask a few questions.\n  Why was it that a few months ago, after the election but before the \nnew Congress took over, when the President had both Houses of Congress \nunder the control of his party, why did he opt not to pass a full \nbudget for fiscal year 2011? That was the first seed he sowed in the \ndirection of a government shutdown. I submit it was one that was either \nirresponsible on the one hand or deliberate and malicious on the other, \nintending to bring about a sequence of events that would culminate \ninevitably in a government shutdown.\n  No. 2. Even after the new Congress convened, after the balance of \npower shifted completely in the House of Representatives and after a \nnumber of seats in this body shifted and the new Congress convened in \nJanuary of this year, the President did not bring forward something \nthat could attract both Houses of Congress to approve and that he could \nfund the government with for the balance of the year. He instead chose \nto operate on a series of continuing resolutions. We are now moving up \nagainst what I believe will be our seventh continuing resolution if it \nis passed. What we have from the President is radio silence in the \ndirection of what we need to do to move forward.\n  A number of us have suggested all along in this process that at a \npoint in time in America when we have a national debt approaching $15 \ntrillion, at a point in time when we are adding to that debt at a \nstaggering rate approaching $1.7 trillion a year, it does not make \nsense and it is not responsible to continue, even in small increments, \nperpetuating that degree of reckless, perpetual deficit spending.\n  What we want to see more than anything isn't any specific set of \nsocial issue legislation. It is not any specific degree of spending \ncuts. It is instead a plan, some plan that will move us in the \ndirection of a balanced budget, that will put us on track so we might \nonce again enjoy the benefits of a balanced budget, so we might again \nenjoy the\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\nday and age when we don't have a debt-to-GDP ratio well in excess of 90 \npercent. We know when we have a debt-to-GDP ratio in excess of 90 \npercent, it slows economic growth by as much as half every year, \ncosting our economy as many as a million jobs every single year. This \nultimately is about jobs. Our sprawling debt kills jobs and kills \neconomic growth necessary to create jobs.\n  So, no, this is not a quixotic quest for perfection. This is a quest \nfor that which will suffice to get us back on track toward fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  I mentioned two seeds the President has planted to lead to a \nshutdown, the first being his refusal to push through a budget for the \nentire year, fiscal 2011; the second being his reliance on continuing \nresolutions. The third seed he sowed, one I am not sure we will be able \nto get around this time, much as we wish to, is his threat in the last \nhour or two, his promise to veto the continuing resolution the House is \nexpected to pass this afternoon. It may have passed moments ago. He is \nthreatening to veto that before it even gets over here. One must \nwonder, why does the President want a shutdown.\n  We have to remember, these are not drastic changes that have been \nproposed. In fact, they are not even sufficient to get us back on track \nso we can say this heads us in the direction of an eventual balanced \nbudget. These are minor cuts. Yet the President insists on moving us \ninevitably, inexorably in the direction of a shutdown.\n  While we are on the subject of addressing a false blame placed on the \nRepublican Party and the tea party, I care to address the accusation \nmade by various of my colleagues, an accusation I believe made in \nignorance and that, in any event, is manifestly incorrect with regard \nto the tea party. This is a movement whose views are not extreme. What \nis extreme is a $15 trillion debt we are adding to at a staggering rate \nof $1.7 trillion a year. That is extreme, as is what has happened in \nthe last few years, including the U.S. Government takeover of \neverything from our banking industry to auto manufacturing to our \nhealth care industry. Those things are extreme.\n  The tea party movement is something that is shared by many Americans, \nregardless of whether they appear at a rally of any kind. It is a \nspontaneous grassroots political phenomenon that simply recognizes our \nFederal Government has grown too big and has become too expensive.\n  We need to do something about that. Many of us who consider ourselves \npart of the tea party movement and believe the best solution, perhaps \nthe only solution, is to return to that 223-year-old founding document \nwe call the Constitution, look to those powers that are identified as \nsomething within the exclusive ability, the exclusive power and control \nof the Federal Government. The more we do that, the more we believe we \ncan turn to constitutionally limited government of the sort that can \noperate on a balanced budget.\n  This is not necessarily even a politically conservative movement. It \nis neither conservative nor liberal. At the end of the day, it need not \nbe Republican or Democratic. It is simply American. It recognizes this \ncountry was founded upon the principle that national governments, as \nthey become large and powerful, have a certain tendency toward gaining \nan excess of power and spending an excess of money, and to prevent a \nform of tyranny. A national government can function best when it has \nlimited enumerated powers of the sort we granted the Federal Government \na couple of centuries ago, powers including things such as national \ndefense, establishing a uniform system of weights and measures, \nregulating trademarks, copyrights, and patents, and so forth. Included \nin that list we won't find anything about a government takeover of \nhealth care or manufacturing industries or the banking industry.\n  This is neither liberal nor conservative, neither Republican nor \nDemocratic, and it certainly isn't extreme. It is simply American. It \nis what makes us great. It is part of what has created the strongest \neconomy and the greatest civilization the world has ever known. At the \nend of the day, as those who have planted quite deliberately the seeds \nfor an inevitable shutdown seek to blame others, we have to remember \nthe seeds they have sown, and we have to be willing to cast blame where \nblame is due.\n  The blame here cannot and, as long as I am standing, will not be \nplaced at the feet of the Republicans or of the tea party. We do not \nwant a shutdown. We will do everything we can to fight against it. If \nwe have one, it will be because the President of the United States and \nmembers of the other party in this august body have refused to put \nforward a palatable, defensible budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I associate myself with my colleague from \nUtah. I appreciate the clarity of his remarks. I wish to add to them.\n  I am glad we have some folks here today listening in. There is \nprobably no other place in the country we can hear so much nonsense as \nwe will hear on the Senate floor today. Unfortunately, we just heard \nthat from the colleague before my colleague from Utah.\n  The House just passed another resolution to fund the government, fund \nthe military for the rest of the year, pretty much at a figure we have \nall agreed on. It includes funding for 1 week to keep other aspects of \nthe government open, and it makes some very modest cuts to our budget. \nMost of these have been agreed to in advance. But there seems to be one \nsticking point. This bill would prohibit using taxpayer money to fund \nabortions in DC.\n  My colleague who spoke a minute ago said this is an invasion of \nreproductive rights. I am here to tell colleagues that no one has a \nreproductive right to use somebody else's money for an abortion. That \nis all this is about. Not only taxpayers' money, but we are borrowing \nmoney to do something at a time when the country is nearly broke that \nAmericans disagree on, and it violates the conscience of many \nAmericans.\n  But my colleagues on the other side have decided to make this the \ncrucial issue. Either Republicans agree to use taxpayer money for \nabortions or they are going to shut down the government. And they say \nwe are emphasizing social issues. This is not just a social issue. It \nis an American issue. Even people who support abortion support the idea \nthat taxpayers should not be forced to pay for it. It is a small \nrequest. The cuts are small. But it is clear, as the Senator from Utah \njust said, this shutdown has been planned by the President and the \nDemocratic majority for a long time, believing they can win the PR \nbattle, thinking that Americans are too stupid to figure it out. I am \nconfident, as we go into this, that Americans are much smarter than my \nDemocratic colleagues. I think they are going to figure out how \nirresponsible the President has been, how much lack of leadership there \nhas been in the Senate, trying to blame Speaker Boehner in the House \nwho controls one-half of one branch of government for a shutdown, when \nlast year, when the President controlled the whole government, we \ndidn't pass a budget. We didn't fund any aspect of government. This \nlanded in the lap of a new Congress which still includes a Democratic \nmajority here in the Senate.\n  There has not been one bill from the Senate that the Democrats agree \non. The President has not sent down one funding request we could vote \nfor. We don't have a bill proposed by Senator Harry Reid today that we \ncan vote for to keep the government open. Yet he is saying what the \nRepublicans on the House side are sending over is not good enough.\n  The House just passed another bill. Fifteen Democrats voted for it. \nIf we had 15 Democrats in the Senate who were reasonable, we wouldn't \nhave to deal with this ridiculous, irresponsible government shutdown. I \ndon't know what else Republicans in the House could do. They sent over, \nover 40 days ago, a bill that would have funded the government through \nthe rest of the year with very nominal cuts. It was set up to fail in \nthe Senate. We have yet to have hardly any debate on the issue. During \nall this time we have spent less than 3 hours of debate on the most \nimportant issue in the country. We spent the last couple of weeks on a \nsmall business bill. I bet no American could tell us what we are even \ntalking about. Before that we spent a couple of weeks on a patent \nbill--anything we could do\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\nto avoid the responsibility of debating the most pressing issue in this \ncountry.\n\n  I also have to take issue with what the Democrats are trying to do \nwith the tea party. I remind them that many tea party members are \nDemocrats. They are Independents. They are Republicans. Many of them \nhave never been involved with politics before. Many are Hispanic and \nAfrican American. They are all Americans. But they are concerned about \nour country. They seem to be able to do something we can't do here. \nThey add and subtract. They understand we can't keep spending more than \nwe are bringing in and expect the country to survive. We even brought \nup a resolution--the Senator from Utah did--to have a sense of the \nSenate that we should balance our budget. Just about every Democrat \nvoted against that. That means there is an intent to bankrupt our \ncountry. Because there is no way around it; if we keep spending more \nthan we bring in, we will bankrupt the country.\n  That is the course this President has put us on. That is the course \nSenator Reid and the Democratic majority want to keep us on. When we \ntry to do even modest, nominal reductions in spending to change the \ntrend line, they are coached, as Senator Schumer has said, to call it \nextreme and to blame it on the tea party. Americans are smarter than \nthat. I think my colleagues are getting ready to figure that out.\n  We come down to the bottom line the Senator from Utah mentioned. Why \nare they doing this? They look back to 1997, back in the 1990s, and \nthey think they can win the PR battle. Even more importantly, the \nPresident needs a distraction. The focus on the President now is \nrevealing a lack of leadership in domestic policy and foreign policy. \nHe has led us into a mess in Libya. He has led us into a domestic mess \nand has us on a course to bankrupt the country. He is trying to take \nover health care. And all those unions and other people who were \nadvocating for it are now asking for waivers. There have been over \n1,000 waivers, people who want to get out of this health care bill. The \nfinancial reregulation Dodd-Frank bill is threatening to hurt the \neconomy even more. The President needs a distraction. This is a \nchoreographed distraction to close the government down, to draw \nattention, to try to shift the blame from a President who has been AWOL \nfrom leadership and has very little political courage.\n  That is what we need right now across America. That is what Americans \nare asking us to do, to keep fighting, be bold. This is not a matter of \npartisan politics as much as it is a matter of national survival. We \nhave to make some hard decisions. We can't keep spending more than we \nare bringing in. We have to do what families do, tighten our belts, \nbalance the checkbook.\n  These are not radical ideas. All we have to respond to is what the \nHouse has passed today. Senate Democrats who control this place have \nnot offered any solution. The President has not offered a solution. I \nsuspect we will not even be allowed to vote on the one option we have, \nwhat the House sends over here. Yet they think Americans are so stupid \nthat they can come to the floor and blame Republicans who have no \ncontrol over the situation except to send us what they think is best \nfrom the House.\n  That is what they are doing. They need to be applauded. Speaker \nBoehner has done everything he can to try to work with all parties here \nto responsibly keep the government going and at the same time to \nrecognize we cannot keep this reckless spending the President has been \ndoing the last couple of years. This is an urgent and serious matter \nthat I am afraid is being played as a PR game by the other side.\n  The misrepresentations I heard just before about the budget being \nproposed on the House side are very difficult to swallow. The truth is \nvery rare in this body. I hope all Americans will take the time to look \nat what is really going on because this is all a blame game, and the \nDemocrats are counting on Americans not to pay attention, to take their \ncues from the national media.\n  We are going to do everything we can to keep the government open, to \nresponsibly respond to what the voters told us last November, and not \nto play the blame game with the other side. But this is being played as \na game instead of a matter of serious national survival, a serious \nnational issue. But the bill we will hopefully have a chance at least \nto debate that the House just passed will take our No. 1 \nresponsibility, to defend our country, fund our troops, and make sure \nthat is done for the balance of the year. We can argue about the rest \nnext week, but let's fund our troops this week and do what we were sent \nhere to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add the \nfollowing Senators as cosponsors to S. 724: Senator Manchin, Senator \nUdall of Colorado, and Senator Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, that brings to 43 the number of \nbipartisan Senators, including the Presiding Officer, who are \nsupporting the bill that will assure that our military personnel are \npaid even if there is a government shutdown.\n  We all realize the stress that a military person and a family are \nunder if that military person, especially, is deployed overseas. We \nhave troops in Afghanistan. I was talking to my staff a minute ago, and \nhe heard from one of his friends in Afghanistan, on his ninth \ndeployment, who had heard about our bill and he thanked us for \nrealizing there might be a delay in the military pay and for trying to \naddress it if, in fact, the government is shut down. His ninth \ndeployment, and he is worried about whether he is going to be paid on \ntime so his family, with a 1-year-old child, will be able to make sure \nand pay the mortgage on the first of the month. Oh, my gosh, what are \nwe thinking here?\n  I think there are certainly legitimate disagreements about the \nspending and the budget. I am one who believes we should be cutting the \nspending. I think the ways to get there are certainly legitimate areas \nof disagreement. There should be one matter on which we do not disagree \nand that we would unanimously pass in this Senate; that is, in the \nevent the government does shut down because the sides are still apart \nwhen the deadline comes Friday night, that our military get their \npaychecks, and those who are serving our military overseas or wherever \nwith food service and the things that are done by civilian employees \nserving the military, that they, too, would show up for work and they \nwould be paid.\n  We cannot have somebody thinking: Oh, golly, now, I wonder if I am \nsupposed to show up to serve the military meals in Afghanistan or in \nthe base in Iraq or the police station where our troops are \nembedded. Are we going to ask those questions? I hope not. I hope that \nif there is one thing this Congress and this President can agree on, it \nis that there should be no question that the mother at home with the 1-\nyear-old child whose husband is on his ninth deployment in Afghanistan \nwill not worry that she will have that, hopefully, direct deposit so \nshe can pay her mortgage on time.\n\n  S. 724 is very simple and very clear: that our military will be \nrequired to come to work, which will be no doubt for them, and they \nwill be paid on time. The same goes for anybody serving the military \nwhere it is essential for the service of the military. We have almost \n100,000 people in Afghanistan today. We have 47,000 in Iraq. There are \na lot of people who are serving under great stress and doing a great \njob under very trying circumstances. I hope this Senate, if, in fact, \nthe government shuts down, can speak very clearly.\n  I don't think we can wait until 11 o'clock Friday night to make that \ndetermination. The processing of the bills and the direct deposits and \nall that is right now because the paychecks are imminent. It is about 1 \nweek until the paychecks come, but we have a process and we need to \nensure the process is going forward.\n  We know the House, as we speak, is debating the 1-week continuing \nresolution. It does have the funding for the\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\nDepartment of Defense until the end of the fiscal year. The President \nhas said he will veto that because of the riders in the bill, which \nmeans we could be facing a government shutdown. I don't want the \ngovernment to shut down because I don't think we even know the real \nconsequences to the thousands of people who are affected, to the \nveterans who get benefits and live benefit to benefit or the military \npersonnel, of course, and those in the Department of Defense.\n  Many of us are trying to make the decisions as to who is essential in \nour offices. It is very hard to do the constituent services when we are \ninvolved in a government shutdown. I can't tell my colleagues the \nnumber of emergencies I get: people who have loved ones overseas who \ncan't get visas, can't get back, who lost passports. We have so many \ncalls where people need services. So we have to select what are the \nessential services. These are all things people are not aware of that \nwill happen when there is a shutdown of government.\n  So I hope we can come to an agreement. If, in fact, we have an \nagreement--and some people are saying we do for the top-line spending; \nI haven't heard it yet, so I don't know if that is the case--but if the \nleaders have made a decision that there is now an agreement on that, I \nhope we will be able to act and not have a government shutdown.\n  I also hope we will be able to pass a long-term continuing \nresolution. It is high time people know what they can contract for, \nwhat government services are going to be ongoing and at what price, at \nwhat funding level. Nobody would run a small business this way. Nobody \nwould run a corporation this way: Well, we can't agree, so we will just \nhave a week-to-week continuing resolution in a business. Nobody would \ndo that.\n  I think we have to be focused on the big picture. We have 6 more \nmonths in this fiscal year, until October 1. We need to make sure we \nget this out of the way so we can focus on what is truly going to make \na difference in terms of whether we can get this deficit down and get \nthe debt off the plates of our children in the future, and those will \nbe the reforms that will be tied to the debt ceiling. If we don't have \nreforms, that is when we should draw the line in the sand and say we \nare not going to have the debt ceiling lifted without the reforms in \nplace that will allow us to not hit that $14 trillion number in the \nfuture. I hope we will have a 10-year plan that would start lowering \nthe deficit every year over 10 years so eventually we would have it \ndown to a reasonable amount as compared to our gross domestic product. \nThat would provide the credibility to the rest of the world that we are \ngoing to meet our obligations, that we will not default, and that we \nwould be taking hold of our financial situation in this country. That \nwould be the prudent thing to do. I hope we will all be able to work \ntogether to do it.\n  As of now, I think the important thing for this Senate to do is to \npass S. 724 that now has 43 cosponsors. It is a bipartisan bill that \nsays the military should not have to worry about a government shutdown. \nThat should be the last thing on their minds. They should be protecting \nthemselves from harm in Iraq and Afghanistan and their families should \nbe able to do the best they can to support their families while their \nloved ones are overseas. I hope there will be a time going forward when \nwe can pass this bill in short order--not at 11 o'clock Friday night \nbut in the next day or so--if, in fact, we are not able to see our way \nto passing the 1-week continuing resolution that would prepare us, \nhopefully, for the long-term continuing resolution to get this fiscal \nyear out of the way and let us focus on next year's budget, which \nstarts October 1, and the long-term reform that is going to be \nnecessary to start cutting our deficit significantly.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I understand our Democratic leader is \nmeeting with the Republican Speaker of the House and the White House \nand working to try to establish the funding level we will have for the \nrest of this fiscal year that ends September 30.\n  Let me explain, briefly, how we got here. Our Democratic majority in \nthe Senate failed to pass a spending level last year--failed to pass a \nsingle appropriations bill last year and, at the start of the fiscal \nyear, voted a continuing resolution for 5 months. In the course of all \nthat, there was a national election and the most driving force in that \nelection was the American people's deep concern about reckless \nWashington spending and surging debt that they know is endangering the \nAmerican economy, can reduce growth, cause a debt crisis and put us on \nan unsustainable path and burden our children and grandchildren with \nmassive debt, the likes of which we have not seen before.\n  The continuing resolution that passed at the start of the fiscal year \ncarried us 5 months of the 12-month fiscal year. I suppose, after the \nshellacking the big spenders took last fall--the biggest shellacking in \n80 years--huge numbers of individuals got elected to the House and a \nlarge number to the Senate who are committed to containing spending--\nthere should have been no doubt that when we came to decide how much \nspending we would have the last 7 months of the fiscal year, that there \nwould be proposals to reduce spending. The House responsibly came \nforward with H.R. 1, which calls for a reduction of spending by $61 \nbillion over the last 7 months of the fiscal year, and it was sent to \nthe Senate. The Senate has done nothing. We have a vote on the bill. \nActually, more votes were obtained in the Democratic-controlled Senate \nfor the Republican House bill than votes achieved for the Senate \nDemocratic bill. Ten Democratic Senators were uneasy with the bill the \nSenate majority produced because it only reduced spending by $4.6 \nbillion. Have they forgotten what happened in November? Have they \nforgotten that projections continue to grow throughout the year, and \ninstead of a $1.3 trillion expected deficit this year, the numbers have \ngrown to $1.4 trillion in debt added to our country this fiscal year \nending September 30?\n  Did not the American people expect us to do something? One would have \nthought this $61 billion reduction is somehow the end of the world. We \nhave been fighting ever since.\n  We have had a series of short-term continuing resolutions so the \ngovernment does not shut down. Why should the government shut down? \nBecause under our Constitution, if the Congress does not fund a \ngovernment entity, the entity does not have a right to exist. It can't \ngo out and operate as a government entity if it has not been funded by \nthe Congress. So we have a serious problem. I hope our colleagues reach \nan agreement. I hope Senator Reid and Speaker Boehner can reach an \nagreement, but I am uneasy about it. Frankly, I am not happy about some \nof the things that have been occurring.\n  Let me read for my colleagues what Senator Reid, our Democratic \nleader, has been saying. You know we want to have a compromise, they \nsay. Why don't you guys all get together and be nice to one another? \nWell, we should, and we do, even though we sometimes are pretty \naggressive in our debates. But it is a bit much when Senator Reid says \nthe tea party is trying to push through its extreme agenda--issues that \nhave absolutely nothing to do with funding the government.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       They have made a decision to shut down the government \n     because they want to make it harder, for example, for a woman \n     to get a cancer screening.\n\n  I have asked myself: What in the world could he be talking about \nthere? My staff thinks the only thing he could be referring to is the \nproposal to reduce funding for Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion \nprovider in America.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Do they really want to shut the government down because the \n     tea party doesn't want scientists to make sure the air we \n     breathe is clean and pure?\n\n  Give me a break.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       This is a time we don't have to fight over the tea party's \n     extreme social agenda.\n\n  They had a tape of my good friend, Senator Schumer, and he had to \nback\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\ndown from it, but everyone agreed to use the word ``extreme.'' So they \ncalled everybody ``extreme.'' They had a press conference and it got \npicked up. One of our fine Democratic colleagues was talking about the \nextreme Republicans, and then he said the extreme Republicans, ``my \ngood friends.'' Good for him. Give me a break. There are other \nstatements like that. The Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, \nsaid:\n\n       The GOP Ryan budget is a path to poverty for America's \n     seniors and children and a road to riches for big oil.\n\n  One of the Congressmen said that the Ryan budget ``puts yet another \nbrick in the wall between the haves and the have nots.''\n  Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget Committee, of which I am the \nranking member, called that budget ``unsustainable and unreasonable.''\n  Well, we have a problem in America. The debt in this country is \ndangerous. We are coming out of the recession, and we need to continue \ngrowth. We need to continue job creation. It is not as good as a lot of \npeople say, but it is improving. It has been slower than most \nrecessions for us to recover. But Alan Greenspan, Erskine Bowles, Bill \nGross at PIMCO bond company, the largest in the world, who has stopped \nbuying U.S. Treasury bonds and sold all his U.S. Treasury bonds, and \nMoody's have all warned us that we could be facing a crisis in short \norder. We need to make some changes.\n  Also, all of this is being conducted under an atmosphere that is \naffected by the budget for fiscal year 2012.\n  Chairman Ryan and his fabulous Budget Committee in the House have \nproduced a very good budget. It is a courageous and long-term budget \nwhich deals with the unsustainable course of Social Security and \nMedicare and Medicaid. He proposes solutions that save those programs \nand protect our seniors. They put us on the right trajectory. That is \nwhat has been hammered as some extreme document.\n  What has the Senate produced? Nothing. The Senate hasn't produced \nanything, nada. This is most troubling. But what has the other party, \nwho is required to submit a budget--the Budget Act requires the Senate \nto produce a budget, and it requires the House to produce a budget, and \nit requires the President to submit a budget. The President, a week \nlate, submitted a budget.\n  Mr. Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson tell us we are facing the most \npredictable economic crisis in our Nation's history as a result of the \ndebt we are running up. We cannot continue this. It is unsustainable. \nMr. Bernanke says we are on an unsustainable course.\n  What did the President do? What kind of budget did he propose? His \nbudget increases spending every year. It increases discretionary \nspending every year. It increases taxes by $1.7 trillion. It doubles \nthe debt in 5 years and triples it in 10 years. It is unsustainable. It \nis, in light of the circumstances we face today, unacceptable. He \nprovides no suggestion whatsoever to save Social Security, which is \nmoving into an unsustainable course, nothing whatsoever to fix or \nstrengthen Medicare or Medicaid, all of which every expert in the \ncountry agrees are on dangerous paths that cannot be sustained. It is \nstunning.\n  Interest on our debt last year was $200 billion. We borrow the money \nwe don't have. Interest last year was $200 billion. This year, we are \ngoing to spend $3.6 trillion and we are going to take in $2.2 trillion. \nForty cents out of every dollar we spend is borrowed. This is the third \nstraight year with a $1 trillion-plus deficit. These last 3 years, we \nare averaging $1.4 trillion in deficits per year. The highest we ever \nhad before that was $450 billion.\n  The lowest budget deficit, projected by the President's own budget \noffice, scored by the CBO, in 10 years would be $740 billion. Worse, it \nis going up in the outyears. In the tenth year, under President Obama's \nbudget, the deficit would be $1.2 trillion. And the reason the numbers \ndropped was always there--based on the projection that our economy will \ncontinue to rebound, nothing that the President has done. His spending \nlevels increased under the budget.\n  Therefore, I believe and I honestly think that the President's \nbudget, in light of the warning and the danger this debt is posing to \nAmerica, is the most irresponsible budget ever presented by a President \nof the United States. It is stunningly damaging. It is unacceptable. It \naccelerates the unsustainable path we are on. As Congressman Ryan, \nchairman of the House Budget Committee, said, it makes it worse than \nthe unsustainable baseline numbers we are operating under now. It makes \nit worse.\n  The Republican House has produced a good budget, the President has \nproduced a budget that is unacceptable, and our Democratic colleagues \nin the Senate have produced nothing. They just want to complain. They \nwant to make these kinds of attacks: punishing working families; \nanother brick in the wall between the haves and the have-nots; denying \nwomen the right to have breast exams and cancer screening; extreme \nsocial agenda--extreme, extreme, extreme. Be sure to use that word, \n``extreme.'' I don't believe the American people are going to buy this \nor that they are going to be taken in by the big spenders. They weren't \nlast fall when 64 new House Members were elected who are committed to \nrestrained spending, and I don't believe they will in the future.\n  Some think that Republicans will get blamed for shutting down the \ngovernment if they don't have an agreement. Let's talk about that.\n  As a matter of compromise, the House has sent over another bill, H.R. \n1363, that would extend funding for another week and allow the \nnegotiations to continue for another week, and that will reduce \nspending by an additional $12 billion. That bill also funds the Defense \nDepartment through the end of this fiscal year so that they are not \nhung out there with CR after CR, and so that the Defense Department, \nthe people who defend our country can have confidence in the funding \nlevel for the rest of the year. H.R. 1363 is here in the Senate. The \nHouse passed that legislation so the Senate can pass a permanent fix \nfor the rest of the fiscal year or it can do 1 more week and we can \ncontinue to talk. It is hard for me to imagine how the Republican \nHouse, which has sent two good pieces of legislation over here, ought \nto be blamed when the Senate has passed nothing. They brought up \nnothing.\n  It is a bit odd to me also that the President said, ``I am going to \nveto it.'' I saw a commentator this morning say that the President \nwants to act like a good daddy and try to get the Senate and the House \ntogether and put his arm around them and be the person who brings them \nall together. Maybe that would be good if it would happen. It looks as \nif he has taken that hat off and is threatening to veto even a 1-week \nextension of spending that funds the Defense Department.\n  Why? One experienced Senator told me: I will tell you why. Senator \nReid may not have the votes. He may not want to vote on the 1-week CR. \nA lot of his Members are getting tired of this. They know we have to \nreduce spending and we need to fund the Defense Department. If it came \nup on the floor, maybe a lot of Democratic Senators would vote for it \nand it would pass. Maybe they can work out some of these agreements if \nwe have another week.\n  I am just saying that some people think all of this sound and fury is \npolitics. I guess there is some politics in it; that is hard to deny. \nBut this is not the normal political squabble between Republicans and \nDemocrats. We really do face a debt crisis. We really have a \nresponsibility.\n  President Obama's own debt commission pleaded with us to do something \nabout the systemic threat we face from our surging debt that could \nknock down the growth and progress we are just beginning to feel a \nlittle bit here. It could kick us back. Alan Greenspan, former Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve, and as Erskine Bowles, a chairman of President \nObama's debt commission and President Clinton's former chief of staff, \nhave said that nothing could be more devastating to the country than if \nwe had a debt crisis. They are warning us to do something now, not just \na short-term spending level for the rest of this fiscal year but the \nbudget for the next year. They tell us we have to deal with the \nentitlements, the long-term danger they present, as well as the short-\nterm spending levels. I believe Congress knows that.\n  Some say the American people don't believe in cuts; they talk about \ncuts, but they don't believe in them. I don't\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\nthink so. I believe Mr. Christie is hanging in there in New Jersey, and \nGovernor Cuomo in New York is proposing serious reductions in spending. \nHis popularity is strong. In Alabama, my State, Dr. Bentley, our new \nGovernor, just announced that the discretionary spending levels would \nbe cut by 15 percent the rest of this fiscal year. Nothing we are \nproposing is close to those kinds of spending reductions they are \ntalking about in Alabama. We are going to have to do some spending \nreductions. It is going to be meaningful, significant, and it will be \ndifficult to deal with. We should do it carefully.\n  If we bring down this level of spending, it will have a \ntransformative impact. For example, if you take the $61 billion and you \ndid what the House said--reduce the spending level $61 billion--that \nreduces the baseline of Federal spending by $61 billion, and over 10 \nyears we will save $860 billion. That is real money just from reducing \nbaseline spending by $61 billion. We have to think in terms of 10-, 20-\n, 30-year budgets because, as it gets in the outyears, the dangers are \neven worse.\n  I believe we can do this, and I believe the American people are ready \nto face up to these challenges.\n  I salute my colleagues in the House for presenting a budget that is \nhonest. If you want to know what kind of challenges we face, look at \nthat House budget because it deals with them. The budget the President \nsubmitted is filled with gimmicks. When the CBO analyzed the \nPresident's budget, it found over $1 trillion in gimmicks. CBO found \nthat his debt projections were off by over $1 trillion because of \ngimmicks.\n  I think Congressman Ryan's budget is honest. Not only that, it deals \nwith the long-term threats to our economy and our finances. It is \nsomething we ought to consider. If my colleagues have different ways to \nachieve some of the things he achieves in his plan, let's hear them, \nlet's talk about them. Let's make sure seniors are not going to get \nhammered and unfairly treated in any way. We can do that. We ought to \nhave an open and fair debate.\n  The only people who have stepped up and have shown leadership so far \nhave been the members of the House Budget Committee. The President's \nbudget is irresponsible, and the Senate has done nothing. It is time \nfor us to get together, get our act together, finish the funding for \nthis fiscal year, reduce spending every dollar we can, and do a budget \nfor next year that puts us on a path to a sound economy where growth \ncan occur and jobs will be created.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, earlier today the House of \nRepresentatives passed H.R. 1363, a 1 week continuing resolution that \nwill pay our troops and keep the government running.\n  It is a pretty sad commentary on the willingness of the White House--\nand my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--to get serious about \nspending, that we have even arrived at this point.\n  We need to be clear about a few things in this debate.\n  First, we are here because Democrats did not do their job last year. \nAmong the most basic responsibilities of Congress--in fact its core \nconstitutional responsibility--is to take up and pass a budget and fund \nthe core functions of the government for the year.\n  Last year, Democrats had the majority in the House of \nRepresentatives. They had a filibuster proof majority in the Senate. \nAnd, of course, they had the White House.\n  But they were so tied up with pressing matters like passing a $2.6 \ntrillion health care bill that the American people did not want, that \nthey never got around to passing a budget.\n  And then in the fall, as the bottom fell out of public support for \nthe Democrats, they were too interested in salvaging their majorities \nand trying to spin ObamaCare that they never funded the government.\n  So that is why we are here.\n  We are debating a spending bill for fiscal year 2011.\n  It is April of 2011.\n  Fiscal year 2011 started in October of last year.\n  It is very simple.\n  Democrats did not do their job, and so they left it to the new \nRepublican majority in the House to fund the government for fiscal year \n2011.\n  The Republican-led House got to work. They passed H.R. 1.\n  Now I know that it is in the Democratic talking points to call this \nbill extreme, but what exactly did it do?\n  When you strip away the ideology and the rhetoric about this so-\ncalled dangerous and extreme bill, what exactly did it do?\n  Here's what it did.\n  It reduced non-defense discretionary spending by $61 billion. That is \na big number, but let's put this in perspective. This year we are \nscheduled to spend $207 billion just on interest on the debt.\n  This year we have a projected budget deficit of $1,600 billion.\n  And this year, the Federal Government is on pace to spend $3,800 \nbillion.\n  So H.R. 1 was proposing $61 billion in reduced spending by a Federal \nGovernment on pace to spend $3,800 billion.\n  You all have heard the old joke.\n  When someone is asked if they got a haircut, they respond I got them \nall cut.\n  In this case what the Republicans are proposing is like going to the \nbarber and getting just one of the hairs on your head trimmed.\n  The Democrats call this bill draconian.\n  But as one person put it, the spending reductions in this bill are \nequivalent to ordering a Big Mac, a large Coke, and a large fry, and \nthen eating the whole Big Mac, drinking the whole Coke, eating 98 of \nthe 100 fries in the bag, taking a bite of the 99th fry, and then \nleaving the rest. That is hardly a crash diet.\n  But to hear Democrats talk, Americans would starve if H.R. 1 passed. \nThat is not an exaggeration. Former Speaker Pelosi suggested as much \njust yesterday.\n  To hear Democrats talk, this is Armageddon. To hear them talk, this \n$61 billion in spending reductions is so onerous, America will never be \nthe same.\n  Americans aren't buying it. The people of Utah, and people around the \ncountry, understand that if the Senate were to accept the full $61 \nbillion in spending reductions, life would not only go on, no one would \nnotice any difference at all.\n  Let's look at this a different way. Nondefense discretionary \nappropriations have been hiked up by 24 percent in the last 2 years, \nand 84 percent if you count the stimulus bill. But to hear Democrats \ntalk, even beginning to roll back this explosion in government spending \nis akin to shredding the Declaration of Independence. Give me a break. \nThe bottom line is that the cuts in H.R. 1 are more than reasonable. \nPeople who are remotely serious about reducing the size of government \nshould accept them in full.\n  But the White House, and their Capitol Hill allies, do not seem to \nhave gotten the message that Americans want to roll back spending. \nInstead, they are playing politics. They have calculated that if the \ngovernment shuts down--if Senate Democrats refuse to pass and the White \nHouse refuses to sign a bill to reduce spending--the Republicans will \nbe left holding the bag. They think that history will repeat itself, \nand just as in 1995, the public will blame Republicans for a government \nshutdown.\n  Even the New York Times might not be able to carry that much water \nfor the President and his Democratic allies.\n  The American people get this, and they are saying enough is enough. \nIf the White House and its Capitol Hill allies think they can force a \ngovernment shutdown and blame Republicans, they must have zero respect \nfor their constituents. The last week of negotiations has proven yet \nagain that big spending is in the Democrats' DNA.\n  They are congenitally incapable of reducing government spending, so \nmuch so that they are even willing to shut down the government.\n  In the words of John Blutarsky, ``when the going gets tough, the \ntough get going.''\n  But when the going got tough on these negotiations, the Democrats \nwere missing in action.\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\n  The President jetted off to a couple of fundraisers. And his Capitol \nHill allies turned to the rankest of political smears.\n  The incoming chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who \nuntil about 5 minutes ago was scolding Republicans for their lack of \ncivility, hit the ground running and claimed that the budget proposed \nby House Republicans for next year is a death trap for seniors and a \ntornado through nursing homes. So much for an adult conversation.\n  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was quick to \nfundraise off of these spending fights,.\n  In an e-mail to their dare-I-say extreme base, they claimed that \nRepublican negotiators are engaged in blackmail and blamed tea party \ncitizens for the shutdown, rather than the Democratic leadership that \nrefuses to pass the fiscal year 2011 spending bill and move on.\n  I will tell you what. They might have an easy time raising money by \nsmearing conservative Republicans and blaming them for this mess. But \nthis is fool's gold, because they are going to have a heck of a time \nexplaining to our men and women in uniform why it is that they refused \nto pass a bill that would make sure they are paid.\n  Because the Democrats in this chamber will not accept the modest \nspending reductions in H.R. 1, the House took up H.R. 1363 today. This \nis a continuing resolution that will fund the government for a week, \nprevent a shutdown, and fund the Department of Defense through the end \nof the year, making sure that our servicemen and women receive their \npaychecks and that our national security is not compromised.\n  The ball is in the court of this body's leadership.\n  The President has now made it clear that he is willing to shut down \nthe government rather than pass this CR.\n  They have issued a Statement of Administration Policy suggesting that \nthey will veto this continuing resolution if passed.\n  If the President wants to go off this cliff, I can not stop him.\n  But I would encourage my Democratic colleagues here that they do not \nneed to follow him off that cliff.\n  Now, their leadership is saying that it will oppose H.R. 1363 because \nit eliminates taxpayer funding of abortions in the District of \nColumbia.\n  In the end, I cannot believe that they would shut down the entire \nFederal Government in order to appease the most radical pro-abortion \nmembers of their left-wing base.\n  We will see what happens.\n  Maybe the Senate will do the prudent thing and pass H.R. 1363.\n  But I am not holding my breath.\n  The $61 billion in spending reductions passed by the House months ago \nis equivalent to 1.6 percent of total projected federal spending. \nAmericans tighten their belts much more than this every day, but \nDemocrats are acting like these cuts are the end of the world.\n  I would say that the leadership on display from the White House on \nthis issue is pathetic, if there was any on display at all.\n  Because the White House has showed zero leadership on the issue of \nspending and government bloat, because it has refused to make the \ndecisions that would force the Federal Government to live within its \nmeans, we are in this unacceptable situation of a potential government \nshutdown. Our Nation is broke. We have to stop spending money we do not \nhave.\n  But on this most critical of issues the President has been missing in \naction.\n  His advisers seem to be treating this exercise like it is a no-stakes \nHarvard Law seminar in multiparty dispute resolution.\n  But the stakes could not be higher.\n  This situation calls for leadership, but we are getting nothing from \nthe White House.\n  It is time for real leadership that keeps the government running \nwhile cutting spending.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt H.R. 1.\n  In the alternative, we should adopt the House-passed short-term CR.\n  There is no need for a government shutdown.\n  Democrats who think that clever strategists and professional \npoliticos can spin the American people into thinking this is the \nRepublicans' fault, even though it was the Democrats who walked away \nfrom the from the table, should remember last year's experience with \nObamaCare.\n  Reluctant Democrats in the House and Senate were told by the same \nstrategists and professional spinners that ObamaCare could be messaged \nin a way so that it would benefit them.\n  Today there are many former House and Senate Members who wish they \nhad not bought that snake oil.\n  If the government shuts down, no amount of spinning is going to \nconvince Americans that this was the fault of anyone other than the \nPresident and Democratic congressional leadership who have refused to \nmake any meaningful reductions in Federal spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, have you ever noticed when \nsomeone points their finger and says ``it is all your fault, it is all \nyour fault,'' did you notice that there are three fingers pointing back \nat them?\n  Here we have the blame game going on. What we have is politics at its \nworst. In trying to govern a country that is large and diverse and \ncomplicated, as our country is, you have to have people of good will \nwho will come together to build consensus, who will respect each \nother's opinion, who will respect each other, and realize that their \nopinion may not be the only opinion.\n  That is what we have that is leading us to this point. We have folks \nwho are saying, it is going to be my way or no way. And because of the \nvote structures, 60 votes required here in order to pass anything out \nof 100 Senators, we are coming to the precipice, and we are about to \nfall off.\n  It is not supposed to work this way. You can have people who sharply \ndisagree about a particular issue, but when it is time to build a \nconsensus and get it done, you have got to have that capability of \ncoming together. Some people use the word ``compromise.'' But \ncompromise has a dirty connotation. It should not. It is the glue of \nsolution making. And that is what this world's most deliberative body \nfor over two centuries has done so well, is come together to build \nconsensus to govern the country. Notice something else. You do not \ngovern from the political extremes. If the political extreme says, it \nis my way or the highway, you cannot build that consensus in the \nmiddle. Thus, that is the situation we have gotten into. A radical, in \nthis case--we have had it on the left end of the political spectrum in \nthe past, but that is not what this is. This is a radical rightwing \nagenda that is saying, from the House of Representatives, it is going \nto be their way or no way or they are going to shut down the \ngovernment.\n  That is a sad state of affairs. That is saying we cannot come \ntogether and agree and reach a solution. So what is going to be the \nconsequence? Well, do you realize when the government is shut down and \npeople are out of work, this does not just affect Federal employees? \nWhat about those employees in the private sector whose business depends \non being frequented by Federal employees? For example, someone whose \nbusiness suddenly goes down, are they going to be able to pay their \nrent?\n  What about the poor person who is suddenly not going to have a \npaycheck and they are not going to be able to pay their mortgage? Do \nyou think their bank is going to work with them in order for them not \nto be in default?\n  Wait. Let's back up. Look at the experience of my State, Florida. How \nmany banks have worked with people who have been unemployed who have \nnot been able to pay their mortgage, and the banks are not working with \nthem?\n  So if we go out of the government being functioning, and all of the \nactivities of government, what about the airlines? Certain essential \nemployees will have to operate the air control towers and TSA for \nsecurity. But do you think the people who are not going to be able to \nwork in the Federal Government in the hemisphere of aviation, do you \nnot think that is going to ripple through the economy in this example \nof the airlines?\n  What happens if there is that lapse of safety and this time an \nairliner does\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\nnot land safely as we have had where people have fallen asleep in the \ntower?\n  Let's talk about our military. At the end of the day the other side \nis saying, oh, is it not awful that those of us on this side are not \ngoing to pay the military? We are going to vote over and over to pay \nour military. Our leadership is going to make consent requests over and \nover to pay our military if we are going to be shut down.\n  What about our intelligence apparatus, the very apparatus that in far \ndistant lands gets a snippet of information that is passed through the \ngovernmental centers that allows us to avert the terrorists from ever \ndoing the attack in the first place? Is that going to be affected? Oh, \nessential personnel will be there. But what about some of those \nextended personnel we rely on for our intelligence apparatus?\n  Ladies and gentlemen, we are not only playing with fire, we are \nplaying with superheated fire. What about Gabby Gifford's husband, the \ncommander of the next space shuttle mission? They are supposed to \nlaunch April 29. Are all of those workers at the Kennedy Space Center \nwho are preparing the next to the last space shuttle flight going to \ncontinue that preparation? Are they going to lay off the astronaut crew \nbecause they are not essential as they are training in split-second, \nvery precise training?\n  Is CAPT Mark Kelly, United States Navy, going to be able to command \nthat mission to take the final components up to low-earth orbit to \nconnect those final components of the International Space Station? What \nkind of effect is that going to have and be felt throughout the NASA \ncenters all over the country?\n  What about the Securities and Exchange Commission? What about the \nbanking regulators? What about the Internal Revenue Service going after \nthe people who are trying to defraud us? Do you know that we have \nprisoners in the State prison system in Florida--more than any other \nState--who have been putting in fake income tax returns and getting \nrefunds? We have finally got the IRS working with the State prison \nsystem, and they are going to shut that off in the next week. Are we \ngoing to be able to stop that fraud upon the taxpayer? What about the \nfellow who just received a $250,000 IRS refund check, and he has not \neven filed his income tax return, because somebody has stolen his \nidentity and put in a fake return, and fortunately the check got to \nhim, not to the shyster. Are we going to have those IRS personnel to \ncontinue to go after that? You can go on and on.\n  What about our court system? What about the administration of \njustice? This is what we are facing.\n  Rigid ideology, in some cases placed on top of excessive \npartisanship, is now bringing us almost to our knees. If we shut down \nat midnight tomorrow night, and if we go through the weekend, guess \nwhat is going to happen to the Asian financial markets come Sunday \nafternoon, Sunday evening here, when it is Monday morning there, and \nthose Asian markets open up. Oh, and by the way, have not the people of \nJapan suffered enough? The 20 or so ships we have over there trying to \nassist the people of Japan, are they going to have to go on furlough \ntoo?\n  This is the time, as the Good Book says, for people to come. Let us \nreason together. This is the time for people of good will--and there \nare plenty of those people who are Members of the Senate--on this side \nof the Capitol and on the other side of the Capitol to come together. \nCome, let us reason together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Mr. President, like the majority leader, I was here the \nlast time there was a government shutdown. I never believed it would \nreach that point. I certainly didn't believe it would be a long \nshutdown, but it turned out to be over 2 weeks before it was over. It \nwas a period of profound embarrassment for all of both political \nparties who served in Congress that it had reached a point where our \nefforts to find common ground had failed, and we had basically failed \nby closing down the government and calling an end to basic government \nservices.\n  The Senator from Florida went through a partial list. The list could \ngo on and on. What about the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Men and women \nwho risk their lives every day guarding the most dangerous people, what \nis to happen to them as we shut down the government? He raised \nquestions about our efforts to monitor terrorist activities. Those \nefforts are not only exclusively among the military. He mentioned the \nintelligence-gathering operations of the United States. I don't think \nmost people outside our walk of life have any idea how many men and \nwomen get up every single morning, monitoring transmissions of \ninformation, monitoring activity all around the world, looking for that \none shred of evidence that there is something dangerous about to occur. \nThese are Federal Government employees, subject in many respects, many \nof them, to a government shutdown.\n  In the Department of the Treasury is a foreign assets desk that \nmonitors every single day the movement of money, looking for evidence \nof drug cartels and terrorist activities and criminal activity in the \nUnited States and around the world. They share that information with \nlaw enforcement at every level--State, local, and international--to \nkeep us safe. These are Federal employees affected by a government \nshutdown. We just learned our Secretary of State is canceling a major \nconference on Tuesday, bringing in leaders from around Washington and \nthe world to talk about critical issues, because of her fear that the \nDepartment of State will be shut down on Tuesday. We also know, in \nembassies all around the world, men and women literally risk their \nlives to be there representing the United States, offering their \nservices for Americans and others in terrible circumstances, and they \nare going to be subject to a shutdown, skeleton crews.\n  We ask ourselves: Is this necessary? Have we reached a point where \nthere is no alternative? The answer is there is an alternative. The \nalternative is for people of good will to come together and find common \nground.\n  I am closer to the position of Senator Reid because I know, I have \nfollowed his conversations, his reports on the negotiations. I am \ncertain of what I say. When it comes to the dollar amount for budget \ndeficit reduction, we are virtually in agreement. The differences are \nminuscule. We have agreed on the amount of spending to be cut. That is \nno longer a matter of debate.\n  What happened in the last 24 hours is a dramatic shift away from the \nbudget deficit discussion. Now Speaker John Boehner, who is my friend, \non behalf of his caucus, is arguing it is no longer about the budget. \nIt is no longer about the deficit. It is no longer about cutting \nspending. It is about a social agenda, some issues.\n  No. 1, Speaker Boehner insists we have to accept language from the \nHouse which says the Environmental Protection Agency will basically \nshut down its operations when it comes to certain environmental hazards \nsuch as greenhouse gas emissions. Some of us think that is a \ncatastrophic decision, a disastrous decision. The House Republican \ncaucus voted for it, the Republican majority. Now they are saying to \nus: Accept it.\n  Yesterday, we debated that issue. We debated it in the Senate for \nmany hours. The Senator from Florida was here. We had four separate \nvotes on the issue of taking the power away from the EPA. The first \namendment offered received seven votes in the affirmative. The second \none received seven votes in the affirmative. The third one received 12 \nvotes in the affirmative. The fourth\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\none failed with a 50-50 rollcall vote, offered by the Republican \nleader. Has the Senate spoken on this issue? It has. If I remember \ncorrectly, under the Constitution that both House and Senate Members \nare sworn to uphold, there are two Chambers. We disagree profoundly \nwith the House Republican position. For Speaker Boehner to now insist \nthat despite all the debate and activity, it is a ``take it or leave \nit'' on taking away the powers of the EPA is not only unreasonable, it \nis unfair and totally unrelated to the issue of budget deficit \nreduction.\n  But there is a second issue. The second issue, which I find hard to \nbelieve they are now making the fulcrum of the decision on whether we \nshut down the government, is whether we should shut down the access of \npeople across America, particularly poor women and children, to primary \nhealth care in clinics. They have an amendment under title X which \nwould basically stop the funding for access to private health clinics \nfunded by that program. What kind of services do these clinics offer? \nThey offer cancer screening, breast cancer screening, screening for \ninfectious diseases. The basic care we provide to women and families \nacross the country would be shut down by the provision the Republicans \nin the House insist we agree on if we want the government to stay open \nand do business. Is that what the last election was about? I missed \nthat part. I missed the part where the tea party stood and said: We are \nfor fiscal sanity, and we want to close down the access of women to \nbasic health services. I don't remember that at all.\n  I welcome that debate. In the next hour or two or perhaps tomorrow \nmorning, we are going to offer to the Republicans, if they want to \ndebate on the floor that rider that is in the House approach, let's \nhave the debate. Let's have the vote. It isn't as if we are ignoring \nit. We are prepared to face it and vote on it. I know what the outcome \nwill be, and I think the Speaker knows as well. He is going to lose. So \nwhy are we allowing this ship of state to founder over two social \nissues, closing down the EPA's function and closing down women's access \nto health care?\n  That is where they are. It is no longer about the deficit. All the \ndeficit hawks and all the speeches we have heard, that is over. I find \nit hard to believe there are actually people who think a government \nshutdown is a good thing politically. There was a statement printed in \nthe Washington Post this week on April 5:\n\n       Republicans gave the speaker an ovation when he informed \n     them . . . to begin preparing for a possible shutdown.\n\n  An ovation? So some people in that caucus apparently believe a \ngovernment shutdown is a good thing. Some of them, Congressman Pence of \nIndiana, has been forthright and direct. Let's shut it down, he says.\n\n  How do we answer the basic question posed so many times: What does \nthat do to the reputation of the United States around the world, that \nour government is going to shut down? What does it do in terms of the \nstate of our economy which is coming out of a recession, trying to put \npeople back to work? We know what the predictions are. Any government \nshutdown will reduce economic growth at a time when we desperately need \nmore economic growth and more jobs. The longer the shutdown goes on, \nthe worse it is in terms of unemployment and economic growth. We also \nknow that even though some Republicans in their caucus were cheering on \nthe idea of a shutdown, basic services essential to the operation of \nthis government and the safety of our Nation will be in peril and \ndanger. People who literally give their lives in service to the country \nwill be wondering from day to day and hour to hour whether we will \ncontinue to finance the government.\n  The clock runs out at midnight tomorrow night. Between now and then, \nI hope Speaker Boehner comes to his senses and appeals to his \nRepublican caucus and tells them we cannot have everything. Take what \nwe have, this cut in spending, this reduction in spending, which is a \nstep in the right direction. I hope he will say it to even those who \nare cheering the idea of a government shutdown. It is not the right \nthing for America.\n  It is time for men and women of both political parties to stand and \nto represent the best in this country, to make the concessions that \nkeep us moving forward. We have plenty of work to do beyond this. I am \nleaving here to go to a meeting to discuss a bipartisan approach to \ndealing with our budget problems way beyond the next 6 months. If we \nare going to create an environment for bipartisan cooperation, it does \nnot start with a government shutdown. If there are any Republicans who \nbelieve this is a sound strategy, that somehow this will endear them to \nthe American people, I think they are making a mistake. A shutdown \ncould cost the government dearly, and it could certainly cost the \nUnited States in its reputation around the world. I don't want to see \nthat occur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, sometimes when my constituents come to \nWashington I tell them: Welcome to the District of Columbia, 68 square \nmiles of logic-free environment, where perception is reality.\n  I can't think of anything more surreal than the situation we find \nourselves in with the House of Representatives having passed an \nappropriations bill that would keep the government open while \nnegotiations continue and would fund our men and women fighting now \nthree wars around the world to make sure they get paid.\n  I have also had occasion to tell my constituents that Washington, DC, \nis a lot like Disneyland. It is a fun place to visit, but it is not \nreal. When we get in trouble, when Members of Congress get in trouble \nis when they think Washington is real because it is not. What is real \nis what is back home, where people have common sense, try to solve \nproblems working together, rather than play endless political games.\n  I find it outrageous that Senator Reid, the majority leader, and the \nPresident of the United States would refuse to fund pay to the men and \nwomen in uniform by threatening a veto to the House bill sent over \nhere. We know that unless Senator Reid and the President agree to keep \nthe government open, they will be responsible for the shutdown of the \nFederal Government and all the disruption that goes along with it.\n  After the government shuts down, we are still going to have to pass \nan appropriations bill at some level to keep the government \nfunctioning. A shutdown doesn't solve anything, except cause \ndisruption, concern, and heartburn among a lot of good people about \nwhether they will get paid. First and foremost among those are our men \nand women in uniform.\n  The President has threatened to veto the troop funding bill, which is \nH.R. 1263, by saying: ``This bill is a distraction.'' That is according \nto the President's own Statement of Administration Policy issued by the \nWhite House earlier today--``a distraction.'' An attempt by the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives to make sure our men and women in uniform are \nbeing paid while they are fighting three wars around the world is a \ndistraction to the President of the United States. That is outrageous. \nThat is irresponsible. That is an abdication of Presidential \nleadership, and I hope the President will reconsider because funding \nour troops is not a distraction, it is a responsibility. A veto threat \nis not what they deserve nor what they should be hearing from the \nCommander in Chief.\n  About 1 in 10 people who wear the uniform of the U.S. military calls \nTexas home. Those Texans are among the roughly 100,000 U.S. troops \ncurrently deployed in Afghanistan, many of whom are serving multiple \ndeployments away from home and away from their families. Some of them \nare, for example, members of the Texas Army National Guard's 176th \nEngineer Brigade headquarters that is currently handling engineering \nprojects for about one-half of the country. Other Texans are among the \nroughly 40,000 troops still deployed in Iraq. Some of these are members \nof the Texas Army National Guard's 36th Infantry Division\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\nheadquarters that is currently providing command and control for about \none-third of that country.\n  Texans are also supporting the mission in Libya, although many are \nperhaps unclear about what the mission is. Texans are onboard more than \na dozen Navy vessels currently providing humanitarian assistance off \nthe coast of Japan.\n  The President's threat to veto funding for these troops is \nirresponsible and shows his willingness to risk a shutdown of the \ngovernment and deny them the pay they are entitled to rather than to \naccept responsibility and to face the fiscal facts.\n  For nearly 200 days, our Federal Government has operated without a \nbudget because of an irresponsible approach to one of the most basic \nfunctions of the Federal Government: to keep the lights on, to keep the \ngovernment operating, and to accept responsibility for those decisions.\n  We know Democrats, while they controlled the White House and both \nbranches of the legislature, the House and the Senate, failed to pass \neven a budget last year--even a budget. Every family in America, every \nsmall business, everyone other than the Federal Government and Congress \nhas to operate on a budget, but only Washington could continue to spend \nmoney it does not have--about 40 cents on every dollar. Yet I would say \nthe President remains either oblivious to that fact or, I think \nprobably more accurately, in denial about the fiscal crisis that is \nimpending and is apparently unwilling to try to work across the aisle \nto try to address it.\n  I think it is imperative that the majority leader allow the Senate to \nvote on the House-passed measure, which we could do by unanimous \nconsent if not today then tomorrow before the looming shutdown tomorrow \nnight. It is clearly in Majority Leader Reid's hands, and it is in the \nhands of the President of the United States if he would withhold his \nveto, allow negotiations to continue, and to make sure our troops were \nfunded as they should be.\n  The troop funding bill would fund the Department of Defense through \nthe end of the fiscal year, and it represents a bicameral, bipartisan \nagreement that was reached last December on funding of the Department \nof Defense. It is past time for this legislation to be enacted, \nparticularly given that in the months that have passed since December, \nAmerica now finds itself engaged in a third war--entered into without \ncongressional authorization, without any clear mission and, frankly, \nonly 21 percent, according to a recent poll I saw, actually believe the \nmission is clear. Well, I am with the other 79 percent. I do not know \nwhat the mission is.\n  The President said it was a humanitarian mission, although when he \nobligated the U.S. military to go in he immediately outsourced the \nresponsibility for it to NATO, which did not have the assets and the \nresources in order to protect the rebel forces who continue to be \nkilled by Qadhafi's troops.\n  The President said Qadhafi must go. Yet he is doing nothing from a \nmilitary perspective to accomplish that goal. What does that do to \nAmerica's stature and reputation in the world community? What other \ntyrants are watching this President say Qadhafi must go, and yet have \nthis President unwilling to do what is necessary to remove him from his \noffice?\n  Well, I think it not only damages American prestige, it emboldens \nother tyrants like Qadhafi, and it does not solve the humanitarian \ncrisis in Libya.\n  Well, some have said--and the majority whip was here talking about \nso-called riders that accompany this piece of legislation, but let me \nfirst say what this troop funding bill also does. It cuts $12 billion \nin additional spending. When 40 cents out of every dollar the Federal \nGovernment has spent is borrowed money, and we are spending money we do \nnot have, doesn't it make sense to cut Federal spending? Well, I think \nit does. I think anybody who thinks we can continue business as usual \nis just deluding themselves, living in a la-la land that has no \nbearing, has no semblance with reality.\n  This bill would also keep the government operating for another week. \nThis would avoid the shutdown that would occur tomorrow night, and it \nwould allow for more time for bipartisan negotiations to occur.\n  So far as the so-called policy riders go, prohibiting taxpayer \nfunding of abortion in the District of Columbia, well, that has been \nsupported by both Republicans and Democrats in the past. President \nClinton signed similar legislation six times. Vice President Joe Biden \nand Senator Harry Reid have voted for it many times; and President \nObama himself signed this same provision into law in 2009.\n  This troop funding bill also prevents Guantanamo Bay detainees from \nbeing transferred to the continental United States. I think if there \nought to be a consensus about anything, it is that we do not want \ndangerous terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, transferred to \nthe United States. This bill prevents that.\n  This language is virtually identical to existing law that was \nincluded in the National Defense Authorization Act. This bill also \nincludes full funding for our commitment to the U.S.-Israel Memorandum \nof Understanding for fiscal year 2011 and was passed Thursday \nafternoon, this bill, by a vote of 247 to 181 in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I do not know what could be any clearer than if President Obama were \nto veto this legislation--after it was passed by the Senate--that \nclosing the government would be on their hands.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. So this bill has been passed by a substantial majority in \nthe House of Representatives. For Senator Reid to say he will refuse to \ntake this up or President Obama to say--if it were passed in the \nSenate--that he would veto it is irresponsible, and the shutdown of the \ngovernment would clearly be on their hands.\n  This demonstrates a very disconcerting trend that we are seeing of a \nfailure of leadership at the highest office in the land; that is, the \nPresident of the United States--a President who goes to Brazil and \ntalks about, well, I am for free trade, yet has been sitting on the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement, the South Korea Free Trade Agreement, \nthe Panama Free Trade Agreement since he entered office, a President \nwho says he is for bringing down the price of gasoline, for making \nAmerica less dependent on imported energy from abroad, and goes to--\nbelieve it or not--Brazil and says: It is great you are going to be \ndrilling for more oil offshore in Brazil. And do you know what. We are \ngoing to be one of your best customers--in other words, saying one \nthing in America and doing another thing abroad.\n  This is the same President who appointed a fiscal commission that \nreported in December of 2010, which documents the sobering reality of \nthe debt crisis we are facing in this country and what we must do \nresponsibly to deal with it on a bipartisan basis, but in his State of \nthe Union Message, in his budget he has presented, it is not even \nmentioned.\n  We know we have important issues to deal with. This is the most \nimmediate one ahead of us. But this is small compared to the bigger \nissues we are going to have to deal with in just a month or two, which \nis the debt ceiling. America has maxed out its credit card, and the \nPresident is asking us, the Treasury Secretary is asking us to raise \nthe credit limit to allow us to continue to borrow more money.\n  We know that is an unsustainable path. We know the American people \nare sick and tired of the typical gamesmanship and the ``gotcha'' \npolitics in Washington, DC. What they want, I truly believe, is for us \nto work together on a bipartisan basis to solve the problems in front \nof us and not to kick the can down the road, not play a game of \n``gotcha,'' setting up our political adversaries for the next election \nin 2012. That is what this smells like. That is what this looks like.\n  This is irresponsible on the part of the President. It is \nirresponsible on the part of the majority leader to fail to take up \nthis bill and to allow us to vote on it tomorrow to prevent the \nshutdown of the government. It is irresponsible to threaten our men and \nwomen in uniform, fighting three wars across\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\nthe globe, with being deprived of their paycheck by our failure to act, \nby the President's commitment to veto any legislation that were to be \npassed on a temporary basis to stop this government shutdown.\n  I hope the American people will call, write, e-mail, I hope they will \nlet their representatives know that is unacceptable and that Congress \nmust act tomorrow in advance of the deadline; and if the Senate does \npass the bill, that they communicate to the White House, by every means \nnecessary, that, Mr. President, you shall not veto pay to our troops \nwhile we are fighting three wars. To do so not only is an abdication of \nyour responsibility as Commander in Chief, but it is an abdication of \nthe leadership people expect from the President of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know we are rotating back and forth. I \nam the only one on the Senate floor, I think, who is requesting time. I \nask unanimous consent that I be recognized for, let's say, 15 minutes. \nI probably will not use that much time, but I ask that unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, speak in response to \nwhat the Senator from Texas talked about. This is very significant. I \nhappen to be maybe one of the few who voted against the last three \nextensions that were requested--these 1-week extensions. That is no way \nto run government. I understand that.\n  But this one is different, and I rejoiced when I saw we had an \nopportunity to pass a 1-week extension that would do three things: No. \n1, substantial cuts--not these just imaginary things we have been \ntalking about--No. 2, continue the funding for what we must do in \nIsrael for the end of this fiscal year; but, most importantly--and I \nsay this as the second ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--this would be a huge help to our military so there would be \ncertainty, they would know what we are going to be doing between now \nand the end of this fiscal year. That absolutely has to be done.\n  It is unimaginable to me that in the middle of what I call two, maybe \nthree conflicts right now that we are not lining up and making sure we \nhave the funding that is necessary for what is going on in Afghanistan \nand other places where we have our troops in harm's way. It is \nsomething that is inexcusable, and I just cannot believe there is going \nto be a veto.\n  In spite of the veto threat, this is our opportunity to have time to \nbe fiscally responsible, and I hope we are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2241-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2241-S2243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             COTE D'IVOIRE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is not why I am here, however. I want to be sure \nthat something I have been talking about over the last days has now \ncome to a peak where we must do something.\n  I have been concerned about what is happening in Cote d'Ivoire, in \nwest Africa. I am very close to the situation. I have had occasion to \nbe there over the last few years nine different times. I know the \nPresident is there, the current President and his wife, Laurent and \nSimone Gbagbo. I was familiar with the election that came around, so I \nhave been on the floor talking about what I believe should happen \nthere, that we should call for a new election. Unfortunately, the \nUnited States and our State Department--I will be very critical of \nthem--have joined with the United Nations and with France in taking the \nside of Alassane Ouattara from the north who was the challenger, who \nhas been challenging this administration now for at least 10 years that \nI know of.\n  I got a scathing reply from the Ambassador to the United States from \nFrance. I am not going to read it. I am not going to enter it into the \nRecord. It doesn't make any sense. I only wish to respond to a couple \nof things in that letter. First of all, they talk about the fact that \nthis was a legitimate election and it was certified properly and it was \nin accordance with the Constitution of Cote d'Ivoire, and I don't \nbelieve that. I will respond to that by saying the independent \nelectoral commission did not fulfill its constitutional mandate to \nannounce the final provision vote tallies within 3 days. That is what \nthe Constitution says in the country of Cote d'Ivoire and west Africa. \nIt announced then, almost 16 hours after it was constitutionally \nmandated, to report them to the Constitutional Council. It is my \nunderstanding it is the Constitutional Council of Cote d'Ivoire and not \nthe electoral commission which certifies and declares the winner of \nPresidential elections.\n  On three occasions now I have talked about this election and the \nabuses that were taking place. In one case we had information that was \ngiven to me by members of the opposing party to President Gbagbo where \nthey submitted that in one of the five regions in the north--let's keep \nin mind the challenger, Ouattara, is from the north, a Muslim area up \nthere. They had, in five of these regions--in one of them--149,598--and \nI showed how it was calculated. I showed the actual results that were \nthere from the electoral process, and this was just one of five \nnorthern cities. But when the total was officially reported in the \ntotal vote column, Ouattara received 244,000 votes, a difference of \nalmost 95,000 votes.\n  If you do your math and you say this happened in all five of these \nareas in northern Cote d'Ivoire, that would be more than enough to \ndeclare--enough mistakes that would take the election away from the \nduly reelected President, President Gbagbo. If you don't want to get \ninto the weeds that far, all you have to do is look at the results they \nhad. In that election they came out with the results that said Gbagbo \nin those northern precincts--we call them precincts, they call them \nsomething else--that they actually had thousands and thousands of votes \nin what we would call the primary, but when the primary runoff came up, \nhe got zero votes. That is a statistical impossibility. So I have given \nall those things to our State Department, and I haven't gotten any \npositive response.\n  In the accusations in the letter the French say he refused to \naccept--he being Gbagbo--refused to accept proposals by the African \nunion, a high-level group, while these proposals have been formally \naccepted by President Ouattara. It is not true, just flat not true. As \nlate as March 27 the African Union sent former Cape Verde Foreign \nMinister Jose Brito to mediate between Ouattara and Gbagbo. Gbagbo \naccepted the mediation, Ouattara didn't.\n  I have a whole list of the accusations that were made and my response \nto these accusations, and I am going to be submitting them at this \nportion in my presentation in lieu of reading them at this time. I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Inhofe Fact Check on French Embassy ``Fact Sheet''\n\n              (From the French Ambassador, April 6, 2011)\n\n     French say:\n     Fact Sheet on Cote d'Ivoire\n     (April 6, 2011)\n       ``After many delays, including on the part of then-\n     President Laurent Gbagbo, a presidential election was held in \n     Cote d'Ivoire last fall. Since then, its results have been \n     certified by the local monitoring mission and acknowledged by \n     the international community, including the United States, the \n     European Union (EU), the Economic Community of West Africa \n     States (ECOWAS), and the African Union (AU).''\n     Inhofe responds:\n       In fact the Independent Electoral Commission did not \n     fulfill its constitutional mandate to announce the final \n     provisional vote tallies within three days. It announced them \n     almost 16 hours after it was constitutionally mandated to \n     report them to the Constitutional Council. And it is my \n     understanding, that it is the Constitutional Council of Cote \n     d'Ivoire and not the Electoral Commission which certifies and \n     declares the winner of presidential elections. It seems that \n     this election was not carried out in accordance with the \n     constitution of Cote d'Ivoire.\n       In addition, there is evidence of massive electoral fraud \n     in the rebel held north. I submitted this evidence in two \n     letters to Secretary Clinton and am awaiting a response to \n     these specific allegations.\n       I also submitted an electoral document showing official \n     regional electoral returns, where it shows Ouattara receiving \n     a total 149,598 from one of five northern cities. But when \n     the total is officially reported in the total vote column, \n     Ouattara receives 244,471; a difference of 94,873 votes!\n       The evidence submitted to Secretary Clinton includes \n     tallies of precincts where, in the first round of voting, \n     President Laurent Gbagbo received multiple thousands of \n     votes, but in the second round he received zero votes. That \n     is a statistical impossibility.\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\n       From all the evidence I now have gathered, I am convinced \n     that it is mathematically impossible for President Gbagbo to \n     have lost the election by several hundred thousand votes. And \n     if a similar amount of fraud exists in the other four regions \n     of the rebel-held north, Gbagbo is actually the winner of the \n     presidential election.\n     French say:\n       ``Since the results, former President Laurent Gbagbo has \n     not only refused to acknowledge the results, and listen to \n     the will of the people of Cote d'Ivoire, but actually \n     dismissed several initiatives, including by the AU, ECOWAS \n     and other African leaders, to avert any bloodshed and find a \n     peaceful solution of the crisis. Most recently, he again \n     refused to accept proposals by the AU High Level Group, while \n     these proposals have been formally accepted by President \n     Ouattara.''\n     Inhofe responds:\n       Not true. As late as March 27, the African Union sent \n     former Cape Verde foreign minister Jose Brito to mediate \n     between Ouattara and Gbagbo. Gbagbo accepted the mediation, \n     but Ouattara rejected it!\n     French say:\n       ``This deadlock has precipitated a deterioration of the \n     humanitarian situation. In addition, it has led to growing \n     violence, of which the first victims have been civilians, in \n     spite of the presence on the ground of the U.N. Operation in \n     Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI). It is in this context that the United \n     Nations Security Council adopted its Resolution 1975 on March \n     30. This decision was adopted unanimously, including with a \n     positive vote from the United States and the three African \n     members of the Council (namely, Gabon, Nigeria and South \n     Africa). It stresses the protection of civilians, and the \n     need to prevent the use of heavy weapons in this regard, as a \n     key element of the impartial implementation of UNOCI's \n     mandate.''\n     Inhofe responds:\n       There is no evidence that President Gbagbo ordered the \n     shelling or killing of civilians in Abidjan or throughout the \n     country. He has repeatedly denied it, and it is in fact \n     actions by forces under the control of Ouattara who have \n     carried out military and terrorist actions. This consisted \n     of attacks upon police and Army forces by ``invisible \n     commandos'' and the outright offensive launched from the \n     north that has led to the present crisis.\n     French say:\n       ``In Cote d'Ivoire, French forces are acting on the basis \n     of an international mandate given by U.N. Security Council, \n     in support to the internationally constituted U.N. \n     peacekeeping operation (UNOCI).''\n     Inhofe responds:\n       Focus should be on the word ``peacekeeping''. \n     Unfortunately, the United Nations and French forces are not \n     engaging in peace-keeping, but war-making.\n     French say:\n       ``Most recently, their intervention has been strictly \n     consistent with Resolution 1975, and responded to a request \n     to President Sarkozy by UN Secretary-General Ban with a view \n     to support UNOCI as it enforces its mandate. In particular, \n     French forces' intervention in Abidjan has been strictly \n     consistent with this goal, and designed to neutralize the \n     heavy weapons used against civilian populations and UN \n     personnel in Abidjan.''\n     Inhofe responds:\n       Not true. Abidjan is a densely populated city of four \n     million people. In this urban environment, the collateral \n     damage caused by the attacks by UN and French attack \n     helicopters and ground troops has caused hundreds if not \n     thousands of civilian casualties. Specifically, hundreds of \n     youths supportive of President Gbagbo formed a human shield \n     around the presidential palace in an attempt to halt the \n     Ouaratta and French offensive. No one knows how many of these \n     youths have been killed by UN and French forces.\n     French say:\n       ``In the context of its commitment to the protection of \n     civilians and the fight against impunity in Cote d'Ivoire, as \n     in the rest of Africa and worldwide, France reiterated its \n     calls for an immediate halt to all violence against \n     civilians, and underscored that the perpetrators of these \n     crimes must be held accountable before a court of law. France \n     welcomes President Ouattara's pledge in this regard.''\n     Inhofe responds:\n       The only reported slaughter of civilians has been \n     perpetrated by Ouattara forces. This occurred in the western \n     town of Duekoue where up to 1000 people were massacred by the \n     Dozos, traditional hunters who fought alongside Ouattara \n     forces. This has been confirmed by the United Nations and \n     Human Rights Watch.\n     French say:\n       ``France is looking forward to the end of the current \n     violence, and hopes that the constitutional and democratic \n     order will eventually prevail. It is for president Ouattara \n     and the people of Cote d'Ivoire to find the political \n     solutions that will favor a democratic, peaceful, prosperous \n     and reconciled nation.''\n     Inhofe responds:\n       Not true. President Gbagbo has called for an immediate \n     cease-fire several times and has been ignored by Ouattara, \n     the UN and French forces. The killings can come to an \n     immediate end if these forces agree to a cease-fire.\n     Conclusion:\n       This past Wednesday, April 6, marked the 17th anniversary \n     of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. We now know that UN General \n     Secretary Koffi Annan and others knew of the extend of this \n     violence early on, but did nothing about it.\n       We all want to prevent another genocide from occurring.\n       That is why the United States must call for an immediate \n     ceasefire to prevent Ouattara and his rebel army from \n     committing more mass slaughters of the Ivoirians.\n       Lastly, I renew my request to Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee Chairman Kerry requesting that he convene a hearing \n     as soon as possible into the atrocities committed by forces \n     loyal to rebel leader Ouattara, as well as into what I \n     believe were flawed elections that gave legitimacy to his \n     claim of the presidency.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I came to the conclusion that on Wednesday, April 6--that \nmarked the 17th anniversary of the terrible thing that happened in \nRwanda, the genocide--and we have information that actually Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan had knowledge of that. It wasn't shared. We didn't \nhave warning, and we all know 800,000-plus people were brutally \nmurdered in Rwanda during that genocide.\n  What I wish to do now is make sure we are on record in warning the \nUnited States, France, and the United Nations what is going on right \nnow.\n  First of all, if we look--they say it is all decided, everyone has \nmade up their minds, yet President Obiang--President Obiang of \nEquatorial Guinea. He is also the current President of the African \nUnion, or the chief of the African Union. He is on record saying that \nAfrica must be allowed to manage its own affairs, and this is a quote:\n\n       Africa does not need any external influence. Africa must \n     manage its own affairs.\n\n  This is the President who is the head right now of the African Union.\n  President Sarkozy has said--so there is no doubt about whether he has \nauthorized his troops to go in there and participate in these raids \nthat have taken place, two of them that I will describe in a minute. \nFrench President--this is reported on BBC News--Nicolas Sarkozy said in \na statement he had authorized 1,600 strong French Licorne forces in the \ncountry.\n  That shows definitely, and I don't think anyone is questioning that. \nHere is another one:\n\n       One source said soldiers from a 1,000-strong French Licorne \n     force--\n\n  This is a very strong force--\n\n     in the Ivory Coast has been deployed in Zone 4, in the south \n     of the city.\n\n  I think also it is important to see that France has authorized its \nmilitary--and I am reading now from the same report:\n\n       France has authorized its military to participate in a \n     United Nations operation in the Ivory Coast to protect \n     civilians against escalating violence there. The Elysee \n     Palace said the operation aimed to neutralize heavy weapons \n     belonging to troops loyal to President Gbagbo.\n\n  So he is talking about sending them in. Of course, I think most of \nus--I will go ahead and read one more thing here that I think is \nsignificant: ``French helicopters opened fire on a military camp in \nAbidjan on Monday.''\n  That is going to go down in history as ``Black Monday.''\n  If anyone wants to see what was happening with helicopters and \nrockets firing on all kinds of targets near the palace in the residence \nin Abidjan of Ouattara, go to my Web site. We have pictures of that.\n\n       Earlier, French President Nicholas Sarkozy said he had \n     authorized France's military to join a U.N. operation against \n     forces loyal to Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo.\n\n  So, clearly, they are the ones who had--I want to say this: There are \ntwo major assaults on Cote d'Ivoire. I mistakenly thought that the \nFrench were involved in the one in a city called Duekoue. I find out \nlater that they weren't. They were supporting, of course, Ouattara--the \nforces that were there, but they did not have a direct participation in \nit. A man named Guillaume Ngefa, who is the head of the United Nations \nmission in Cote d'Ivoire, said that Ouattara's forces had carried out \nthe killings in Duekoue, and we have pictures--I am quoting them now:\n\n       We have pictures. We have evidence. This is retaliation.\n\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\n\n  That is what the deputy head of the mission in Cote d'Ivoire of the \nUnited Nations mission said.\n  Then: ``We have credible reports of serious abuses being committed by \nOuattara's side.'' That came from Corinne Dufka, a Human Rights Watch \nresearcher based in Dakar, Senegal. It is raising very serious \nconcerns.\n  Then further quotes. It goes on and on. I will enter all of these \nquotes into the Record.\n  But the bottom line here is that Ouattara's forces are the ones that \nwere involved in Duekoue when they--the estimate they have right here \nis that--it comes from Patrick Nicholson, a spokesman for the Catholic \naid agency Caritas, saying that an agency team in town last week on a \nroutine aid mission had found a lot of dead bodies. ``We estimate \nbetween 800 and 1,000 dead,'' Nicholson said in a telephone interview \nfrom Rome.\n\n       They are primarily killed by gunshot, though some of the \n     wounds were made by machetes. I don't think they were killed \n     in crossfire.\n\n  It is interesting, because the forces of President Gbagbo had left \nthat area of Duekoue a week before all of that happened. So that had to \nhave happened with those forces that were Ouattara's. Well, anyway, I \nam still quoting from this, which was printed in the Washington Post:\n\n       Ouattara's forces have also been accused of carrying out \n     reprisal killings and extrajudicial executions of prisoners \n     during their march to the capital.\n\n  Gbagbo's forces had vacated a week before.\n  We have pictures showing the French flags that were on the major \nmassacre that took place and that was the one that took place on Monday \nnight. I have already said all of this on the floor. We have talked \nabout this and the problems.\n  One thing I haven't mentioned is one of the first things Ouattara did \nwhen he marched on Cote d'Ivoire in the south and on Abidjan is to turn \nto release all of the prisoners in one of the major Abidjan prisons--\nthat is some 5,000 prisoners--and military sources loyal to the \nincumbent leader Gbagbo said the doors of the MACA prison--that is the \nbig prison in that area--were opened by forces loyal to the President, \nPresidential claimant Alassane Ouattara, in the midst of an offensive \naimed at Gbagbo.\n  Afterwards, they go into detail as to hearing the gunfire; in other \nwords, releasing prisoners to fight against the sitting President.\n  Residents near the jail said thousands of youths streamed out of the \nprison, which had the capacity of 3,000 prisoners, but was believed to \nbe holding over 5,000, into the neighborhood in Abidjan.\n\n       We heard gun fire early this morning and afterwards the \n     doors of the prison were opened and prisoners were left \n     shouting for joy.\n\n  That is something I have not had in the Record before.\n  One of the things I have to repeat that I have stated before--let me \nask the Chair how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I request an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I wish to speak about one of the testimonials in Duekoue.\n\n       I spot four pigs eating something dark in a charred \n     courtyard. Standing by a newly dug mass grave, a UN soldier \n     from Morocco is choking with rage and grief. I asked him if \n     any of the dead are children. He nods and begins to sob, \n     quietly, into his facemask.\n\n  This is something that has been happening again. We talked about this \nbefore. I don't want to abuse the time we have, but a few minutes ago I \ngot a notice from somebody I happen to know and he says:\n\n       I must admit that it was very difficult. This day too--\n\n  we are talking about in the last few hours--\n\n     has been very confusing with the rebels parading in the \n     streets stealing and dispossessing people of their goods. \n     This is what makes it very dangerous because it is a no law \n     zone. Hundreds of people have started leaving town avoiding \n     the danger in Abidjan.\n\n  That is what is happening right now. The report we have now recently \nis that the Ouattara rebel army is deploying death squads, and I will \nread from this because I think it is very important that we get this \ndown right, because I am going to make some accusations here that maybe \nhave never been made in recent history on this floor.\n\n       I have just received devastating news about the situation \n     in Cote d'Ivoire.\n       I have been told that there are ``death squads'' roving \n     around the streets of Abidjan ``disappearing''--\n\n  they used the word ``disappearing''\n\n     supporters of President Gbagbo.\n\n  Do they kill the supporters of President Gbagbo? Probably so, but \nthey use the word ``disappearing'' because there is no accounting of \nit.\n\n       These death squads are led by soldiers of Ouattara's rebel \n     Army. They have already killed 400 people in the last few \n     hours.\n\n  I am talking about contemporary, right now.\n\n       If we do nothing, this soon will include the murder of \n     President Gbagbo and his wife Simone. Ouattara's armed rebels \n     are supported militarily by the United Nations and the French \n     government. I call on UN Secretary General Ban Kee Moon and \n     French President Sarkozy to condemn and halt immediately \n     these ``death squads.'' If they do not, I charge that they \n     are complicit in allowing these death squads to operate \n     freely on the streets of Abidjan.\n\n  It also calls for immediate cease-fire.\n  I will conclude and say that I remember well, because I was around \nwhen this happened, and when we knew--some people knew, we didn't know \nin advance, what was going to happen in Rwanda. President Kagame didn't \nknow what was going to happen in Rwanda. Kofi Annan of the United \nNations apparently did know what was going to happen and elected not to \nsay anything about it, so that they weren't warned and 800,000 \nmutilations later, we know what the genocide was all about. We know \nnow. We know the death squads are there. The death squads have already \nkilled, according to these reports, some 4,000 people in the last few \nhours.\n  If we don't do anything about it, I have in my own mind--I feel very \ncertain that those death squads run by Ouattara's rebel army will reach \nthe hiding place of President Gbagbo and his wife Simone and their \nfamily, and they, too, will be murdered. If we don't do anything, we \nhave been warned that can happen. We can intervene and stop the death \nsquads roaming around in Abidjan in the country of Cote D'Ivoire.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business until such time as somebody else comes in and \nwants the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2243-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2243-S2261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I didn't get a chance to elaborate on the \nsubject that was covered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn. I think \nit is very important when we are faced with the shutdown of the \ngovernment. I happened to be here in 1995, and I remember, frankly, it \nwasn't as bad as everybody said it was going to be. This is something \nthat is totally avoidable now. We have an opportunity to do a 7-day \nextension that would take care of the military's needs, and I think it \nis important to do so.\n  I wish to also mention the vote that took place yesterday--the last \nvote; we had four--having to do with the overregulation, I will call \nit, of the Environmental Protection Agency. The first three amendments \nbefore they came to mine were offered by Democrats for whom I have a \ngreat deal of respect. In each amendment, they made it clear that the \nauthor--all Democrats--thought it was not the place for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to do what Congress is supposed to be \ndoing in terms of regulation of greenhouse gases.\n  The votes were overwhelming in terms of the fact that they didn't \nhave Democrats supporting them because they were temporary fixes. The \nonly real vote that took place was on mine.\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\n  I introduced legislation several weeks ago, in concert with my \ncolleague over in the House of Representatives, Fred Upton, to take out \nfrom the Environmental Protection Agency the jurisdiction of regulating \ngreenhouse gases. We all know how it happened. We know that since 2003, \nMembers of this Senate have introduced legislation to call for cap and \ntrade under the assumption that catastrophic global warming is taking \nplace from anthropogenic gases, and we have been able to defeat all of \nthose.\n  So while there has been a real effort by this administration to \nregulate greenhouse gases and do it by legislation, when they finally \nrealized that wasn't going to happen, that they were not going to be \nable to garner sufficient votes to pass a bill that would allow for a \ncap-and-trade system--by the way, the cap-and-trade system would have \namounted to between $300 billion and $400 billion a year as a tax \nincrease, which would have been the largest one in the history of this \ncountry.\n  When President Obama decided--in the wisdom of both the House and \nSenate--we were not going to pass anything that would be a cap-and-\ntrade bill, he said: That is fine, we will do it through regulation.\n  That is how this whole thing started. So the effort was for the EPA \nto come up with an endangerment finding which would say that greenhouse \ngases--anthropogenic gases, methane--were dangerous to health. Well, \nthis has to be based on science.\n  I remember asking the Director of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, whom I \nrespect--I said: If you are going to have an endangerment finding, it \nhas to be based on science. What would that be? Well, it was the IPCC, \nwhich, for the edification of anybody who is not aware, is the United \nNations. They are the ones who started this whole thing, and they are \nthe ones who would be in a position to try to force the regulation.\n  Anyway, the time has gone by now, and since that time, we have almost \nunanimity in this body and in the other body, also, that we don't think \nthe EPA has the ability or the authority to regulate greenhouse gases \nand to do administratively what we refuse to do through our own bills \nwe pass.\n  That is where we are today. One of the things I am thankful for is \nthat my amendment got 50 votes. It was 50-50, pretty much down party \nlines. But the people who are voting against my amendment are saying: \nWe want to have the EPA have this authority--the authority of \noverregulation of not just the oil and gas industry but all other \nindustries also. The primary target for them would be fossil fuels.\n  The fact that we have oil, gas, and coal--by the way, there is a \nfairly recent finding by the Congressional Research Service that we \nhave the largest reserves in the United States--recoverable reserves--\nof oil, gas, and coal of any country in the world. This is not \nsomething you hear on the other side.\n  We have heard President Obama say several times that we only produce \n3 percent of the oil and yet we use 25 percent or whatever it is. Those \nare proven reserves. The difference is that a proven reserve means you \nhave to drill and prove it is there. But the government won't let us \ndrill. I am talking about the east coast, the west coast, the gulf, the \nnorthern slope--83 percent of our public lands are off limits. If we \nwere to open that up, we could be completely independent of the Middle \nEast for our ability to run this machine called America. That is why \nthis issue is very important.\n  I have already served notice, but I will do it again to make sure it \nis clear. While we needed 60 votes, we only had 50 votes. I am going to \nput that amendment on as many bills as come up so we have an \nopportunity for people to know the seriousness of this problem.\n  I suggest to you--and I will not name names--that if people, prior to \nthis vote, would have called different individuals, the staff would \nhave responded: Well, we don't know how our Senator will vote, but he \nwill certainly take your comments into consideration.\n  Now we know because we have the votes in so that we can say which \nones did vote for it, and anybody who didn't vote for my amendment is \nsaying they believe the EPA should have that total control that we \nrefuse to give it through legislation.\n  Anyway, it is not over yet. In fact, I think that was a major \nmilestone, a victory. We now know who is for it and who is against it. \nI know there will be another 10 Members who will see the light and \nrealize that we still--it is fine, I am for all of the above, for the \nrenewables--wind, sun, thermal--as well as the fossil fuels. We need \nall of the above to become totally independent and be able to run this \nmachine called America. That is what is coming up. I am happy we have \ntaken the next step, and I look forward to making another step after \nthat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise at this late hour in the \nafternoon to join many of my colleagues who have come to the floor \ntoday to express growing frustration with the politics as usual in the \nCapitol. I say ``politics'' not ``policy'' because I think we should be \nfocusing on policies that will get our country back on track.\n  I have to say, people who are watching the debate are witnessing \npotentially an impending government shutdown that I think is needlessly \nbeing forced on the American people. That is whom we are, after all, \nhere to serve. I know the Presiding Officer feels that strongly. I am \nnot the first person to highlight how disturbing our long-term fiscal \npicture has become, but what is equally frustrating is the disservice \nbeing done to the American public by this current debate on our \nbudget--a budget, by the way, for the second half of 2011. It is not a \nbudget debate we need to have on 2012 or the longer term challenge the \nSimpson-Bowles Commission pointed out.\n  We ought to be focusing on supporting economic development and job \ngrowth. While we are doing that, I believe the Senate and some Members \nof the House of Representatives continue to seek sustained \nconfrontation and seem to me to be interested in shutting down the \ngovernment as a misguided statement that they are serious about debt \nreduction. It seems they want to pick a fight for a fight's sake while \nour people, the U.S. citizens, will be left to pick up the pieces from \na shutdown.\n  The latest demands have not been about funding the government at all. \nI think we have common ground on what the number ought to be. The fight \nnow seems to be on controversial abortion and climate change issues. I \ndo not understand it. We have this tentative agreement to cut billions \nfrom current spending levels, but the Speaker of the House seems to \ncontinue to demand we ought to focus on controversial climate change \nissues.\n  These are hot-button issues. Why we would insert them in an unrelated \nbudget debate when there is so much at stake is beyond me. I understand \nwe want to show the American people we are serious about deficit \nreduction. I am. I know the Presiding Officer is.\n  In Colorado, people see straight through this latest ploy. What do \nabortion and climate change have to do with finding a compromise on \nkeeping our government running? Nothing. They have nothing to do with \nthat. It strikes me the debate has become increasingly ideological and \nincreasingly about sending a partisan political message, one that \nleaves the American people paying the price.\n  We have had 13 straight months of private sector job growth. We have \nadded 1.8 million jobs in that time. But our economy is still fragile, \nand way too many Americans, way too many Minnesotans, way too many \nColoradans are struggling. I have no doubt a government shutdown at \nthis time would create a counterproductive effect on our economic \nrecovery.\n  Do not just take my word for it. I am a Senator from Colorado. Listen \nto what top business leaders of all political persuasions are saying. \nThe Business Roundtable president, John Engler, a former Republican \nGovernor of Michigan, said businesses would face the dangerous \n``unintended consequences,'' where interest rates could\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\nrise because of a shutdown, and there could be turmoil in our financial \nmarkets. Forecasters at Goldman Sachs have warned that a shutdown could \nshave off growth in our GDP every single week. CEOs of all stripes have \nwarned about a shutdown's impact on confidence in the U.S. economic \nrecovery. The Presiding Officer and I know and Senators from across the \ncountry know confidence is what we need to build. That is what is \nlacking in many respects.\n  A setback of this nature, a shutdown would actually prevent the \ngrowth we tangibly need to address our long-term growth and fiscal \nbalance--in other words, get the economy growing again. We will have \nmore tax revenues and we will see the gap between what we are spending \nand bringing in narrow.\n  I cannot help but think, in the context of this debate, about my \nUncle Stewart Udall, the father of Senator Udall from New Mexico. He \nwrote a book called ``The Forgotten Founders'' that focused on the \nsettling of the West. I should add he focused on the people who were \nthere at the time the Europeans arrived.\n  The theme of the book was on how the West was settled, how it was \nbuilt. It made the strong case that people coming out to the West--I \nthink the Presiding Officer's home State, which is in the near West, \nmight fit this characterization--people coming to the West were not \nlooking to get into gunfights or range wars. They were looking to start \ntheir lives over to pursue the American dream.\n  Stewart pointed out that in reality, particularly when we watch those \nHollywood movies, people standing on the board sidewalks watching the \ngunfights were the people who built the West, and they built the West \nworking together, solving problems, looking out for one another. It did \nnot matter what your political party was. It seems to me the American \npeople are standing on one of those board sidewalks watching the same \nsenseless gunfights and range wars right here in Washington, DC.\n  I know I was sent to Washington to work together and solve shared \nproblems. I suggest this spirit I described is in stark contrast to \nthis new kind of divisive politics that is brewing away in America. It \nis the kind of politics that furthers disagreement. It draws \nideological lines in the sand, and it sows disrespect at the expense of \nshared interest and collective prosperity. The American people are \nseeing a disappointing example of that this week.\n  While a vocal minority seems to favor acrimony and combativeness \nwhich, in the end, will further slow our economy, many of us are doing \nwhat we can to do the people's business and try in good faith to \nprevent a government shutdown.\n  As the American people look on in amazement at this spectacle, I \nstand with them wondering if Members of Congress will finally settle \ndown, act like adults, and work collaboratively toward a real budget \nsolution.\n  Yes, we have to reduce our government deficit and debt. One would be \nhard-pressed to find a Senator more committed to that cause than I am. \nLet's reach that goal. Let's reach it in a way that protects our senior \ncitizens, our students, our veterans, our border security--I could go \non with a long list. Let's do it in a way that slashes spending but \ndoes not harm our fragile economic recovery or divert our attention on \ndivisive social issues.\n  We cannot afford a government shutdown. I will be disappointed, to \nsay the least, if the bipartisan deal that is before us is undercut by \ncontentious, unrelated issues such as abortion and climate change.\n  I wrote a letter 2 days ago to the Speaker of the House, Mr. Boehner, \nwhom I know well, in which a large number of my fellow Senators joined \nme to suggest to him and urge him to work with us to avoid a Federal \nGovernment shutdown. I will stay here all day, all night, whatever it \ntakes. I am here to urge my colleagues in both Chambers--I served in \nthe House and I now have the great privilege of serving in the Senate--\nlet's sit down together, let's reason together, let's be commonsensical \ntogether. Let's find a compromise. That is the American way. I know \nthat is what propelled me to the Senate, my willingness to work across \nparty lines. I think the Senate of the United States could set an \nexample. There are colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have \nworked together, and we know the stakes are high.\n  That is the reason I came to the floor, to urge Senators of both \nparties to work together to find a commonsense compromise to keep this \ngovernment moving forward and make sure our economy is focused upon and \nwe produce as many jobs as possible. That is job one.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your attention and for your interest. \nI yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time because we are now only \nliterally hours away from a potential shutdown of government. I must \ntell you that my constituents are angry about this, and I join them in \nsaying this should never happen. There is no reason why we should have \na government shutdown.\n  We know the financial issues, and there have been good-faith \nnegotiations. It is my understanding we have pretty much resolved the \nfinancial issues. And, remember, we are dealing with 12 percent of the \nFederal budget. We need to get to the 2012 budget and get a credible \nplan to deal with the deficit. We all understand that. We are talking \nabout the 2011 budget--the budget that started on October 1 of last \nyear and will end on September 30 of this year. We are over halfway \nthrough that budget year.\n  There are differences between where the Democrats were and where the \nRepublicans were. Everyone understood it couldn't be what the \nRepublicans wanted or the Democrats wanted; that we needed to have \ngood-faith negotiations. Those negotiations have taken place, and it is \nmy understanding we have pretty much agreed on the dollar amounts and \nwe are prepared to move forward.\n  But let me talk a little about what will happen at midnight tomorrow \nnight. I have the honor of representing the people of the State of \nMaryland. There are almost 150,000 active civilian--civilian--Federal \nemployees who live in the State of Maryland. I happened to bump into \none of those Federal employees today who asked me a question. She asked \nme: What am I supposed to do if we have a government shutdown and I \ndon't get a paycheck? I don't have any savings. How am I going to pay \nfor my mortgage?\n  We already have too many people whose mortgages are in jeopardy \nbecause of the weakness of our economy, and now 150,000 Marylanders are \nin jeopardy of losing their paycheck as a result of the inability to \nresolve this year's budget.\n  I also happened to talk to people who run our Metro system here, and \nthey told me if we have a government shutdown it will mean $1 million \nless in the fare box, possibly every day, because of the number of \npeople who won't be taking the Metro because they are not going to be \ngoing to work. A lot of Federal workers are not going to be going to \nwork.\n  Guess what. They are not going to stop at the coffee shop to buy \ncoffee or buy that lunch. They won't be patronizing the shops. It is \ngoing to hurt the small business owners who depend upon that business; \ndepend upon the people who use their paychecks to do their cleaning or \ngo to the different shops. It is going to hurt our economy. It is going \nto hurt innocent small business owners, just at a time that our economy \nis starting to recover.\n\n  I will give another example. A person contacted me today, one of my \nconstituents in Maryland who happens to have an issue concerning the \nneed for a passport to be issued. It needs to be issued rather quickly. \nWe are going to try to accommodate that person to get it done by \ntomorrow. But suppose that call would have come in next week after \nthere is a government shutdown and that person has travel plans that \nnow may be disrupted because we cannot issue that passport. The list \ngoes on and on of people who are going to be\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\nhurt as a result of a government shutdown.\n  We know a government shutdown will actually cost the taxpayers more \nmoney. A shutdown costs taxpayers money, More money than the \ndifferences in our negotiations in the last couple of days will be \nlost. So don't tell the taxpayers of this country that we are having a \ngovernment shutdown to save money. It will not save taxpayer money, it \nwill cost them additional moneys. It will jeopardize our recovery, and \nindividual people will get hurt as a result of the government shutdown.\n  What is the issue? We have already said the money issues--this is a \nbudget debate--have been pretty well resolved. It is not the dollars. \nIt is not the differences you heard--and the differences, frankly, were \nquite small compared to the size of our budget deficit and the gap \nbetween spending and revenues. The issue that is now being raised by \nthe Republicans has nothing to do with dollars. It has to do with their \nsocial policies. It has to do with family planning. It has to do with \nthe Environmental Protection Agency being able to enforce our \nenvironmental laws, the Clean Air Act. Does that sound familiar? It \nshould because we debated those issues on the floor of the Senate \nyesterday, and we took votes on these environmental issues yesterday on \nthe floor of the Senate, as we should do, debating these issues on \ntheir own individual merits.\n  It should not be included in the budget resolution for the remainder \nof this year. That is not the appropriate place for it. We are not here \nto debate the social agenda. Those issues should be done on the bills, \nthe substantive bills that come forward.\n  You sort of get a little suspicious as these issues are being raised \nas to whether, in fact, those who are negotiating on the Republican \nside are sincere in trying to reach an agreement to prevent a \ngovernment shutdown or whether they continuously move the goalposts and \nchange the rules in order to bring about a government shutdown.\n  I must tell you, I was disappointed, as I heard Republican after \nRepublican in the last couple of weeks talk about a shutdown might be \ngood for the country; if we have a shutdown, so be it. Let's do it. \nEven some Republicans calling for a shutdown.\n  I understand there is a problem the Speaker of the House has in \ndealing with the members of the Republican caucus who belong to the tea \nparty, and they are insisting he not compromise; they don't want to see \nany compromise. I understand that, but those Members do not control the \nprocess. We have a majority of the Members of the House and a majority \nof the Members of the Senate who are prepared to move forward with this \ncompromise that will not only keep government functioning but will \nallow us to get on to the real issues of dealing with the deficit of \nthis country by looking at the 2012 budget. There we will be \nconsidering more than just the discretionary domestic spending cuts, we \nalso can take a look at the other programs, including military and \nmandatory spending and revenues, and get a credible plan to deal with \nthe deficit.\n  We have enough votes among the Democrats and Republicans to pass this \ncompromise. We do not have to yield to the extremists on the Republican \nside in the House who do not want to see any compromise whatsoever, but \nwhat worries me is that perhaps the design is to close the government; \nthat is what the Republicans want. I know Speaker Boehner got a \nstanding ovation when he informed his caucus to begin preparing for a \npossible shutdown.\n  These are serious issues--like that Marylander I talked to today who \nmay, in fact, lose her home if there is a government shutdown or that \nconstituent who had planned a trip and found out that because their \npassport will expire shortly, they need to get it renewed before they \nare permitted to enter a foreign country and will need to get that \npassport tended to or lose the opportunity to travel, perhaps, for a \nfamily event or perhaps for business or the taxpayers of this country \nwho are scratching their heads saying: What are you doing adding to the \ncost of government when I thought this was a debate about reducing the \ncost of government.\n  It is not about the dollars. If we have a shutdown of government--and \nI really hope we do not have a shutdown of government, but if we have a \nshutdown of government, it is not the dollar difference, it is the \nsocial agenda that the Republicans are trying to push through this \ndocument, that should not even be on this document, that they are now \nusing as a reason to deny a compromise. It is the extreme elements \nwithin the Republican caucus who are saying let's have this government \nshutdown who will be getting their way.\n  There is still time remaining. I hope common sense will prevail. I \nhope people understand how serious a government shutdown is to our \ncountry, to our image internationally, to our ability to conduct \nbusiness internationally, as well as our ability to provide the \nservices to the people of this Nation who expect those services. We \nstill have time. This is a democracy. Let the majority rule. I think we \nhave the majority of Democrats and Republicans alike who want to bring \nthis issue to conclusion, who know that we have a good compromise done \nright now that compromises the differences between what the Democrats \nwould want and what the Republicans would want. That is how the process \nshould work.\n  Yes, I am here--representing the people of Maryland, including a \nlarge number who work for the Federal Government and a large number who \ndepend upon those who work for the Federal Government and a large \nnumber who depend upon the services of the Federal Government--to say \nlet's get this done, not yield to the few on the Republican side in the \nHouse. Let's get this job done for the people of Maryland and for the \npeople of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, tomorrow night at midnight, unless steps \nare taken, we will be facing a government shutdown. When I say steps \nare taken, steps are taken to avoid that. That can happen one of two \nways: That could be an agreement that funds the government through the \nend of the fiscal year, which would be September 30 of this year, and \nthere are negotiations that continue on dealing with that issue, or \nthere could be a short-term continuing resolution that would take us \nthrough the next week that would enable those who are negotiating a \nlonger term agreement to continue their discussions and hopefully to \nconclude a successful outcome to those discussions.\n  I want to remind my colleagues--and I believe I have been on the \nSenate floor a number of times speaking to this issue, but I think it \nbears repeating--why we are here, why we are in the middle of the sixth \ncontinuing resolution. This is the sixth short-term continuing funding \nresolution that we have had to live with since the end of the fiscal \nyear, which was September 30 of last year.\n  The reason we are here is because last year the Democratic majority \nin Congress failed to pass a budget and failed to pass a single \nappropriations bill. They didn't fulfill the most fundamental \nresponsibility that we have to the American taxpayers; that is, put \ntogether a budget that funds their government. So we have funded the \ngovernment through these successive continuing resolutions. As I said \nbefore, we are now in the middle of the sixth short-term funding \nresolution which expires tomorrow night at midnight.\n  My colleagues on the other side have been coming to the floor and \nattacking the Republicans for wanting to shut down the government. I \nwould say to my colleagues that nothing could be further from the \ntruth. I think everybody here recognizes that no one benefits from a \ngovernment shutdown. Frankly, the effort has been made in the House of \nRepresentatives to pass a long-term funding resolution that would take \nus through the end of the fiscal year, through September 30 of this \nyear, but that failed in the Senate. We had a vote on that. It failed \nand there has not been, since that time, any meaningful effort made on \nthe part\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\nof the Democrats in the Senate to put forward a proposal that might, in \nfact, be able to pass the Senate and ultimately pass in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  So we triggered these discussions between the White House and the \nleadership in the House of Representatives and the leader of the \nDemocrats in the Senate. My understanding is those discussions \ncontinue. I hope they will reach a conclusion, a successful conclusion, \nbut until that time happens we need to do something to make sure the \ngovernment stays open beyond tomorrow night at midnight. So we will \nreceive from the House of Representatives a piece of legislation that \nthey passed earlier today, a continuing resolution that actually \nreduces government spending by about $13 billion, discretionary \nspending, all cuts that have been agreed to by both parties, and also \nextends funding for the military through the end of the fiscal year.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about we need to provide some \ncertainty for our military so they can plan. I agree with that \nabsolutely. I met with members of our military, with our military \nleadership. It is important that we take care of the funding needs that \nthey have through the end of this fiscal year.\n  So what did the House of Representatives do? They took a series of \nspending reductions which had been agreed upon, as I said, by both \nparties; they funded the military through the end of the fiscal year, \nthrough September 30; and they added a couple of provisions to that \nlegislation that had been widely supported by both parties in the \nCongress.\n  There is a ban on abortion funding in the District of Columbia which \nhas been supported by the Democratic leader, the Democratic whip on \ncountless occasions. They included a provision that would prevent \nfunding being used to bring detainees here and try them in the United \nStates instead of at Guantanamo Bay. That is something widely \nsupported. In fact the last time it was supported was when the Defense \nauthorization passed late last year in December, and it passed by \nunanimous consent. So many of my Democratic colleagues are on record \nsupporting all the elements that are in this continuing resolution that \nwill be coming over to us from the House of Representatives.\n  The question then becomes, Who is it that is trying to trigger a \ngovernment shutdown?\n  I am not here this evening to play the blame game. I do not think \nthat serves anybody's interest, nor do I believe a government shutdown \nserves anybody's interests very well. I think the American people \nexpect us to find solutions. They expect us to work out our differences \nbut eventually to agree. I think that has certainly happened in the \nform of this continuing resolution that is coming over from the House \nof Representatives.\n  In fact, it passed the House today with 247 votes, including a number \nof Democrats. There were a number of Democrats who voted with the \nmajority of Republicans in the House to pass a continuing resolution \nthat takes on the issue of out-of-control Washington spending, which \nhas been very clearly documented. We need to get spending under \ncontrol.\n  We are adding to the Federal debt at a rate of $4 billion every \nsingle day, which means by tomorrow night at 6:30--it is 6:30 tonight--\ntomorrow night 6:30 on Friday, we will have added another $4 billion to \nthe debt. That is the debt meter we are running. Every single day we \nadd $4 billion to the Federal debt that we pass on to future \ngenerations.\n  We are borrowing over 40 cents out of every single dollar the Federal \nGovernment spends. We cannot continue to do that. We will take in $2.2 \ntrillion this year, spend $3.7 trillion. That is $1.5 trillion in \ndeficits in a single year. Add that up year after year after year and \nwe end up with a $14 trillion debt, which is where we are today. It is \ngrowing at $1.5 trillion every single year.\n  So we have to get spending under control. I understand there is not a \nlot of appetite on the other side of the aisle for taking on Federal \nspending. In fact, many of my colleagues on the other side thought it \nwas an ambitious proposal when they put forward an alternative to the \nRepublican-passed bill that cut discretionary spending by $61 billion. \nThey put forward an alternative that cut $4.7 billion.\n  That is the equivalent of the Federal debt we will add in the next 24 \nhours. That was their, I guess, idea about a serious effort to \nmeaningfully address deficit spending and debts. The fact is, we have \nto deal with the issue of out-of-control spending.\n  Clearly, the continuing resolution, the short-term continuing \nresolution that passed the House, is coming to the Senate, takes on \nthat issue, but does it in a way that cuts spending--spending cuts \nthat, as I said, both sides have agreed to. It is a mystery to me as to \nwhy our colleagues on the other side would reject a proposal that \nincludes spending cuts that have been agreed upon by both sides.\n  Frankly, if, in fact, it is true, in the reports I have read, that \nDemocrats would accept somewhere on the order of $43 billion in cuts \nfor the balance of the fiscal year, this represents about $12 or $13 \nbillion. So we are still considerably under what they have agreed to in \nterms of a total number, but with regard to the actual cuts that are \nsuggested by the House-passed legislation, they are, by and large, cuts \nthe Democrats have agreed with.\n  So we have agreement on these reductions in spending, we have a \ngeneral agreement that we ought to fund the troops through the end of \nthe year, and we have an agreement on the so-called riders--at least \nthere has been agreement in the past, broad bipartisan support. I would \nargue that the two particular provisions on this bill are provisions \nthat are supported by probably 70 percent of people across this \ncountry.\n  So we have a piece of legislation that has broad bipartisan support, \nthat has come over to us from the House of Representatives, and that \nwould prevent a government shutdown at midnight tomorrow night. It is a \ngreat mystery as to why our Democratic colleagues would not accept that \nand do what I think is in the best interests of the American people; \nthat is, at least get us into next week, where a final negotiation on \nthe longer term continuing resolution can be concluded.\n  We have a problem in this country. We have a government that is \nspending way beyond its means. We have to start living within our \nmeans. We cannot continue to spend money we do not have. The efforts \nthat are being made to reduce spending are long overdue. I hope they \ncan conclude a successful agreement on a longer term resolution that \nwould get us through the end of this fiscal year.\n  But I think it is important to point out, right here right now, that \nwe have an opportunity to prevent a government shutdown, to fund our \ntroops through the end of the fiscal year, and to reduce, in a \nmeaningful way, spending, with spending cuts that have been agreed to \nby both sides in the form of this continuing resolution that was passed \nin the House this afternoon, with a large number, not a large number \nbut a significant number of Democrats supporting it.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues on the other side, and I hope they \nwill work with us to make sure we avoid a government shutdown, that we \nfund our troops and that we make a meaningful dent in out-of-control \nWashington spending. I would, again, as we approach that time tomorrow \nnight at midnight, hope the leadership on the other side will take up \nthat legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives, give \nus an opportunity to vote on it. I will submit there will be a large \nbipartisan vote in the Senate. If we do not have a large bipartisan \nvote, it will suggest that there are a lot of people who have changed \ntheir positions on the issues that are included in this piece of \nlegislation because they are all things that many of us on both sides \nhave supported and I suspect continue to support.\n  That will avoid that witching hour tomorrow night at midnight, where \nthe government shuts down. They have given us an opportunity to vote on \nlegislation that would do that. I hope we will take them up on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I think there are times around here \nthat we lose sight about what real people are doing in our home States. \nI think we lose sight of the struggles, their\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\ndaily struggles, how they live their lives with integrity and honor \nevery day and go to work.\n  Yesterday, we got a call in my office from a young lady. She was on \nher cell phone. She is a nurse, a nurse's aide at the VA hospital in \nSt. Louis. She was on her break, and she was on her cell phone.\n  She talked to the young lady who answers our phone and said: I want \nyou to tell the Senator that I have got kids, and I bring home the \npaycheck. The way I feed my kids is with my paycheck I get working here \nat the VA hospital, and I am scared. I am scared about what is going to \nhappen if all of a sudden I quit getting my paycheck. I have no place \nto turn. I am a single mom, and I am very worried.\n  Then, she said: Would you hold on a minute? Then she handed her cell \nphone to someone else in the break room at John Cochran VA Hospital, \nand then that woman handed the cell phone to another woman. By the time \nthis conversation was over, the young lady who answers the phone in my \noffice had talked to half a dozen women who do not make a lot of money, \nwho go to work every day caring for our veterans in a veterans \nhospital.\n  You know what they all said? Why is this happening? Why is this \nhappening? If Latonya and her friends were here right now, I would say: \nYou know what, that is a darn good question, why this is happening. \nThis is not a game. This is not a game of ping-pong, where we are \nhitting the ball up and down this hall from the House to the Senate, \nfighting over divisive social issues that, frankly, our country has \nstruggled with for decades and will continue to struggle with.\n  This is about running our government and about the money it takes to \nrun our government. That is all it should be about. It should not be a \ntime for us to argue about Gitmo. It should not be a time for us to \nargue about women's reproductive health. It should be about funding our \ngovernment. We have many other occasions we can debate those issues and \ndisagree. And reasonable people do disagree.\n  But now is not the time to debate those issues at the 11th hour, when \nLatonya is not going to get a paycheck to feed her kids. I am for cuts. \nI have been the odd man out many times in caucus fighting for cuts. I \nworked on spending cuts last year with Senator Sessions from Alabama. I \ncontinue to work with Senator Corker about cuts.\n  I am somebody who said the original proposals that my caucus made \nwere way too little. But you know what I am beginning to feel like? I \nam beginning to feel like I have been duped, because I thought that was \nwhat this was about. I thought it was about cuts.\n  Let's review the facts. The chairman of the House Republican Budget \nCommittee and the Speaker of the Republican House said we need to cut \n$32 billion out of the remaining budget this year. I have to tell you \nthe truth. I did not think that was unreasonable. I will admit, I am to \nthe right of much of my caucus on some of this cutting stuff. But I did \nnot think that was unreasonable. So I was glad when we went to the \nRepublicans and said: You know what, we will cut. We will cut what you \nwanted to cut. In fact, we will cut more than what the House Speaker \nand the chairman of the House Budget Committee wanted to cut. That is \nwhere we are today. We have put more cuts on the table than they \ninitially recommended.\n\n  I am beginning to realize this is not about cuts. This is about a \nmuch more extreme agenda that has to do with social policy, not about \nmoney. They keep moving the goalpost. What is the number? They keep \nmoving the goalpost. We have gone more than halfway. In my neck of the \nwoods, that is called a compromise.\n  We have the Republicans controlling the House, the Democrats control \nthe Senate. That is why compromise is so important. What is wrong with \na compromise? Let's do the compromise, fund the government, and get on \nwith it, so Latonya can get her paycheck and the other women who work \nwith her at the VA hospital can get their paycheck.\n  They will not take yes for an answer on cuts at this point. They want \nto make it about something else. Was the CR today just about military \npay? No. No, it was not. I did notice one thing they did not put in the \nCR today. Why will the House Republicans not pass the bill we had asked \nthem to pass to cut our pay if the government shuts down?\n  I will certainly not take a paycheck, and no one should take a \npaycheck. Why is that not being passed by the Republican House of \nRepresentatives? Why was that not put on the CR today? They want to, \nonce again, pass something about moving people out of Gitmo, which has \nnothing to do with the budget for the rest of the year. When they were \ndoing the Gitmo thing, why did they not put the pay for Members in \nthere? Why did that not occur? I know the talking point is that--this \nis one of the talking points we are hearing from the other side: Well, \nyou should have gotten this done last year. We can get it done today--\nwe can get it done today.\n  We have gone more than halfway on a compromise. This is no longer \nabout the cuts. This is not about the money; this is about an extreme \nagenda.\n  Latonya's paycheck and the paychecks of her friends in the break room \nat the VA hospital hang in the balance. Let's review what happened last \nyear on the budget. The Republican Party participated in every \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate, and every Appropriations \nCommittee passed a bill.\n  At the end of the year, that bill was brought to the floor because \nthe appropriators believed the Republican appropriators were supporting \nthe bills they helped write. In fact, those Republican appropriators \nstuffed that bill full of earmarks for Republicans. Hundreds of \nearmarks for Republicans were stuffed in that bill.\n  It was brought to the floor. I remember the night it was brought to \nthe floor. It was in the lameduck. Then the Republicans decided they \ndid not want to support it anymore. By the way, it was not as if \npassing anything around here was easy last year. If anybody was paying \nattention, it was about: Let's drag this out. Let's be stubborn. Let's \nmake sure they have to get 60 on everything.\n  Is there blame to go around that the budget did not get done last \nyear? Sure. There is blame that can go on both sides of this aisle. I \nam not here to say it was the Republicans' fault or the Democrats' \nfault. But certainly it takes a lot of nerve to say the only reason we \ndo not have a budget is because the Democrats were not willing to pass \na budget last year.\n  It was a little more complicated than that, if people will remember \nthe facts as they occurred at the time. So it appears to me now that \nthere are certainly a lot of people down the hall who want the \nshutdown. I was interested when I saw in the paper that when Speaker \nBoehner announced to his caucus they were preparing for a shutdown, he \ngot a standing ovation.\n  Well, I can assure you, there are no standing ovations in our caucus. \nThere are no standing ovations. I will tell you what, when I go to \nsleep tonight, I am going to be thinking about Latonya. I am going to \nbe thinking about her kids and what she is telling them tonight and \nwhat not getting one paycheck means to that family. Just one paycheck \ncan make the difference, can send a family down the path of getting \nbehind on the mortgage, behind on the bills, and then not having a way \nto catch up. That is what we should be thinking about right now, not \nabout those social issues that we disagree on and that we can debate \nand disagree on for many years, as we have for the last 40. But really, \ncan we get a number? Can we make the goalpost quit moving? Can we agree \non the cuts and then get on to the hard work? How embarrassing is it \nthat we are fighting over literally a few billion dollars in \ndifference.\n\n  If this is so much about cutting the debt--for another day, I want to \ntalk about this, but, really, the Republican budget was released this \nweek. Guess what it adds to the deficit over the next decade. The Ryan \nroadmap adds $8.2 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. That is \nhow serious they are getting about the deficit. It cuts taxes for a lot \nof wealthy people. It doesn't do much on the deficit.\n  I am all for cuts. I have stood for cuts. I will continue to stand \nfor cuts. This government has to shrink. But what is going on right now \nis a political game. It is shameful. It should\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\nstop. We should make an agreement on the numbers, move on, and make \nsure Latonya gets paid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise as someone who lives in a State \nwhere we balance our budget every year, where the citizens of Wyoming \nand families all across the State live within their means, balance \ntheir budgets. They know what it means to have to live within a budget. \nThat is why our State is one that currently today does not have a \ndeficit, does not have a debt, a State where every year, by \nconstitutional mandate, we balance our budget. It is time for \nWashington to take a lesson from Wyoming and balance its budget. This \nirresponsible spending must stop.\n  Here we are, a day from when it looks as if we may be dealing with a \ngovernment shutdown, and I am ready to vote. I am ready to vote for a \nbill that already passed the House of Representatives early today. I am \nready to vote to keep the government open and functioning, to make sure \nservices are there. The bill passed the House. People who have studied \ncivics in school realize that is how we make a law in this country. It \npasses the House, the Senate, goes to the President, who signs it into \nlaw. The bill has already passed the House. It is coming to the Senate. \nI don't know where other Senators are, but I am ready to vote.\n  I heard my colleague talk about a shutdown and who was rooting for a \nshutdown. It is no surprise to people who may be watching at home that \nit is former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean who is \nrooting for a shutdown. The former chairman of the Democratic National \nCommittee says:\n\n       I think it would be the best thing in the world to have a \n     shutdown. He is the spokesman for the party of the other side \n     of the aisle. That may be what he wants. I don't want to do \n     that. I want to vote for the bill that passed the House. It \n     is the only proposal that is out there. I haven't seen the \n     Democrats offer anything. Even the New York Times said of the \n     President that he was ``silent for too long.''\n\n  We have heard our previous speaker talk about the social issues. \nLet's remember that it is convenient amnesia for Democrats to talk \nabout that specific issue because the President voted for and signed \ninto law spending bills that included similar--actually the identical \nsocial issue in the past, the one he is opposing today. So did 49 \ncurrent Senate Democrats. They also voted for a spending bill that \ndealt with that social issue. Why all of a sudden today it is \ndifferent? I believe it has to do with what the former chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee said:\n\n       I think it would be the best thing in the world to have a \n     shutdown.\n\n  Republicans are proposing solutions. What do we see from the other \nside of the aisle? We see the senior Senator from New York saying, ``I \nalways use the word `extreme.' '' It doesn't matter what is proposed. \nHe says, ``I always use the word `extreme.' '' There are tape \nrecordings of him saying this. He then said, ``That is what the caucus \ninstructed me to use this week.'' Regardless of how reasonable a \nproposal may be, regardless of the solutions that may be proposed, ``I \nalways use the word `extreme.' That is what the caucus instructed me to \nuse this week.''\n  I travel back and forth to Wyoming every weekend, visit with people \nand sit around at different locations, sometimes a morning breakfast \ngroup, sometimes it is people at lunch, dinners, community meetings.\n  I ask them: How many of you believe you have a life that is better \nthan your parents had?\n  Every hand goes up.\n  Then I ask: How many of you believe your children will have a better \nlife than you have right now?\n  Very few hands go up. That is the problem.\n  I ask them: What is the concern? Why do you believe you have a better \nlife than your parents did but your children will not have as good a \nlife as you?\n  The answer they give is the debt, the reckless spending in \nWashington--reckless, irresponsible, unsustainable. Yet, when we want \nto go ahead today, do cuts in spending, keep the military going, deal \nwith the issue at hand, keep the government functioning so we can come \nback and continue to work on the debt and the spending, this body is \nnot ready to vote.\n  I am ready to vote. I am ready to vote for the only proposal on the \ntable--the one the Republicans in the House of Representatives passed \ntoday. That is real leadership. It is a plan. It will work. It is what \nthe American people are asking for.\n  I have people from Wyoming coming to Washington all the time. They \nsay: We realize things are tough this year. They come and explain a \nprogram that is good for people in the community, good for children, \ngood for seniors--I met with six or seven groups like that today--good \nfor students in school. They say: We know that all of us are going to \nhave to deal with the realities of the facts, that we can't continue \nwith this unsustainable spending where 40 cents out of every dollar we \nspend is borrowed, significant amounts from overseas. Our No. 1 lender \nis folks in China. I say: Is that your concern? That is absolutely the \nconcern I hear around the State of Wyoming.\n  They see that the President of China comes over and tells America a \nfew weeks ago that he wants the Chinese currency to be the currency of \nthe future and the dollar to be the currency of the past. That is \nbecause he knows we have an addiction to spending, and it must stop. \nThat is what I hear from people from Wyoming who come here as well. \nThey say: We need to make sure we get the spending under control.\n  It seems reasonable to get back to the level of 2008 spending. That \nis the level many American families are living under. They balance \ntheir budgets. It is time for Washington to do the same.\n  I know the people in Wyoming. I have visited with a number through \nthe week and in many communities last weekend--in Worland, Caspar, \nLaramie. What they are saying is, get the spending under control, and \ndo it in a reasonable manner. But for someone to come from the other \nside of the aisle and say he thinks the best thing in the world to do \nis to have a shutdown and for another person to say he always uses the \nword ``extreme'' because that is what his caucus instructed him to use \nthis week--that doesn't solve the problem. That doesn't let us find a \nsolution. There is a solution on the table right now. It is a solution \nthat has been proposed. This Senate ought to be voting on it tonight.\n  For the President to say he is going to veto it shows that the \nPresident is truly not engaged in this process. He has been silent too \nlong, according to the New York Times. His budget that he has proposed, \nthe Economist, a world-renowned, respected publication, called \n``dishonest.'' That is not the kind of leadership we need. We need \nsomeone in the White House fully engaged, taking an active role, and \nmaking sure we get back on a course that is responsible, that allows us \nto live within our means, as families know, because we have to stop \nspending money we do not have. Stop spending money we do not have. That \nis the way for Washington to behave in a responsible way, to make the \ndifficult decisions necessary for the future of the country, to focus \non the issues that affect families and their needs. Families who are \ntrying to deal with kids and bills and a mortgage know what it means to \nhave to live within their means.\n\n  When we see policies coming out of this administration that are ones \nmaking the pain at the pump even worse, as families are noticing they \nare paying $700 on average more for gasoline this year than last year, \nthat is money that is not available for other bills or for a mortgage \nor to help with their kids. Those are the issues they are facing, \npeople trying to pay for their own health insurance, realizing the \nincreased cost of the insurance because of the Obama health care law \nthat passed way over the objections of the American people, crammed \ndown the throats of the American people by the other side of the aisle.\n  The American people are saying: This is absolutely wrong. That is why \nI think we saw last November the election results we did across the \ncountry. That is why we see people continuing to stand up and speak out \nacross the country. That is why people continue to go to townhall \nmeetings and share their views about the problems happening in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\n  It is interesting. When I think of the great Presidents through the \nhistory of our country--we all have our favorites--I think of Ronald \nReagan. He said that you can't be for big government and big spending \nand big taxes and still be for the little guy. We have on the other \nside of the aisle people who are for big government, big spending, and \nbig taxes. They are not for the little guy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have been listening to the remarks \nof my friend from Wyoming. I noticed that he repeatedly indicated that \nwhat we needed to do in this building was to keep the military funded, \nto deal with the deficit, and to cut spending. It is my firm belief \nthat if we were sent a bill that kept the military funded, that dealt \nwith the deficit, and that cut spending, it would pass in the Senate \nvery readily. Indeed, we have already agreed to $73 billion in spending \ncuts. As Senator McCaskill said earlier, the problem is that the \nRepublicans won't take yes for an answer.\n  The issue dividing us at this point is not the need to keep the \nmilitary funded. We completely agree on that. It is not the need to \ndeal with the deficit. We agree on that. Indeed, the last time we \nsuccessfully dealt with the deficit, it was under the Democrats. \nClearly, we have gone way more than halfway by agreeing to cut $73 \nbillion in spending. So as to those three points, the answers are yes, \nyes, and yes. So what is the problem?\n  The problem is two riders that are being insisted on in the \nnegotiations, one of which would eliminate funding for Planned \nParenthood and the second of which would gut the Clean Air Act--Planned \nParenthood and the Clean Air Act. I thought this was about the deficit. \nI thought this was about solving our fiscal situation. The facts are a \nlittle different.\n  Here we are, mere hours away from the first government shutdown since \nNewt Gingrich forced one during President Clinton's first term. We are \nfacing some 800,000 Federal workers being furloughed; millions more, \nincluding men and women in uniform, who will begin working without pay. \nProjects will grind to a halt. People working under government \ncontracts will stop. There will be a real danger to our fragile \neconomic recovery that is just starting to gain steam. Why take that \nrisk?\n  In front of cameras all week, Republicans have been saying that \ndespite these dangers, they will threaten a government shutdown because \nwe need to tackle the deficit. The story behind the scenes is quite \ndifferent. Even though the tea party has focused 100 percent of its \ncost-cutting fury on only 12 percent of Federal spending--only the \nnonsecurity, so-called discretionary spending--we agreed to the level \nof cuts Republicans wanted. Nothing on the revenue side, everything on \nthe spending side, and only from 12 percent of the budget, and yet we \nwere still able to come far more than halfway to where the Republicans \nare, virtually within single-digit billions of dollars of agreement. \nYet we still find ourselves without funding for the government beyond \ntomorrow night.\n\n  We have heard today that it has to do with the fact that we did not \npass a budget last year. Well, we did not pass a budget last year, but \nwe tried. As Senator McCaskill pointed out, she and I were on the floor \nwhen the omnibus spending bill came to the floor. It had been \nnegotiated in a bipartisan fashion. It had come through all the \ndifferent appropriating committees. It would have funded the government \nthrough September 30. We thought we had an agreement, and at the last \nminute all of the Republicans who had agreed to it changed their minds, \nliterally while we were on the floor. The bill went down. One \nRepublican Senator even took to the floor to gloat about the end of \nthat bill.\n  So it is a little bit of crocodile tears to blame the Democrats for \nnot having an appropriations and budget bill at this point from the \nside of the Chamber that took that bill down, that pulled their \nindividuals who had participated in that bipartisan bill out of the \ndeal, that filibustered it, and that shut it down. That is why we are \nhere today. The minority party used its filibuster power, walked away \nfrom a deal it had already signed off on, and took down the spending \nbill. So here we are. It is important to stay somewhat close to the \nfacts.\n  So now the Republicans are using the deficit concerns, which I think \nSenator Barrasso said very clearly: Keep the military funded, deal with \nthe deficit, and cut spending. That is what we are prepared to agree to \ndo. But the bill we are being asked to agree to now is a Trojan horse. \nIt is a Trojan horse that looks like a deficit bill, but inside it is \nfilled with tea party ideology. It is filled with an extremist \nrightwing political agenda to do things like eliminate Planned \nParenthood and give America's polluters free reign in violation of the \nClean Air Act as it has been determined by the U.S. Supreme Court to \napply. This is no longer about the deficit; this is about trying to \nforce a very radical agenda down America's throats in a Trojan horse \nthat looks like it is about the deficit.\n  What is it really about? Well, you do not have to go very far from \nthis building. Just a few days ago, outside, you had the tea party \nralliers, and what were they chanting outside of the Capitol? They were \nchanting, ``Shut it down. Shut it down. Shut it down.'' That is what \nthe tea party wants. That is why we are here. And, sure enough, when \nthe Speaker went to his caucus on the Republican side and announced to \nthem--to the people who are actually here making decisions in this \nCongress--that he was notifying the administrative staff on the House \nside to prepare for a shutdown, what was the reaction? It was a \nstanding ovation supporting the Speaker in that.\n  So on the outside of the building, you have the tea partiers \nchanting, ``Shut it down. Shut it down. Shut it down.'' You have the \nextreme Members of the House Republican caucus out there with the tea \npartiers, egging them on, ``Shut it down. Shut it down. Shut it down.'' \nThey come back into the building. The Speaker says: We have to get \nready to shut it down. They give him a standing ovation. They could not \nbe happier about this. They load the bill up with things that have \nnothing to do with funding the military, nothing to do with cutting the \ndeficit, nothing to do with bringing down spending, but instead \naccomplish ideological missions that the Republican Party has been on \nfor years.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Absolutely. I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank him for his outstanding remarks. My \nquestion is this: Isn't it true we have had many, many Republicans in \nthe House, Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, some Presidential candidates, \nerstwhile potential Presidential candidates, as well as even some of \nour colleagues here, Republicans, saying they want to shut down the \ngovernment?\n  My question to the Senator is, I cannot recall a single Democratic \nelected official saying they want to shut the government down. My \nsecond question is, Doesn't that show something about who is itching \nfor a shutdown or at least thinks they can use the shutdown to \naccomplish an agenda?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I agree with the Senator from New York. I cannot \nrecall a single Senator expressing any desire for a shutdown. I have \nbeen present in our caucus meetings. Not one person has once said there \nis anything good about a shutdown.\n  We are all gravely concerned about what a shutdown would do to our \nfragile economic recovery. This is still about jobs, ultimately. We \nstill have to grow an economy in this country. And when we shut down \nevery government contract and put those people out of work, when we \nshut down every government project and put those people out of work, \nwhen we take paychecks away from government workers and when we \nfurlough government workers, what does that do to the economy? Any \neconomist will tell you it strikes a terrible blow. We recognize that, \nand that is why no elected Democratic official has said one good word \nabout a shutdown.\n  That is very different from what we are seeing from the other side, \nwhere standing ovations, where chanting mobs, egged on by sitting \nMembers of Congress, where public statements by candidates for \nPresident and by Members of Congress have all said that the shutdown--\n--\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. My time has expired. I thank the Senator from New \nYork for his question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and would share a few \nthings.\n  If my Democratic colleagues would prefer not to shut the government \ndown, then do not do it. The House, the Republican House, has passed a \nbill to fund the government, to fund the Defense Department, and the \nSenate, the Democratic Senate, has passed nothing. Indeed, the \nDemocratic leadership proposed a bill that they said was worthwhile \nthat would have reduced spending by $4.6 billion. Ten Democratic \nSenators defected from the leadership position--a pretty gutsy thing to \ndo on an issue as important as this.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to yield for a question, although my \ntime is limited.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator for his courtesy in yielding for \na question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. Go ahead.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If, in fact, this is really about the deficit and if, \nin fact, this is really about reducing spending and if, in fact, this \nis really about ensuring the military remains funded, why is it \nnecessary to have it be a nonnegotiable condition of the bill that \nPlanned Parenthood be zeroed out and that the EPA be prevented from \nenforcing the Clean Air Act? I do not see that there is any connection \nbetween those two requirements and the deficit, and I think, if the \nparty were willing to give up those two demands, we could solve this \nvery quickly. It is those two demands that are fouling things up and \nforcing a shutdown.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I appreciate the Senator's comment. I would like \nto respond to that. The House has sent over a bill that does not have \nthose provisions in it--a 1-week extension, and it funds the military. \nIt is available to be passed, also, and would allow further discussions \nand negotiations on how to complete the last of the year without \naffecting the military.\n  I just have to tell you, I have no desire to fund Planned Parenthood, \nthe largest abortion provider in America. Maybe that is what you think \nFederal taxpayers ought to spend their money on, but I do not. But that \nis not the critical issue.\n  The critical issue is how much we spend. I certainly agree with that. \nThe House has sent over legislation, both for the whole fiscal year and \nfor a short term, to continue it. If this government is shut down, it \nwill be because of the Democratic Senate and the threat of President \nObama to veto this legislation if it were passed. Why don't they bring \nit up for a vote? Perhaps it is because a number of Democrats who are \nuneasy about this reckless spending might feel that voting for this \nwould be a good way to continue the negotiations and work through it \nand it might pass. So the President has now jumped into the middle of \nit and proposed to shut the government down.\n  And I do not appreciate my colleague--who is fine; we serve on the \nJudiciary Committee together--talking about that this is all extremist \nrightwingers. Give me a break. He said: They really have this secret \nagenda. They pretend it is all about the deficits. It is not about the \ndeficits. It is about some extremist rightwing agenda.\n  He then launches into a full-fledged attack, as has Senator Schumer, \non the tea party, some of the best people in our country who got \nterribly afraid for our Nation and went out and marched all over \nAmerica--millions, tens of millions--who had never before done anything \nlike that. I talk to them all the time. Are these bad people?\n  And let me tell you, Erskine Bowles, former Chief of Staff to \nPresident Clinton, chosen by President Obama to head his debt \ncommission, came before the Budget Committee just 2 weeks ago, and he \nand Alan Simpson, his cochairman, issued a written statement: We are \nfacing the most predictable economic crisis in our Nation's history. \n``Predictable crisis'' means we could be thrown back into another \nrecession or a depression. When asked by Chairman Conrad, our \nDemocratic chairman, when this might happen, what did President Obama's \nchairman say? Two years, maybe a little before, maybe a little later. \nAlan Simpson piped up: I think 1 year.\n  Hopefully this is not so. Hopefully, we are not going to have a debt \ncrisis in a year or 2 years. But these people who took testimony for \nweeks and months and provided their opinion on how to fix our debt, \nthey say we are facing a debt crisis that could put us into a recession \nand surge unemployment, even though it is just beginning to come down a \nlittle bit. This is not a Republican-Democratic squabble. These are \nDemocratic leaders who warned us.\n  Alice Rivlin headed the other commission with Pete Domenici, our \nformer chairman of the Budget Committee. Pete Domenici, now retired \nfrom the Senate, said: I have never been more afraid for my country--\none of the most eloquent orators I have ever heard in the Senate--never \nbeen more afraid for my country. When you have deficits--this year, we \ntake in $2.2 trillion and spend $3.7 trillion--borrowing 40 cents of \nevery dollar we spend, we are creating a nation at risk. That is what \nwe are talking about.\n  So this past election, it was a big issue. All over America, \ncandidates ran for office, and the ones who were the big spenders, who \nwere in denial about the danger the Nation faces, got shellacked. \nSixty-four Republicans got elected to the House--the biggest Republican \nvictory in 80 years--over one issue, really. Spending, that is what it \nwas.\n\n  When we came into the Senate they had only passed, when they had this \nsupermajority in the House and in the Senate, a 5-month continuing \nresolution. The Democrats didn't pass a budget nor did they pass a \nsingle appropriations bill. So everybody knew that after this election, \nthe funding level was going to be reduced. The American people had \nspoken.\n  He walks in, our majority leader, Harry Reid, and says, We will cut \nspending by $4.6 billion out of $3,700 billion we spent. Give me a \nbreak: $4.6 billion out of $3,700 billion that we spent is somehow \nsignificant? The House only recommended $61 billion in the last 7 \nmonths, but that makes a difference. When you reduce the baseline, $61 \nbillion--and the interest you save--$61 billion plus interest, it adds \nup to $860 billion saved over a 10-year period. That is coming close to \n$1 trillion in savings, by that one act. But when you spend on the \nupswing, likewise, you end up raising the baseline and surging spending \nand debt. That is why we have to get responsible, and when we do, we \ncan make a bigger impact than a lot of people think.\n  I remain unhappy and stunned that my Democratic colleagues are in \nfull-fledged attack on the good and decent people who stood up and \ncomplained about what was happening in Washington and now don't \nhesitate to attack the tea party as extremists. I object to that. I \nthink it is wrong.\n  We are in a serious problem. I think many of my colleagues--I know \nmany of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have expressed to \nme that we need to do better, that we have to change the trajectory we \nare on. I think there is a real possibility for bipartisan action, but \nit is only a possibility. I actually have been fairly hopeful, but--we \nhave had a lot of talk on the other side of the aisle, but I haven't \nseen anything moving--nothing--except the President's budget.\n  The Senator from Wyoming said ``The Economist Magazine'' called it \ndishonest. It is. What they said about it was it has been found false \nby five different fact checks. They say it calls on us to live within \nour means. The budget director said it will allow us to pay down our \ndebt, when the lowest single deficit we are projected to have under the \nbudget the President submitted to us is $748 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We are on the verge of \na\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\npossible government shutdown, which is extraordinarily regrettable.\n  Controlling the deficit and paying down the debt is a critical \npriority of this country and must be done. It is a difficult challenge, \nbut not insurmountable. We have done it before. In the 1990s I was a \nMember of the House of Representatives under President Clinton. We were \nable to push through an economic program that did not focus exclusively \nand entirely, as the Republican proposal does, on domestic \ndiscretionary spending. It looked across the board at not only domestic \nspending but defense spending. It looked on the revenue side. It also \nlooked at some of our entitlement programs. The result from the 1993-\n1994 action of the Democratic Congress was that by 2000, when President \nBush was sworn in with a Republican Congress, there was a projected \nmultitrillion-dollar surplus. We were looking at robust employment.\n  I think it is sometimes difficult to listen to some of my colleagues \ntalk about the deficit and President Obama when recognizing, under \ntheir leadership, President Bush and a Republican Congress, a surplus \nwas turned into a huge deficit. In fact, President Bush doubled the \nnational debt in 8 years. It had taken almost more than 200 years to \naccumulate a debt he doubled.\n  So we are here and prepared to make those reasonable and responsible \ndecisions that will lead us forward to a balanced budget and, \nhopefully, to what we accomplished under Democratic leadership and \nPresident Clinton in the 1990s--hopefully--even some surpluses going \nforward. But it can't be done in 2 weeks. We can't undo what has taken \nplace since 2000 in 2 weeks or 2 months. It is going to take a \nconcerted, collaborative effort.\n  One of the problems we have had, frankly, is that the goalpost has \nbeen continuously shifting in terms of Republican proposals. My \nrecollection is that last year the Republicans on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee insisted on a cut of roughly $20 billion from \nthe President's budget request for fiscal year 2011. Then, this year, \nthe House Appropriations Committee, under Republican leadership, \nproposed initial cuts of $33 billion from the fiscal year 2010 level. \nDays later, the Republican leadership decided that was not enough, so \nthen it became more than $60 billion, with cuts in everything from EPA \nwater and sewer grants to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \nto Head Start--programs that are critical to working families and \ncommunities. Also, these investments are critical at a time when our \neconomy is just beginning to regain some of the economic traction it \nhad before. We are seeing some encouraging employment numbers. We are \nseeing some increase in consumer demand. This Draconian approach to \ncuts could very seriously undermine the emerging--not yet complete--but \nemerging recovery.\n  In addition to the numbers that keep moving around, the proposal of \nthe Republican House is studded with special interest riders--social \npolicies, not fiscal policy. In fact, there is the impression sometimes \nthat the deficit reduction claims are an excuse to try to advance not \nthrough the legislative process but through the appropriations \nprocess--through the threat of a shutdown--very conservative social \npolicies. These policies should be debated. They should be voted upon. \nBut to try to present them as nonnegotiable demands with the penalty \nfor failure to heed to their demands the shutdown of the entire U.S. \nGovernment is, I think, inappropriate.\n  The President and Leader Reid have been meeting with House Republican \nleadership continuously. There was a sense that a proposal of about $33 \nbillion in cuts from the appropriate baseline could be accomplished, \nbut then that seems to keep moving again. This is unlike 1995 when we \nsaw the last shutdown of this government by a Republican Congress. \nAgain, this is becoming almost ritualistic. A Republican House is \nelected, and then within months there is a shutdown of the government. \nThe 1995 shutdown lasted about 26 days. It cost about $1.4 billion in \nessentially dead weight lost to the economy and to the government. We \nare on the verge of repeating that mistake.\n  Back in 1995, we weren't engaged in two conflicts with American \nservice men and women engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan. We were not \nparticipating in a very volatile NATO operation involving Libya. We had \nyet to see the threat of international terrorism unleashed so \ndramatically on our shores as it was on 9/11. Again, if this government \nis shut down, there are thousands of civilians and civilian contractors \nwho are part of our intelligence services that are at least in limbo as \nto whether they can continue to provide us the information and the \ninsights we need to protect ourselves against a still existing and now \nclearly obvious threat. These are much more challenging times.\n  Indeed, for months now, in terms of a response to why the economy \nisn't growing, many of my colleagues have said, Well, it is the \nuncertainty of the Obama policies. That was the argument last year for \nthe extension of the income tax cuts not only to middle-income \nAmericans but to the wealthiest Americans. That uncertainty would breed \na lack of investment, a lack of focus on job recovery. What could be \nmore uncertain than shutting down the Government of the United States \nwithout any plan to bring it back and, indeed, without any clue as to \nwhat is the critical issue that must be addressed? At one point it is \ndeficit; at another point it is social policy. That uncertainty I think \ncould lead--I hope it does not--to a lack of confidence in our capacity \nto govern which will ripple through economic markets worldwide, and \nwhich also I think could challenge perception of the United States as a \ncoherent world leader.\n  There are some things that would unfortunately result from such a \nshutdown. We know military Federal pay will be delayed. In fact, \nuniformed military will be required to come to work, as they do, so \ndedicated to the service of this Nation, but their pay will cease the \nmoment we shut this government down. Literally, there will be soldiers \non the ground--sailors, marines, airmen in Iraq and Afghanistan--\nfighting and they will not be paid and their families at home will not \nreceive those benefits. The Federal Housing Administration will not be \nable to endorse any single-family mortgage loan. So if you are ready to \nclose on your loan next week, you have the downpayment and you are \nready to go, because the FHA will be out of business. SBA-guaranteed \nloans for business working capital, real estate investment or job \ncreation--for those things that are trying to move the economy--\nstopped, dead in their tracks. So if you are a small business man or \nwoman, you are ready to expand your company and hire more people, \nsorry, the SBA is closed until further notice. The IRS cannot process \ntax refunds for those who are filing paper returns and are depending \nupon their tax refunds, as so many working families do, to get through \nthe next several months.\n\n  We didn't get here overnight. In 1993, Democrats saw these same \nproblems: a deficit that was prolonged and gnawing at the economic \nfabric of this country. We took deliberate action. It took several \nyears, but within those several years, by the end of President \nClinton's administration we saw a surplus, a robust employment \nsituation, and the future looked very good to working families.\n  In 2001, as I indicated, President Bush came into office with a \nsurplus, but after tax cuts that were unpaid for, two costly wars that \nwere unpaid for, and an unpaid-for extension of our entitlement program \nin terms of Part D Medicare--the largest, by the way, expansion of \ngovernment entitlements in many decades--we are now looking at a huge \ndeficit.\n  President Obama came into office at a time when unemployment was, in \nmy State, reaching beyond 12, almost to 14 percent. He was, I think, \nrequired to take appropriate action. With the Recovery Act, we were \nable to begin to restore some of the jobs. We have seen over the last \nyear growth in civilian jobs, the private sector workforce, that we \ndidn't see under President Bush. In fact, recent reports suggest over \n200,000 jobs. Those are the kinds of numbers that have to be sustained, \nnot undercut, and you don't sustain them by shutting down the \ngovernment and shutting down agencies such as SBA and the Federal \nHousing Administration.\n  We are and have to work diligently. I hear my colleagues talking \nabout\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\nreaching out, collaborating, and I hope that is the spirit we embraced \nin the last several hours. But we have heard many other statements \ncoming, particularly from across the Capitol in the other Chamber, \nabout how we have to shut this government down, how we have to go ahead \nand make a point, not make sound policy. That is not going to lead us \nto a better future for American families.\n  I believe we have to be responsible. We have to recognize the \nproblems before us will take months, if not years, to fully resolve, \nbecause it took years, not days or weeks, to accumulate. We have to \nrespond to the troops in the field, not only to order them into battle \nbut to support their families at home.\n  We have to be responsible to families all across this country and \ngive them a chance to use their talents to contribute to this country. \nI urge responsibility at this moment, not a shutdown of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that of the 10 \nminutes allotted to this side, I be allowed to have 3 minutes and \nSenator Moran 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on the question of funding the Defense \nDepartment, it is a very serious matter. We need to handle that \ncorrectly. I will just recall for my colleagues that the House has sent \nlegislation to us that would fund the government for an additional \nweek, with a reduction in spending of $12 billion, but that would fund \nthe Defense Department for the rest of the fiscal year and take that \nmatter off the table, guaranteeing there would be no disruption of the \nDefense Department.\n  We should do that. We should have already done that. Senator \nMcConnell, our leader on the Republican side, has said he will not \nsupport any more CRs unless we do fund the Defense Department. I have \nto suggest, however, that it appears to me our colleagues are using the \nDefense Department as a hostage and as leverage to the threat of \nshutting down, or partially shutting down, the Defense Department; the \nthreat of that is used to sort of say that we are not going to cut \nspending anymore. So that is a fight we are in.\n  We have heard the discussion about riders, but the new CR the House \nsent to us today doesn't have those riders on it, and it is not a \nproblem in that regard. I do think it is irresponsible for the \nPresident of the United States--the Commander in Chief--to threaten to \nshut down the government.\n  The Republican House has sent a bill over that funds the government \nand funds the Department. The threat to shut down the government is \ncoming from the Democratic side. I don't think the people are going to \nbe fooled. I do believe the American people's voices will be heard. The \namount of reduction in spending makes a difference in how much is saved \nover a decade.\n  Nobel Prize laureate Gary Becker; a superb economist, John Taylor; \nand former Secretary of State, George Schultz did a Wall Street Journal \narticle recently, noting that under our spending--spending now is 24 \npercent of GDP--if the House bill that cuts spending by $61 billion \nwere passed, we would be spending 20.0 percent of GDP--a one-tenth of 1 \npercent reduction in spending from another calculation.\n  I yield to my colleague from Kansas. I am delighted to have him in \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. MORAN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I come here tonight one more time. I am a very short \nterm Member of the Senate--only about 3 months. Every time I have \nspoken on the Senate floor, I have talked about the importance of \nreining in spending. With the crippling nature of our national debt and \nthe belief that if we don't resolve these issues, the future of our \ncountry is at stake, it is really one of the primary motivations I have \nfor serving in this Congress: to see that we turn this country around \nfor the benefit of our children and grandchildren.\n  I think Kansans would say it is time for all Members of Congress to \ncome together and fund the government. A shutdown demonstrates once \nagain how we lack the ability or the desire to just use some common \nsense and reach a common goal. A primary function of Congress is to see \nthat we appropriate the necessary funds to provide for government.\n  Today, it seems to me we have come to the point at which this issue \nneeds to be rapidly resolved. We are down to just a few billion \ndollars--and certainly a billion dollars is a lot of money to Kansans \nand to me, but we need to resolve this issue so we can move on to the \nmore dramatic and important issue we face as Members of the Senate, as \nAmerican citizens--that being next year's budget and the future of \nadditional spending down the road.\n  Tonight, in addition to saying let's resolve this issue, let's \ncontinue to fund the government, let's not pursue the strategy of a \nshutdown, I am here to express my genuine concern about the tactics \nthat seem to be ongoing today, in which we, as the Senator from Alabama \nsuggests, are holding hostage our service men and women and their pay.\n  We have had a lot of discussion in Washington, DC, about who is an \nessential government employee. I will tell you there could be no \nquestioning the fact that our service men and women are essential \ngovernment employees, and they will be working regardless of the \nconsequences, regardless of the decision made here about the so-called \nshutdown.\n  From my view, it makes absolutely no sense--in fact, it is immoral--\nto ask our service men and women to serve in harm's way and have to \nworry about the paycheck that feeds their families--and, in fact, most \nof them live month to month, live paycheck to paycheck. The idea that \nwhile they are serving and sacrificing away from family, they would \nhave the additional concern about whether the paycheck is going to \narrive and be deposited in their accounts seems to me to be something \nbeyond the pale, something we could never expect from a Congress of the \nUnited States of America.\n  So I am here one more time to say, yes, absolutely; let's get \nspending under control. The idea that we cannot go back to 2008 \nspending levels plus inflation--we can do that. Nobody should believe \nthat we cannot accomplish that goal, and nobody should be using the \nservice men and women's paychecks and their service to our country as a \nhostage or the idea of whether this government is shut down. Resolve \nthis issue now and make certain we resolve it in a way that no member \nof our Armed Services, or their families, is harmed by the decisions we \nmake.\n  This is an important decision. It is about the future of our country. \nThe immediate concern is whether our service men and women understand \nthat we value their service and that we will take every step to make \ncertain they are not harmed by political inaction--the inability of us \nin Washington, DC, to resolve the issue of the continuing resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a meeting at the White House. There \nwill be no more votes tonight. We hope that we are able to have some \ngood fortune at the White House. We are going through these issues.\n  As I indicated outside the door, I am not as confident as I was. The \nlast 24 hours have not been kind to the American people. This is not a \ndebate between Democrats and Republicans, it is a debate between \nRepublicans and Republicans. They cannot determine how many social \nissues they want. The funding is pretty well taken care of, but that is \nnot where we are.\n  We are here trying to fund the government at the end of the fiscal \nyear based not on money but on social issues, some of which have been \nin this country for 40 years. We have not settled the issues in 40 \nyears; we will not do it in a few hours. I am not optimistic. I hope \nthings are better when I get to the White House and we can work it out.\n  What is going on is really too bad for the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to share my deep concern that we \nare careening toward a shutdown of the government. Just a little more \nthan 24\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\nhours from now--tomorrow night--our government will shut down if this \nChamber and the House Chamber cannot come together and put a simple \ncontinuing resolution on the President's desk.\n  There is a lot that we should be proud of. One is to be a nation that \nhas been a light for the world, presenting the ideals of democracy in \naction and advocating for and defending human rights. We should be \ndeeply pleased that we have fought for fair working conditions and \neconomic opportunity for Americans across this great land. We should be \nproud of the tradition of public education that gives children an \nopportunity to fulfill their full potential. We should be deeply \npleased of our history, advocating for freedom of speech, freedom of \nassociation, and freedom of liberty. All of these things are part of a \nlegacy for our Nation, a part of what this Chamber has been about.\n  But we should not be pleased and we should not expect that this \nChamber is now engaged not in those great and lofty ideals but in a \nvery small argument over an extension of the budget for 6 months, and \nthat we are so dysfunctional that we are risking shutting the American \nGovernment down for one of the few times in its history. That is not \nthe model we wish to show to the world.\n  I am deeply frustrated by what has transpired since 2000. The first \n11 years of this century--indeed, the first 11 years of this \nmillenium--have not been kind ones for the United States of America. In \n2000 we were running huge surpluses. I was back in Oregon as part of \nthe legislature and very excited by the fact that we were paying down \nour national debt.\n  Economists were starting to debate whether we should pay it down in 3 \nyears or 5 years; do we need to keep a substantial debt for some \nstrange economic reason or should we pay the whole thing off. I was \nthinking, isn't that a great debate to have, because we are going to \nhand a debt-free nation to our children.\n  Mr. President, I think we all share the thought that there will be \ndiscussions tonight and we will not shut the government down. That is \nwhat this debate is about right now.\n  It goes back to the point that in 2000 we had a new President come in \nwho decided that paying off the debt wasn't that important. No, \nPresident Bush said we should have bonus breaks, big giveaways to the \nwealthiest Americans, and he did so without paying for them in any \nother manner. Then we had a war launched in Afghanistan.\n  Instead of the President coming forward and saying we must sacrifice \nand pay for this war, it is important to our national security, he came \nforward and said: American citizens, please keep spending a lot of \nmoney in retail stores. That is the way you can participate in this. So \nthe debt was greatly increased to pay for that war.\n  Then we had the President launch a war in Iraq--the same President, \nPresident Bush--and he proceeded to give away the Treasury to the \nwealthiest Americans. He decided not to pay for the war in Afghanistan. \nPresident Bush decided to launch a war in Iraq, on completely false \npremises, and to do so without paying for it.\n  Then we had Medicare Part D, which happened in that same 8-year \nperiod--a huge expansion of a government program that has and will \nindeed help many Americans, but it was not paid for.\n  Those four decisions doubled the debt from $5 trillion to $10 \ntrillion, but doubling it was not enough. Indeed, the Bush \nadministration did something else; they created a house of cards out of \nthe most important financial document for every American family, the \nhome mortgage. By deregulating retail mortgages, they allowed liar \nloans, undocumented loans. They allowed teaser rates, 2-year really low \nrates that mortgage agents used to talk people into subprime loans when \nthey qualified for prime loans--steering loans that were regarded as \nsuch for steering families from prime loans into subprime loans.\n  Then they took all of those faulty subprime mortgages and packaged \nthem into securities and allowed a new, unregulated form of insurance \nto back up those securities. Those were called swaps or derivatives. A \n$50 trillion unregulated industry came upon the American scene, and \nthose securities ended up in every financial institution around this \nNation. This great house of cards, which corrupted the fundamental \nvalue of primary wealth for most Americans, and the humble fully \namortizing prime mortgage--subprime mortgage--was turned into an \ninstrument of mass financial destruction.\n\n  That financial destruction that was brought down on our house in 2008 \nand 2009 added another $4 trillion to the debt. We went from $5 \ntrillion to $14 trillion. That process continued this last December \nwith a compromise that added another $500 billion to the debt, a \ncompromise I could not support because it added $500 billion additional \nto the debt.\n  I had a lot of hope in January, 3 months ago, that we had a new group \ncome in and we had a new Congress, the 112th Congress, and we were \ngoing to proceed to create jobs and do so by ending some of those \nfrivolous giveaways, those massive oil and gas giveaways that line the \nbottom line of some of the deepest pockets in our Nation, those rules \nthat prevent us from negotiating drug prices which results in our \nseniors on Medicare paying higher prices for drugs than seniors \nanywhere in the world, even though those drugs were invented right \nhere, a potential savings of $6 billion per year; those bonus breaks \nfor billionaires, on top of $100,000 per taxpayer, up to a million more \nfor many taxpayers. Taking those bonus breaks away is a savings of $50 \nbillion a year; ending duplicative Pentagon programs identified by the \nSecretary of Defense, a savings of $75 billion--all of these \nopportunities, and so many more, to bring our financial house into \norder.\n  But those hopes were soon dashed because the new team in the other \nHouse of the Congress did not decide to fight for jobs, did not decide \nto fight to get rid of frivolous programs. Instead they decided to lay \nout a plan that attacks the very communities that have been most hurt \nby the previous disasters because that meltdown, that mortgage meltdown \nthat haunted us in 2008 and 2009, destroyed the wealth of basic \nAmericans of their homes, homes lost enormous value, it proceeded to \ndestroy jobs that those families counted on, huge job losses, it \nproceeded to wipe out their retirement savings. No wonder so many \nfamilies today do not have confidence that their lives, the lives of \ntheir children will be better than their lives. For so many families--\nin fact, their current life is not better than their parents' life was \nbecause of these kinds of devastating decisions.\n  The new arrivals said: No, we are going to increase the harm. We are \ngoing to attack the community development grants that build community \norganizations. We are going to attack the heating programs that keep \npeople from freezing. We are going to diminish the food programs that \nkeep people from starving. We are going to attack women's health \nprograms, programs that have nothing to do, by the way, with abortion, \nbut preventive programs, screenings, Pap screenings, breast exams. We \nare going to wipe those out because of misguided ideological opinions. \nAnd now we find a bill that says we are going to dismantle Medicare. We \nfind an attack on housing for veterans. These are not the things that \nwill bring jobs to America. These are not the things that will rebuild \nAmerica.\n  On top of all of these attacks on specific programs, my colleagues in \nthe House decided to create a whole long list of ideological riders to \nadd to the budget debate. I have a copy, 4 pages, of policy riders to \nH.R. 1. It goes on and on, everything one can imagine, from Job Corps \ncenters to training for our unemployed Americans. It is a huge list. It \ndefunds the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that will guard \nagainst the corruption of mortgages I was discussing earlier. It \nattacks the EPA's ability to enforce the Clean Air Act. And so on. It \nis an unbelievable list all Americans should see to see what the true \nagenda is on the other side of Capitol Hill.\n  Now is the time to set aside these games, these ideological riders. \nNow is the time to set aside these attacks on the core programs that \nstrengthen our communities. We are past the time to have the ability to \ndo a simple 6-month extension of our programs in the United States of \nAmerica so we can go\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\non to debate fiscal year 2012. But not everybody is ready for that \nserious debate.\n  We have been hearing a lot of chanting at rallies that they do want \nto shut down the government over these ideological riders. Indeed, on \nApril 5, the Washington Post reported Republicans gave the Speaker--\nthat is on the House side--an ovation when he informed them to begin \npreparations for a possible shutdown. They want the shutdown because \nthey want this ideological fight.\n  After proceeding through devastating mistake after devastating \nmistake that increased our debt $5 trillion in 2000--remember, it was \nheading down toward zero--to nearly $15 trillion, we still cannot have \na serious discussion. We have folks who want to shut down this \ngovernment over these ideological riders.\n  We must return to understanding our role in the Senate and in the \nHouse in terms of the broad and challenging and important issues facing \nAmerica--the issue of providing fundamental services, the issue of \ncreating jobs, and the lofty goals of advancing democracy and human \nrights and civil rights around this planet.\n  Now is the time to set aside those shallow ideological games, focus \non rebuilding our economy, and putting America back on track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise first to salute my colleague from \nOregon for his eloquent words and his passion. I know he has dedicated \nhis life to making the lives of people better. That is why he feels \nstrongly about how badly a government shutdown would affect average \nfolks.\n  I agree with him. Simply put, there is no reason for a government \nshutdown--absolutely no reason at all. A genuine bipartisan compromise \nwith significant and responsible cuts in government spending is in \nhand, but it is being vetoed by an extreme minority of the Republican \nParty. The tail is wagging the dog. The most extreme, the people least \nlikely to compromise, the people, in general, with less experience in \ngovernment and at least from their statements little respect for views \nnot their own are dominating the House of Representatives.\n  Speaker Boehner is somebody for whom we all have a great deal of \naffection and sympathy. But the hour is nigh and leadership is called \nfor. To allow this small group--relatively small group when we look at \nthe expanse of our government--to dominate everything that is happening \nand hurt millions of innocent people is not leadership.\n  When the Speaker says there is no agreement on the numbers or the \ncuts, he means he is not ready to say so publicly. It is true I have \nnot been inside the negotiating room, but I have heard all the details \nfrom my friend and colleague Harry Reid. I have heard the details from \nthose who have been negotiating.\n  The bottom line is, the number and what composes that number of cuts \nis virtually agreed to. The only reason there is not a handshake is \nSpeaker Boehner and his representatives do not want it to appear the \nnumbers are signed off on, for two reasons, in my opinion. One, they \nare afraid what these hard-right colleagues would say, and two, then it \nwould focus everything on their true casus belli, which is the riders.\n  This is no longer about spending. The hard right in the House of \nRepresentatives wants to make this about ideology, injecting last \nminute ideological add-ons, such as limiting preventive health for \nwomen. We have a fiscal crisis in this country, not a social crisis.\n  Let's not gloss over what is going on. Republicans do not care about \nreducing the deficit; otherwise, they would not have paraded out a \nbudget this week that ends Medicare for our seniors but protects \ntrillions in tax breaks for corporations and millionaires. Care about \ndeficit reduction, yes, you would want to cut Medicare, but you would \nalso want to make millionaires pay their fair share of taxes because \nevery dollar from the millionaire goes just as much to reducing the \ndeficit as a dollar from Medicare cuts. When you do one and not the \nother, you do not care about deficit reduction. You may care about \nshrinking the government. You may wish there is no government at all. \nThat is a perspective of some. But you do not care about deficit \nreduction.\n  One of the things that has not been made apparent is cutting \ngovernment programs to many on the other side of the aisle is not in \nsync with reducing the deficit, and those two are too often confused.\n  Why are we here? Why are we on the eve of a shutdown of government \nwhich will hurt millions? It is because this hard right in the House of \nRepresentatives--some of them members of the tea party, others allies \nof the tea party--want to satisfy the agenda of the extreme rightwing. \nAnd if they do not get everything they want, they have made their \ndesire clear. We do not have to make this up.\n  Here is Mike Pence, one of the leading Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives, one of the leaders of the tea party caucus. What does \nhe say? ``Shut it down.'' That is what he wants. Either he thinks he is \ngoing to get his way by shutting it down--I grew up on the streets in \nBrooklyn and there were people who thought that just by bullying they \ncould get their way. Shut it down if you do not do it all my way. \nBullying does not work, and we will not be bullied. We will not hurt \nmillions of people. We will not abandon our principles because the \nother side believes we will do whatever they want--falsely believes we \nwill do whatever they want--because otherwise they will shut the \ngovernment down.\n  We do not want to shut the government down. I have not heard a single \nDemocrat say what Mike Pence has said. But I have heard lots of \nRepublicans--I heard Sarah Palin talk about the shutdown being a good \nthing. I heard Newt Gingrich talk about a shutdown being a good thing. \nI heard some of Mr. Pence's colleagues, probably a dozen or so in the \nHouse of Representatives, saying ``shut it down'' is a good thing.\n  Have you heard a single Democratic elected official say it? No. That \nalone should tell you who wants to shut the government down or who is \nwilling to shut the government down and who is fighting strongly \nagainst it.\n  They want to shut the government down if they do not get their way. \nAs I said, I have seen people do things like that growing up on the \nstreets of Brooklyn. You know what you learn? If you keep giving in and \ngiving in, they ask for more and more. The way to deal with someone who \nis attempting to bully you is to stand up to them. We have gone so far \nin their direction. President Obama said to Speaker Boehner, it is \nreported: You have gotten three-quarters of what you want. Why don't \nyou declare victory and go home?\n  We know why Speaker Boehner cannot do that. It is very simple. \nBecause then there would be a rebellion among a key part of his \nconstituency--the hard right, many of them, but not all of them \nfreshmen in the House of Representatives. Most of them have very little \nexperience in government. I daresay most of them do not know the \nconsequences of a government shutdown or the kinds of cuts they are \nsuggesting. But they come in with an ideological narrowness.\n  When either party lets the extremes dominate, they lose. When \nRepublicans let the hard right dominate, they lose. Frankly, we learned \nour lesson as Democrats. When we let the hard left dominate, we will \nlose too because most Americans are somewhere in the middle.\n  This idea of shutting the government down or of applauding, a \nstanding ovation when the Speaker informs them to begin preparing to \nshut the government down, I guarantee you it will backfire on the \nperpetrators, just as it did on Newt Gingrich in 1995. But that is \npolitical consolation, small consolation for the damage that will be \ndone to individual people who will lose jobs, to the economy. Just one \nfact: FHA will not be able to issue any guarantees on new mortgages. \nFHA issues 80 percent--guarantees 80 percent--of our mortgages, \nincluding mortgages for the middle class, the bulk of mortgages. \nMiddle-class people will not be able to take out mortgages. What does \nthat do to our economy and the housing sector?\n\n  The Internal Revenue Service will not be able to mail out a good \npercentage of refunds. What does that do to the economy, when the money \nis stuck in Washington instead of going back to people who rightfully \nown it and who\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\nwill spend it in the stores and shops and on vacation?\n  There are other irresponsibilities. We have American troops fighting \nabroad. We want to make sure they are fully funded. A government \nshutdown will not do that. Colleagues on the other side are coming up \nwith an unbalanced, short-term extension that funds the troops. Well, I \nsay to my colleagues, if you want to fund the troops--not for 1 week--\ndon't shut the government down. That is the best way to support our \ntroops.\n  It is time for Republicans to be responsible. It is time for the \nmajority of Republicans--whom I don't agree with on so many issues, but \nwhom I know are mainstream and don't like this government shutdown--to \nstand up to those on the hard right, to accept the compromise we are so \nclose to working out and drop the ideological riders so we can move \nforward.\n  We are at a crucial time in this country. We have had a rough few \nyears. We are beginning slowly to climb our way out of it. This is \nrisky. A government shutdown is risky. The shame of it all is that it \nis so easily avoided. All we need, again, is a little bit of strength \nand courage from the Speaker to tell the hard right in his party, yes, \nhe will try to accommodate some of their needs, but he will not shut \nthe government down; tell them, yes, we do have to cut government \nspending. And we Democrats--the vast majority of us--agree with that. \nWe don't believe in cutting things such as cancer research or loans \nthat go to students who are going to college, but there is a lot of \nwaste in the government, there is a lot of excess, and we can wring \nthat out without hurting people and reduce our deficit. We agree.\n  The proposals we have made, including $73 billion below the \nPresident's proposal for this year, show we have put our money where \nour mouth is. But every time we come close to an agreement, Speaker \nBoehner--not on his own, in my judgment, but pulled by the tea party--\npulls the goalposts back. He pulls them back on the numbers. Although \nwe have gone so far, it is hard for him to do that any longer. But he \nalso does it with these ideological riders.\n  We are at a sad moment. We are at a time when the continuation of \nthis government--with the hard-working people who compose it--is right \non the edge of closing, with untold damage to innocent people. I would \nask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and in the other \nbody--I would plead with them--let's stop the political games, let's \nstop the ideological posturing, let's stop thinking it has to be only \nmy way and no one else's. Let's come meet in the middle with a \nreasonable agreement, keep the government going and move forward to do \nthe things the American people have asked us to do.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I came to the floor the other night to \ntalk about what I had learned in 2 years of townhall meetings in \nColorado regarding our deficit and regarding our debt. What I said the \nother night was that people in our State, whether in red parts of the \nState or blue parts of the State, have a commonsense way of approaching \nthis, and they have a three-part test they want to apply.\n  The first test is they want to make sure we actually come up with \nsomething that materially addresses the problem we face. They are tired \nof gimmicks. They are tired of tricks. They want us to sort this out. \nThey know it will not be fixed overnight, but they want us to get \nstarted on it.\n  The second test is that we are all in it together. They are tired of \nthe us-against-them conversation that happens in Washington. They are \ntired of hearing that one person's ox is going to be gored or one group \nof people's ox is going to be gored and everyone else will be left \nalone. Everybody wants to contribute to solving this problem.\n  The third test is they want it to be bipartisan. Because, frankly, \nthey do not have confidence in either party on this issue and they want \nto see us working together.\n  That is it. We should be working toward that as a Senate and as a \nHouse. We should be having a serious conversation about how not to \nleave our children stuck with a bill of $15 trillion in debt and a $1.5 \ntrillion deficit. I feel that keenly, as the father of three little \ngirls myself.\n  But I think it is very important for the American people to \nunderstand the debate we are having right now. The threat that we are \ngoing to shut the government down has nothing to do with the broader \nconversation about our deficit and our debt. In fact, shutting the \ngovernment down is going to make matters worse.\n  I said the other night that there is not a superintendent of \nschools--I used to be one in Colorado--there is not a city council or a \nmayor in Colorado, from the largest city to the smallest town, who \nwould dream--who would dream--of saying to their constituents: We can't \nwork this out, so we are going to close the government next week. We \ncan't work this out, so we are not going to plow your snow next week or \npick up your trash next week or educate your kids next week, not one \nlocal official in our State. The Presiding Officer knows this. He was a \nmayor. He would never have gone to his constituents and said: Oh, by \nthe way, we are closing next week because we have a disagreement.\n  It makes no sense. Nowhere on the planet would that make any sense. \nTo say nothing of the fact we find ourselves at a moment in the \ncountry's history when we are engaged in wars all across the globe, \nwhen we are now involved in a multilateral effort in Libya, when we \nhave thousands of people--government employees--trying to help the \nJapanese weather this unbelievable tragedy they are facing, when we \nhave economic competitors all over the globe trying to seek an economic \nadvantage against the United States in the 21st century. Yet we are \nsaying: Well, we are going to take a time out because we can't agree. \nWe are going to pause, take a rest, close the government. The American \npeople must think, well, you guys must be very far apart. That is why I \nbrought this chart. I don't know the exact details here. Nobody does. \nThe reports on the news tonight were that several billion dollars \nseparated the negotiators. I have heard it ranges from $5 billion to \n$10 billion, or somewhere in there, so I picked the number $7 billion, \nwhich is more than several. But that appears to be what divides the \nparties--$7 billion. Seven billion dollars.\n  That is a lot of money. It is a lot of money. But look at it in the \ncontext of our deficit and our operating budget. Here is this line. You \ncan't even see it. This line is the $7 billion, right here. This is our \ndeficit, and this is our operating budget--$1.5 trillion, $3.6 \ntrillion.\n  I apologize, Mr. President, but I couldn't fit it on one chart so I \nhad to have two made in order to show what the order of magnitude of \ndifference is between what we are squabbling over here in Washington, \nand what our deficit looks like and what our operating budget looks \nlike. That is it. That is it. That is it.\n  Do you know, this difference, if this were the city of Alamosa--and \nthe former mayor is the Presiding Officer--and my State--which has \nroughly a $14 million operating budget in the San Luis Valley--if they \nwere saying we were going to shut down our government based on this \ndifference, that would be like Alamosa saying, we can't figure it out \nbecause $27,000 is what we are apart.\n  Mr. President, if you and I went to Applebee's tonight and we had \ntheir $20 dinner for two, and then we had a fight over the bill, we \nwould be fighting over 4 cents. That is what would separate us--roughly \n.19 percent of our operating budget.\n  I could even understand if the parties were saying we disagree, we \ndisagree, let's keep negotiating. But I can't for the life of me \nunderstand how on those terms anyone could threaten a government \nshutdown, especially when we confront the dangers we confront today.\n  And so the answer is, it is not about our budget. The time we have \nconsumed here is taking time away from the conversations that the \nPresiding Officer and I have been part of, that\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\npeople on the other side of the aisle have been part of, that the gang \nof six, a bipartisan group of Senators--three Democrats and three \nRepublicans led by Mark Warner and Saxby Chambliss--have been working \non. That is what we should be doing. We shouldn't be threatening to \nclose the government. I don't think we should be threatening to close \nthe government under any circumstances, but certainly not when the \neconomics are as thin as that.\n  I know there are people--and it is not all Republicans--there are \nsome people in the House who feel the social issues they have attached \nto this piece of budget legislation are somehow more important than \nkeeping government open or that litigating those issues in the context \nof trying to keep the government open is the right thing to do. I \ndisagree. I think they should have a hearing. I think we ought to have \na floor discussion about what we want to do with women's reproductive \nhealth or the other issues that are there. I am glad to have that \ndebate. But don't threaten to shut the government down based on that.\n  So I will say again, as I said the other night, I encourage the \nleaders of both parties in both Chambers, and our President, to find a \nway to settle this, to find a way to work it out, to find a way to keep \nthis government open at this moment when we have troops deployed all \nover the globe, and to live up to the standard of every single local \nelected official in my State, whether they are Democrats or whether \nthey are Republicans, who are making tough choices in this budget \nsituation but managing to respond to their constituents' priorities.\n  This week, in Colorado, they reached a budget agreement. The Governor \nis a Democrat, the Senate is a majority Democratic, the House is \nRepublican. The Speaker of the House, who is a Republican, said this is \nthe first budget I have been able to vote for in years because of the \nleadership of John Hickenlooper, our Governor, and the leadership of \nthe Democratic and Republican Party there. That breeds confidence in \npeople's work. I think if we can find a way to work together across the \nparty lines in a bipartisan way and demonstrate that we can keep the \ngovernment open, and much more important even than that, that we can \ncreate a path toward fiscal sanity in this country, I think the \nAmerican people would cheer. Right now we have not given them very much \nto cheer about.\n\n  I see the Senator from Texas is here, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have been talking for a long time \ntoday about this fiscal crisis. I don't think anyone is looking at the \nlooming deadline tomorrow night as something that we want, to have \ngovernment shut down. I hope so much that the President and Speaker \nBoehner and the Democratic leader of the Senate, Mr. Reid, can come to \nterms because we are so close to having an agreement on a continuing \nresolution until the end of this fiscal year--which is what we need. If \nanyone would run a business the way this government is being run, in 2-\nweek continuing resolutions and 1-week and 3-week--it is not a way to \nrun anything. It is not organized and you cannot plan. Certainly, we \nknow taxpayer dollars are not being the most efficiently spent if we \nare going in 1- and 2-week increments.\n  The stakes are very high. I look back at the year 2000, and we had \nbalanced budgets. We had a balanced budget in the year 2000. We had a \nbalanced budget up until 9/11. That was only 10 years ago, and we ought \nto be able, as the U.S. Congress, working with the President, to say if \nwe had a balanced budget 10 years ago, we cannot possibly be so far \nover the line that we cannot bring it back into balance. But to bring \nit back into balance we are going to have to look long term. We cannot \ndo it on $30 billion of difference from now to the end of the fiscal \nyear's spending. The fiscal year ends October 1. We cannot do it. We \nhave to have a 10-year plan; we have to have clear cuts in spending; \nand we have to start working toward a balanced budget in a responsible \nway.\n  I cannot say I agree with everything in it, but the House Budget \nCommittee chairman, one of the Republicans in the House, has proposed a \nbudget that would do exactly that. It would get us to nearly a balanced \nbudget. Now we need to start talking about the plans he has put \nforward. The President has not been; Congressman Ryan has. We are going \nto change some of it, I hope. We should have the same goal; that is, to \nget to a balanced budget over a period of time, 5 to 10 years. But we \ncertainly are not going to do it in the next 24 hours, talking about \n$30 billion or $36 billion going for the next 6 months.\n  I hope we will settle this issue so we can go to the long-term \nissues. The long-term issue is going to come up in about 1\\1/2\\ months \nwhen we are going to be called on to raise the debt ceiling. The debt \nis $14 trillion. We are looking at a deficit this year alone of $1.6 \ntrillion. If we go with the budget the President submitted, $3.7 \ntrillion more, over $14 trillion? No wonder the people of this country \nare up in arms. We need to listen to the people of this country who say \nstop doing business in Washington the way it has always been done. Stop \nit now and start cutting back on the appetite for spending so we will \nbe able to have the balanced budget that we can see in our future.\n  What we are looking at now is the potential of a government shutdown. \nI hope it does not come to that, but there is one thing we ought to be \nable to do in this Congress, and that is at least protect our military \nwho is serving in Afghanistan and Iraq and their families who are back \nhome worried enough about them because of where they are and who most \ncertainly should not have another burden put on them of not knowing if \ntheir paycheck is going to come at the normal time of the month--the \n1st and the 15th.\n  I have introduced S. 724. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nSessions as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will say that makes our 46th cosponsor of S. 724. \nIt is a very simple bill. It just says if there is a government \nshutdown, the military will be paid. The Secretary of Defense will have \nthe discretion to also pay the civilians and those who are serving our \nmilitary so the food service in Afghanistan and Iraq will not be \nstopped because we have a government shutdown and the paychecks are not \ngoing to come.\n  I want to alleviate any fear on the part of any member of our \nmilitary or one whose family is watching the debate on the House and \nthe Senate floor, watching this play out and thinking: Am I going to be \nable to pay the mortgage on time? I want to alleviate that fear right \nnow.\n  I hope we will be able to pass this bill that is gaining sponsors \nabout every 15 minutes, as people start looking at the looming shutdown \nof government that will happen a little later than this tomorrow night \nif we do not have an agreement. I think all of us should put our \nmilitary in the front of the line and say: They are going to show up \nfor work. Let's assure them their pay will not be delayed. That is not \nthe message they are getting right now, but I think we can assure they \nwill get it.\n  I have a letter we just received from the National Association of \nUniformed Services, which says:\n\n       On behalf of the more than 180,000 members and supporters \n     of the National Association for Uniformed Services, I offer \n     our full support for your legislation, S. 724, the Ensuring \n     Pay for Our Military Act of 2011.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                           Uniformed Services,\n\n                                   Springfield, VA, April 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the more than 180,000 \n     members and supporters of the National Association for \n     Uniformed Services (NAUS), I would like to offer our full \n     support for your legislation S. 724, the Ensuring Pay for Our \n     Military Act of 2011, a bill to assure that, in the event of \n     a federal government shutdown, our nation's men and women in \n     uniform would continue to receive their military pay and \n     allowances.\n       The Ensuring Pay for Our Military Act would make available \n     the necessary funds to prevent an interruption in pay for \n     members of the military if there is a funding gap resulting \n     from a government shutdown. The bill also includes a \n     provision to authorize the Secretary of Defense to allow \n     those who serve as DOD civilians or contractors in support of \n     our men and women in uniform to continue to be paid as well.\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\n       The National Association for Uniformed Services thanks you \n     for introducing legislation that demonstrates our nation's \n     appreciation for those who serve in our Armed Forces. We look \n     forward to working with you and your staff and deeply \n     appreciate your continued support of the American soldier and \n     their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard A. Jones,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I hope we come to agreement and do not \nshut down the government. We are so close to getting this temporary \nfiscal year--which we are already halfway through--finished, and let's \ntake this off the books. What we ought to be doing right now is \nfocusing on the 2012 budget that starts October 1, where we are having \nour hearings, and we are asking our questions, and we are trying to set \nour priorities with a lower scale of government. We are going to cut \nback way below what we spent last year and the year before, but we are \ngoing to prioritize our spending.\n  We had FBI Director Mueller testify before our Commerce-Justice \nSubcommittee of Appropriations to talk about the law enforcement needs \nof our FBI. I want to spend my time talking about the needs of the FBI \nand the other necessary functions of government; certainly, our armed \nservices bill. I do not want to be talking about shutting down \ngovernment in the middle of the fiscal year because we are not coming \ntogether on $6 billion or $3 billion--I don't know exactly where they \nare now, but it is not very much in the scheme of things. What we need \nto do is get this behind us, alleviate the fears of our military \npersonnel, alleviate the fears of their families that they might have a \nhiatus in their paychecks.\n  We need to start thinking about the big picture, the big picture of \nwhat we must focus on, which is cutting spending so we can go toward a \nbalanced budget and agree on a 5- to 10-year trajectory that will put \nus back in a fiscally responsible position for our country to have the \ncredibility in the world we should have, for our children to be free of \nthe debt for what we have used in government in this country. We don't \nneed to pass that debt to our children if we are responsible stewards \nof both their lives and our taxpayer dollars.\n  We need to be the leaders that people expect us to be. The people \nspoke in very loud terms last November, that they do not want more \nspending. I hear it everywhere I go. I hear it in the airports, on the \nstreets, when I am talking to people in informal meetings, the grocery \nstore--people are scared to death of a $14 trillion debt. It has never \nbeen so high in our country before.\n  I don't want that to be the legacy of this Congress and our \ngeneration. That is not the legacy we should have as leaders of the \ngreatest country in the free world.\n  I implore the leaders of Congress and the President to get the \ncontinuing resolution behind us so we can focus on the big picture; \nthat is, the $14 trillion debt that we are facing right now and doing \nthe responsible cutting that will begin to cut back on the deficits, \ntake down the debt, and address the issues that have not been addressed \nfor all these years, once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas on her \nbill of which I am very proud to be a cosponsor, to make sure our men \nand women in harm's way continue to receive their compensation and \nsupport for their families if, in fact, there is a government shutdown. \nI am certainly going to continue to do everything I can to keep that \nfrom happening. I am unwilling to give up, and I know others are as \nwell.\n  I commend the Senator, but I think this is very important. We need to \nsend that message. We need to get this done and get the bill done.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I say to the Senator from Michigan, she was one of \nthe first to sign on as a cosponsor of this bill. I think that is the \nright thing to do. I appreciate her leadership.\n  I just got a note from my staff, and I also ask unanimous consent to \nadd Senator Scott Brown and Senator Amy Klobuchar as cosponsors of S. \n724.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Michigan. I think we can do \nthis together if we will come together and focus on those great young \nmen and women in Afghanistan and Iraq serving right now and do \nsomething that is right for them regardless of whether we have to face \na government shutdown for all the rest of us.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I could not agree more that we need to \ndo this. I think it is important that the Senate take the lead as we \ndid on another piece of legislation that our friend from California \nbrought forward, and which was passed unanimously by the Senate, to set \ndown a very important principle; that is, if we, those making \ndecisions, cannot come together, then it should be Members of Congress \nnot getting a paycheck. Our troops should be getting paid, but Members \nof Congress should see their paychecks stopped.\n  Unfortunately, under law right now Members of Congress would be the \nonly ones whose paychecks don't stop. That is something we have passed \nin the Senate, to change that. Frankly, I found that to be pretty \nembarrassing. Then it became outrageous when we found out that the \ntroops' paychecks might stop.\n  So it is important we send two messages: people who are responsible \nfor making this decision take responsibility and their paychecks stop \nif it doesn't get done, but also we have to make sure the men and women \nin harm's way continue to have our support verbally and that we show it \nin our priorities as well.\n  I hope we are not going to see this happen. There is no reason for \nthis to happen. We are talking about a shutdown that would not only \naffect many people around this country--families, small businesses--it \nwould affect also the markets, our international standing. This is a \nvery serious issue. People of good will can solve this.\n  We all know we have to be smart. We have to change the way Washington \noperates and cut the things that are not working and invest in the \nthings that do. There is no question about that. We have to do that. In \nfact, we have agreed to major changes in that direction, but it is a \nchallenge.\n  I just wanted to take a second because I think the toughest job in \ntown today is the Speaker's. It is very clear that he has a very \ndifficult job when people are giving a standing ovation for him when he \nis talking about preparing for a shutdown. We do not need this. That is \nnot what we need.\n  What we need is to continue to have people of good will coming \ntogether, as we have just been talking about, in support of our troops \nand saying: We can complete this year's budget. We are halfway through \nthe year. Let's just get it done.\n  What happens if it does not get done? It is not about us. It is not \nabout us. We will be all right. It is not about us. It is about the \npeople who are affected. We know, but let's just go through what \nhappened back in 1995.\n  In 1995, there were 400,000 veterans who saw their disability \nbenefits and pensions claims delayed--our veterans.\n  Again, we are talking about our troops. But in the last shutdown, \n400,000 veterans had delays in their disability benefits and pensions. \nThat ought to be a motivator for all of us to get this done. It would \nbe outrageous if that were to happen again. There was approximately $3 \nbillion in U.S. exports that were delayed because they could not get \nthe export licenses. That is jobs for us.\n  As we look at a time when we want to export our products, not our \njobs, around the world, delaying that affects our jobs. We know \nhundreds of thousands of Medicare and Social Security requests were \ndelayed the last time this happened.\n  For the first time in history, six States ran out of Federal \nunemployment insurance at the time, and small business loans, we know, \ncould be stopped or delayed, as well as tax refunds for people who have \nbeen waiting for hard-earned dollars, stretching every penny to make \nends meet.\n  So it makes no sense. It makes no sense to the economy, it makes no \nsense for families, for seniors, for veterans. We need to come together \nand get this done. We also need to make sure that whatever is done and \nwhat we have been fighting for, the majority has been fighting for, is \nthat we not\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\none more time ask middle-class families and small businesses to be the \nones who have to sacrifice.\n  In my State, our families, middle-class families, people trying \ndesperately to stay in the middle class or to get in the middle class \nhave been the ones hurt over and over--their jobs, losing their jobs or \nlosing their incomes, with their houses underwater, trying to make ends \nmeet, not sure right now if they are going to be able to have the kids \ncontinue to go to college. With gas prices going up like crazy, are \nthey going to be able to even just get back and forth to work? Those \nare not the folks who should be, one more time, sacrificing, carrying \nthe load. The same with people sending their children, grandchildren to \nwar. Our middle-class families should not be the ones continuing to be \nthe only ones sacrificing in order to deal with what is a national debt \nand the need to balance the budget and change the way we fund \nWashington, reduce spending, change the priorities.\n  What I am concerned about is that middle-class families and small \nbusinesses not continue to be the ones who get the brunt over and over. \nI think about this struggle the last couple of years in Michigan and \nwhat we have had to go through with our automobile industry and how \nproud I am of where we are now, but also the sacrifice that it took to \nget there.\n  We are making the best automobiles. We are winning all the awards. \nOur people are smart and skilled. We have the best engineers and the \nbest skilled workforce, but a couple of years ago we had a horrible \ncrisis. It took sacrifice from everybody to turn that around and some \nsmart thinking.\n  Workers had to sacrifice--beginning pay cut in half; retirees, the \ncompany, shareholders, communities--everybody had to sacrifice in order \nto turn this around. But we did something else. We then said: While you \nare cutting back, we are going to invest in the future. We are going to \ninvest in innovation. We are going to invest in those things that are \ngoing to allow us to grow and create more jobs and be successful.\n  After 2 years of a tremendous amount of hard work and everybody \nsacrificing, with some smart decisions and investments, we are turning \nit around, making a profit for the first time--each of our companies--\nsince 1999. We are turning things around because people were willing to \nbe in it together. That is what I am fighting for, because we know we \nhave to change the way we do business and we have to cut the things \nthat do not work and invest in the things that do. But everybody has to \nbe in on this--everybody--not just some people who are being asked to \ngive over and over, not just small businesses that did not cause what \nhappened on Wall Street but cannot get the loans because of what \nhappened with the crisis, holding on, trying to make it, trying to get \nthe capital they need to keep the doors open or to expand. They did not \ncause this, and yet we seem to find the same people over and over \nhaving to make the sacrifices. That does not make sense. I do not think \nit is American.\n  So what we are seeing now as we close in on the final decisions, \npeople coming together, is a question of whether we are going to have \neverybody be a part of the solution or one more time asking the middle \nclass and small businesses. We can come together and get this done if \npeople want to do that. There is no question about it, that people of \ngood will can get it done. I think that it is in everybody's best \ninterests to do that on every single level.\n  But there is no question as well that we have very different \npriorities that are being debated today in our country. We saw that \nthis last week in very stark terms, which goes to the whole question \nof, again, how do we solve our problems and is everybody in? Is every \nAmerican going to be part of turning the ship around? That goes to the \nbudget proposal this week that has added, in my opinion, insult to \ninjury, which relates to the proposal coming from the House Budget \nchair to change Medicare as we know it; to change Medicare from an \ninsurance plan for our retirees and people with disabilities to \nsomething that would be a voucher for insurance companies.\n  It is stunning to me, actually, in looking at this proposal, and \nextremely concerning to me, the ramifications of what is being \nproposed. Then what adds insult to injury is that the proposal is being \nmade to unravel Medicare, do away with Medicare as we know it, raise \nthe costs, the premiums, and the medical costs for almost every senior \nin the country--according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  At the same time this same budget document would give over $1.8 \ntrillion in new tax cuts for special interests and the millionaires of \nthe country--not the folks who have been working hard to try to make \nit, who have not gotten the big breaks, but one more round of big \nbreaks for the people who have not felt this recession, the people who \nhave gotten the special breaks, who somehow have not had to go through \ntheir house underwater, their income go down, worry about the kids, \nworry about the car, worry about the gas. The folks who earn over $1 \nmillion got the special tax breaks--those interests that are doing \nextremely well in this country.\n  That is not how I view shared sacrifice in order to be able to solve \nthe country's problems and get us out of debt and grow the economy, \ncutting Medicare for seniors, dismantling it, at the same time giving \none more round of tax breaks for millionaires and the major special \ninterests of the country.\n  That is wrong in my judgment. It is the wrong set of priorities, and \nit is worth debating, and we will debate that. It is interesting; I \nremember when we were passing health care reform, and we were focused \non the fact that we had to make sure Medicare was healthy for the \nfuture and make some tough decisions so that it would be strong and \nthere for seniors.\n  We took a look at overpayments for for-profit insurance companies. \nThere are major overpayments, and we decided to cut those back. It was \nactually causing the majority of beneficiaries, the majority of \nseniors, to see their premiums go up because of some overpayments to a \nfew. We decided that we would cut back on those insurance company \noverpayments, and we would instead focus on quality in Medicare, making \nsure seniors could go to the doctor and get their cancer screenings, \ntheir wellness visits without out-of-pocket costs and bring down the \ncost of medicine; that we would focus on ways to streamline, focus on \nquality and streamlining the way that we cut costs.\n  According to the budget gurus, we were able to save, I believe, over \n10 years, $500 billion. It did not cut any benefits for seniors, but \nthe other side of the aisle said this was terrible. It was terrible \nbecause we were focused on cutting overpayments to insurance companies.\n  Now we see this proposal that would dismantle Medicare, and it would \ncut what is the average amount a senior spends on medical care in a \nyear, which is about $15,000 a year. It would, instead, cut that amount \ndown to $6,000 a year and give it in a voucher to an insurance company. \nThat is OK. That is a different set of priorities than I have and I \nknow that you have, Mr. President.\n  So these are debates we are going to have, and they are important \ndebates for our country. How do we go forward? How do we solve the \nbudget deficit? How do we grow the economy? How do we create jobs? How \ndo we make sure what we are doing is fair for everybody and keeps what \nworks while cutting what does not?\n  Medicare is a great American success story. Do we need to make sure \nit is there for the next generation? Absolutely. Do we need to look at \nways to streamline and cut costs? We have done that, and we need to \ncontinue to do that. Absolutely. We need to do that. But it is a great \nAmerican success story. It has allowed a whole generation of older \nAmericans to live healthy lives, play with their grandkids.\n  Now that I have two beautiful grandchildren who, by the way, are the \nmost beautiful grandchildren in the world, just for the record--but now \nas I have my 3-year-old and 1-year-old and I look at the fact that I \nwant to be healthy for a long time so I can be there for them, and what \na wonderful gift as Americans we have given to seniors, that gift of \nMedicaid and Social Security so that they can be healthy and live in \ndignified ways in their own homes and be able to live long lives for \ntheir grandchildren and their great-grandchildren, that is something we \nshould be proud of.\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\n  So as we go through this time, we have two kinds of debates. We have \nto deal with what is happening immediately, complete this 6-month--not \n6-year, 6-month CR; I am talking about a 6-month budget--in a \ncommonsense way, make sure that troops get paid, make sure we do not \nhave any veterans losing their opportunity for disability benefits or \npension benefits, and small businesses are not being delayed from \ngetting their loans. In my judgment, we need to put down a marker \nsaying if we cannot come together, that we are the ones who do not get \npaid, not the troops. Then the next step is to debate the vision of \nthis country and where we go, what is important and what is not.\n  Should some Americans be asked to sacrifice in order to solve our \nproblems and be stronger and compete in a global economy or should \neverybody be asked to do their part? People want to do their part, and \nthey are willing to do their part. But we need to make that clear, that \nwe expect everybody to be a part of the solution.\n  What I find most concerning today is that when we are in a global \neconomy and we ought to be talking about the United States competing \nagainst China, the United States competing with Germany or India or \nKorea, we are not doing that. We are standing here on the Senate floor \non a Thursday night talking about whether people will come together to \ncomplete a 6-month budget and make sure our troops can get paid. That \nis not the debate we should be having. We have precious time available \nto us. The debate we should be having is about how as Americans we will \ncompete in a global economy and win. That is what we need to be doing. \nThat is the debate I am anxious to have.\n  I hope we are not going to give up. I will not give up on what we \nneed to do right now, to come together, get this done, avoid a \ngovernment shutdown, and get on to the real business of creating jobs \nand competing in a global economy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to talk about the disastrous \nconsequences if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue \nto prioritize politics and posturing over what is best for Americans \nand our fragile economic recovery. We have 27 hours to convince them \nthat shutting down the government should not be treated as a gimmick, \nthat shutting down the government is a serious matter with serious \nconsequences for almost every American. But before I go into the \nconsequences and their impact on my constituents, I want to take a \nmoment to reflect on how we got here, how we are now in a position \nwhere a government shutdown is 27 hours away.\n  One thing is certain: There is a lot of misinformation and confusion \nout there. A number of my friends on the other side of the aisle have \nbeen saying that the Democrats and the President refused or failed to \npass appropriations for fiscal year 2011. This is revisionist and \nconfused history.\n  One of my colleagues, a new Member, said today:\n\n       Why was it that a few months ago, after the election but \n     before the new Congress took over, when the President had \n     both houses of Congress under control of his party, why did \n     he opt not to pass a full budget for fiscal year 2011?\n\n  The Presiding Officer knows this is just not true. This isn't true. I \nhave been hearing a lot of this.\n  We had appropriations legislation for the entire Federal Government \nready to go. Democrats were in support of it. We were prepared to fund \nthe government for the rest of the fiscal year. But, remember, it takes \n60 votes to pass something like that in the Senate. There were 58 \nDemocrats in the Senate last December, and there were 42 Republicans. \nSo we needed some Republicans to pass a full budget for 2011--not many, \nbut we needed two. We didn't get any. Not a single Republican agreed to \nsupport the bill. That is what happened.\n  For a while, we were told that a number of Republicans were going to \nsupport it. The bill had been negotiated on a bipartisan basis. But \nthen, by all accounts, arms were twisted, and they were turned against \nthe bill.\n  The minority leader said:\n\n       I am actively working to defeat it.\n\n  And he did. He killed it. That is the truth. And my friends on the \nother side of the aisle celebrated.\n  After they made clear that there would not be enough votes to pass \nthe omnibus bill, my friend from Illinois engaged in a colloquy with \nSenator McCain, asking:\n\n       For those who don't understand what just happened, did we \n     just win?\n\n  Senator McCain responded:\n\n       I think there is very little doubt.\n\n  Senator Kirk concluded the colloquy by saying:\n\n       I congratulate the Senator.\n\n  We really do owe it in these serious times to engage in debate where \nwe are being honest with the American people. There is little doubt \nabout who opted not to pass a full budget for 2011. It was not the \nPresident or the Democrats in the majority; it was my friends on the \nother side.\n  My friends on the other side protest that they do not want to shut \ndown the government, and then they point the finger at us.\n  Yesterday, there was a rally for the tea party on Capitol Hill. Part \nof my delegation, Michelle Bachmann, whom I like very much, said:\n\n       Democrats are trying to make it look like we want to shut \n     the government down. We don't. They are trying to do that.\n\n  Silence.\n  That same day at the same rally, Mike Pence said to them:\n\n       It looks like we're going to have to shut down the \n     government.\n\n  And what did the tea party crowd do? They started chanting: ``Shut it \ndown. Shut it down. Shut it down. Shut it down.''\n  According to his own account, when Speaker Boehner told Republican \ncolleagues in his caucus that he had taken steps to prepare for a \nshutdown, ``I got a standing ovation.''\n  There have been no standing ovations on our side about a prospective \nshutdown. Come on. We are trying to keep the government working. We \ndesperately want to keep the government working.\n  Republicans are busy fighting ideological battles. For them, this is \nnot about the deficit. It is not about the budget. It is certainly not \nabout jobs. This is about ideology.\n  I was presiding today, and I had the opportunity to hear some of my \ncolleagues talking about the bill the House passed today to fund the \ntroops. We want to fund the troops if there is a shutdown. We do. There \nwas all this sanctimonious talk about how Republicans want the troops \nto be funded, and the House had passed a bill to fund it. Do you know \nwhat was left out? That Steny Hoyer, the minority whip in the House, \nthe Democratic minority whip, had offered a bill to pay the troops if \nthere was a shutdown, a clean bill, nothing attached to it other than \nthat. It was voted down by Republicans in the House. What passed? A \nbill with a rider on it about abortion. I didn't hear that in all the \nsanctimonious talk.\n  Let's at least have an honest debate. Really, adding abortion? Look, \nI know there are people who have very strong, heartfelt feelings, \nobviously, on abortion on both sides. This is something we have been \ntalking about for decades. Why put it a rider about abortion on \nlegislation to pay for the troops and then go in front of this body and \nsay: Democrats don't want to pay the troops.\n  This can't be about holding a gun to our heads and saying: You have \nto come down on this side of this issue that people feel so strongly \nabout and have been debating for 40 years.\n  The Republicans in the House talk about the Constitution. They \nstarted this session by reading the Constitution. They left out some of \nthe embarrassing parts, that a slave was three-fifths of a person. They \nleft that out. But there are two Houses, and there is a President. But \nthey don't want to compromise. They just want to put a gun to our \nheads. And it is in the form of abortion and in the form of global \nwarming. Look, 99.6 percent of climate scientists in the world believe \nthere is global warming and it is caused by human beings. The other .4 \npercent work for coal companies or oil companies or the Heritage \nFoundation. Then there might be another guy somewhere.\n\n  Why put a rider on this that is about ideology? This should not be an \nideological debate. This is about getting\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\nthe deficit down and about our economy. We had 216,000 new jobs last \nmonth. It is fragile, but we are beginning to come out of this. This is \nnot the time to shut the government down.\n  What it is going to do to people in my State, to seniors--every week, \nthere are hundreds of seniors--how many a day--170 a day applying for \nSocial Security. They are not going to be able to do that, people who \njust turned 65. There are people who are going to try to get FHA loans \nand won't be able to. There are farmers who want to put seed in the \nground who will not have the Farm Service open. This is not the time to \ndo this. This is going to mean 800,000 Federal employees laid off. What \nis that going to do to the economy?\n  Look, there are things in this that I don't like, but I am willing to \nswallow and do it.\n  They want to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in hunger programs, \n$700-plus million to cut food for women, infants, and children. It has \nbeen analyzed, and because of that, the neediest kids will not get \ntheir allotted amount of fruits and vegetables that is recommended. And \nthat is not just during the closing; that is what they want to do for \nthe rest of the year and presumably beyond that.\n  At the same time, we were here last December, and they wanted to \nextend the Bush tax cuts. They insisted on it, not just to your first \nmillion dollars or your second million dollars, to your tenth million \ndollars, to your 13th million dollars, or to your 300th million \ndollars. The top 400 income earners in this country average over $330 \nmillion a year in income. They would rather those women, infants, and \nchildren not get food, the food they need to be healthy. I don't like \nthat. Boy, do I not like that. Boy, do I not like that. But I was \nwilling to swallow that for whatever is in the compromise to keep the \ngovernment going so we could go through the year, so we could keep the \neconomy going, so we continue the job growth we have had.\n  They know how to keep the government going. Take the ideological \nstuff off. Let's not resolve abortion in 27 hours. We have had more \nthan 27 years--37 years--since Roe v. Wade. Let's not put a gun to \neveryone's head and say we have to resolve Roe v. Wade in 27 hours. \nThat is just plain inappropriate.\n\n  I think you know how I feel. I think we know which side gives \nstanding ovations when it is announced the government may very well be \nshut down. I think we know which side's crowd cheers and chants when \nthey hear there may be a shutdown. I wish it were not that way. I wish \nwe were working together. I hope we are working together. I hope we are \nworking together on Monday.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak in morning business, \neven though it is the evening--the nature of the Senate rules and \nprocedure. During the course of the day, we have had a number of \ncolleagues coming to the floor and talking about the looming shutdown \nof the Federal Government.\n  During the last several hours, as we have spoken, Majority Leader \nReid and Speaker Boehner have been meeting with President Obama. It is \nmy sincere hope that it has been a productive and fruitful meeting and \nthat they will report that we have found a way out of this difficulty. \nI certainly hope that is the case. But if it is not, if we are destined \nto see this government shut down tomorrow night at midnight, it is a \nsad commentary--one that most American voters will resent and be \ndisappointed with, and understandably so. It basically says the leaders \nhave not been able to reach an agrement. Fingers of blame will be \npointed in both directions, and the public can reach conclusions about \nwho is responsible.\n  From my point of view, having worked with Senator Harry Reid on this \nfrom the beginning, I attended many meetings and heard many reports. It \nhas been a frustrating experience because the Speaker's position in the \nHouse has changed so often. The amount of money they wanted to cut from \nthe budget, where it would come from, and the policy riders that were \npart of this conversation have been changing with each meeting. I know \nSenator Reid is a patient person. I have watched him as my friend since \nwe were both elected to the House in 1982, and as my colleague in the \nSenate now--and this is my third term. He is patient, but he has been \nfrustrated because of these changing scenarios.\n  The most recent change is one that I find most troubling, which is \nthat it appears the debate is no longer over deficit reduction or \nspending cuts. It really isn't about how much money we are going to cut \nduring the remainder of this year. Most Americans thought that was what \nwe were debating and negotiating. It turns out now that it has devolved \ninto a debate over policy questions that have nothing to do directly--\nmaybe even indirectly--with the budget deficit we face and the money we \nare going to spend.\n  For example, Speaker Boehner has been insisting today that the Senate \nadopt a provision which removes the authority of the EPA when it comes \nto issues involving pollution. I disagree with that position, but I \nhave to say to the Speaker that he should check the Congressional \nRecord. It is not the most exciting publication, but if he looks at \nyesterday's Congressional Record, he will find that we spent most of \nyesterday debating this point.\n  Four different amendments were offered by Democrats and Republicans, \nincluding Senator McConnell, the Republican minority leader, on this \nissue. We debated them for days and voted yesterday on the question of \nthe authority of the EPA. There were four votes.\n  On the first one, there were seven Senators voting in favor of the \nchange in that amendment. On the second amendment, seven Senators \nagain. On the third amendment, 12 Senators voted in favor of the \nchange. The fourth, offered by Senator McConnell, was 50-50. At the end \nof the day none of them passed.\n  For Speaker Boehner to insist now that we include in our bill a \nprovision that has already been debated in the Senate and rejected is \nfundamentally unfair and goes way beyond any question about deficit \nreduction and cutting spending.\n  The second item he raised is one that is even more puzzling. For some \nreason the Republican majority in the House believes the last election \nwas a referendum on whether we provide medical services to women in \nAmerica. We have the title X program--primarily for low-income women--\nthat gives them access to basic health care, to the type of cancer \nscreening and infection screening that we want all of the women in \nAmerica to have access to. The House Republicans decided we should \neliminate that Federal commitment and close the clinics, denying access \nto millions of Americans to basic primary health care.\n  How can that be in the best interest of our country and the costs \nthat we incur to provide medical services? How can it be fair to these \npeople, the men and women who use these clinics because they are \naccessible and affordable? They want to close them down. I don't recall \nthat debate in the last election. I don't remember any candidate for \nthe House or Senate saying: I want to go to Washington to close down \naccess to health care for women, children, and men across America. That \nis, in fact, what they are saying now is the reason we need to close \ndown the government. They think it is better to close down the \ngovernment than to continue to give access to medical care to women \nunder title X.\n  Planned Parenthood, which has a clinic in my hometown of Springfield,\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\nIL--for the record, Planned Parenthood and any clinic operating under \ntitle X is prohibited from using any Federal funds for the purpose of \nabortion. The only exceptions are those that have been in the law and \naccepted by both political parties for decades--the so-called Hyde \namendment for women who are victims of rape, incest, or their lives are \nat stake in a continued pregnancy.\n  This isn't an abortion issue. It is obviously a health care issue. \nFor some reason, the House Republicans would rather close down the \ngovernment than allow this kind of health service to continue. That is \ntroublesome.\n  It is also troubling that the underlying House budget they passed has \nbeen judged by economists to be a job killer--700,000 jobs would be \nlost if the Republicans passed their budget and the Senate approved it. \nAt a time when we are celebrating the creation of over 200,000 new jobs \nlast Friday, and the lowest unemployment rate in 24 months, here come \nthe Republicans with a budget proposal that will cost 700,000 jobs, \npushing us back toward recession instead of away from it. That isn't \nsensible.\n  I don't believe the American people ever considered that part of the \nbargain in the last election. It is true the American people focused on \nthe deficit and cutting spending, and we are too--on both sides of the \naisle. That is why we have reached an agreement on the amount of money \nto be cut from the remaining part of this budget. For us to now face a \nshutdown of the Federal Government over the question of women's access \nto health care or whether we are going to accept an EPA change, which \nhas already been rejected on the floor of the Senate, shows the \nunreasonable level of this debate.\n  We had a meeting today of the Democratic Senators, and John Kerry \nspoke. I told him afterward that what he said had a profound impact on \nme. He reminded us that what we are doing isn't just being observed by \npoliticians on Capitol Hill or reporters and journalists in Washington; \nit is being watched by the world.\n  It is a sad commentary that this great Nation, the United States of \nAmerica, with its government, has reached a point where we face \nclosure. We know we can do better. It is unfortunate the House \nRepublicans, with their new leadership facing growing pains, have \nbrought us to this moment. I hope we can reach a point where we can \nfind an agreement even now. I hope this evening there will be a \nbreakthrough.\n  They said last week, when the Speaker announced to his Republican \ncaucus in the House that there was going to be a shutdown of the \ngovernment, there was a standing ovation. They were cheering the idea \nof shutting down the government.\n  I will not cheer that. That is a bad outcome. It is bad for \ntaxpayers, bad for our Nation, and bad for the Federal employees who \nare performing essential services in North Carolina, Illinois, and \nacross the country. These are men and women who are working to keep us \nsafe. They are performing important duties, such as watching dangerous \nprisoners and making certain our planes take off and land safely. To \neven jeopardize for a minute the funding for these agencies is \nirresponsible to the extreme.\n  Let's hope there is an agreement. If not, let's hope we can extend \nsomehow the functions of government and not close them down at midnight \ntomorrow evening. At this moment, there is no report. There is likely \nto be one later.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have just returned from the White House. \nWe have narrowed the issues significantly; However, we have not yet \nreached an agreement. In 26 hours and 15 minutes the government will \nclose if we don't get this resolved. We have not yet reached an \nagreement.\n  We are going to work throughout the night to attempt to resolve many \nissues. The remaining issues are extremely narrow. Having said that, I \nhave been to this podium before, and I have spoken to the press before, \nand I said we have narrowed the issues--and we have. The sad part about \nit is that we never quite get to the finish line.\n  I hope we can work through the night and get this done. The President \nset an early morning deadline before we have to start notifying almost \n1 million Federal employees that they will have to report to work and \nhear that they won't be there on Monday. It is a technical thing they \nhave to do tomorrow before closing time. We need to work toward that \ndeadline. I hope we can get that done. I am not really confident, but I \nam very hopeful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2262-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2262-S2263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAIR ELECTIONS NOW ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last year, the Supreme Court issued a \ndecision in a case named Citizens United v. FEC. In this sweeping \ndecision that ignored decades of precedent, the Supreme Court held that \ncorporations and unions could spend as much money as they want to \ninfluence congressional elections.\n  At the time the Court issued this decision, I and others warned that \nCitizen United would have a negative impact on our democracy and open \nthe floodgates to undisclosed private money in Federal elections.\n  The results of the first congressional elections after Citizens \nUnited have been analyzed. Those of us who sounded the alarm about this \nunfortunate decision were right.\n  In 2010, for the first time ever, spending on House and Senate races \nexceeded $1.6 billion.\n  Outside groups, now freed from spending limits by Citizens United, \nspent 335 percent more on congressional campaigns than they did just 4 \nyears earlier.\n  The amount of money that big corporations and special interest \nlobbyists are willing to spend to shape policy is expected to increase \neven more in 2012.\n  This dramatic increase in spending tells us that big business is not \ngoing to be shy about using its new power to say to Members of \nCongress: ``If you vote against our business interests, we'll spend \nmillions to make sure you never get the chance to vote against us \nagain.''\n  That is a terrible reality for Members of Congress evaluating policy \noptions and it is an even worse statement about our democracy.\n  As bad as Citizens United was, the Supreme Court may very well be at \nit again. Last week, the Court heard oral arguments in the McComish v. \nBennett case.\n  An adverse decision in the McComish case would hamstring \njurisdictions that have implemented campaign finance measures in \nresponse to corruption and scandal.\n  Citizens United and its corrosive impact remind us of the urgent need \nto fundamentally reform the way we finance congressional elections.\n  It is time we had a system that allows candidates to focus on \nconstituents instead of fundraising.\n  That is why I introduced the Fair Elections Now Act. The Fair \nElections Now Act will dramatically change the way campaigns are \nfunded.\n  This bill lets candidates focus on the people they represent, \nregardless of whether those people have the wealth to attend a big \nmoney fundraiser or donate thousands of dollars.\n  Fair Elections candidates would be in the policy business, regardless \nof what policies are preferred by big business and wealthy special \ninterests.\n  The Fair Elections Now Act will help restore public confidence in the \ncongressional election process by providing qualified candidates for \nCongress with grants, matching funds, and vouchers from the Fair \nElections Fund to replace campaign fundraising that largely relies on \nlobbyists and other special interests.\n  In return, participating candidates would agree to limit their \ncampaign spending to amounts raised from small-dollar donors plus the \namounts provided from the Fair Elections Fund.\n  Fair Elections would have three stages for Senate candidates.\n  To participate, candidates would first need to prove their viability \nby raising a minimum number and amount of small-dollar qualifying \ncontributions from in-state donors. Once a candidate qualifies, that \ncandidate must limit\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\nthe amount raised from each donor to $100 per election.\n  For the primary, participants would receive a base grant that would \nvary in amount based on the population of the state that the candidate \nseeks to represent. Participants would also receive a 5-to-1 match for \nsmall-dollar donations up to a defined matching cap. The candidate \ncould raise an unlimited amount of $100 contributions if needed to \ncompete against high-spending opponents.\n  For the general election, qualified candidates would receive an \nadditional grant, further small-dollar matching, and vouchers for \npurchasing television advertising. The candidate could continue to \nraise an unlimited amount of $100 contributions if needed.\n  The Fair Elections approach frees candidates to spend more time with \nconstituents and in policy debates and less time with wealthy donors \nand special interest lobbyists.\n  Our country faces major challenges.\n  Everyone knows that we need to reduce the deficit, modernize our \nenergy policy, and reform the Tax Code--among other things.\n  What many people may not know is that, at every turn, there are high-\npowered, special interest lobbyists ready to fight every proposal.\n  It is mighty hard for Members of Congress not to pay attention to the \nconcerns of big money lobbyists and donors when Members of Congress may \nneed to raise money from these same people during their next campaign.\n  This bill would dramatically reduce the influence of these lobbyists \nand corporations, because Fair Elections candidates would not need \ntheir money to run campaigns.\n  Let me be clear: I honestly believe that the overwhelming majority of \nthe people serving in American politics are good, honest people, and I \nbelieve that Senators and Congressmen are guided by the best of \nintentions.\n  But we are nonetheless stuck in a terrible, corrupting system.\n  The perception is that politicians are corrupted by the big money \ninterests . . . and whether that is true or not, that perception and \nthe loss of trust that goes with it makes it incredibly difficult for \nthe Senate to take on tough challenges and have the American public \nbelieve that what we are doing is right.\n  This problem--the perception of pervasive corruption--is fundamental \nto our democracy, and we must address it.\n  Fair Elections is not some farfetched idea.\n  Fair Election systems are already at work in cities and states around \nthe country.\n  Similar programs exist and are working well in more than 12 \njurisdictions, including Maine, Arizona, North Carolina, and Vermont.\n  These programs are bringing new faces and new ideas into politics, \nmaking more races more competitive, and dramatically reducing the \ninfluence of special interests.\n  The vast majority of Americans agree that it is time to fundamentally \nchange our system of financing campaigns.\n  Recent polling shows that 75 percent of Democrats, 66 percent of \nindependents, and 55 percent of Republicans support Fair Elections-\nstyle reform.\n  The Fair Elections Now Act is supported by several good government \ngroups, former Members of Congress from both parties, prominent \nbusiness leaders, and even . . . lobbyists.\n  Special interests lobbyists and big corporations are entitled to a \nseat at the table, but they shouldn't be able to buy every seat.\n  The Fair Elections Now Act will reform our campaign finance system so \nthat Members of Congress can focus on implementing policies that \nbenefit the people that sent them to Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2263-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF PLATTE COUNTY, WYOMING\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I am pleased to recognize the \nCentennial of Platte County, WY.\n  Although today's Platte County is vastly different than that of 100 \nyears ago, its vibrant history connects the two. The early inhabitants, \nwho were then part of Laramie County, campaigned passionately for the \ndivision of the county. They had distinguished themselves as functional \ncommunities, and they contributed to the State's economy by \nstrengthening their ties to the railroad, agricultural development, and \nmining industries. They wanted an independent identity. On April 28, \n1911, a headline in the Wheatland World jubilantly announced, ``County \ndivision carries! Platte County a reality.'' Their success represents \nWyoming's spirit of independence.\n  Platte County consists of 8,200 residents in the five communities of \nWheatland, Guernsey, Hartville, Glendo, and Chugwater. Parts of \nWheatland's unique irrigation system are still visible. In the early \n1880s, engineers created a system of canals to transport water from \nmanmade reservoirs through the mountains to the town below. Such \nforesight assisted in the taming of a small section of the great Wild \nWest. A few miles outside of Guernsey stands Register Cliff, a \nsandstone outcropping upon which emigrants recorded their names and \ndates as they traveled the historic Oregon Trail. Wagon ruts from the \ntrail are also visible and remind us of the grand journey people made. \nThe Sunrise Mine, located just outside of Hartville, was one of the \nlargest iron mines in the country, producing over 42 million tons of \niron ore during its 80-year operation. Platte County is the only county \nin Wyoming with two State parks: Guernsey State Park and Glendo State \nPark. Both parks contribute to the area's irrigation systems, as well \nas provide excellent year-round recreational opportunities for Wyoming \nresidents. Livestock production has always been a major enterprise in \nWyoming; Chugwater earned distinction as the headquarters for Swan Land \nand Cattle Company, one of the largest cattle outfits in the United \nStates. Now, new generations of ranchers continue the cattle legacy.\n  Today, Platte County helps meet America's growing energy demands. The \nLaramie River Station powerplant, located northeast of Wheatland, \ndelivers electricity to two separate power grids and is one of the \nlargest consumer-operated, joint power supply ventures in the country. \nStrides have been made in developing renewable energy technology, \nincluding plans to harness Wyoming's wind. Also impressive is Platte \nCounty's proximity to the Niobrara Shale Formation, a shale rock \nformation that covers four States in the West. Drilling beneath this \nformation will provide numerous opportunities for oil and natural gas \nproduction.\n  Madam President, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Platte \nCounty, I invite my colleagues to visit this historic place. This year, \nthe Platte County Centennial Committee has planned several countywide \ncelebrations and has announced its motto, ``The People, the Land: Past, \nPresent and Future.'' I applaud the citizens of Platte County in their \nefforts to celebrate such rich history and to present it to visitors \nfrom all over the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2263-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2263-S2264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

Prior to \nbecoming the president of Delta Council, Dr. Pennington served as \nSuperintendent of Education for school districts in Tallahatchie and \nSunflower Counties, MS. He has served as a college sports referee and \nis a past chairman of the Board of Institutions\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\nof Higher Learning in the State of Mississippi, which oversees the \noperations and management of the eight public universities in our \nState.\n  Upon retirement from the local public education system in Indianola, \nMS, Dr. Pennington served as executive assistant to the president of \nDelta State University. Later, he was asked to move into the position \nas the first chief executive officer of Delta Health Alliance, which \nhas been a vitally successful program aimed at improving access to \nhealth care in the Mississippi Delta.\n  Cass Pennington is respected in all business and education circles \nthroughout our State. Delta Council, itself, has been taken to a new \nlevel through the involvement of Dr. Pennington. He is a leader and a \nman of strong conviction, especially with regard to the future of the \nMississippi Delta.\n  In Mississippi, we appreciate Cass Pennington, his wife Carolyn, and \ntheir daughter Athena for the sacrifices they have made to help improve \nthe lives of all who live and do business in the Mississippi \nDelta.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2264-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \n  DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13536 ON APRIL 12, 2010 WITH RESPECT TO \n                             SOMALIA--PM 8\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \noffset against income tax refunds to pay for restitution and other \nState judicial debts that are past-due; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues Senators \nSessions, McCaskill, Thune, Boxer, and Graham, I am introducing the \nCrime Victim Restitution and Court Fee Intercept Act. This bipartisan \nbill would help crime victims and state courts recover the restitution \nand fees that are owed to them. This bill would accomplish this worthy \ngoal by intercepting tax refunds of deadbeat debtors who've failed to \npay restitution or court fees. If enacted, this bill would essentially \nallow state courts to cross-reference outstanding debts with the IRS \nand use existing procedures to withhold tax refunds in order to satisfy \npast due debts.\n  This bill would not only deliver justice to crime victims who are \nowed restitution, but would also provide much-needed resources to help \nkeep court rooms open and court programs operating. At a time when our \nState and local governments are struggling to find funding for vital \nprograms--including keeping courthouse doors open--unpaid court fees \nrepresent an important source of revenue that should be captured. This \nbill would help close budget gaps and provide additional revenue \nwithout raising taxes or imposing any new costs or burdens. In fact, \nparticipation in the program would be optional for States, but I expect \nmost States to participate and to benefit greatly from this bill.\n  This bill would operate the same way as the very successful child \nsupport debt collection system. The bill will allow states to share \ninformation on outstanding restitution owed and court debts with the \nIRS, which would then be required to intercept any Federal tax refunds \nof debtors and send that money to the victim or court owed that debt.\n  It has been estimated by the National Center for State Courts that \noutstanding court debts across the country total approximately $15 \nbillion. In my home state of Oregon alone, the outstanding restitution \nand court fee debt amount is $987 million. Only a portion of \noutstanding debts are owed by individuals who will receive Federal tax \nrefunds, so a portion of court debts would not be collected \nimmediately. Nonetheless, the state of Oregon estimates that passage of \nthis bill would allow the State to collect $30 million per year.\n  Without this straight-forward and efficient mechanism, the collection \nof victim restitution and court debts is a costly and time-consuming \nprocess. Enactment of this bill would reduce the fiscal cost and \nadministrative burden that victims and courts bear in attempting to \ncollect those debts. Again, in the midst of a challenging fiscal \ncrisis, it only makes common sense to collect revenues that are already \nowed--through an efficient and convenient method.\n  Because this bill would benefit both the court system, and those who \nrely upon it, the Crime Victim Restitution and Court Fee Intercept Act \nis endorsed by a broad array of court, government, law enforcement, and \ncrime victims' organizations. I would like to especially recognize the \nNational Center for State Courts and the American Bar Association for \ntheir support in getting this bill introduced.\n  The bill is also supported by the Conference of Chief Justices, the \nConference of State Court Administrators, the National Association for \nCourt Managers, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the \nNational Association of Counties, the Government Finance Officers \nAssociation, the National District Attorneys Association, the American \nProbation and Parole Association, the National Crime Law Institute, the \nNational Center for Victims of Crime, the National Organization for \nVictim Assistance, the National Association of Crime Victim \nCompensation Boards, the National Association of VOCA Assistance \nAdministrators, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the \nNational Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the National Organization of \nParents of Murdered Children Inc., and Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n  I urge all colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation and I \nyield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 756. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the public availability of Medicare claims data; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in March, I introduced S. 454, the \nStrengthening Program Integrity and Accountability in Health Care Act, \nto enhance the government's ability to combat Medicare and Medicaid \nfraud.\n  One of the provisions in that bill would require the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to issue regulations to make Medicare claims \nand payment data available to the public similar to other federal \nspending disclosed on www.USAspending.gov.\n  That website was created by legislation sponsored by then-Senator \nObama and Senator Coburn. It lists almost all federal spending, but it \ndoesn't include Medicare payments made to physicians.\n  That means virtually every other government program, including some \ndefense spending, is more transparent than spending by the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Medicare is funded by taxpayers, and in 2009, the federal government \nspent $502 billion on Medicare.\n  Taxpayers should have a right to see how their hard-earned dollars \nare being spent.\n  Also, if doctors know their billing information is public, it might \ndeter some wasteful practices and overbilling.\n  On the day that I introduced S. 454, I learned that Senator Wyden was \nalso working on legislation to make Medicare payments to physicians \navailable to the public. We decided to work together.\n  Today, Senator Wyden and I are introducing the Medicare Data Access \nfor Transparency and Accountability Act, Medicare DATA Act.\n  This bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nissue regulations to make available a searchable Medicare payment \ndatabase that the public can access at no cost.\n  Our bill also clarifies that data on Medicare payments to physicians \nand suppliers do not fall under a Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, \nexemption.\n  Under a 1979 court decision, Medicare is prohibited from releasing \nphysicians' billing information to the public.\n  But before that injunction, the Department of Health, Education, and \nWelfare--now the Department of Health and Human Services--was in the \nprocess of releasing reimbursement data for all Medicare providers.\n  Third parties that have tried to obtain physician specific data \nthrough the FOIA process have failed in the past because the courts \nheld that physicians' privacy interests outweigh the public's interest \nin disclosure.\n  The nonprofit, consumer organization--Consumers' Checkbook--for \nexample, had filed a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human \nServices to compel disclosure of that data.\n  The organization made its FOIA request to determine whether or not \nMedicare paid physicians who had the qualifications to perform the \nservices for which they sought federal reimbursement, especially those \nperforming a high volume of difficult procedures.\n  In particular, the organization was looking for physicians with \ninsufficient board certifications or histories of disciplinary actions.\n  My question is: why wouldn't we want individuals examining this data \nto ensure that the government is protecting taxpayer dollars by \npreventing improper billing to the Medicare program?\n  And why wouldn't we want public interest watchdog groups helping to \nlook out for potential abuse or fraud?\n  In January, the Wall Street Journal reported the American Medical \nAssociation's, AMA, concerns about making\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\nMedicare claims data publicly available.\n  The AMA President said that physicians ``should not suffer the \nconsequences of having false or misleading conclusions drawn from \ncomplex Medicare data that has significant limitations.''\n  But I would like to note the value of access to Medicare billing \ndata.\n  Even with limited access, the Wall Street Journal was able to \nidentify suspicious billing patterns and potential abuses of the \nMedicare system.\n  The Wall Street Journal found cases where Medicare paid millions to a \nphysician, sometimes for several years, before those questionable \npayments stopped.\n  Volume alone doesn't automatically mean there's fraud, waste, or \nabuse.\n  More patients may be going to a specific physician for a particular \nservice because that physician is a leader in his or her field.\n  Nonetheless, to alleviate the concerns raised by the American Medical \nAssociation, our bill would require a disclaimer that the data in the \npublic database ``does not reflect on the quality of the items of \nservices furnished or of the provider of services or supplier who \nfurnished the items or services.''\n  I believe transparency in the health care system leads to more \naccountability and thus less waste and more efficient use of scarce \nresources.\n  I have often quoted Justice Brandeis, who said, ``Sunlight is the \nbest disinfectant.''\n  That is what Senator Wyden and I are aiming to accomplish with the \nMedicare DATA Act.\n  When it comes to public programs like Medicare, the Federal \nGovernment needs all the help it can get to identify and combat fraud, \nwaste and abuse.\n  Our bill will add to the reforms Congress passed last year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Data Access for \n     Transparency and Accountability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF MEDICARE CLAIMS DATA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1128J of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7k) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(f) Public Availability of Medicare Claims Data.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, to the extent \n     consistent with applicable information, privacy, security, \n     and disclosure laws, including the regulations promulgated \n     under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n     of 1996 and section 552a of title 5, United States Code, make \n     available to the public claims and payment data of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services related to title \n     XVIII, including data on payments made to any provider of \n     services or supplier under such title.\n       ``(2) Implementation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2012, the \n     Secretary shall promulgate regulations to carry out this \n     subsection.\n       ``(B) Requirements.--The regulations promulgated under \n     subparagraph (A) shall ensure that--\n       ``(i) the data described in paragraph (1) is made available \n     to the public through a searchable database that the public \n     can access at no cost;\n       ``(ii) such database--\n\n       ``(I) includes the amount paid to each provider of services \n     or supplier under title XVIII, the items or services for \n     which such payment was made, and the location of the provider \n     of services or supplier;\n       ``(II) is organized based on the specialty or the type of \n     provider of services or supplier involved;\n       ``(III) is searchable based on the type of items or \n     services furnished; and\n       ``(IV) includes a disclaimer that the aggregate data in the \n     database does not reflect on the quality of the items or \n     services furnished or of the provider of services or supplier \n     who furnished the items or services; and\n\n       ``(iii) each provider of services or supplier in the \n     database is identified by a unique identifier that is \n     available to the public (such as the National Provider \n     Identifier of the provider of services or supplier).\n       ``(C) Scope of data.--The database shall include data for \n     fiscal year 2012, and each year fiscal year thereafter.''.\n       (b) Information Not Exempt Under the Freedom of Information \n     Act.--The term ``personnel and medical files and similar \n     files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of personal privacy'', as used in \n     section 552(b)(6) of title 5, United States Code, does not \n     include the information required to be made available to the \n     public under section 1128J(f) of the Social Security Act, as \n     added by subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Grassley to \nintroduce the Medicare Data Access for Transparency and Accountability \nAct. I would like to begin by thanking my friend and esteemed colleague \nfor his unwavering commitment to greater transparency and \naccountability in government. This Medicare DATA Act advances that \ngoal.\n  Sunshine continues to be the greatest disinfectant. In that light, \nthe Medicare DATA Act ensures all taxpayers have access to the Medicare \nClaims Database, both to aid them in making medical decisions, and in \nunderstanding what their money is paying for in this vital, yet \nenormous, health program. Making this information public will also help \nprevent wasteful spending and outright fraud in Medicare claims. The \nMedicare Claims Database is an important resource for public and \nprivate stakeholders as it captures healthcare provider payment and \nclaims information for roughly 1/3 of the United States healthcare \nsystem. But why isn't this information already available?\n  In 1978, the Department of Health Education and Welfare attempted to \nrelease this information, upon request, under the premise that \naccessibility to the source data was in the public interest and \ntherefore should be made available for public consumption. An \ninjunction by a Florida court, however, successfully blocked that \npublic disclosure of this information. As a result, this data has \nbeen--with limited exceptions made for government employees, \ncontractors, and researchers willing to pay for partial access--off \nlimits for the last three decades. Passage of the Medicare DATA Act \nputs an end to that practice.\n  I consider hiding information affecting the American taxpayer that \nclearly should be in the public domain, to be indefensible in a free \nsociety. With this principle in mind, I join with Senator Grassley in \nchanging ``business as usual.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that Medicare \ndata is finally fully transparent and available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries and taxpayers alike. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 759. A bill to provide to the Secretary of the Interior a \nmechanism to cancel contracts for the sale of materials CA-20139 and \nCA-22901, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Soledad \nCanyon High Desert, California Public Lands Conservation and Management \nAct of 2011. This bill would resolve a 21-year-old mining dispute \nbetween the City of Santa Clarita and CEMEX USA, and have numerous \nother benefits for communities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino \nCounties, CA.\n  In 1990, the Bureau of Land Management awarded CEMEX two 10-year \nconsecutive contracts to extract 56 million tons of sand and gravel \nfrom a site in Soledad Canyon. The City of Santa Clarita strongly \nopposed CEMEX's expansion of mining in this area. After two decades of \nconflict and nearly a decade of litigation, the two parties announced a \ntruce in early 2007, and started working out an agreement.\n  This legislation would implement the terms of that agreement. It \nwould require the Secretary of the Interior to cancel CEMEX's mining \ncontracts in Soledad Canyon and prohibit future mining at this site. \nThe BLM would sell lands near Victorville, CA that are currently on its \ndisposal list, and would use the proceeds to compensate CEMEX for the \ncancellation of its mining contracts. Local land use authorities, such \nas the City of Victorville and County of San Bernardino, would have the \nright of first refusal to purchase many of these parcels, which would \nhelp satisfy their future development needs. Some of these funds would \nalso go towards the purchase of environmentally-sensitive lands in \nSouthern California.\n  My legislation would settle a 20-year-old dispute to all parties' \nsatisfaction, complement future development plans in Southern \nCalifornia, and help secure important lands for conservation.\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\nThat's why it has won the support of a diverse group of interests, \nincluding the City of Santa Clarita, CEMEX, the Santa Monica Mountains \nConservancy, and the Sierra Club.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure the passage of \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Akaka, and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 761. A bill to improve the acquisition workforce through the \nestablishment of an acquisition management fellows program and a \nleadership development training program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce two bills that \nwould lay a strong foundation to improve the Federal acquisition \nsystem.\n  The first bill, the Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 2011, S. \n761, co-sponsored by Senators Akaka and McCaskill, would create a \nFederal acquisition management fellows program to develop a new \ngeneration of acquisition leaders with government-wide perspective, \nskills, and experience.\n  The second bill, the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act of \n2011, S. 762, co-sponsored by Senators Akaka, McCaskill and Brown of \nMassachusetts, would provide much-needed organizational clarity to \nenable the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to fulfill its mission \nof facilitating career development and better management of the federal \nacquisition workforce.\n  The Federal acquisition system is under tremendous stress. Between \nfiscal years 2000 and 2010, acquisition spending by the federal \ngovernment expanded by 163 percent, from $205 billion to $535 billion. \nThe necessary costs of military operations, natural disasters, homeland \nsecurity precautions, and other vital programs will continue to strain \nthe acquisition system in the years ahead.\n  This unprecedented level of purchasing creates abundant opportunities \nfor fraud, waste, and abuse. We have seen far too many outrageous \nfailures in government contracting. The Secure Border Initiative \nNetwork, the Census Bureau's handheld computers for the 2010 Census, \nand the Marine Presidential Helicopter programs are among recent, \nnotorious and costly acquisition failures, which we can ill afford.\n  These and other failures demand strong steps to protect taxpayer \ndollars and deliver better acquisition outcomes.\n  As a long-time advocate for stronger competition, accountability, and \ntransparency in government contracting, I recognize the actions the \nAdministration has taken recently to improve federal contracting. Many \nof these initiatives originated from legislation I co-authored with \nSenator Lieberman during the 110th Congress.\n  But, no matter how many laws we pass or guidance documents OMB \nissues, the effectiveness of our Federal acquisition system ultimately \ndepends on a vital human component--the acquisition workforce.\n  While contract spending has risen dramatically, the number of \nacquisition professionals who help plan, award, and oversee these \ncontracts has been stagnant. And with roughly half of the current \nacquisition workforce eligible to retire by 2018, the difficulties of \nstrengthening that workforce are becoming increasingly acute. A well-\ntrained and adequately sized acquisition workforce is critical to \nmanaging and overseeing federal spending and the increasingly complex \nprocurements of services and goods.\n  The two pieces of legislation I am introducing today are designed to \naddress these important long-term goals.\n  The Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act would create a centrally \nmanaged, Government-wide Acquisition Management Fellows Program that \ncombines both a Master's degree-level academic curriculum and on-the-\njob training in multiple federal agencies. By partnering with leading \nuniversities that have specialized government acquisition programs, the \ngovernment can attract top-caliber students and retain our best \ngovernment employees who are interested in pursuing both academic \nadvancement and public service.\n  Compared to the several existing, agency-specific intern programs, \nthis government-wide program would provide a much-needed skill set that \nwe currently do not have in sufficient number; that is, acquisition \nprofessionals with multi-agency and multi-disciplinary training who can \nunderstand and manage government-wide acquisition needs and \nperspectives.\n  Considering that interagency acquisition now accounts for \napproximately 40 percent of the Federal Government's entire contract \nspending, and that GAO has designated the management of interagency \ncontracting a high-risk area since 2005, it is evident that we need to \ndevelop future acquisition leaders who understand government-wide needs \nand perspectives and are able to operate effectively outside of the \ntraditional, single-agency environment.\n  Specifically, the Acquisition Management Fellows Program would \ninclude one academic year of full-time, on-campus training followed by \n2 years of on-the-job and part-time training toward a Masters or \nequivalent graduate degree in related fields; and a curriculum that \nwould include rotational assignments at three or more executive \nagencies covering, among other issues, acquisition planning, cost-\nestimating, formation and post-award administration of ``high risk'' \ncontract types, and interagency contracts.\n  Upon graduation, participants will have completed all required, non-\nagency-specific training courses necessary for a basic contracting \nofficer warrant.\n  In addition, participants would be required to enter into a service \ncommitment to ensure the Federal Government receives a proper return on \nits investment. The service commitment would be no less than 1 year for \neach year a participant is in the program, and would require \nreimbursement of funds for those who do not successfully complete the \nprogram or do not fulfill the minimum service requirements.\n  Our second bill, the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act, \nwould strengthen the Federal Acquisition Institute, FAI, whose key \nresponsibilities are to promote career development and strategic human \ncapital management for the entire civilian acquisition workforce.\n  The FAI has remained largely underutilized due to a lack of \norganizational clarity, the disproportionate funding compared to its \ncounterpart in the Department of Defense, and its intermittent use by a \nfew Federal agencies.\n  The proposed legislation would establish a clear line of \nresponsibility and accountability for the Institute by requiring that \nFAI, through its Board of Directors, report directly to the Office of \nFederal Procurement Policy, OFPP; the director of FAI be appointed by \nthe OFPP Administrator, and report directly to the OFPP Associate \nAdministrator for Acquisition Workforce; all existing civilian agency \ntraining programs follow guidelines issued by OFPP, which would ensure \nconsistent training standards necessary to develop uniform core \ncompetencies; and the OFPP Administrator report annually to \nCongressional committees of jurisdiction projected FAI budget needs and \nexpense plans to fulfill its statutory mandate.\n  With respect to its core government-wide functions, FAI would be \nrequired to provide and keep current government-wide training standards \nand certification requirements including ensuring effective agency \nimplementation of government-wide training and certification standards; \nanalyzing the curriculum to ascertain if all certification competencies \nare covered, or if adjustments are necessary; developing career-path \ninformation for certified professionals to encourage retention in \ngovernment positions; and coordinating with the Office of Personnel \nManagement for human capital efforts.\n  The administration has identified acquisition workforce development \nas a pillar for improving acquisition practices and contract \nperformance. While I fully agree with this goal, we need specific and \nconcrete action to solve this problem.\n  Our legislation would prompt the sustained effort necessary to \nrebuild the acquisition workforce. While this will take time and \ninvestment, I am confident this is a wise investment that will yield \nsubstantial returns. Just think about it: if our better-trained \nacquisition professionals can prevent one failed procurement, it can \nsave the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars. If they can avoid \noverpaying one percent of our contract spending, it\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\nwill save the taxpayer more than five billion dollars each year. The \nnumbers speak for themselves.\n  The Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act and the Federal Acquisition \nInstitute Improvement Act are critically needed and both enjoy \nbipartisan support. I encourage my colleagues to support them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 761\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to require the establishment of teacher evaluation programs; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Securing \nTeacher Effectiveness, Leaders, Learning, And Results Act of 2011--the \nSTELLAR Student Act, and I am honored to be joined in this bipartisan \neffort by my colleagues Senator Scott Brown and Senator Mary Landrieu. \nThe STELLAR Student Act will ensure that all students are taught by \neffective teachers and that all teachers are supported by effective \nprincipals.\n  Teacher and principal effectiveness are critical factors in improving \nstudent learning and achievement. Research shows that increasing \nteacher quality is one of the most effective and promising strategies \nfor improving education in the United States. Some studies show that \nthe differences in achievement gains for students who had the most \neffective teachers versus those who had the least effective teachers \nwere greater than any single influence of class-size, race, socio-\neconomic status, or parent education. Estimates suggest that the \ndifference between having a highly effective teacher versus a highly \nineffective teacher can be as much as a full year's learning growth.\n  Imagine the dire situation for a student who has a highly ineffective \nteacher for multiple years in a row. It is a situation that many \nstudents experience and potentially never recover from. There are far \ntoo many ineffective teachers, especially in less affluent urban \ndistricts. In many cases, due to antiquated hiring and firing protocols \nand policies, those ineffective teachers are keeping innovative young \nteachers from teaching where they are needed most. It is essential that \nwe begin to differentiate between those highly effective and highly \nineffective teachers and principals, especially when it comes to making \npersonnel decisions in these challenging economic times.\n  The STELLAR Student Act of 2011 aims to encourage States to do just \nthat by directing States to develop evaluation systems that consider \nstudent achievement and classroom observation, and to use those \nevaluations for key personnel decisions including pay, tenure, lay-\noffs, and retention.\n  To further these goals, the STELLAR Student Act of 2011 would \nspecifically direct States to implement a teacher assessment system \nthat bases teacher effectiveness predominantly on student academic \ngrowth and other measures including classroom observations; direct \nStates to implement a principal assessment system that bases \neffectiveness predominantly on student academic growth as well as \nimprovement in graduation rates, leadership, and successful hiring, \ndevelopment, evaluation, and retention of teachers; tie Title 1 funding \nto teacher and principal evaluations that incorporate multiple \nmeasures, relying predominantly on measures of student academic growth \nand achievement, as well as classroom performance; require that \nevaluations be used to inform key personnel decisions including tenure, \ncompensation, and layoffs in the event of any reduction in force; \nencourage input from teachers and principals in the development and \nimprovement of evaluations; and encourage improved targeting of \nprofessional development based on these evaluations.\n  The STELLAR Student Act addresses the fact that current teacher and \nprincipal evaluation systems are inadequate. Evaluation measures for \nteachers are not strongly linked to their ability to teach. In fact, \nseniority, not effectiveness, is often the single indicator used for \nmaking teacher personnel decisions. Some studies show that less than 1 \npercent of teachers are identified as unsatisfactory even though we \nknow many more than 1 percent falls into this category. This also means \nthat our most effective teachers are lumped together with less \neffective teachers and are not recognized for their exceptional work.\n  It is time to rethink conventional measures of teacher qualifications \nsuch as advanced degrees, traditional\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\ncredentialing, and years of experience as measures of teacher quality, \nand focus instead on actual measures of teacher effectiveness, such as \nstudent academic growth. Indeed, many States are looking for ways to \ntie teacher performance to student achievement and then use this \ninformation to inform personnel decisions. The STELLAR Student Act will \nhelp States do just that.\n  Although we believe it is important to hold teachers and principals \naccountable for student achievement, teachers and principals are \ncertainly not the problem--they are an essential part of the solution. \nThis bill asks for input from teachers and principals in designing and \nimproving assessment systems, recognizes the importance of observation \nand other ongoing formative assessments, highlights the need for \nmeaningful professional development, and asks States to duly recognize \nthose effective teachers and leaders. The STELLAR Student Act also \nencourages school districts to assist low performing teachers by \nsetting up targeted remediation and improvement plans.\n  Many teachers and parents also recognize and support the need for \neffective teacher evaluation linked to student performance. In a recent \nsurvey, 69 percent of teachers and 92 percent of parents support \nmeasuring teacher effectiveness based on student growth. In addition, \nmost teachers--approximately 80 percent--and parents--approximately 96 \npercent--also believe that giving schools more ability to remove \nteachers who are not serving students well should be another priority. \nFrom the same survey, teachers in schools with high proportions of low-\nincome students, high proportions of minority students, and those in \nurban or rural schools are more likely than other teachers to say that \nusing measurements of teacher effectiveness that are based in \nsignificant part on student growth is something that must be done. \nThose same teachers are also more likely to say that giving schools \ngreater ability to remove teachers who are not serving students well is \nsomething that must be done.\n  The Administration and many States are already moving in the \ndirection of increased accountability and effective teacher and \nprincipal assessments. As the President said in the State of the Union \n``we do want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for the \nbad ones.'' A number of States, many of which are leaders in education \nreform, are exploring ways to hold teachers and principals more \naccountable along with rethinking ideas around tenure and the long \nstanding last-in-first-out policies.\n  Whether your concern is that our students rank behind 30 other \ncountries in math, that 1.2 million students drop out of school each \nyear, or that an unacceptable achievement gap still persists for our \nlow income and minority students, all of us must act on the urgent need \nto put forth a strong bipartisan effort to fix our education system. \nThe reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, long \noverdue, affords us the opportunity. We must work across the aisle to \nfix what is broken in the current education law. We hope the STELLAR \nStudent Act will be considered in the context of the ESEA rewrite, to \nensure effective teachers and principals for every child and every \nschool. Our colleagues in the House have introduced a similar bill, and \nI urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the STELLAR Student Act \nof 2011.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 763\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Effective teachers and principals are the backbone of \n     our schools and the key to successful students.\n       (2) Teachers and principals deserve our full support as \n     they take on one of the most important and most challenging \n     responsibilities--educating our children.\n       (3) Research shows that high-quality and effective teaching \n     is the single most important school-based factor impacting \n     student learning.\n       (4) High-quality evaluations that provide meaningful \n     feedback are a crucial element in giving educators the \n     support they need to help students achieve at high levels.\n       (5) Teachers and principals also deserve access to high-\n     quality professional development opportunities.\n       (6) Constructive feedback specifying areas for improvement \n     could be useful to both teachers and principals.\n       (7) Although research also suggests that quality teacher \n     evaluations are an important tool in improving teacher \n     performance, for many teachers, the current evaluation \n     systems do not provide useful feedback that would help the \n     teachers improve and grow as instructors.\n       (8) In formal studies, including research highlighted in \n     ``The Widget Effect'', nearly 75 percent of teachers reported \n     that they have not received specific suggestions on how to \n     improve classroom practices in annual evaluations.\n       (9) Across all local educational agencies, only 43 percent \n     of teachers, including novice teachers who may benefit the \n     most from suggestions, report that current evaluations \n     systems help them.\n       (10) Research also shows that school leadership quality is \n     second only to teacher quality among school-related factors \n     that impact student learning.\n       (11) Strong school leadership is a key determinant of \n     whether schools can attract and retain effective teachers. \n     Principals set the direction and the vision for a school.\n       (12) Effective teachers and principals also deserve to be \n     recognized for excellence and receive commendations in areas \n     of strong performance and significant improvement.\n       (13) High-quality teacher and principal evaluations have \n     the potential to be a powerful tool and should play a \n     significant role in improving the public education system.\n       (14) Teachers and principals should provide input and \n     contribute directly to designing, implementing, and improving \n     evaluation systems in their school districts.\n       (15) Students and parents deserve effective teachers and \n     inspirational principals who are performing to the best of \n     their ability and who are helping to close achievement gaps \n     and raise student achievement.\n\n     SEC. 3. ROBUST TEACHER AND PRINCIPAL EVALUATIONS.\n\n       (a) Teacher and Principal Evaluations.--Section 1111(a) of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Report on teacher and principal evaluations.--For any \n     State desiring to receive a grant under this part, the State \n     educational agency shall submit to the Secretary not later \n     than 1 year after the date of enactment of the Securing \n     Teacher Effectiveness, Leaders, Learning, And Results Act, a \n     report on--\n       ``(A) the system in the State of evaluating teachers' and \n     principals' performance;

The Oregon \nCaves Revitalization Act of 2011 was first introduced in 2008, and \nagain in the last Congress. It progressed out of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee in the last Congress but unfortunately there wasn't \nan opportunity to vote on it on the Senate Floor. The Devil's Staircase \nWilderness Act of 2011 also moved out of the Committee but failed to \nget a vote in the full Senate. The Chetco River Protection Act of 2011 \nwas also introduced last session, but there was not enough time to get \na hearing before the Senate adjourned. I am pleased to again introduce \nthese bills with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley. My \ncolleague in the House of Representatives, Representative DeFazio, will \nalso be introducing companion legislation today.\n  The first bill I am introducing, the Oregon Caves Revitalization Act \nof 2011, will expand the boundary of the National Park Service land to \ncreate the Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve. Under this \nbill, the stunning majesty of both the underground and the aboveground \ntreasures found at this National Monument site will be protected for \nfuture generations.\n  Established by a Presidential Proclamation in 1909, the Oregon Caves \nNational Monument is a 480-acre natural wonder located in the \nbotanically-rich Siskiyou Mountains. It was originally set aside \nbecause of its unusual scientific interest and importance. Oregon Caves \nhas a unique geologic history and is particularly known as the longest \nmarble cave open to the public west of the Continental Divide.\n  A perennial stream, the ``River Styx''--an underground portion of \nCave Creek--flows through part of the cave and is one of the dynamic \nnatural forces at work in the National Monument. The cave ecosystem \nprovides habitat for numerous plants and animals, including some state-\nsensitive species such as Townsend's big-eared\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nbats and several cave-adapted species of arthropods found only in only \none place on Earth: the Oregon Caves. The caves possess a significant \ncollection of Pleistocene aged fossils, including jaguar and grizzly \nbear. In 1995, grizzly bear bones found in the cave were estimated to \nbe at least 50,000 years old, the oldest known from either North or \nSouth America.\n  Today, I am proposing legislation that will enhance the protection \nfor treasures such as these found within the Oregon Caves National \nMonument and that will increase public recreation opportunities by \nadding surrounding lands to the National Park Service site. My bill \nwould expand the park site by 4,070 acres to include the entire Cave \nCreek Watershed, and transfer management of the land from the United \nStates Forest Service to the National Park Service. The newly acquired \nlands will be designated as a Preserve so that hunters can still use \nthem. In addition, my legislation would designate at least 9.6 miles of \nrivers and tributaries as Wild, Scenic, or Recreational, under the \nfederal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, including the first subterranean \nWild and Scenic River, the River Styx. This bill would also authorize \nthe retirement of existing grazing allotments.\n\n  When the Oregon Caves National Monument was established in 1909, the \nfocus was on the unique subsurface resources, and the small rectangular \nboundary was thought to be adequate to protect the cave. Through the \nyears, however, scientific research and technology have provided new \ninformation about the cave's ecology, and the impacts from the surface \nenvironment and the related hydrological processes. The current 480-\nacre boundary simply can't adequately protect this cave system. The \nNational Park Service has formally proposed a boundary modification \nnumerous times, first in 1939, again in 1949, and most recently in \n2000. Today, I am happy to again propose legislation to enact that \nboundary adjustment into law.\n  The Oregon Caves National Monument makes a unique contribution to \nSouthern Oregon's economy and to the national heritage. The Monument \nreceives over 80,000 visitors annually and a larger Monument boundary \nwill help showcase more fully the recreational opportunities on the \nabove-ground lands within the proposed Monument boundary. The \nMonument's above-ground lands in the Siskiyou Mountains possess a \nbeauty and diversity that is unique in America, and indeed the world. \nThe Oregon Caves National Monument's approximately 500 plants, 5,000 \nanimals, 2,000 fungi, and over a million bacteria per acre that make \nthe spot have one of the highest concentrations of biological diversity \nanywhere.\n  Expanding the Monument's boundary will also preserve the caves' \nresources by protecting the water that enters the cave. By granting the \nNational Park Service the ability to safeguard these resources, and by \nproviding for a voluntary donation of grazing permits, my legislation \nwill be able to better protect these resources. Over the decades, the \nnumber of allowed livestock has diminished, but the livestock still has \nan impact on the drinking water supply and the water quality of this \nnatural gem. The current grazing permitee, Phil Krouse's family, has \nhad the Big Grayback Grazing Allotment, 19,703 acre, since 1937. Mr. \nKrouse has publicly stated that he would look favorably upon retirement \nwith private compensation for his allotment, which my legislation will \nallow to proceed.\n  The second bill I am introducing is the Devil's Staircase Wilderness \nAct of 2011, which designates approximately 30,540 acres surrounding \nthe Wasson Creek area as Wilderness. Devil's Staircase personifies what \nWilderness in Oregon is all about. It is rugged, wild, pristine and \nremote. So rugged, in fact, that land managers have repeatedly \nwithdrawn this landslide-prone forest from all timbering activity and \nintrepid hikers must follow elk and deer trails and keep a sharp eye on \na compass. The proposed Devil's Staircase Wilderness is the finest old-\ngrowth forest remaining in Oregon's Coast Range, boasting huge Douglas-\nfir, cedar and hemlock and a wealth of threatened and endangered \nspecies. Wildlife include threatened marbled murrelets and the highest \ndensity of Northern Spotted Owls in the coastal mountains.\n  My proposal would not only protect the forests surrounding Wasson \nCreek but would also designate approximately 4.5 miles of Franklin \nCreek and approximately 10.1 miles of Wasson Creek as Wild and Scenic \nRivers. Franklin Creek, a critically important tributary to the Umpqua \nRiver, is one of the best examples of pristine salmon habitat left in \nOregon. Together with Wasson Creek, these two streams in the Devil's \nStaircase area deserve Wild and Scenic River designation by Congress.\n  The ecological significance of this treasure is apparent. The land is \nprotected as a Late-Successional Reserve by the Northwest Forest Plan, \nas critical habitat for the northern spotted owl, and as an Area of \nCritical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management. \nPreserving these majestic forests as Wilderness for their wildlife and \nspectacular scenery matches the goals of the existing land management \nplans. I look forward to protecting this gem for future generations.\n  For over a decade, I've advocated for protections for the Chetco and \nother threatened waterways in Southwest Oregon. I'm reintroducing a \nthird piece of legislation today that would continue that effort. The \nChetco River Protection Act of 2011 would withdraw about three miles of \nthe Chetco River from mineral entry, while upgrading the designations \nfor some portions.\n  This river is under immediate threat from out-of-state suction dredge \nminers. The group American Rivers said last year that the Chetco was \nthe seventh most endangered river in the country because of those \nthreats. This is a river that is hugely important for salmon habitat \nand local sport fishing. The passage of this legislation would mean \nprotecting that habitat, and promoting the continued success of the \nfishing industry throughout the West Coast.\n  Withdrawing these portions of the river from future mineral entry \nwill prevent future harmful mining claims and make sure that those \nclaims that already exist are valid I am pleased the Obama \nadministration has taken some steps to protect this area, but the \npassage of this legislation is needed to ensure long-term protection \nfor this important river.\n  Finally, I want to express my thanks to the conservation, recreation \nand business communities of Southern and Coastal Oregon, and Phil \nKrouse for his strong conservation ethic. All of them have worked \ndiligently to protect these special places. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Merkley, Representative DeFazio, and other colleagues and \nthe bill's other supporters to keep up the fight for these unique \nplaces in Oregon and get these pieces of legislation to the President's \ndesk for his signature.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 767. A bill to improve the calculation of, the reporting of, and \nthe accountability for, secondary school graduation rates; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in today's rapidly changing, global \nknowledge-based economy, making sure that all students graduate from \nhigh school is more important than ever. A high school diploma opens \nthe doors to postsecondary education and workforce development \nprograms, which lead to jobs that pay family-sustaining wages. The \nbottom line is that a high school diploma is no longer an option--it is \nan essential education credential that all Americans need to have in \norder to successfully compete in the workforce. Yet, for far too many, \na high school diploma is still out of reach. According to researchers \nat Johns Hopkins University, one out of every three students who enters \nthe ninth grade fails to graduate from high school within 4 years. An \nestimated 12 million students will drop out of school during the next \ndecade, costing the Nation more than $3 trillion in forgone revenues \nand increased social service costs.\n  When Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, we \nrequired that accountability determinations for high schools include \ngraduation rates. However, the law did not require States to use a \ncommon formula for calculating graduation rates nor did it set \ngraduation rate goals for high schools. As a result, states created \ndifferent calculations that have led to inconsistent and inaccurate \nreporting of\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\ngraduation rates. Without transparency, we cannot know the full extent \nof our Nation's dropout crisis, hold schools accountable, or design \neffective solutions.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce the Every Student Counts Act, \nwhich my colleague Rep. Bobby Scott will introduce in the House today. \nThis legislation will ensure the accurate calculation and reporting of \nhigh school graduation rates, and will hold States, districts, and \nschools accountable for ensuring that all students graduate with a high \nschool diploma.\n  The Every Student Counts Act builds upon steps taken by all 50 States \nand the Department of Education to ensure more accurate calculations of \nand reporting of high school graduation rates.\n  Four years into the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, \nState leaders recognized the need for consistent graduation rate \ncalculations and governors from all 50 States joined together in 2005 \nto call for a uniform graduation rate across the States. This \nleadership from the States was crucial in calling attention to the \nproblem of inaccurate graduation rate calculations and formed the basis \nfor action. In 2008, the U.S. Department of Education built on the \ngovernors' laudable work and issued regulations that require states to \nuse a single, accurate graduation rate calculation and to set \ngraduation rate goals and annual growth targets.\n\n  The 2008 regulations were an important step in the right direction, \nbut they need to be improved and codified so that states, districts, \nand schools no longer have to rely solely on regulations that could be \nreversed. The Every Student Counts Act codifies key pieces of the \nregulations while making improvements where necessary. Specifically, \nthis act sets a uniform graduation rate goal of 90 percent and requires \nschools that do not meet this goal to improve their graduation rate \nannually by three percentage points. Additionally, this act builds upon \nthe States' and the Department of Education's graduation rate \ncalculation work by giving credit to schools for students who graduate \nin more than 4 years through a cumulative graduation rate calculation, \nwhile maintaining the expectation that all students graduate within 4 \nyears.\n  This legislation will bring transparency and accountability to \nschools across the Nation to help them provide all students with the \nhigh school diploma they need to have a chance to succeed in \npostsecondary education and the global economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Every Student Counts Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In order for the United States to retain a competitive \n     edge in the world economy, it is essential that youth in the \n     United States be prepared for the jobs of today and for the \n     jobs of the future. Such jobs increasingly require \n     postsecondary education, and according to a 2008 Department \n     of Labor report, almost 90 percent of the fastest growing and \n     best paying jobs require some postsecondary education.\n       (2) Individuals without a regular secondary school diploma \n     experience higher rates of unemployment, incarceration, \n     poverty, and receipt of public assistance than individuals \n     with a regular secondary school diploma.\n       (3) According to the 2009 Center for Public Education \n     report ``Better late than never? Examining late high school \n     graduates'', on-time graduation with a regular secondary \n     school diploma leads to the best outcomes for students, but \n     students who graduate late with a regular secondary school \n     diploma are still more likely to earn an associate or a \n     baccalaureate degree, to be employed full-time, and to obtain \n     a job with retirement benefits and health insurance than are \n     either students who drop out of secondary school or students \n     who receive a GED.\n       (4) About 1,300,000 secondary school students, which is \n     approximately \\1/3\\ of all secondary school students in the \n     United States, fail to graduate with their peers every year. \n     According to the Department of Education, the United States \n     secondary school graduation rate is only 75 percent.\n       (5) The graduation rates for historically disadvantaged \n     minority groups are far lower than that of their White peers. \n     Little more than half of all African-American and Hispanic \n     students finish secondary school on time with a regular \n     secondary school diploma, while more than \\3/4\\ of White \n     students finish secondary school on time with a regular \n     secondary school diploma.\n       (6) Nearly 2,000 secondary schools (about 12 percent of all \n     secondary schools in the United States) produce about half of \n     the Nation's secondary school dropouts. In these schools, the \n     number of seniors is routinely 60 percent or less than the \n     number of freshmen 3 years earlier. While 34 percent of the \n     Nation's African-American students and nearly 28 percent of \n     Latino students attend these ``dropout factories'', only 16 \n     percent of White students do.\n       (7) The average gap between State-reported graduation rates \n     and independently-reported graduation rates is approximately \n     11 percent.\n       (8) In 2005, all 50 of the Nation's Governors signed the \n     National Governors Association's Graduation Rate Compact, \n     pledging to use a common, accurate graduation rate.\n       (9) In 2008, the Secretary of Education released final \n     regulations that also require States to report a common \n     graduation rate calculation. However, since the Department of \n     Education did not specify in the regulations what graduation \n     rate goals and growth targets are appropriate and how States \n     should include 4-year rates and extended year rates in \n     calculating adequate yearly progress, it is necessary to \n     clarify these goals, targets and rates in order to create a \n     meaningful Federal accountability system for secondary \n     schools.\n       (10) State-set targets to make adequate yearly progress \n     under the Secretary of Education's 2008 regulations are \n     numerous in type and varied in aggressiveness. Twenty-eight \n     States have set a graduation rate goal of less than 90 \n     percent. At least 8 States have set status targets that do \n     not take into consideration progress toward the State-set \n     goal. Furthermore, only 2 of the 9 States that include \n     extended year rates in measures of adequate yearly progress \n     do so in a way that places a priority on graduating students \n     within 4 years.\n       (11) The most accurate graduation rate calculations rely on \n     high-quality longitudinal data systems that track individual \n     student data from the time a student enters kindergarten \n     through the time such student finishes 12th grade. Forty-\n     eight States plan to have data systems that will provide \n     secondary school data that will allow such States to use the \n     graduation rate formula specified in the Department of \n     Education's 2008 final regulations not later than the 2011-\n     2012 school year.\n       (12) An accountability system with meaningful graduation \n     rate goals--\n       (A) holds schools, school districts, and States responsible \n     for both student achievement and outcomes; and\n       (B) ensures that low-performing students are not \n     unnecessarily held back or encouraged to leave school without \n     a diploma.\n       (13) Prior to the 2008 regulations, the amendments to the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.) made by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 \n     (Public Law 107-110) did not require consistent calculations, \n     meaningful goals, or disaggregation of graduation rates. \n     Without clear guidance from the Department of Education, most \n     secondary schools can continue to make adequate yearly \n     progress by making as little as 0.1 percent improvement or \n     less in secondary school graduation rates each year and can \n     do so with a consistent, or even growing, secondary school \n     graduation gap among subgroups of students.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to require consistent calculations and reporting of \n     secondary school graduation rates across schools, school \n     districts, and States;\n       (2) to provide educators with critical information about \n     student progress toward secondary school graduation; and\n       (3) to ensure meaningful accountability for the improvement \n     of secondary school graduation rates for all students, \n     particularly for poor and minority students.\n\n     SEC. 4. SECONDARY SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES.\n\n       Subpart 1 of part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) is \n     amended by inserting after section 1111 (20 U.S.C. 6311) the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1111A.

Res. 137\n\n       Whereas the Take Our Daughters To Work Day program was \n     created in New York City as a response to research that \n     showed that, by the 8th grade, many girls were dropping out \n     of school, had low self-esteem, and lacked confidence;\n       Whereas, in 2003, the name of the program was changed to \n     ``Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work Day'' so that boys who \n     face many of the same challenges as girls could also be \n     involved in the program;\n       Whereas the mission of the program, to develop ``innovative \n     strategies that empower girls and boys to overcome societal \n     barriers to reach their full potential'', now fully reflects \n     the addition of boys;\n       Whereas the Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work Foundation, \n     a nonprofit organization, has grown to become 1 of the \n     largest public awareness campaigns, with more than 33,000,000 \n     participants annually in more than 3,000,000 organizations \n     and workplaces in every State;\n       Whereas, in 2007, the Take Our Daughters To Work program \n     transitioned to Elizabeth City, North Carolina, became known \n     as the Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work Foundation, and \n     received national recognition for the dedication of the \n     Foundation to future generations;\n       Whereas every year, mayors, governors, and other private \n     and public officials sign proclamations and lend their \n     support to Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work;\n       Whereas the fame of the Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work \n     program has spread overseas, with requests and inquiries \n     being made from around the world on how to operate the \n     program;\n       Whereas Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day will be \n     observed on Thursday, April 28, 2011; and\n       Whereas Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work is intended to \n     continue helping millions of girls and boys on an annual \n     basis\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\n     through experienced activities and events to examine their \n     opportunities and strive to reach their fullest potential: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the goals of introducing our daughters and \n     sons to the workplace; and\n       (2) commends all the participants in Take Our Daughters and \n     Sons To Work for their ongoing contributions to education, \n     and for the vital role the participants play in promoting and \n     ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/07/senate-section/article/S2282-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 287.
