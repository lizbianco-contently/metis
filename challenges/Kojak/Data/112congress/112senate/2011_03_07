Mr. President, budgets and votes have something very \nimportant in common: At their heart, both require and reflect tough \nchoices.\n  Tomorrow we hope the Senate will vote on the Republican response to \nthe President's budget. That is the so-called H.R. 1. Not only is the \nUnited States now focused on it, but the entire world is as well. Then \nwe will vote on the Democratic response. Everyone has done the math and \neveryone knows how these votes will turn out. It is likely neither \nproposal will pass, which means neither will reach the President's \ndesk, and we will go back to\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\nsquare one, back to the negotiating table.\n  But tomorrow's votes are still significant. Just as our budget--that \nis, how we invest taxpayer money and invest our resources--reflects our \nvalues, so will the votes cast on these two competing measures. They \nwill show us which Senators are serious about fortifying our long-term \nfuture and which are more concerned with scoring short-term political \npoints. These votes will show us who wants an easy applause line and \nwho wants to strengthen our Nation's bottom line.\n  As the two parties' vastly different proposals make clear, there is a \nfine line between a responsible budget and a reckless budget. The \nRepublican plan we will vote on tomorrow is the same plan the tea party \nalready pushed through the House of Representatives. It is called H.R. \n1. Now the same tea party is trying to push it through the Senate. That \nplan will cost 700,000 Americans, including 6,000 Nevadans, their jobs, \nand I will not support that nor will any other Democrat I know of here \nin the Senate. The figure of 700,000 is not a figure picked out of the \nair. Economists generally agree that is a huge job loss for our \ncountry--economists led by Mark Zandi, whom I have said on this floor \non a number of occasions has a pretty good resume. He is a chief \neconomist at Moody's now. He is a noted economist and was John McCain's \nchief economic adviser during the campaign.\n  The tea party Republicans are hoping America will see their budget's \npricetag and swoon over its cuts. They are hoping the country doesn't \nlook under the hood and see what is wrong. That is because they know \nthat when we do, we will see their shiny new budget is a lemon and has \na badly broken engine.\n  I can remember I represented a number of car dealers when I practiced \nlaw. One of them was a wonderful man. His son is now running his \noperations. There was someone out picketing his place of business and \nhe had a great big lemon. He alleged he had bought a car there at \nFindlay Oldsmobile and it was a lemon. I was an attorney wanting to \nstop that. I was ready to go to court and get an injunction to stop \nthat. Pete Findlay called me and said, look, there is something wrong \nwith that car and I don't want people to buy cars when there is \nsomething wrong with them. Take care of it. We will get him another \ncar.\n  Well, that is what the Republicans should do with the lemon they are \ntrying to perpetuate over here. As I said, when we look under the hood \nof H.R. 1, we find it is not a good piece of legislation, and that is a \ngross understatement. H.R. 1 has not only a broken engine, it is a \nlemon in many other respects.\n  To pull ourselves out of this ditch, we need an engine that powers \ngrowth, innovation, and our being more competitive. We need one that \npowers a recovery. The last thing we can afford is a broken engine that \nwill drive us right back into recession. We can't fix a broken economy \nwith a broken engine. But that is exactly what the Republican House is \ntrying to sell us with this H.R. 1. The tea party plan will make \nNevada's students and workers less competitive and will make Nevada's \nfamilies and communities even less safe.\n\n  It hurts education, which, of course, threatens our future. There are \nmany examples, but let me give two or three, starting where many of our \nchildren start--in early education. Head Start is a successful early \neducation program for the poorest of the poor. It has been proven Head \nStart students are much more likely than their peers to graduate from \nhigh school. But under the Republicans' plan--this tea party plan, this \nH.R. 1--200,000 Head Start students, including hundreds and hundreds in \nNevada, will be basically eliminated from the school system. That is a \ncareless short-term cut with devastating long-term consequences.\n  Second, what about students who are already out of high school and go \nto college thanks to Pell grants? If the Republican plan were to pass, \nthose Nevada undergraduates who rely on Pell grants would see their \ntuition assistance cut by more than $600 a year. That means one of two \nthings: These students' tuition bills will go up or they will be forced \nto drop out. We can't afford this. Either choice is a bad choice.\n  Third, what about those who are already in the workplace who are \nlooking to join the job market? This tea party proposal would cost \nNevada $30 million in job training investments. That would hurt about \n8,000 potential Nevada workers. These cuts won't do anything to help \nunemployment go down or help Nevada's economy get back on its feet.\n  We all know we have to make some sacrifices. We know there have to be \ncuts made. We have made them. But these Republican cuts, as indicated \nin H.R. 1, dealing with education alone, as I have mentioned, are \ncounterproductive. If we slice budgets in the name of a stronger future \nbut cut the most important way to strengthen our future, what have we \naccomplished? Nothing. We have made things much worse.\n  It is not just education. Let's talk about a few more of these \ndangerous consequences the Republicans' reckless budget would have for \nNevada. The same would apply to Connecticut. It would pull the plug on \nrenewable energy jobs in Nevada, including 600 new jobs at the State's \nlargest solar plant. It would fire another 600 Nevadans who work at \ncommunity health centers. One of the outstanding things we did in the \nhealth care bill is we put $10 billion in that bill to build 10,000 new \ncommunity health centers across the country. These aren't just for poor \npeople, but they do help poor people a lot. It gives a place for people \nto go so our emergency rooms don't become overrun. All of the medical \neconomists say it will cut down the cost of health care delivery \nsignificantly. But that isn't what the Republicans do. The 600 Nevadans \nwho work at community health centers would basically be eliminated, \nwhich means fewer Nevadans would have jobs and the neediest among us \nwould have fewer places to turn when they need help getting healthy.\n  It would cut more than $1.5 million from local law enforcement \nprograms to help Nevada prevent crime, fight domestic violence, and \nkeep our neighborhoods safe from gangs. The plan would cut homeland \nsecurity investments by about $1 million which puts every Nevadan and \neveryone who visits Nevada at risk. Some 60 million people a year visit \nLas Vegas alone. These cuts threaten the health of our economy, our \ncommunities, and our citizens.\n  The Democrats know we cannot make our economy work again for the \nmiddle class unless we invest the taxpayers' money as responsibly, \nefficiently, and transparently as possible. So for anyone to say we \ndon't think there should be cuts--we believe there should be cuts. We \nhave proven that. We have already cut $51 billion below what the \nPresident recommended, and it was a pretty austere budget he presented. \nYes, it is easy to demonize any investments we make by calling it \ngovernment spending. It has always been a political shortcut to demand \nthat we slice zeroes off the end of the national budget. But before we \ngo on a reckless cutting spree, let's think about what these \ninvestments do, whom they help, and how much they mean to our future.\n  That is what Democrats have thought about as we drafted our plan. We \nmade responsible cuts to the tune of $51 billion below President \nObama's budget. We have made some difficult choices. But where the \nRepublican plan cuts indiscriminately, we have cut carefully. Where the \nRepublican plan is based on ideology, ours is based on reality.\n  Some of the ideological cuts: Eliminate public broadcasting, \neliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities. There are scores of things they have \ndone, cutting indiscriminately. Where the Republicans' plan is based on \nideology, ours is based on reality. That is because we know the whole \npoint is to cut in a way that strengthens our economy, not in a way \nthat weakens it. Our cuts eliminate redundancies, end unnecessary \nprograms, and stop funding for earmarks. Our plan recognizes our job \nisn't to cut a billion here and a billion there just to say we did.\n  Our plan recognizes, as Democrats do, that we are not in competition \nto determine who can cut the most without regard to consequences; \nrather, we need to cooperate and figure out where we can cut the \nsmartest.\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n  The budget is complex, but the choice is very simple: If we want to \ncreate jobs, the Senate simply cannot pass the plan the tea party has \nalready pushed through the House. We want to responsibly make the cuts \nwe all agree we have to make. The Senate should pass the Democrats' \nproposal to bring down the deficit and keep our economy moving in the \nright direction.\n  If we want to realistically get something done before it is too late, \nthe House and the Senate Democrats and Republicans should return to the \nnegotiating table where we know a good compromise on common ground \nawaits us. The country is waiting too. Time is not on our side.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1311-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I don't think a 6-percent reduction in \nspending that is proposed by the House is going to cause the U.S. \nGovernment to sink into the ocean. States are making far more serious \nreductions in spending than that.\n  The language the majority leader is using seemed to me like the \nlanguage of 1994--reckless Republican spending cuts, poor people thrown \nto the street, and that sort of thing. But what happened in 1994? The \nAmerican people, through their newly elected Congress, balanced the \nbudget in 4 years. They balanced the budget when people said it could \nnot be done. They said the spending reductions were going to destroy \nAmerica's growth and prosperity and everything else they could imagine. \nBut it didn't happen. It helped create a period of outstanding growth.\n  Tuesday, we are told, we will have a key vote. It is a very important \nvote. It deals with the level of spending in which this country is \ngoing to participate. It is going to make a national decision that is \nimportant. We passed a 2-week continuing resolution that reduced \nspending by $4 billion over that period, keeping us on track to meet \nthe House-passed goal of a $61 billion reduction in spending this \nfiscal year. It was a good, small, first step. But the big step will be \ncoming up, I suppose, a week from this Friday when the CR that we \npassed will expire and we have to pass another one. At what level will \nwe pass it? That is the question that will be before us.\n  Will we continue the trend of reduced spending that the House started \nus on and that the American people started us on by the election last \nNovember, just months ago, or do we continue business as usual--\ncontinue to be in denial and say no more, no mas, we can't do anymore, \nwe give up.\n  Well, a vote for the Democratic plan that will be presented tomorrow \nwill be a vote to do nothing. That is a fact. It will be a vote to say \nwe are still in denial. It will be a vote that says deficits don't \nmatter, we can just continue to spend, just continue to invest, and it \nwill all get better in the end. It is a vote for more investment and \nmore spending.\n  Indeed, the Budget Committee, on which I am the ranking Republican, \nhad testimony last week from the Department of Education. They are \nasking for an 11-percent increase, when the inflation rate is 2. The \nDepartment of Energy asked for a 9.5-percent increase. Amazingly, the \nDepartment of Transportation came in with a 62-percent increase in \nspending.\n  Is this the way to bring this country under control? Is that what the \nAmerican people expected when they voted in the last election and sent \nus a new House of Representatives and new Senators? I don't think so. \nIt will be another vote for fear that we can't reduce spending because \nthe Nation will sink into the ocean. I don't think so, and the American \npeople don't think so in the cities, counties, and States that are \nfacing these same situations and making tough decisions and being \nsuccessful at it.\n  The decision we make on spending could well determine the fate of our \nNation and our economy. It is that important; it really is. Forty \npercent of every dollar we spend today is borrowed. We will spend, this \nfiscal year, $3.5 trillion, but we only take in $2.2 trillion. Did you \nknow that? Congress knows that. They are in some denial, but that is a \nfact. It is indisputable, and it is in the President's budget.\n  Over the next 10 years, pursuant to the budget--the plan the \nPresident gave us--interest on the debt will go from $200 billion last \nyear to $844 billion in 1 year. We will double the entire national \ndebt, the gross debt, from $13 trillion to $26 trillion. They claim \nthey are saving $1 trillion. I guess it would have gone to $27 \ntrillion. How can we save $1 trillion when the deficit is going up \nevery year? The lowest single year of deficit is $600 billion. The \nhighest single deficit year President Bush had--which was too high--was \n$450 billion. The lowest they will have is $600 billion, according to \nthe President's own numbers, which he sent to us. This is not an \nacceptable path.\n  We are on the wrong road. This is a road to decline. It is the road \nto dependence upon foreign sources of money to finance our spending \nspree. It is not the road to prosperity and growth. We simply have to \nmake tough choices. We have to make this government leaner and more \nproductive.\n  We need to create growth and prosperity. The growth and prosperity \nhave to be in the private sector. That is who pays the taxes, which \nallows us to continue to have a healthy government. A failure to act at \nthis point in history, after all of the discussion we have had in the \ndebt commission--and several have met and all have called for \nsubstantial reductions in spending. But Congress doesn't get it. This \nis demoralizing for our people, for our government, for investors in \nthe United States, for businesses sitting on capital and thinking about \nwhat the future will be like, whether this is not going to be a sound \neconomy any longer or is the Government of the United States incapable \nof altering its trajectory. They thought perhaps this election was that \nway.\n  Well, the House has sent a clear message. Some think it could have \ngone further. It proposed a $61 billion reduction in discretionary \nspending accounts. That is a 6-percent reduction. We have already \ngotten 4 off that, so it would be $57 billion. When we take these \nnumbers--and I hope we will think about this--when we reduce the \nbaseline by $61 billion for spending in discretionary accounts, that is \nfar larger than some people think.\n  One of the things that got us in trouble is the geometrical problem \nof increasing spending--when we increase spending at 7 percent a year, \nfor example, for 10 years, we double the size of government just like \nyour bank account doubles at 7 percent interest compounded.\n  In reducing spending, the same thing occurs. A $61 billion reduction \nin the baseline, if there were no more reductions over 10 years built \ninto the baseline, will result in about $850 billion in savings. In 10 \nyears, that is almost $1 trillion. That is with just a $61 billion cut. \nIt does make a difference, and it is significant.\n  But President Obama's plan and the Senate Democratic plan do almost \nnothing. He proposes, as I understand it, a $6 billion cut for the rest \nof the fiscal year. That is just about a one-half of 1 percent \nreduction in spending. The Senate Democratic plan, it appears to me, is \na $4 billion reduction, which is less than a one-half of 1 percent \nreduction in spending this year.\n  Those are fake cuts; they are not real cuts. This is Washington talk. \nThis is why this country is virtually broke. The President says he \nproposed a budget to the Congress--as the law requires him to do--and \nthat budget would cause us to live within our means and to begin paying \ndown the debt. That is what he said, and that is what his Budget \nDirector said in testimony before the committee.\n  What planet are they on? The lowest single annual deficit--and if \nanybody on this floor wants to dispute this, I\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\nwould like to hear it. The lowest single annual deficit is over $600 \nbillion in the 10-year plan. They are going up in the outyears to \nalmost $900 billion in the tenth year of the 10-year plan.\n  That is why experts tell us this is an unsustainable course. I wish \nwe weren't in this fix. I will have to take some of the blame too. I \nvoted against a lot of spending programs, but I have supported some, \nand we have gotten ourselves into a fix. It will be hard to get out of \nit. It is not impossible, but we have to take some action. It cannot be \nbusiness as usual. But that is what the majority leader is proposing to \ndo--nothing. Let the interest on our debt go from $200 billion a year \nto $844 billion.\n  Where is that money going to come from? The education budget is $60 \nbillion, the highway budget is $40 billion--$844 billion on interest? \nWhat is it going to crowd out that we would like to spend government \nmoney on? What if we have a debt crisis? Interest rates are at 3.5 \npercent, but a lot of people think this interest rate is not so stable. \nA lot of people are afraid we could have a national or even \ninternational debt crisis. Interest rates could surge.\n  When I bought my first house, the interest rates were double digits. \nI think it was 11.5 percent. Do you think we could not have that \nhappen? Instead of $844 billion in interest, could we have $1\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in interest in 10 years, crowding out all kinds of other \nspending? This is irresponsible. This is an irresponsible course. \nEverybody knows it. We can't borrow our way out of debt.\n  So what is going to happen? Let's pull back the curtain and talk \nabout what the plans are. It is pretty clear if we look at it and have \nbeen around this town a little bit. The Democratic leader didn't want \nto have any debate. He accepted the $4 billion reduction over the 2-\nweek period last week. That was done and nobody talked about it much. \nThe American people assumed things were rolling along pretty well, that \nat least we avoided a government shutdown and things are moving along \npretty well.\n  So now we are going to have another quick vote tomorrow--that was \ndecided, apparently, today--on two plans: the House plan on a 6-percent \nreduction and a Democratic plan with basically no reduction. Then \nneither one will pass.\n  A week from this Friday, the 2-week CR will expire, and we will be \nheading toward a government shutdown. Secret negotiations will begin; \nthey will start talking. Maybe the Vice President will get in there and \ntalk a little bit, and they will move around, and special interests \nwill be involved. The American people will not be in on the discussion. \nThey probably will not invite me in on the discussion. I don't know who \nall will be there, but they will begin to negotiate and talk, and they \nwill be seeking some toothless compromise. There will be warnings and \ncrocodile tears will be shed and they will say we can't have a \ngovernment shutdown. We have had a half dozen for short periods of \ntime, but we certainly don't want one.\n  That is the way they will talk about it--we just can't cut anymore; \nit is going to end--schools will close, health care programs are going \nto close. We have heard it all before. Every State, city, and county \nthat goes through this has the same political rhetoric out there. We \ncan't do it. It just won't happen.\n  Then they are going to expect, I guess, the Republicans to cave, and \nthe plan, of course, as it has been from the beginning, is business as \nusual. Business as usual. Politicians win again. People lose. Elections \nnullified. Business as usual.\n\n  I do not think so. Business as usual has put us on the road to \nbankruptcy. The voters did speak. There is a moral responsibility of \nthis Congress to respond to the legitimate cries of the American \npeople. Do we not have that responsibility? I know one Senator who told \nme that during that election, every single ad they ran talked about \nreducing spending and this Senator won by a margin far more than anyone \npredicted. There is no doubt the American people expect us to reduce \nspending. They know there will be some people who will not get as much \nmoney as they were getting before, but they know we are spending too \nmuch. That is so commonsensical.\n  A vote for the Democratic proposal truly would be a vote for the \nstatus quo. It would be a victory for the status quo. It would be seen \nclearly as a victory for the big spenders. It will be a continuation of \nthe unsustainable fiscal path we are on--the path to decline, the path \nto dependence, debt dependence.\n  The whole world is watching, just as we watched the British. They \nstepped to the plate and made cuts. The Germans have criticized the \nUnited States for excessive spending. The European Union has criticized \nthe United States for our excessive spending. Canada has done a lot \nbetter than the United States in containing spending. The world is \nwatching: What is the United States going to do? Is it going to get its \nhouse in order as the other developed nations are working to do? Have \nthey made a national decision to reform their unsustainable actions?\n  Some say these $61 billion in cuts would hurt growth. I contend that \nabsolutely is not so. In terms of total government spending, we spend \n$3,500 billion. A $60 billion reduction in that spending total is not \ngoing to throw this economy into a recession. Indeed, it would send a \nmessage to the financial world that the American people have gotten it, \nthat the Congress has gotten it, and they are at least beginning to end \nthe unsustainable trajectory this government is on.\n  The idea that we can borrow money, pay interest on it, and create \njobs has not worked. If it were such a good idea, why don't we borrow \nthree times as much and spread around three times as much money? It is \nnot an economically sustainable theory. It will not work, and it has \nnot worked.\n  We are facing a huge national decision. I believe many of my \nDemocratic colleagues get it. They tell me they do. Many of them have \nsaid so publicly. But talk is not enough. Action will be needed. We \nwill begin to take action tomorrow when we cast this vote. Party \nloyalty is fine. We all have to try to work with our leadership. Nobody \ncomplains about that, to a degree, but we are not to be lemmings. We do \nhave a duty to our constituents, our country, and our future to make \nsome tough decisions.\n  For example, I will share one more thought and I will wrap up. I see \nmy colleague, Senator Roberts, an able Senator from Kansas, is here. Do \nnot think we are cutting spending, this 6-percent reduction, from some \ntight baseline of spending, such as may be so in your State, your city \nor your county. In the last 2 years, nondefense discretionary spending \nhas increased 23 percent, and that does not count the stimulus package \nmoney, the $850 billion, the largest expenditure ever in the history of \nthis Republic or any other nation in the history of the world. That is \non top of the 23 percent in spending.\n  For example, the EPA, in 2 years, received a 36-percent increase in \nbaseline spending. They cannot take a 6-percent reduction? Plus, they \ngot a 70-percent increase from the stimulus package, a $7 billion \ninfusion on top of their $10 billion budget.\n  What about the State Department? They got a 132-percent increase in \nspending in the last 2 years, plus $1 billion from the stimulus \npackage.\n  The Education Department asked for an 11-percent increase this year. \nThey received an 11-percent increase previously and--hold your hat--\ntheir budget is about $63 billion now. They got $97 billion out of the \nstimulus package--more than their whole budget.\n  We borrow 40 cents out of every $1 we spend. Our debt will soon \noutgrow our economy. Interest on the debt, under the President's \nbudget, will rise to $844 billion a year. The question is not whether \nwe are headed for a crisis but whether we have time to act to prevent \nit.\n  Our character is tested by how we respond in times of great \nchallenge. This week, the Senate faces such a test: How do we respond \nto the growing fiscal crisis facing our Nation that every expert, \nincluding the debt commission, has told us is real? This is a defining \nvote in the career of every Senator and a defining vote for the Senate. \nA one-half percent proposed reduction in spending by this \nadministration is not anything. It is basically doing nothing.\n  We need every group, every concerned citizen to reach out to \nCongress,\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\nto tell Congress to get off this road to fiscal calamity. To every \nfellow Senator, I say now is the time to stand and be counted. Are my \ncolleagues going to be the vote that helped us turn back from the \nfiscal cliff or the vote that pushed the economy that much further \ntoward the edge?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business \nand that I am recognized for 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe recognized for 15 minutes. I will try to make it short. If it goes \non any longer, I will ask unanimous consent for additional time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Alabama \nfor laying out exactly what we face when we have a vote tomorrow in \nregard to the future of the United States and whether we restore common \nsense to Federal spending and prevent the chaotic situation he so aptly \ndescribed, not only in terms of our immediate future but for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  That says it all in regard to we had a townhall meeting--Senator \nJerry Moran, Congressman Kevin Yoder, and myself in Johnson County, KS. \nIn that meeting, the first question out--it was 100 to 250 people who \nwere so excited: When are you going to get control of this spending? \nThey worry not just about themselves but their kids and grandkids.\n  As usual, we are going to have to dub the Senator from Alabama the \nwatchdog of the Senate, but he so eloquently described what we face. I \nthank him for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1313-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1313-S1315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to speak out against what I \nconsider to be a regulatory assault on our Nation's energy sector. That \nis pretty strong language, but I intend it to be.\n  I listed a number of these proposed regulations in a letter I sent \nearlier today to President Obama. I ask unanimous consent to have this \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2011.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: I write you today to express my \n     sincere appreciation for your recently implemented Executive \n     Order mandating that all federal agencies review and revoke \n     any rules or regulations that place unreasonable burdens on \n     our nation's business community. In light of our current \n     economic crisis, establishing a regulatory environment that \n     promotes growth and job creation should be the number one \n     priority for this Congress and Administration.\n       Many people today believe no agency over the past few years \n     has had more of a negative impact on business growth and \n     regulatory certainty than the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA). Since fiscal year 2010, ten new regulations \n     promulgated by the EPA have accounted for over 23 billion \n     dollars in new costs to the American taxpayer. As your \n     Administration reviews both proposed and promulgated \n     regulations, please consider the following five regulations \n     and the negative economic impact their full implementation \n     will have on our nation:\n       EPA's proposal to amend the current primary 8 hour ozone \n     standard to a range of 60 to 70 parts per billion. The EPA \n     itself has estimated that this new regulation would cost \n     between 19 and 90 billion dollars to fully implement, while \n     providing no rationale as to what new scientific data \n     justifies updating a standard set as recently as 2008.\n       The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration's decision to mandate greater fuel economy and \n     emissions standards for all passenger vehicles and light-duty \n     trucks. Recent analysis has estimated this new regulation \n     will cost the already struggling automobile industry upwards \n     of 10.8 billion dollars to comply, and consumers up to 985 \n     dollars per vehicle in higher purchase prices.\n       The EPA's regulation restricting green house gas emissions \n     from stationary sources. While this regulation currently only \n     affects those stationary sources emitting 75,000 or more tons \n     of carbon per year, future implementations of this rule could \n     negatively impact millions of small businesses and community \n     organizations with costs of over 75 billion dollars a year.\n       The EPA's recently promulgated Reciprocating Internal \n     Combustion Engines (RICE) regulation that requires operators \n     of current diesel or dual fuel engines (those operating on a \n     mix of diesel fuel and natural gas) to install new oxidation \n     catalysts on existing engines. This regulation has already \n     had a profound impact on municipal electric utilities, rural \n     electric cooperatives and agricultural irrigators in Kansas. \n     Costing an estimated $60,000 to $100,000 per engine, this \n     regulation is particularly difficult for small rural Kansas \n     communities that may only operate these engines a few hours \n     every year for emergency situations or extreme weather \n     conditions.\n       As EPA officials prepare to release a final ruling on \n     regulation of coal combustion byproducts (CCB), I highly \n     recommend avoiding any classification of this product as a \n     hazardous waste. Classification of this byproduct as a \n     hazardous waste will restrict further beneficial reuse of \n     CCBs and without any corresponding benefit to the \n     environment.\n       Again, thank you for the opportunity to share my \n     recommendations on what rules and regulations pose serious \n     negative consequences to the growth of our nation. As the \n     112th Congress gets under way, I will continue to identify to \n     your administration regulations that handicap American \n     businesses and halt American job creation. It is my hope that \n     we can create a regulatory environment that provides American \n     businesses with the necessary tools to hire and thrive in \n     this global market.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Pat Roberts,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. We--myself, staff, others, a lot of people I have met \nwith in Kansas, regardless what economic sector we are talking about, \nwhether it is energy, which I wish to talk about today, whether it is \nagriculture, which we talked about last week, health care is coming, \nand then we are going to talk about the financial sector--we have \ntalked about the President's initiative, his Executive order in which \nthe President said rightly--and I applauded that statement that we have \nso many regulations pouring out of Washington and so many regulations \non the books, we do not have a cost-benefit yardstick--that is my \nfavorite term for it--to say: Does the cost exceed the benefit? Does it \nmake sense?\n  The President himself said there are many that are duplicative and \nvery costly and basically are stupid. That is exactly what the \nPresident said. I said ``egregious.'' That is the Senate word. The \nPresident said ``stupid.'' I think everybody understands that. He \nissued an Executive order, and he said to all the Federal agencies: \nPlease, take a look at the regulations that are on the books and all \nthe regulations that are coming out of your agency and see if you can \nmake sense out of it and try to separate out the ones that are \nduplicative, costly, and, yes, stupid and the ones that are not and we \ncan make some progress. I applauded the President's effort.\n  The problem is, it is an Executive order that has no teeth. There are \nthree exemptions--and I will get into that in my prepared remarks, but \nbasically the independent agencies are excluded. There are a bunch of \nthem. There is language in the bill that says, if you are doing it for \nthe public good, the Secretary can say: Oh, well, that does not apply \nto us. How many Secretaries around here--for that matter czars. I guess \nthey are in the room. I don't know what they do. If there is a czar \nsitting there talking to schedule C appointees and says: Do you think \nour regulations serve the public good, of course, they think that. They \nwould not have promulgated them or issued them or thought them up to \nbegin with if they did not think it was for the public good. So they \nare exempt.\n  Then, we have a wonderful paragraph that I defy anybody to \nunderstand. They can also use that in regard to dodging around the \nPresident's Executive order. The President issued an Executive order, \nsaid some very good things to the American public, but it does not have \nany teeth.\n  I have a bill. We have 30 cosponsors. The bill says: Mr. President, \nyou are right with your Executive order. We codify his order, but we \ntake out the exemptions. What a day that would produce--or a year, for \nthat matter--for all Federal agencies, if they truly had to adhere to \nthe President's Executive order. I hope we get more cosponsors and we \ncould actually consider it and actually pass it on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  We have several areas of our economy that are affected in a most \negregious way by all these regulations. I talked about agriculture last \nweek. We are talking about energy today. Health care is coming, and the \nfinancial institutions will be coming after that.\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\n  Even as the price of crude continues to climb above $100 this \nadministration continues to promote domestic energy policies that are \nmaking it more expensive for Americans to put gas in their cars, heat \ntheir homes, power their businesses. Just yesterday in a townhall \nmeeting in Johnson County in Kansas, I heard complaints about the \nrising gas prices and our dependence on foreign oil and the need to \ndevelop our own domestic resources--all those resources. But this vital \ngoal is now extremely difficult on the administration's own policies, \nagain affecting not only energy but agriculture and our financial \ninstitutions and health care. I call them the four horsemen of \nregulatory strangulation. That may be a little harsh, but I don't think \nit is.\n  As I said, last week, I came to the floor and highlighted a multitude \nof new overly burdensome and, in many situations, absurd EPA \nregulations that will have a significant negative effect on the ability \nof our farmers and our ranchers to produce the food and the crops \nnecessary to compete in a global market and to feed a troubled and \nhungry world. Take a look at the coverage in regard to Libya and the \nnews blip we saw on television where somebody was shouting and \nprotesting and one of our newspeople stuck a microphone in front of his \nface and said: Are you trying to promote democracy? He said: No, I just \nwant a loaf of bread. I will say to you that a hungry nation is a \nnation that does not have any possibility of economic opportunity. \nWell, unfortunately, as we all know, the EPA's reach goes well beyond \nthe agricultural industry. Its regulations are moving to make the \nenergy we rely on every day more expensive to produce, and many times \nwithout providing any appreciable benefits to the environment. Nobody \nwants to do anything that would endanger the public health. But I think \nwe can take a good look at some of these regulations in regards to any \nappreciable benefits to the environment and find they are few and far \nbetween.\n\n  Since fiscal year 2010, 10 new regulations promulgated by the EPA \nhave accounted for over $23 billion in new costs to the American \ntaxpayer, costs which are even more painful for Americans as our Nation \ncontinues to struggle with an almost 9-percent unemployment rate. \nUnfortunately, with the number of proposed regulations currently before \nour domestic energy producers, if we do not take action--we meaning the \nCongress--2011 and beyond will be even costlier.\n  For example, EPA has proposed to amend the current national ambient \nquality standards for ozone to a range of 60 to 70 parts per billion. \nThis is a range so stringent that recent analysis estimates hundreds of \nthousands of jobs would be at risk because of the inability of cities \nand counties to meet these attainment levels.\n  The EPA itself has estimated this new regulation would cost between \n$19 billion and $90 billion to fully implement. I am talking about the \n60 to 70 parts per billion standard. It provides no rationale as to \nwhat new scientific data justifies updating a standard set as recently \nas 2008.\n  This proposed regulation is in addition to the recently enacted \ngreenhouse gas regulations requiring application of the best available \ncontrol technology. Who decides that? That is the Kansas Department of \nHealth and Environment with the EPA looking over their shoulder, and it \nis the application of best available control technology for stationary \nsources of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  This regulation currently only affects those stationary sources of \nenergy emitting 75,000 or more tons of carbon per year and which are \nalready subject to the prevention of significant deterioration--they \ncall that PSD--permitting requirements for nongreenhouse gases--or \nGHGS.\n  Future implementation of this rule could negatively impact millions \nof small businesses, farms, hospitals, and community organizations with \ncosts of over $75 billion a year. So we are talking billions and \nbillions and billions in regards to these regulations.\n  According to the Affordable Power Alliance, a civil rights \norganization, by the year 2030, greenhouse gas regulations--trying to \ncontrol them--specifically targeting our domestic energy producers will \nresult in the loss of 2.5 million jobs--2.5 million jobs--and a \nreduction of household income of $1,200 a year.\n  Keep in mind, these are impacts that will have the greatest negative \nimpact on poor households, low-income households, that spend a greater \npercentage of their monthly income on utilities and groceries--\nnecessities made more expensive to produce and purchase with rising \nenergy prices.\n  In the area of energy recycling, EPA officials are preparing to \nrelease a final ruling on regulation of coal combustion byproducts--the \nacronym for which is CCBs--which I hope avoids any classification of \nthis product as a hazardous waste. CCBs are, of course, an unavoidable \nresidual of burning coal to create energy, which I wish to add is the \nmost cost-effective form of energy available still, and is responsible \nfor providing over 70 percent of the energy to my State's taxpayers--70 \npercent. Classification of this byproduct as a hazardous waste will \nrestrict further beneficial use of CCBs in a multitude of industries, \nincluding agriculture, Portland cement, home construction, and without \nproviding definitive benefits to the environment.\n  In my home State of Kansas, representatives speaking on behalf of a \nnumber of Kansas energy producers estimated costs to industry of over \n$300 billion over the next 5 years to comply with a multitude of \nproposed EPA regulations dealing with air, water, and CCB management. \nThree hundred billion dollars. That is unreasonable, and is probably \nthe mildest thing I can say. These are real numbers that will \ndoubtlessly drive up the cost of energy Kansans rely on to heat their \nhomes and drive our Nation's agricultural industry.\n  Unfortunately, the negative impacts resulting from the multitude of \nnew, overly burdensome EPA regulations don't stop with agriculture and \nenergy. Beyond affecting the way people power their homes and \nbusinesses, the administration has even moved to regulate what cars \nAmericans can drive. This was made evident by the EPA and the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration's decision last year to begin \nmandating greater fuel economy and emissions standards for all \npassenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. Recent analysis has estimated \nthis new regulation will cost the already struggling automobile \nindustry upwards of $10.8 billion to comply, and consumers up to about \n$1,000 per vehicle in higher purchasing prices. They just pass the \ncosts on. So if you want to buy a new pickup down the road, it will be \n$1,000 more.\n  While EPA has garnered much of the attention in my State for its \nefforts to make energy more expensive, from a national perspective, the \nDepartment of the Interior shares similar responsibility for pursuing \npolicies that not only make energy more expensive but also make our \ncountry more reliant on foreign, and oftentimes unfriendly, sources of \nenergy. For example, under the current administration, the Department \nof the Interior has canceled 77 oil development leases in Utah that \nwere located within a larger formation covering three States that the \nBureau of Land Management has estimated contains around 800 billion \nbarrels of oil, more than three times the proven reserves in Saudi \nArabia.\n  Why? Why would we revoke these leases? That question has to be asked \nand answered. We are speaking of 800 billion barrels of oil. No, they \ncan't go do that. This, of course, is in addition to the gulf of Mexico \ndeepwater drilling moratorium imposed last summer which has had a \nlasting negative effect on the gulf coast economy.\n  The President said yes, you can go ahead and drill, but the safety \nregulations are such that a lot of companies that were drilling have \nleft or are leaving. However, foreign competition is drilling in the \nsame place. That doesn't make sense.\n  Beyond the regulatory burdens, it is also essential we focus on \nremoving redundant programs within the various Federal agencies. Listen \nup. Every upset taxpayer should know this and, more importantly, demand \naction from this Congress. Last month, the administration's own \nGovernment Accountability Office--the famous or infamous GAO--released \na report highlighting hundreds of duplicative programs currently on the \nbooks that cost American taxpayers billions of dollars every year.\n\n[[Page S1315]]\n\n  You get into double digits when you are counting the number of \nprograms all of us want to depend on and all of us think are important, \nbut they are duplicative. They are doing the same thing. As I say, it \nis costing American taxpayers billions of dollars every year.\n  While separate from regulatory oversight, this study further \namplifies the importance that we take a serious look at our Federal \nagencies and put in place appropriate oversight, review, and revocation \nwhere needed.\n  It is for these reasons that I believe Congress must move forward \nwith solutions that remove overly burdensome regulations and create an \nenvironment that doesn't hinder energy production and use of those \nresources that make the most economic sense while still protecting, \nyes, our clean water, clean air, and do what we can in regards to \nCO2 emissions.\n  Understanding this, last month, I, along with 30 other Senators, \nintroduced the bill I was talking about--the Regulatory Responsibility \nfor our Economy Act. The bill moves to codify and strengthen the \nPresident's January 18 Executive order that directs agencies within the \nadministration to review, modify, streamline, expand or repeal those \nsignificant regulatory actions that are duplicative, unnecessarily \noverly burdensome, or would have significant economic impacts on \nAmericans.\n  Those are the President's words right there. I agree with them. I \napplaud the President for saying that. While I agree in principle with \nPresident Obama that we need to take a serious look at both current and \nproposed Federal regulations, I don't believe his Executive order \nactually does what it purports to do. There are too many loopholes and \nno teeth.\n  Specifically, my bill moves to hold accountable independent agencies \nwhich are exempt under his Executive order, such as the FDIC, the SEC, \nand the EPA that are not covered under President Obama's Executive \norder. The EPA came up and said: We are doing the public good. Then \nthey followed that crazy paragraph I will read in a minute and said: We \nare okay. We are not issuing any regulations that hurt anybody.\n  I just attended the Commodity Classic, made up of all farm \norganizations, all commodity groups out in Great Bend, KS, and the No. \n1 issue: regulations. Why on Earth are you putting out all these \nregulations that are about to put us out of business? You go right down \nthe line and any group, any association, any business all throughout \nAmerica are saying: Pat, what are you doing strangling us with all \nthese regulations? What are you guys doing? My response is: I am not a \n``you guys,'' I am an ``us guy,'' and I am trying to do something about \nit.\n  Specifically, my bill moves to hold accountable these independent \nagencies. It also removes from the Executive order highly subjective \nlanguage that directs each agency to use the best available techniques \nto quantify anticipated present and future benefits and costs as \naccurately as possible, and--here comes the paragraph I defy you, Mr. \nPresident, and I defy any of our highly skilled and educated people on \nthe dais, I defy this nice young lady taking down my words the best she \ncan, or anybody listening to this to understand--each agency may \nconsider and discuss qualitatively--this is the way they look at a \nregulation to determine whether they are going to issue that regulation \nor not--values that are difficult or impossible to quantify, including \nequity, human dignity, fairness, and distributive impacts.\n  That statement is amorphous. It is synonymous with amorphous. I defy \nanybody to try to determine what that means, except what you want it to \nmean. So that statement now wins the gobbledygook award of the month. I \nthink I am going to come down here every month and award a gobbledygook \nstatement in the regulatory field that is about to drown us all as the \ngobbledygook statement of the month--and that sure hits it. It doesn't \ntake a legislative scholar to understand that this language creates a \nloophole large enough to drive a grain truck through and renders the \norder meaningless. That is why passage of my regulation is so \ncritically important.\n  I invite my friends on both sides of the aisle to please sign on as a \ncosponsor of my legislation, realizing the immense opportunities it \ncreates for meaningful review and possible revocation of regulations \ncounter to our Nation's growth, along with the GAO report outlining \nspecific duplication of Federal programs, a report that defies \nPowerPoints or charts--couldn't do it; a maze of too many programs \ntrying to do the same thing. If we don't do this, we are going to cost \nthe business community of America and all Americans billions of dollars \nand get nothing in return in regard to environmental benefits.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1315-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1315-S1316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT SPENDING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we reengage in the ongoing debate \nover government spending this week, it is worth noting that some on the \nother side appear to have already decided to fold up their tents.\n  Last week, Republicans showed we could change the status quo in \nWashington by cutting government spending. It was a small step but a \nstep in the right direction. Some of us were hopeful momentum was \nfinally building for the bipartisan consensus that would enable us to \ncut even more government red ink this week.\n  The assistant majority leader seems to have had enough. Yesterday, he \nsaid cutting $6 billion pushes the limits of what is needed to live \nwithin our means. This is ludicrous, Mr. President. So far this fiscal \nyear Washington has spent nearly $650 billion more than it has taken \nin--this year. That is a little more than $4 billion a day that \nWashington is spending over and above what it has to spend.\n  Senator Durbin thinks Democrats in Congress have pushed the limits of \nresponsibility by agreeing to cut $6 billion more this year. Imagine if \nevery American had the same approach to their credit card bills. \nImagine calling up your credit card company and asking first if you \ncould just freeze your out-of-control spending habits in place. Then \nwhen they say no, imagine telling them you don't want to cut down your \nmonthly spending because you prefer living outside your means.\n  That is the logic of our friends on the other side. Now, according to \nthis logic, they would rather draw a line in the sand than agree to cut \nanother dime in spending at a time when Washington is spending about $4 \nbillion more every single day than it is taking in.\n  Republicans have been hopeful that we could make progress and reach a \nbipartisan solution on this issue. It is my hope that the assistant \nmajority leader was speaking for himself and not for his entire \nconference.\n  This, of course, is the debate that most people in Washington will \ncontinue to be focused on this week, and it is an important debate. But \nfocusing on day-to-day expenses threatens to obscure an even larger \nthreat. Here I am talking about, of course, entitlement programs such \nas Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  Anyone who has looked at these programs closely knows they are \nbecoming unaffordable, that doing nothing risks not only the future of \nthese programs themselves but our Nation's future as well. Anyone who \nlooks at history also knows the best time to address a crisis such as \nthis is a time such as right now, when two parties share power in \nWashington. This is the time.\n  I have made the case for action publicly and in private conversations \nwith the White House. As Republican leader, I put this issue front and \ncenter my first day on the job. Four years ago, I came to the floor and \nsaid the demographic changes taking place in America made it incumbent \nupon us as a body to reform Social Security. Two years later, when the \nAmerican people put a Democrat in the White House, I renewed my call to \naction. I said Republicans stood ready to work with the President on \nentitlement reform. I repeated that call again 4 months ago\n\n[[Page S1316]]\n\nwhen voters decided to put Republicans in charge of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Throughout this time, I have held out hope that our friends on the \nother side would rise to the occasion, if not when Republicans \ncontrolled the White House, at least when they did.\n  I was encouraged further when President Obama said repeatedly in 2009 \nthat his administration would seek to work with us on serious \nentitlement reform that preserves the safety net for our seniors, for \npeople with disabilities, and which also puts it on a firmer, stable \nfooting for generations to come.\n  The President has acknowledged the seriousness of the problem. He has \nnoted himself that costs are escalating, even as the population is \ngetting older, creating a perfect storm for a fiscal crisis that dwarfs \neven today's budget crisis, as urgent as it is.\n  If both parties agree on all this, I thought, then there is no reason \nwe cannot do this for the good of the country. The urgency for action \nhas only intensified in recent months, as we have seen an uproar in a \nnumber of State capitals.\n  Every State is different, but the problems in every one of them can \nbe summed up pretty easily. Lawmakers from New Jersey to California and \njust about everywhere in between made promises they could not keep. But \nthe promises lawmakers in Washington have made put the States to shame. \nIf you add up the unfunded liabilities in all 50 States, you get, by \none estimate, about $3 trillion total. Add up Washington's promises on \nSocial Security and Medicare alone, and it is over $50 trillion--$50 \ntrillion that we promised to the American people that we do not know \nhow we are going to pay for.\n  Something must be done, and now is the time to do it. Republicans are \nready and willing. Where is the President? Suddenly, at the moment when \nwe can actually do something about this, he is silent. As one columnist \nin the Washington Post put it: ``For a man who won office talking about \nchange we can believe in, [the President] can be a strangely passive \npresident.''\n  On the greatest fiscal challenge of the day, he appears, at least so \nfar, to have taken a pass. This is obviously deeply disappointing to me \npersonally, given my repeated raising of this issue. But more \nimportantly, it should be deeply disappointing to every American who \nhad reason to hope we could tackle these issues in a moment of divided \ngovernment. It should be disappointing to all those who believe this \nPresident when he pledged to shake up the status quo in Washington.\n  Past Presidents had the foresight to seize the moment, to reach \nacross party lines, and solve an earlier funding problem with Social \nSecurity, in the case of President Reagan, and welfare reform in the \ncase of President Clinton.\n  It is not a question of whether it is possible but a question of \nwhether the President has the courage to step up to the challenges we \nface. In this case, one cannot help but wonder if the President, who \ncame into office promising change, has been changed by the office \ninstead.\n  I hope I am wrong about all this, but all the signs point toward \ninaction on the part of the White House and, in my view, this would be \na tragic failure of leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1316-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1316-S1318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BUDGET CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there was an interesting letter to the \neditor in the New York Times over the weekend, and it was sent by two \nMinnesota State representatives. I apologize for not having the names \nat my fingertips. Democratic and Republican Minnesota State \nrepresentatives wrote a letter to the editor. It was in response to an \narticle written by David Brooks. Brooks, whom I respect very much, is a \nconservative and a very thoughtful man and I read him with a lot of \ninterest. Brooks had written about what to do with the State and \nFederal challenges when it came to budget deficits.\n  What these two Minnesota State representatives said--a Democrat and a \nRepublican--is, we acknowledge in our State and Nation what we face. We \nface a situation where we have a weak economy, and we face a situation \nwhere the debts that are being incurred by our levels of government are \ngoing up too fast, having acknowledged that we have to find a solution.\n  I am going to probably not say this as accurately, but I thought they \nsaid it so well. They said we have come to the conclusion that we \ncannot just cut our way out of the problem and we cannot tax our way \nout of the problem, we have to think our way out of the problem. We \ncannot lurch from one budget battle to another budget battle without \nlooking at the fact that our challenge is a structural, long-term \nchallenge. It does not relate to the immediate budget but to a lot of \nthings that are happening over a long period of time.\n  I reflected on that for a minute. I thought: There is real wisdom in \nwhat they say because, if we look at what we face at the Federal level, \nthere are reasons why we are running into these budget problems, not \nthe least of which, as Senator McConnell mentioned earlier, is that the \npopulation of America is changing. Baby boomers have reached the point \nwhere they will be drawing on the government benefits they paid for \nover a lifetime. As more and more draw on these benefits, there is an \nobvious question as to whether the reserves will be there to take care \nof them. How do we deal with that?\n  Let me speak to two particular issues Senator McConnell raised. The \nfirst is Social Security. Is there a program that is more important to \nAmerica? I cannot think of one. That was the starting point of the New \nDeal when President Roosevelt said: We have to give seniors in America \nsome peace of mind that when retirement rolls around and their senior \nyears roll around, they will, in fact, have enough money to live on, \nnot in a luxurious way but the basics.\n  There is a time I can remember in my family and many American \nfamilies where grandparents moved back in with the kids because there \nwas no place to go. They could no longer work and they could no longer \nafford their homes and they became part of the larger family. It \nhappened in my family and it happened in others.\n  Then came Social Security, and with a little planning and a little \nsaving and Social Security checks, senior citizens had independence. It \nwas a critically important program. It was an insurance plan--not a \nwelfare plan--an insurance plan that virtually every American paid into \nand from which every American drew.\n\n  Where are we today? I arrived in Congress in 1983 as a brand-new \nMember of the House from Illinois. They said: Welcome to Washington. \nSocial Security is broke.\n  I said: Great. I thought I would get a little breathing space. But, \nin fact, there was not.\n  President Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Tip O'Neill--a political \nodd couple if you have ever seen one--got together and hammered out an \nagreement. The agreement we reached and voted for in 1983 resulted in \nSocial Security remaining solvent from then until 2037. We wanted to \nbuy 75 years of solvency, but we bought over 50.\n  Those who say today that Social Security is in trouble, I remind \nthem, untouched with no action by Congress, Social Security will make \nevery payment it has promised to every Social Security recipient with a \ncost-of-living adjustment every month of every year until 2037. There \nare not many things you can say that about in Washington; that for over \n25 years, this program is financially sound.\n  The bad news is, in 2037, things change dramatically. Untouched at \nthat point, Social Security benefits will go down 22 percent. That is a \nheavy hit on lower and middle-income retirees. We know that looming 25 \nyears over the horizon is a terrific challenge.\n  President Obama created a deficit commission. Senator Harry Reid was \nkind enough--I guess ``kind'' is the word--was nice enough to appoint \nme to this Commission. I spent 10 months listening and then voted for \nthe final Commission product. It went into Social Security, and it \nsuggested some things that are inherently controversial. For example, \nif you are going to give Social Security a longer life, what\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\nis the mix? What will you cut in benefits? How much will you increase \nrevenue? Those are the two things.\n  I said Social Security is basic arithmetic. Medicare is advanced \ncalculus. Social Security is basic arithmetic, although those basic \ndecisions get to the heart when you retire, how much you receive when \nyou retire and how much you receive in your payroll deductions each \nmonth.\n  The Commission reached an agreement. There were parts I did not like, \nbut it did buy 75 years of solvency for Social Security.\n  It is interesting that we brought it up then as part of the deficit \ncommission because literally Social Security does not add to the \ndeficit. Currently, there is a surplus in the Social Security trust \nfund, and that trust fund is being invested in government securities \nand being paid interest, but it does not add to the deficit.\n  Many of my colleagues have argued: Why are we debating Social \nSecurity as part of deficit reduction if it does not have a direct \nconnection? That is a legitimate point. I have raised the same point \nmyself. I think we should look at it. We should do it on a separate and \nparallel track to deficit reduction.\n  I welcome what Senator McConnell said. Let's have that conversation. \nBut I do not think it needs to be the necessary starting point for \ndeficit reduction because there is no connection between the two.\n  Then I heard Senator McConnell say the President has not shown \nleadership on Medicare. I respectfully disagree with Senator McConnell. \nThe whole debate about health care reform was lowering the cost of \nhealth care. You cannot balance the budget of America with 13 million \npeople unemployed without addressing the skyrocketing cost of health \ncare. President Obama worked with Congress--the House and Senate--to \nreduce the growth in the cost of health care.\n  One area was in Medicare. Time and again, the Senator from Kentucky \nand his colleagues came to the floor and gave critical speeches saying: \n``The Obama plan is going to take $500 billion out of Medicare.'' Day \nafter day, ``$500 billion out of Medicare.'' If we are seriously \ntalking about budget deficit reform, if we are talking about Medicare \nreform, we are talking about reducing the anticipated expense of \nMedicare and reducing at least $500 billion in costs.\n  What will that mean to Medicare recipients across America? Does it \nmean less coverage, less care? It does not have to. I always use as an \nillustration, the average cost of a Medicare beneficiary in my hometown \nof Springfield, IL, the average annual cost is $7,000 to $8,000. Go up \nto Chicago, where there are more speciality hospitals and a little \nhigher cost of living and it is not $7,000 to $8,000, it is $8,000 to \n$10,000 a year for the average Medicare beneficiary. Then go down to \nMiami and the number is $14,000 to $15,000 a year.\n  Why the dramatic difference between Chicago and Miami? That is the \nquestion we ought to ask. Is there better care in Florida or more \nexpensive care? Can we bring the cost of that care down and not \ncompromise the quality of the care? These are hard questions but the \nonly questions that count if you want to have reform in Medicare that \ndoes not sacrifice the basic benefits.\n  What I would say to Senator McConnell is this: He quoted me early in \nhis statement, and I was not on the floor. Yesterday, I said I was \nsupporting not the House Republican budget but the budget proposed by \nSenator Inouye. This budget, for the remainder of this year, the next \n6\\1/2\\ months, would cut about $10 billion more. We would cut $51 \nbillion below what President Obama asked for this year. In the Senate, \nwe will have reached $51 billion. In the House, they went $100 billion \nbelow what the President asked.\n  I think there is a qualitative, not just quantitative but \nqualitative, difference in the approach. I think the House Republican \nbudget went too far. I do not believe we need to cut the basics in \neducation for lower income families across America, and that is exactly \nwhat the House Republican budget does.\n  Let me give an illustration. They reduced dramatically the amount of \nmoney going to be spent on Head Start. I do not know how many Members \nhave had a chance to visit Head Start Programs. I did a couple weeks \nago in Chicago. These are kids who are most likely to drop out without \nsome intervention, most likely to struggle in pre-K and kindergarten \nand most likely to have a difficult time learning. So they bring them \ninto Head Start at an early age and they learn. The one I visited in \nChicago is nothing short of amazing. They were teaching these little \nkids--and they were so impressive--Chinese as well as a Nigerian \ndialect, and these kids were chattering away. I thought this \nexperience--being together, learning, singing, being so happy about \nit--cannot help but prepare these kids for a classroom setting where \nthey are going to learn in just a couple years.\n\n  The House Republican budget dramatically cuts the Head Start Program. \nThese kids and the teachers and staff who support them will be gone \nunder their proposal, and what will happen to those kids? I am not \nsure. I don't know if there will be a babysitter down the street or \nwhether someone else will intervene. But it is possible, without early \nintervention and early training and education, these kids will show up \nin a year or two for prekindergarten or kindergarten and not be as far \nalong as they should be. Does that make their chances at success \nbetter? No, of course not. We know that. The studies have shown it.\n  The second area the House Republican budget cuts is the money to \nschool districts in the poorer parts of America. In my home State there \nare plenty of those--my hometown of East St. Louis, IL, for example. To \ncut back on Federal assistance to that poor community at this moment in \ntime would be a mistake. We need to make sure these young people have \ngood teachers and good resources and can learn, even though they live \nin a town that is economically poor. The House Republican budget cuts \nthat money and cuts the teachers for these school districts.\n  Then it cuts the money for Pell grants. Pell grants are the college \naid grants given to students from lower income families. Many of them \ndon't have a chance to go to school unless they get a grant so they can \nproceed with their education. The House Republican budget cuts $850 a \nyear out of the Pell grants for lower income students--students from \nlower income families. That, unfortunately, will mean many of them will \ndrop out.\n  When I went to visit with the president of Augustana College, a \nprivate Lutheran college in the quad cities area, he anticipated they \nwould lose 1 out of every 20 students because of this cut in Pell \ngrants. So if students--when we have high unemployment in a recession--\nare dropping out of college because of House Republican budget cuts, \nthe obvious question is: Does that make America's workforce any better? \nAre we in a better position to compete with China and the other \ncountries of the world or will we sacrifice our advantage because \nstudents have to drop out of school? I think the answer is obvious.\n  That is why the House Republican budget, which some support, goes too \nfar. It cuts too much in education. It would cut dramatically medical \nresearch. What were they thinking in the House of Representatives, that \nwe would cut the National Institutes of Health, medical research in \ncritical areas--Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's disease, diabetes, cancer--at \na time when we know research and innovation are critical for America's \nsuccess. Why would the House Republican budget cut back so dramatically \nin areas we know pay off?\n  I think they made some poor choices, and that is why I support the \nSenate Democratic approach--$10 billion in cuts but preserving in \neducation, worker training, education research, innovation, and \ninfrastructure the investments we need at this moment in our history, \nwith the recession we face and 13 million Americans out of work. That, \nto me, is why the difference is so stark in contrast.\n  Senator McConnell spoke with the President and said he needed to show \nmore leadership. I know where the President is on this. He wants us to \nreach an agreement in terms of the decisions which we need to make to \nmove us toward a balanced budget, but we need to do it in a thoughtful \nway, first, coming out of the recession making America's workforce \nstronger for the future, helping small businesses create\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\njobs, and investing in infrastructure which creates good-paying jobs \nright here in America.\n  Mr. President, I understand we are going to go into executive \nsession, and I am going to pause at this time and ask if the Chair is \nready to report executive session so I can discuss two judicial \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Anthony J. Battaglia, \nof California, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of California, Sue E. Myerscough, of Illinois, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Central District of Illinois, and James \nE. Shadid, of Illinois, to be United States District Judge for the \nCentral District of Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate with respect to these nominations, with the time equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of two of the nominees. \nI will vote for all three, but I rise in support of two of the \nnominees--Sue Myerscough and James Shadid for the Central District of \nIllinois. These are nominees whom I presented to the President and who \npassed through the review not only by the White House but also by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and now come before us today to be \nconsidered by the Senate.\n  This day has come not a moment too soon for the Central District of \nIllinois, which I call home. It is a huge district. It covers 46 \ncounties, includes the State capital, as well as cities such as Peoria, \nUrbana, and Rock Island. Since last August, the Central District of \nIllinois has had only one Federal district court judge out of four. \nThere are supposed to be four and, unfortunately, three seats have been \nvacant. Those three vacancies were all designated as judicial \nemergencies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  The chief judge, and the only active judge not in senior status, of \nthe district--Mike McCuskey, also one of my nominees--has done an \namazing job keeping the judicial system running for the past 7 months. \nMike, in years gone by, had had some health issues. They asked him \nwhether there was anything they could do to relieve the stress he was \nfacing, being the only judge out of four in the district. He said: Only \nthe Senate can relieve this stress. Today, Mike McCuskey, we are going \nto do our best to relieve that stress and send two excellent new \ndistrict court judges.\n  It hasn't been easy. Right now there are no active status judges in \nthe Federal courthouses in Springfield and Peoria. Judge McCuskey, who \nis based in Urbana, has put a lot of miles on his car driving around \nthis large district to keep the dockets moving. I salute him for his \ndedicated service, and I wish to also salute Judges Mike Mihm, Joe \nBilly McDade, Harold Baker, and Richard Mills, who stepped up to help \nout the district, despite some personal family and health challenges. \nThey have stepped up, even though they are in senior status, to try to \nmake sure the district was served.\n\n  I am pleased that help is on the way to the Central District of \nIllinois. I also wish to thank my colleague, Senator Mark Kirk, who has \njoined me in presenting these nominees to the Senate.\n  The first I wish to mention is a friend of mine for many years, Sue \nMyerscough. She has been prominent on the legal landscape of \nSpringfield for many years. She has over 23 years of judicial \nexperience and currently serves as an elected justice on the Illinois \nFourth District Appellate Court.\n  Justice Myerscough has been nominated to fill the Springfield-based \njudgeship that was vacated by the retirement of Judge Jeanne Scott, \nanother one of my appointees who served that district so well.\n  Justice Myerscough is a Springfield native. She earned her bachelor's \ndegree and law degree from Southern Illinois University. She began her \nlegal career as a law clerk for Judge Harold Baker of the same Central \nDistrict. Following her clerkship, she worked for 6 years in private \npractice.\n  Judge Myerscough was appointed as an associate judge of the Illinois \nSeventh Judicial Circuit in Springfield in 1987. In 1990, she was \nelected as a circuit judge for that court. During her 11 years as a \ntrial judge, she presided over thousands of bench and jury trials, \nincluding some of the most complex civil litigation and murder trials. \nIn 1988, Judge Myerscough was elected to her current seat on the \nIllinois appellate court and in 2008 won her retention election.\n  During her years on the appellate court, she has authored over 1,200 \ndecisions on a wide range of issues. Justice Myerscough has worked to \npromote legal education for schoolchildren, and since 2001 she has \nserved on the Board of Visitors for the Southern Illinois University \nLaw School. She is an excellent judge, she is an excellent lawyer, she \nhas a great family, and I am proud the President presented her name and \nthe Senate will have a chance to vote on her today.\n  Jim Shadid is a leading figure in the Peoria legal community. He \ncurrently serves as a judge on the Tenth Judicial Circuit in Peoria \nCounty. He has been nominated to fill the Peoria-based Federal \njudgeship that was vacated when Judge Mihm took senior status.\n  Judge Shadid was born in Peoria and received his undergraduate degree \nfrom Bradley University. He was quite a baseball player for the Bradley \nBraves. He was a two-time team MVP and was inducted into the Bradley \nAthletics Hall of Fame. After graduation, he played a season of minor \nleague baseball before he turned his talents to law and getting his \nJ.D. from the John Marshall Law School in Chicago.\n  He was first appointed as a circuit judge in 2001 and won retention \nelections in 2002 and 2008. He has presided over approximately 300 \ntrials and thousands of additional pleas and sentencings. Prior to his \nservice on the State bench, Judge Shadid worked as an attorney in \nprivate practice, as a part-time Peoria County public defender, as a \npart-time commissioner on the Illinois Court of Claims, and as an \nassistant attorney general in Illinois.\n  In addition to his broad legal experience, Judge Shadid has an \nimpressive record of service to the Peoria community, including tenure \nas president of the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Peoria.\n  Judge Shadid was the first Arab American to serve as a State judge in \nIllinois. Upon his confirmation, he will be the only Arab-American \nFederal judge in the State and one of only a handful nationwide. There \nis a large Arab-American community in Peoria, including my friend, the \nU.S. Transportation Secretary, Ray LaHood. I know this community and \nall of Peoria and Illinois will be so proud of Judge Shadid.\n  Both Justice Myerscough and Judge Shadid were unanimously reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee last month, and in a short time the Senate will \ntake up their nominations. I hope my colleagues will agree that the \npeople of Illinois will be well served with these two fine individuals \non the bench.\n  We will still have one vacancy, when these two are approved. \nFortunately, President Obama has nominated another excellent candidate \nto fill that vacancy. Sara Darrow is a distinguished Federal \nprosecutor, whom I was pleased to recommend to the White House. I look \nforward to working with my colleague, Senator Kirk, to consider her \nnomination in an expedited fashion.\n  Also working with Senator Kirk, we have a bipartisan agreement in \nterms\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\nof filling all vacancies, and Senator Kirk is in the process now of \nchoosing a judge to fill one of the vacancies in the Northern District \nof Illinois.\n  Last year, the Senate confirmed three excellent judges for the \nNorthern District: Judge Gary Feinerman, Judge Sharon Coleman, and \nJudge Ed Chang. I might mention that Judge Chang had been recommended \nby the Republican Selection Committee the year before, and I found him \nto be an excellent candidate. Party aside, he is going to serve very \nwell and is now serving on the Northern District. Senator Kirk and I \nwill continue to work together to find excellent judges for that \nNorthern District.\n  In conclusion, as we proceed toward this evening's votes, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the nominations of Sue Myerscough \nand Jim Shadid. They will make superb Federal judges in a district that \ndesperately needs their service on the bench.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with judicial vacancies still at \n100, nearly half of them judicial emergencies, the Senate's action \ntoday on 2 nominees to fill longstanding judicial emergency vacancies \nin Illinois and 1 of the many vacancies in California is much needed. I \nthank the Senate majority leader for scheduling action on these \nimportant nominations and the Republican leader for his cooperation. I \ncommend Senator Durbin for his efforts to fill longstanding vacancies \nthat have plagued the Central District of Illinois.\n  These nominees are 3 of the 13 judicial nominations that were \nunanimously reported last year and have now been unanimously reported, \nagain, this year by the Judiciary Committee. They could--and, in my \nview, should--have been considered and confirmed last year. Instead, \nthey were returned to the President without final Senate action despite \ntheir outstanding qualifications, and despite the needs of the American \npeople to have judges available to hear cases in these Federal courts. \nThe President has had to renominate them, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has had to reconsider them and now, finally, the Senate is \nbeing allowed to consider these sorely needed judges for Illinois and \nCalifornia.\n  Justice Sue Myerscough and Judge James Shadid were each nominated to \nfill emergency vacancies in the Central District of Illinois. I have \nspoken on numerous occasions over the last 2 years about the need for \nthe Senate to confirm them. I urged their consideration in my statement \nlast Monday and am thankful that they are being considered tonight.\n  Their confirmations will help relieve the chief judge of that \ndistrict, who is the only active judge for the entire district. I have \npreviously recounted how Chief Judge McCuskey wrote to Senator Durbin \nlast November urging the Senate to take action to fill these vacancies. \nChief Judge McCuskey has been commuting 90 miles between Urbana and \nSpringfield and relying on senior judges to administer justice in the \ndistrict. Judge McCuskey had a heart attack a few years ago. \nReportedly, when his cardiologist told him that he needed to reduce his \nstress level, the chief judge replied that ``only the U.S. Senate can \nreduce my stress.'' Well, Chief Judge McCuskey, it has taken too long \nbut we hope finally to provide you some relief. To the people of the \nCentral District of Illinois I say, help is finally on the way.\n  Judge Battaglia of California will fill a vacancy in the Southern \nDistrict of California where he has served as a U.S. magistrate judge \nsince 1993. Last November we heard from the Judicial Council of the \nNinth Circuit, which encompasses California. They wrote to us last \nyear, noting: ``In order to do our work, and serve the public as \nCongress expects us to serve it, we need the resources to carry out our \nmission. While there are many areas of serious need, we write . . . to \nemphasize our desperate need for judges. Courts cannot do their work if \nauthorized judicial positions remain vacant. . . . We respectfully \nrequest that the Senate act on judicial nominees without delay.'' I \nagree. I am glad to see the Senate finally consider and confirm Judge \nBattaglia.\n  On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee will consider the nomination of \nanother California judicial nominee, John Kronstadt, who is nominated \nto fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Central District of \nCalifornia. In the next couple weeks we should reconsider and report \nagain the nomination of Edward Chen to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy in the Northern District of California.\n  Recently Seth Stern reported in Congressional Quarterly criticism \nfrom Chief Judge Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia, who warned that the breakdown in the judicial confirmation \nprocess is ``injuring the country.'' There are two judicial nominees to \nfill longstanding vacancies for his court still waiting for final \nconsideration by the Senate. The Senate should consider and confirm \nthem without further delay. I will ask that a copy of the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Besides the nominees to fill vacancies in the District of Columbia, \nalso reported from the Judiciary Committee and before the Senate are \nnominees to fill judicial vacancies in North Carolina, and a judicial \nemergency vacancy in New York. The Judiciary Committee has also now \nconsidered the renomination of Susan Carney of Connecticut to the \nSecond Circuit and Michael Simon to be a district court judge in \nOregon. More than half of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee \nvoted in favor of those nominations. They should be debated and \nconfirmed without delay, as well.\n  I expect to be able to move forward with reporting two additional \nFederal circuit nominees and four additional district court nominees \nthis week. We are holding hearings every 2 weeks and hope finally to \nbegin to bend the curve and start to lower judicial vacancies across \nthe country.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country number too many and \nthey have persisted for too long. That is why Chief Justice Roberts, \nAttorney General Holder, White House Counsel Bob Bauer and many \nothers--including the President of the United States--have spoken out \nand urged the Senate to act.\n  Nearly one out of every eight Federal judgeships is vacant. This puts \nat serious risk the ability of all Americans to have a fair hearing in \ncourt. The real price being paid for these unnecessary delays is that \nthe judges that remain are overburdened and the American people who \ndepend on them are being denied hearings and justice in a timely \nfashion.\n  Regrettably, the progress we made during the first 2 years of the \nBush administration has not been duplicated, and the progress we made \nover the 8 years from 2001 to 2009 to reduce judicial vacancies from \n110 to a low of 34 was reversed. The vacancy rate we reduced from 10 \npercent at the end of President Clinton's term to less than 4 percent \nin 2008 has now risen back to over 10 percent. In contrast to the sharp \nreduction in vacancies we made during President Bush's first 2 years \nwhen the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 100 of his judicial \nnominations, only 60 of President Obama's judicial nominations were \nallowed to be considered and confirmed during his first 2 years. We \nhave not kept up with the rate of attrition, let alone brought the \nvacancies down. By now they should have been cut in half. Instead, they \ncontinue to hover around 100.\n  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by \nthe Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. \nJudicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal \njudiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a \nbacklog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the \nFederal bench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with \nDemocratic and Republican home State Senators to identify superbly \nqualified, consensus nominations. None of the nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar are controversial. They all have the support of \ntheir home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats. All have a strong \ncommitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the \nConstitution.\n  During President Bush's first term, his first 4 tumultuous years in \noffice, we proceeded to confirm 205 of his judicial nominations. We \nconfirmed 100 of\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\nthose during the 17 months I was Chairman during President Bush's first \n2 years in office. So far in President Obama's third year in office, \nthe Senate has only been allowed to consider 70 of his Federal circuit \nand district court nominees. We remain well short of the benchmark we \nset during the Bush administration. When we approach it we can reduce \nvacancies from the historically high levels at which they have remained \nthroughout these first three years of the Obama administration to the \nhistorically low level we reached toward the end of the Bush \nadministration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the CQ article to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From CQ Today Online News, Feb. 28, 2011]\n\n Judges: ``Totally Broken'' Confirmation Process Causing ``Dire'' Case \n                                Backlogs\n\n                            (By Seth Stern)\n\n       Two federal judges criticized the slow pace of judicial \n     confirmations Monday, saying cases are backlogged and judges \n     overwhelmed at the trial court level.\n       Speaking at a Brookings Institution event on judicial \n     nominations, Royce Lamberth, the chief judge of the U.S. \n     District Court for the District of Columbia, said the \n     confirmation process is ``totally broken'' and that the \n     pattern of ``paybacks and the bickering have been thoroughly \n     bipartisan.''\n       Lamberth, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in \n     1987, raised similar concerns in a speech in March 2009, just \n     after the start of the Obama administration. But he said he \n     was increasingly concerned by the delays in the confirmation \n     of federal trial judges, which has only worsened in the two \n     years since.\n       ``I say to both Democrats and Republicans, you are injuring \n     the country,'' Lamberth said.\n       Lamberth was joined on the panel by William Furgeson Jr., a \n     Texas district court judge who said judges' growing caseloads \n     resulting from the vacancies in his district in western Texas \n     are a ``desperate problem'' that results in ``assembly-line \n     justice.''\n       Furgeson called the situation on the border ``dire,'' \n     adding it was a ``giant mystery'' why senators now fight over \n     trial court judges.\n       Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had also emphasized the \n     ``persistent problem'' of vacancies on the federal bench in \n     his annual report on the state of the judiciary released in \n     December.\n       ``Each political party has found it easy to turn on a dime \n     from decrying to defending the blocking of judicial \n     nominations, depending on their changing political \n     fortunes,'' Roberts wrote in the report.\n       Only 67 percent of Obama's district court nominees were \n     confirmed during his first two years in office, compared to \n     92 percent for George W. Bush and 87 percent for Bill \n     Clinton, according to statistics compiled by Russell Wheeler, \n     a visiting fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings \n     Institution, and 83 of 677 district court seats were vacant \n     as of Feb. 25.\n       The Senate has confirmed six district court judges so far \n     this year, including two more Monday: Amy Totenberg and Steve \n     C. Jones to the Northern District of Georgia.\n       On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a \n     second confirmation hearing for President Obama's most \n     controversial judicial nominee: Goodwin Liu, who was first \n     nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th \n     Circuit in 2009.\n       The University of California law professor has faced \n     intense criticism from Republicans for his liberal views and \n     for repeatedly amending the materials he has provided to the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time \nduring the quorum be equally divided between both the Republican and \nDemocratic sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored today to support the \nnomination of Judge Anthony Battaglia to the Southern District of \nCalifornia. I had the great privilege of recommending Judge Battaglia \nto President Obama to serve on the Southern District Court. He is \nwidely respected in the San Diego legal community. He will make an \nexcellent addition to the bench. I have a committee that is set up in \nall the various areas over California, and they recommended him to me, \nand I was proud to recommend him to the President. I congratulate him \nand his family on this important day.\n  Judge Battaglia was born and raised in San Diego. He is a graduate of \nthe U.S. International University, now Alliant International \nUniversity, and California Western School of Law in San Diego. He has \npracticed law for 35 years in San Diego, and for 19 years he was a \nprivate practitioner with a very strong record as a litigator.\n  For the past 16 years, Judge Battaglia has served with distinction as \na magistrate judge for the Southern District. He has a reputation as a \njudge's judge, which means the judges believe he is very hard-working, \nthoughtful, and fair. Local lawyers praise him for being well prepared \nfor hearings and for trials, and he is very diligent in moving cases \nforward. He has presided over 22 trials that have gone to verdict \nduring his tenure on the bench.\n  Equally important is Judge Battaglia's dedication to service outside \nthe courtroom. He is a past president of the national Federal \nMagistrate Judges Association and has twice been selected by Chief \nJustices of the Supreme Court to serve on a national advisory committee \nthat reviews criminal court rules.\n  In short, Judge Battaglia's career stands out as a testament to his \ndedication and devotion to the law and legal community of San Diego, \nboth inside and outside the courtroom.\n  I close my comments here by congratulating the judge and his family \non this momentous day, and I urge my colleagues to confirm this highly \nqualified nominee to the Federal bench.\n  I am very grateful to the Judiciary Committee, which twice voted him \nout of the committee. We are grateful for that.\n\n\n                        Government Shutdown Pay\n\n  I would like to add a comment on another matter--the Boxer-Casey bill \nthat was passed here and sent over to the House. The bill says that if \nthere were to be a shutdown of government, which I know nobody wants, \nbut if there were to be one, Members of Congress should not get their \npay. They should not get their pay and they should not get retroactive \npay because this is a very basic responsibility we have--to keep the \ngovernment running, to make sure Social Security recipients receive \nchecks on time, and disabled veterans, too, and make sure Superfund \nsites are cleaned up and the NIH continues functioning so they can find \ncures for the diseases that plague our families.\n  It is fair to say the two parties have different views on how to \napproach the deficit. The party I am proud to belong to believes--and \nwe showed it under the leadership of Bill Clinton--we can balance the \nbudget but not threaten job creation. We did it under Bill Clinton, but \nwe did it smartly, we did it wisely, and the millionaires did pay their \nfair share, as opposed to some of the proposals in H.R. 1 that came out \nof the House that at the minimum would cost, according to the \neconomists, 200,000 jobs. We have heard estimates of 800,000 jobs. We \ncannot afford to lose that many jobs just as this economy is getting to \nthe point where jobs are being created in decent numbers.\n  Yes, we need to trim the deficit, and yes, we have to make sure we do \nnot knock this economic recovery off track. Therefore, it is essential \nthat the parties work together because if we each just stay in our \ncamps, we are never going to get anything done.\n  Let's do this in a wise way. It is true that we had an election and \nthe House changed hands. Guess what. The Senate didn't, and the White \nHouse is not up for election for 2 more years, so you cannot go around \nsaying there was an election and the election said that the Republicans \nget everything they want. That just does not make any sense.\n  Having come back from that election, I want to say it was about \njobs--jobs, jobs, jobs. My opponent essentially asked every morning, \nevery noon, and every night: Where are the\n\n[[Page S1321]]\n\njobs? And that was a fair question. I said to her and I said to my \npeople in California: We are not creating jobs at a fast enough pace; \nwe have to do better. As I stand here, how could I ever betray what I \nsaid in the campaign and vote for a plan that would cut between 200,000 \nand 800,000 jobs, the Republican plan from the House?\n  We have to get our act together here and meet somewhere in the \nmiddle. If you look at the Republican plan, I think it was $100 billion \noff the President's budget. Our plan is about, now, $50 billion off of \nthe President's budget. We have met them more than halfway. Let's get \nthis thing done. If we get this done and do it in responsible way, yes, \nwe will get this deficit on the right path. But to hold out this idea \nthat we are going to go after just 12 percent of the budget and the \nthings the people really rely on, the roads and the bridges and the \nhighways and education and cleaning up Superfund sites and the FBI and \nall the things we rely on--to go after that one small part of the \nbudget and decimate it the way H.R. 1 would do would be \ncounterproductive.\n  It is a job killer that hurts the middle class, and we cannot go that \nway. Having said all of this, I am sure we are going to see a vote on \nH.R. 1. I am pretty sure we are going to see a vote on H.R. 1, and I do \nnot think it is going to get enough votes to pass. Then we will take \nthe proposal of the Democrats that Vice President Biden has put forward \nand see what that does. If neither gets the requisite number of votes, \nwe are going to have to keep talking. But we cannot continue with these \n2-week extensions. It is absolutely irresponsible. Imagine taking \nbillions of dollars out of the Federal budget every 2 weeks. It is \ngoing to be tens of thousands of jobs in every one of our States that \nare lost.\n  In summing up, I hope the Speaker of the House over there will take \nup our bill quickly, make sure that Members of Congress are not treated \nany better than anybody else. And we will hopefully avert a shutdown. \nBut if there is one, we are treated like every other Federal employee, \nno budget, no pay.\n  I am very grateful to the Judiciary Committee for giving us the \nopportunity to vote for Anthony Battaglia who is going to make a great \njudge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nthe nomination of Magistrate Judge Tony Battaglia to be a Federal \ndistrict judge in the Southern District of California.\n  Judge Battaglia is a highly regarded jurist in the San Diego area. \nFor more than 17 years, he has served as a magistrate judge. He has \nseen more than 20 cases to verdict or judgment, has managed both \nindividual and large class action suits, and has presided over matters \nranging from environmental claims to commercial contract disputes to \ncriminal and civil rights cases.\n  Outside of the courtroom, Judge Battaglia has generously given his \ntime to train and educate other lawyers and judges by, for example, \nwriting extensively in local bar journals and leading instructional \nworkshops and seminars across the country.\n  He has been appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to represent \nmagistrate judges across the country on the Judicial Conference. He has \nserved as president of the Federal Magistrate Judges Association. And \nhe has been president of the San Diego County Judges Association.\n  Prior to his appointment to the bench, Battaglia was an equally well \nregarded litigator--first with the law offices of John Marin, then as a \nsole practitioner, and finally as a partner in the firm of Battaglia, \nFitzpatrick, & Battaglia.\n  During almost two decades in private practice, he tried 23 cases to \nverdict and handled more than 125 arbitrations.\n  His accolades as an attorney included serving as president of the San \nDiego Bar Association and president of the San Diego Trial Lawyers \nAssociation, as well as being named Outstanding Trial Lawyer by the San \nDiego Trial Lawyers Association.\n  Judge Battaglia will bring to the district court a wealth of \nexperience as an attorney, as well as a top-notch record as a judge.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for recommending him for this position, and I \nam very pleased to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we continue in our efforts to \nlessen the burden our overworked courts currently face. We are about to \nconfirm three more judicial nominees. Two of the three nominees we will \nvote on tonight are for seats designated as judicial emergencies. With \nour action today, in only 22 days the Senate has been in session, the \nSenate has confirmed 10 nominees.\n  With these votes tonight, we will have confirmed 19 percent of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees submitted in this Congress. This \npace far exceeds the progress made at this point in the 108th Congress, \nwhich was the beginning of the third year of President Bush's \nPresidency. At this point, the 108th Congress had confirmed only 4 of \nthe 48 nominations sent to the Senate, about an 8 percent confirmation \nrate.\n  Our fast pace on the floor is matched by our rapid pace in committee. \nWe held our third nominations hearing this past Wednesday. We have now \nheard from 13 judicial nominees and have reported 16 favorably. Our \nwork in committee and on the floor indicates a cooperative effort \nbetween me, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and our leadership. \nIt is an indication of the progress that can be made when the President \nnominates consensus nominees.\n  We will continue in our efforts, but again, I would remind everyone \nthat while we in the Senate are doing our part, the administration must \nalso be engaged in this process. I would note that 24 of the 41 vacant \nseats deemed to be judicial emergencies have no nominee. Of the \nadditional 54 vacancies, 28 have no nominee.\n  I am perplexed as to why the President would ignore these pending \nvacancies and instead spend time and resources to send up a nomination \nfor a seat that will not be vacant for some time. I refer to the \nPresident's nomination, on February 16, 2011, of Scott Skavdahl, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Wyoming. This seat \nwill not be vacant until July 24, 2011, when the current judge will \nretire. I do not understand the administration's priorities when it \ncomes to judicial nominations. Instead of focusing on nominations for \nfuture vacancies, I would hope the administration would use some common \nsense and direct its efforts towards nominating individuals for seats \nwhich are at least currently vacant.\n  With regard to the nominees on whom we will vote this evening, let me \nsay a few words about each.\n  Judge Joseph Battaglia is nominated to be a U.S. district judge for \nthe Southern District of California. He presently serves in that \ndistrict as a U.S. magistrate judge. He was first appointed to that \nposition in 1993. In addition to serving as a magistrate judge, Judge \nBattaglia has served on the Judicial Conference of the United States \nAdvisory Committee on Rules of Criminal Procedure, on the Ninth Circuit \nExecutive Board of Magistrate Judges, and as a Magistrate Judge \nObserver on the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit. In 2009, Judge \nBattaglia was appointed by Chief Justice Roberts as Magistrate Judge \nObserver to the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  Judge Battaglia received his B.A. from the U.S. International \nUniversity and his J.D. from California Western School of Law. He spent \nalmost two decades working in private practice, and also acted as an \narbitrator for the San Diego Superior Court, serving on many panels. \nThe American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated him ``Well-Qualified.''\n  This evening, we will also vote on two nominees to the Central \nDistrict of Illinois. Both of these vacancies are considered to be \njudicial emergencies.\n  Judge James E. Shadid received his B.S. from Bradley University and \nhis J.D. from the John Marshall Law School. Upon admission to the \nIllinois bar, Judge Shadid opened his own law practice. He maintained \nhis law practice until 2001, when he was appointed by the Illinois \nSupreme Court to fill a vacancy on the Tenth Judicial Circuit. He was \nelected to a full term in 2002 and re-elected in 2008.\n  While in private practice, he served as a part-time public defender \nat the\n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\nPeoria County Public Defender's Office. He also served an assistant \nattorney general for the State of Illinois. He was appointed by \nGovernor Jim Edgar to serve as a commissioner of the Court of Claims in \nIllinois. The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary rated Judge Shadid as ``Qualified'' by a substantial \nmajority, while a minority rated him ``Well Qualified.''\n  Also nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy for the Central \nDistrict of Illinois is Judge Sue E. Myerscough. Judge Myerscough \nreceived her B.A. with honors, from Southern Illinois University, and \nher J.D. from Southern Illinois School of Law. Upon graduation from law \nschool, she served as a law clerk to the Honorable Harold A. Baker of \nthe U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois.\n  Judge Myerscough was in private practice for approximately 6 years \nbefore being elected as an associate circuit court judge for the \nSeventh Judicial Circuit of Illinois. Judge Myerscough later became a \ncircuit judge for the Seventh Circuit. In 1998 she was elected as an \nappellate court justice of the Illinois Appellate Court, Fourth \nDistrict. The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Myerscough as ``Qualified.''\n  I congratulate these three nominees and wish them well in their \npublic service as a U.S. district judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I first wanted to alert Senators that \nwe will most likely be voting somewhere around 5:30. We are still \nworking on an agreement about yielding back time, but I thought people \nwould like to know that.\n  The other thing I wish to note is to first urge my colleagues to \nconfirm the judges before us tonight, and then I wish also to briefly \nsay a few words about the third vote we are going to be taking in this \nsequence.\n\n\n                          America Invents Act\n\n  In a few moments the Senate will take another important step toward \npassing the America Invents Act. This bipartisan bill will go a long \nway in ensuring our country remains the world leader in \nentrepreneurship, research, and development and, of course, innovation.\n  Over the course of last week, every Senator had an opportunity to \ncome to the floor and weigh in on this bill with amendments. We made a \nlot of progress, and as a result I am pleased to say we have a bill \nthat is even better than the one we started with, a truly bipartisan \nproduct which will bring our patent system into the 21st century. If \npassed, this legislation will make the first comprehensive set of \nreforms to our Nation's patent process in almost 60 years. Sixty years.\n  A lot has changed since then. The America Invents Act will create a \nlegal framework that reflects current technology and a climate in which \ninnovation can flourish. In doing so, it will unleash the power of our \nNation's single most precious resource, the ingenuity of our people. I \npoint out that it will do it without adding a penny to our deficit.\n  An improved patent process will spark the kind of job creation and \nbusiness growth our economy needs right now. I know you know that in \nDelaware--and we certainly know it in Minnesota. Those are not \nDemocratic priorities--the priorities of competitiveness and \ninnovation--and they are not Republican priorities, they are American \npriorities.\n  I urge all Senators to support the motion so we can move forward with \nthis important legislation. I thank Senator Grassley for all his work \non this bill and Senator Leahy as well, and all the rest of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I yield the floor, and we will soon have an update on whether we can \nyield back the time to start the votes at 5:30.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are prepared to yield back the \nbalance of time on this side.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that all remaining time on \nboth sides be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Sue E. Myerscough\n\n  Under the previous order, the nomination of Sue E. Myerscough, of \nIllinois, to be United States District Judge for the Central District \nof Illinois is confirmed.\n\n\n                 Vote on Nomination of James E. Shadid\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of James E. Shadid, of Illinois, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Central District of Illinois?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Durbin.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will take another \nstep toward completing action on the America Invents Act. This is \ncommonsense legislation that will make the first comprehensive reforms \nto our Nation's patent system in nearly 60 years. The debate on this \nbill since its introduction 6 years ago has been long, and the \ncompromises have been many. I am confident that the bill before us \ntoday makes the needed changes to bring the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice into the 21st century.\n  The America Invents Act is bipartisan legislation that has resulted \nfrom deliberation in both the Senate and House. It has been the topic \nof more than a dozen hearings and committee meetings in the Senate, and \ncountless hours of meetings and negotiations. I had hoped to complete \naction on this legislation last week. The additional time has allowed \nevery Senator the opportunity to come to the floor and speak about the \nimportant matters encompassed by this bill. We have debated and adopted \nrelevant amendments and debated and rejected other amendments, \nincluding some that were not even relevant to this legislation. This is \na bill that does not spend a dollar of taxpayer money and does not add \nto the deficit. It will directly result in millions of dollars being \nsaved, and indirectly in helping unleash American innovation to create \njobs and help bolster our economy.\n  Now is the time to act. Now is the time to vote. Now is the time to \nmove forward with this job-creating bill that will help boost our \neconomy and restore America's competitive edge in the global \nmarketplace.\n  Modernizing our patent system through the America Invents Act will \nmake America more competitive. It protects innovators and inventors \nlarge and small, from the small independent inventor in Middlesex, VT, \nto cutting-edge manufacturers and innovators in Ohio and California. It \nwill give the Patent and Trademark Office the tools it needs to process \nand award the patent for what may be the next life-saving device or \nlife-changing invention. And the America Invents Act will do all of \nthis without spending a dollar of taxpayer money. This is a jobs bill \nthat doesn't add a cent to the deficit. Supporters of this legislation \ncome from both sides of the aisle, from every corner of the country, \nand from every component of the patent community.\n  This country's first patent was issued to a Vermonter. Thomas \nJefferson, the Secretary of State, examined the application, and \nPresident George Washington signed it. A lot has changed in the more \nthan 220 years since that first patent was issued. We cannot remain \ncomplacent and expect to remain at the forefront of innovation. \nEnacting the America Invents Act is one way in which we can come \ntogether and show the American people that we in Washington are working \ntogether with the future of our country in mind.\n  I commend Austan Goolsbee, the chair of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers, for his white board presentation today on the \nimportance of patent reform to help America win the global competition \nand create jobs. The creation of more than 220,000 jobs in the private \nsector last month, the creation of 1.5 million jobs over the last 12 \nmonths, and the unemployment rate finally being reduced to 8.9 percent \nare all signs that the efforts we have made over the last 2 years to \nstave off the worst recession since the Great Depression are paying off \nand the economic recovery is taking hold. The almost full percent point \ndrop in the unemployment rate over the last three months is the largest \ndecline in unemployment since 1983. Despite interruptions of economic \nactivity in many parts of the country caused by winter weather over the \nlast months and days, despite the extraordinary rise in oil prices, the \nDow Jones industrial average has climbed back to over 12,000 from a low \npoint of 6,500. Passage of the America Invents Act should help bolster \nour economic recovery and keep us on the right path toward business \ndevelopment and job creation.\n  I urge all Senators to support the cloture motion on the America \nInvents Act. The Nation's economy, American inventors and innovators, \nour competitive edge in the global marketplace all will be helped when \nwe pass this important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. 23, \nthe Patent Reform Act of 2011, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I now call up a second-degree amendment, \nwhich is No. 152.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 152 to amendment No. 143.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: To provide an effective date)\n\n       On page 2 of the amendment, after line 11, add the \n     following:\n       ``(e) Effective Date.--Subsection (d) shall take effect 1 \n     year and 1 day after the date of enactment of the Patent \n     Reform Act of 2011.''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, so everyone knows what this amendment does, \nwe looked at the National Science Foundation regarding a program called \nEPSCoR. A number of sparsely populated States are disadvantaged with \nthis program. However, in talking with a number of Senators, this \namendment we are going to seek modification of at a later time would \nhave no, zero, effect on scoring. There is no score to it whatsoever. \nBut we are going to try--not trying to, we are going to include every \nState because it costs nothing.\n  Even though a lot of States are not funded adequately with this \nEPSCoR money, there is no reason every State that has a State \nuniversity and does something inventive should have to pay exorbitant \npatent fees.\n  It does not cost any money. It is the right thing to do. We will \ndiscuss it at a further time. If someone has some problem with it, we \nwill have to make a determination. At this stage, I think it would be \nthe right thing for the country.\n\n\n                           Satellite Offices\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Leahy for working to pass \nan amendment I introduced last week with Senator Udall to authorize the \nDirector of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, to establish \nthree or more satellite offices. This amendment will go a long way \ntoward improving the efficiency and quality at the USPTO.\n  I really appreciate the chairman and ranking member for working with \nus to modify the amendment's language in order to address colleagues' \nconcerns on both sides of the aisle. We struck a good balance to not \ntie the hands of the USPTO, allow the Office to take advantage of the \nwork it has done on the satellite office concept, and ensure\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\nthat PTO can have an open, competitive process in making determinations \nfor future regional satellite offices. At this moment, I would like to \ninvite the senior Senator from Colorado, Mark Udall, to enter into a \ncolloquy to discuss this amendment.\n  The establishment of regional satellite offices will help the USPTO \nrecruit and retain workers from across the country. Regional offices \nwill draw local scientists, engineers and patent attorneys into the \nUSPTO, which add real world expertise to the patent review process. \nThey will also increase outreach activities and connection to patent \nfilers; enhance the ability of the USPTO to recruit and retain patent \nexaminers; and improve the quality and pendency for patent \napplications.\n  In short, USPTO Director Kappos has already taken steps toward \nestablishing regional satellite offices. Our amendment is intended to \nbuild on this prior work, which I believe provides a good foundation \nfor the USPTO improving its footprint in innovation centers across the \ncountry. I know Senator Udall and I will be advocating for a regional \nsatellite office in Denver, and of course we expect other advocates to \npoint out the merits of their potential sites as well.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I would also like to thank the chairman for \nhelping us pass this important amendment. Right now, the European Union \nuses four geographically diverse patent offices. By only having one \npatent office, we are at a competitive disadvantage. We need to have \nthese regional offices in order to connect innovators and businesses \nacross the country.\n  The current lack of regional satellite offices is even more of a \nproblem when you consider all of the recruitment and retention issues \nthe USPTO is having with its patent examiner workforce. USPTO is unable \nto hire and retain over 6,000 examiners at its single location in \nAlexandria, VA. This has resulted in one-third of patent examiners \nhaving been with the USPTO for less than 3 years. USPTO should be \nrecruiting examiners from across the country. Establishing satellite \noffices will help the USPTO develop expertise from all regions of the \ncountry--and I know that a satellite office in Denver, CO, would \nattract highly qualified examiners.\n  Mr. BENNET. I agree with the Senator. We need to be maximizing our \nhuman capital. I have heard from a number of more senior patent \nattorneys and engineers in Denver that would love to work for the USPTO \nbut cannot uproot their families across the country. Having a satellite \noffice in places like Denver will make sure we are taking advantage of \nthese high-skilled workers.\n  While our amendment provides for an open process and does not \nconstrain the USPTO in making determinations for future offices, we do \nhope that the Office can build on its decision making process in 2010. \nThis process ultimately led to the selection of Detroit as an initial \nregional satellite. While Senator Udall and I were disappointed that \nColorado wasn't selected, we respect the thoroughness of the USPTO's \nreview and do not want all of its hard work in reviewing locations \nacross the country to go to waste.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. There really are a number of objective reasons \nfor choosing Denver. First, opening an office in Colorado will permit \nUSPTO to recruit and hire from a pool of the best candidates the U.S. \nhas to offer. Colorado is home to a great number of technology workers \nwho would be excellent long-term patent examiners for an office located \nin Colorado. The technology workforce in Colorado is consistently \nranked in the top-10 in the U.S. in many important categories. \nAccording to a report by Pew Research, Colorado is ranked: third for \npercent of workers with a bachelor's degree or more; fifth for number \nof workers with science and engineering degrees per capita; fifth for \nnumber of scientists and engineers as a percent of the labor force; and \nsecond for number of patents per 1,000 workers. Additionally, other \nFederal agencies have found Colorado to be a great place to locate an \noffice. Outside of the Washington metro area, Denver has the highest \nnumber of Federal employees per capita.\n  Because Colorado is a very desirable place to live, locating a \nsatellite office in Colorado would allow the USPTO to dramatically \nimprove its ability to recruit and retain its most valuable employees. \nAccording to the report by Pew Research, Colorado is ranked first for \npercent of U.S. workers who say they want to live there; and sixth for \nthe percentage of sunny days. Colorado is also well known for its \nreasonable cost of living, especially in comparison to cities located \non the east and west coasts, and Chicago.\n  Colorado is also centrally located in the U.S. and easily accessible \nto the entire country. Our location in the middle of the country \nprovides convenient access for the technology centers of the West, \nMidwest, and Rocky Mountain regions.\n  Mr. BENNET. I fully agree with Senator Udall. There are a number of \nclear, objective reasons why Colorado should be a regional satellite \nlocation for the USPTO. My understanding is that in 2010 the USPTO \napplied a number of criteria to review numerous site possibilities. \nThis criteria included patents granted, per capita; scientists and \nengineers in the State, per capita; proximity to law schools and major \nresearch institutions; number of patent attorneys and agents; number of \nteleworking PTO patent examiners; and presence of Federal employees, \noffice space. This approach makes sense. By all accounts--and I admit I \nam biased here--Denver is at the top. It is my strong view that when \nyou factor in our central location and accessibility to the rest of the \ncountry, it makes sense for an office to be located in Denver.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I look forward to working closely with the \nSenator to advocate for an office in Denver. I think a Western office \nwill go a long way toward ensuring the success of our patent system.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. \n23, which largely reflects the agreement on patent-reform legislation \nthat Senator Leahy and I announced last year.\n  The Judiciary Committee has been working hard on landmark patent \nreform legislation for the past 7 years, and has finally reached a \nbroad, bipartisan agreement. This bill includes important reforms that \nwill improve the functioning of the Patent and Trademark Office and \nwill allow the office to reduce its backlog of pending applications. \nThe bill also makes the long-overdue transition to a first-to-file \nsystem, a change that will help ensure U.S. inventors receive patents \nthat will also be entitled to priority in foreign countries.\n  This bill has the support of a broad range of industries and trade \nassociations, across the economic spectrum, as well as the support of \nuniversities, patent professional organizations, independent \nentrepreneurs and labor unions. The PTO and the Commerce Department \nalso strongly support this legislation. While not all interests are \nsatisfied, I think it is fair to say that the present agreement has \nproduced a near consensus on this issue, and has resulted in the \nbroadest possible support for this reform.\n  The most important change made by this bill is its adoption of a \nfirst-to-file patent system. Under current U.S. law, when two different \npeople come up with the same invention, priority is given to the person \nwho can prove that he first conceived of the invention and was able to \nmake it work. Under the first-to-file system, by contrast, priority is \ngiven to the first person who not only conceived of the invention and \nwas able to make it work, but who also filed a disclosure with the PTO \nexplaining the invention and how to make it work.\n  The first-to-file system has several important advantages over the \ncurrent system. First, it is easy to verify when an inventor filed a \ndisclosure statement with the PTO. By contrast, under the current \nsystem, invention priority dates are determined by examining the \ninventor's notebooks and other records, all of which must have been \ncontemporaneously validated by a third party. The first-to-file system \nnot only dispenses with expensive discovery into ``what did the \ninventor know and when did he know it,'' it also allows the public to \neasily determine an invention's priority date--and whether a patent for \nthe invention is valid in light of the prior art. Additionally, the \nfirst-to-file system, combined with the use of provisional applications \nfor patents, also provides an inexpensive and secure way for small \ninventors\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\nto protect their patent application while discussing the invention with \npossible investors and other third parties.\n  Other reforms included in the bill will improve the quality of U.S. \npatents over the long term. The bill creates a new post-grant review of \npatents, which can be sought within the first 9 months after the patent \nis issued and used to raise any challenge to the patent. This will \nallow invalid patents that were mistakenly issued by the PTO to be \nfixed early in their life, before they disrupt an entire industry or \nresult in expensive litigation.\n  The bill also allows third parties to submit prior art relevant to a \npatent application before the patent is issued. This will help PTO \ndetermine if the invention is already in the public domain and should \nnot be patented. This provision will allow the public to help the PTO \ncorrect its mistakes, and ensure that no patent rights are granted for \ninventions already available to the public.\n  The bill also makes structural reforms to post-grant review that were \nsought by the PTO. It allows inter partes reexamination to be run as an \nadjudicative system, and elevates the threshold for starting post-grant \nproceedings. The PTO has insisted that a higher threshold is critical \nto its ability to administer these proceedings. By raising the \nthreshold for starting an inter partes review to a showing of a \n``reasonable likelihood'' that a patent is invalid, the bill will allow \nthe PTO to avoid accepting challenges that were unlikely to win in any \nevent.\n  The bill also includes many protections that were long sought by \ninventors and patent owners. It preserves estoppel against relitigating \nin court those issues that an inter partes challenger reasonably could \nhave raised in his administrative challenge. It imposes time limits on \nstarting an inter partes or post-grant review when litigation is \npending. And it imposes a one-year time limit on the duration of these \nproceedings. All of these reforms will help to ensure that post-grant \nreview operates fairly and is not used for purposes of harassment or \ndelay.\n  I commend the members of the Judiciary Committee for the work they \nhave put into this bill and I urge my colleagues to support passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1326-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the American economy remains on an \nunsettled footing, as we all know. There are some real signs of \neconomic recovery, but it shows a very fragile recovery. The consumer \nconfidence level seems to be increasing, and that is good news. U.S. \nfactory activity is up. That is good news. But also we are very nervous \nabout the housing market remaining weak. The Nation's unemployment rate \nstands at 9 percent--maybe officially now 8.9 percent--and now our \neconomy is facing a significant head wind due to rising energy prices.\n\n  Since the unrest began in Tunisia, our energy markets have rocked \nupward by the uprisings in Egypt and now in Libya. Libya produces only \nroughly 2 percent of the world's crude oil, with much of that going to \nEurope. But even with Libya producing such a small amount, it still \nmakes a tremendous impact on the world market of oil. The uncertainty \nand fear about supplies, according to oil speculators, has driven crude \nprices to more than $100 a barrel. Prices at the pump were already high \nbefore the unrest in the Middle East. The events going on in North \nAfrica and the Persian Gulf area just worsened the problem.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, gas prices jumped \n19 cents during a 1-week period at the end of February. This is the \nsecond largest 1-week jump in more than 20 years. I think over the \nweekend we learned that gasoline, in a 2-week period of time, is up 33 \ncents. So Americans are now paying, on average, $3.51 a gallon for gas. \nThat, obviously, is about 80 cents higher than this time last year.\n  The average cost to fill a tank of gas is likely around $50. We all \nknow that for a family struggling to make ends meet, these are valuable \ndollars spent at the pump, with most of those dollars going overseas.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer probably knows that before this rapid \nrise in the price of oil, we were spending $730 million a day to import \noil. Obviously, that is now a much higher figure, probably close to $1 \nbillion a day right now. Our country is at risk, our economy is at \nrisk, our Nation's security is at risk; that is, economic security, but \nalso it is related to our national security. Our ever-increasing \nreliance on foreign sources for energy is undermining our Nation's \neconomic and national security. The activities in the Middle East over \nthe last 6 weeks should be an alarm bell going off. It should, in fact, \nbe a wake-up call. Let me be clear. I know that for our economy to grow \nand for business and individuals to thrive, we need access to reliable, \naffordable energy. I support an energy policy that I like to say is \nakin to a four-legged stool or another way of saying it is all of the \nabove--obviously, all the sources of petroleum we can get our hands on, \nand more domestically, obviously, than import, all sorts of alternative \nenergy. Conservation has to be a leg of that stool and, obviously, \nnuclear energy.\n  So to be repetitive: First, we have to have access to oil and gas \nresources here at home. Two years ago, when gas prices were so high, \nthe rallying cry was ``drill here, drill now.'' It seems to me that \nstill is a legitimate rallying cry for us with gas at $3.51 a gallon. \nThe idea that we limit our access to our own resources, which in turn \nleads us to go hat in hand to foreign dictators such as Hugo Chavez and \noil sheiks is ludicrous. It is silly to be sending more money overseas \nto give people resources to train terrorists to kill Americans.\n  We currently import more than 60 percent of our crude oil, and it \ndoesn't have to be that way. I know we can't get to energy independence \nby drilling here and drilling now all by itself, but isn't it a little \nfoolish to have our economy held hostage by events in Libya--North \nAfrica generally--or the Persian Gulf area and particularly with Libya \nonly supplying 2 percent of the world's oil?\n  The Obama administration needs to put an end to the existing policy \nof a de facto moratorium through permitting; that is, for drilling \nonshore and offshore of our own domestic supply. We need to make sure \nwe are doing everything we can to protect workers and the environment. \nBut permitting delays and obstacles should not prevent our Nation from \nmoving forward to developing resources here at home.\n  I also support efforts to expand the use of clean coal and nuclear \nenergy. I also support conservation efforts. I agree that the cheapest \nform of energy is the energy that doesn't have to be used. That is \nconservation. Here in the Senate, I have supported policies aimed at \nreducing energy use in homes and buildings through conservation and \nenergy-efficient technologies. I see the value in reducing overall \nenergy consumption.\n  I have also been a leader in the Senate in promoting alternative and \nrenewable energy. Why? Because the supply of fossil fuels is a finite \nquantity. We must look to alternative and renewable resources so we can \nimprove our energy and our national security. This includes supporting \nenergy from wind, biomass, hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, and \nbiofuels.\n  I would like to focus now on the effort to develop homegrown \nbiofuels. For many years, Congress has realized the need to develop an \nalternative to fossil fuels, particularly as a means of reducing our \ndependence on that fossil fuel. One of the first priorities was a tax \nincentive to encourage the use of\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\nhomegrown ethanol. For over 100 years, the fossil fuel industry has had \na monopoly on our transportation fuel. They built the market. They own \nthe infrastructure. They weren't about to use a product they didn't \nmanufacture, own or profit from. So Congress created a tax incentive to \nencourage big oil to use the product and make it available to their \nconsumers. It was paired with an import tariff to make sure that only \ndomestic ethanol receives the benefit of the tax incentive.\n  So the tax incentive and the tariff worked together to do two things: \nThe incentive exists to encourage the use of domestic ethanol. The \ntariff exists to ensure that we aren't giving a tax incentive to \nalready subsidized foreign ethanol.\n  In other words, wouldn't it be silly to have a tax incentive for the \nproduction of a domestic alternative energy and then allow the import \nof it, which would have taxpayers subsidizing an alternative form of \nenergy coming in from another country? Well, that wouldn't make sense.\n  Together, these two approaches ensure that we don't replace our \ndependence on foreign oil with a dependence upon foreign ethanol. The \nincentive was created to encourage big oil to use a domestically \nproduced product and a renewable product. In 2005, Congress created the \nRenewable Fuels Standard. The standard was created to ensure a minimum \namount of renewable fuels was used in the fuel supply. It was strongly \nopposed by big oil, but it was enacted over their opposition.\n  In 2007, it was greatly expanded. It mandates the use of 36 billion \ngallons of renewable fuel annually by 2022. But that decision, made in \n2007, also limited the amount of ethanol that can be made from grain to \n15 billion gallons.\n  One of the criticisms I hear occasionally is that the ethanol \nreceives both an incentive and a mandate. So I think we should address \nthat point.\n  First, while the mandate requires that the fuel be used, it does not \nmandate that the ethanol be produced domestically. The incentive acts \nas an encouragement to use homegrown products. It increases economic \nactivity at home and works to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil. \nIt doesn't do any good if you are importing a domestic renewable fuel \nif it can be done here locally, creating the jobs here.\n  Secondly, the mandate acts as a floor to ethanol use. Without the \nincentive, we would consume a bare minimum. The incentive encourages \nethanol use beyond the mandate.\n  Some in the environmental community are quick to raise objections to \nthe biofuels mandate as well as the incentive. I would like to suggest \nto them that this is a clear example of limitless hypocrisy and \nintellectual dishonesty in this town. Many of the loudest voices \nagainst these policies are the same voices who lobby me for tax \nincentives and also mandates for wind, solar, geothermal, and other \nrenewable energy.\n  I happen to be a strong supporter of electricity generated from wind \nand other renewable sources. I first authored the production tax credit \nfor wind in 1992. Over the years, it has been expanded to include other \ntypes of resources. Since as far back as 2003, environmental advocacy \ngroups have been pushing for a renewable portfolio standard, which is a \nmandate that utilities around the country use a certain amount of wind \nor other types of alternative energy instead of coal in the production \nof electricity.\n  So now what do we hear? They want the production tax credit for wind \nand other renewable electricity and a mandate that it be produced. Yet \nthey oppose these same policies for biofuels. That is an inconsistency. \nThat seems to be an intellectually dishonest approach; that they would \nlike to have this Senator support mandates for wind as well as a tax \nincentive for wind but lobbying against this Senator's approach to \nhaving a tax incentive for other alternative energies as well as a \nmandate.\n  I have been a champion of ethanol and biofuels for a long time. I am \nwell aware of the positive role ethanol is playing to create a cleaner \nenvironment. It is improving our economic and national security and it \nis creating jobs and economic activity in rural America. In 2010, \nnearly 90 percent of all gasoline sold in the United States contained \nsome ethanol. The 13 billion gallons of ethanol produced in the United \nStates reduced our oil imports by 445 million barrels of oil.\n  After domestic oil production and imports from Canada, U.S. ethanol \nproduction is the third largest source of transportation fuel--what we \nuse in internal combustion engines. U.S. ethanol production is larger \nthan what we import from Saudi Arabia or even from Hugo Chavez's \nVenezuela. Without domestic biofuels, we would be on bended knees even \nmore than we are today, begging others for oil.\n  Just think what has developed in the 2 weeks of Libya. We have OPEC \nhaving to go to Saudi Arabia to make up the difference, just because of \n2 percent of the oil production being affected. Why would we want to be \nmore dependent upon foreign sources of energy, particularly for our \nnational security?\n  Without domestic biofuels it seems to me that we would be on bended \nknees even more than we are today, begging others for oil. Ethanol is \nthe only reliable, legitimate alternative to crude oil. Domestic \nethanol currently accounts for nearly 10 percent of our transportation \nfuel. There is no other renewable fuel that comes close to achieving \nthe economic, environmental, and national security benefits currently \ndelivered by this biofuel that we call ethanol.\n  There are other well-funded misinformation campaigns underway to \nundermine the only alternative to crude oil. Big oil has been joined in \nrecent years by opportunistic grocery manufacturers who hope to find a \nscapegoat in their desire to increase profits and raise food prices. \nThey did this just 2 years ago, when corn was $7. They scapegoated \nethanol. They needed a cover to raise the price of food and then, \nwithin 7 months, when the price of corn was down to half that price, \n$3.50 per bushel, did you see the price of food come down? No. You are \ngoing to find the same thing now.\n  These people continue to perpetuate the same tired, baseless \narguments to try to undermine our efforts toward energy independence. \nThey are more interested in protecting market share and profits than \nnational economic security.\n  Over the next few weeks I am going to do everything I can to talk \nabout this issue, to educate the public on the benefits of domestic \nbiofuels. I am not going to sit quietly while the energy, \nenvironmental, and national security benefits of ethanol are scoffed \nat. I intend to beat back every false attack. The American public \ndeserves an honest, fact-based discussion about the benefits of \nreducing our dependence on people such as Hugo Chavez and Muammar \nQadhafi. They deserve to hear the benefits of reducing our dependence \non dirty fossil fuel.\n  I look forward to continuing this effort and invite dialog from any \nof my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1327-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1327-S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BIENNIAL BUDGETING\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \ninstituting biennial budgeting within the U.S. Government. We should \nreform the Federal budget process by converting it from an annual \nspending process to a 2-year cycle, with 1 year for appropriating \nFederal dollars and the following year devoted to oversight of Federal \nprograms.\n  Under the current budget process, Congress almost never finishes the \nappropriations bills by October 1 and is forced to consider omnibus \nlegislation composed of individual appropriations bills that were never \nconsidered on the Senate floor. Worse still is that we are often unable \nto amend an omnibus appropriations bill and are forced to accept \nprovisions that may be objectionable. Because we are constantly racing \nagainst the clock to finish appropriations, authorizing committees are \nhampered in their ability to conduct effective oversight. This means \nthat we have trouble learning about what spending programs work and \nwhich must be modified or eliminated. Budget reforms are much needed \nand long overdue.\n  The amendment that I filed today would require the President to \nsubmit a 2-year budget at the beginning of the first session of a \nCongress. Members of Congress would then need to adopt a 2-year budget \nresolution, a reconciliation bill if necessary and 2-year \nappropriations bills during that first session. The legislation ensures \nthe enactment\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\nof 2-year appropriations bills by providing a new majority point of \norder against consideration of an appropriations bill that fails to \ncover 2 years. The second session of a Congress would then be devoted \nto the consideration of authorization bills and oversight of Federal \nprograms. The result is enhanced oversight that will provide greater \naccountability of government programs and a superior budget process.\n  Each year, approximately 40 percent of Congress's debating time is \nspent on appropriations, on the resolution and on the reconciliation \nprocess. In some years, that number is as high as 60 percent, not even \nreflecting the time that the budget process consumes the entire Federal \nbureaucracy. Moreover through February 18 of this year, House lawmakers \nspent 61 hours over 4 days debating 162 of the nearly 600 amendments \nfiled on the 359-page measure to fund government until September. And \nafter all the debate and consideration last year, Congress failed to \nadopt the budget or pass any of the 13 appropriations bills for the \nfirst time since the landmark Budget Act of 1974.\n  It is no wonder that the American people are dismayed because all \nthey have seen is the chaotic nature of the budgetary process and the \nfailure of Congress time and time again to meet statutory deadlines.\n  It is important to have a biennial budget because it will allow the \nPresident--as well as Congress--in the second year to fine-tune the \nbudget, revisit issues, improve oversight activities, and--if \nnecessary--respond to a downturn in the economy, such as a recession. \nAnd it would also immeasurably add to accountability to the American \ntaxpayer. If you ask the American taxpayer, ``Do you think your Federal \ndollars are being spent wisely and efficiently?''--the response is a \nresounding ``no'' as reflected in many polls and public opinion \nsurveys. Only if we improve oversight activities and examine every \nprogram and agency, will we restore the confidence of the American \ntaxpayer in how government spends hard-earned tax dollars.\n  Unfortunately, the battle to get the biennial budget passed is not \nnew. I have been advocating for budget reform for years and have \npursued shifting the federal budgeting process to a biennial system \nthroughout my tenure in the Senate. In 1997--the year that led to \nrecord surpluses--I cosponsored the Biennial Budgeting and \nAppropriations Act, S. 261, to amend the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 to revise the Federal and congressional budget processes by \nestablishing a two-year budgeting and appropriations cycle and \ntimetable. That bill sat dormant in a Senate committee--as did the next \nfour bills of this kind that I have cosponsored since.\n  So we find ourselves with record deficits, a complicated and time \nconsuming budget process that gives Americans little confidence in \ntheir government, lack of congressional oversight over the many \nprograms and agencies that dispense taxpayer's funds, and the surpluses \nof the 1998-2001 nowhere to be found. If that does not tell us that the \nsystem is broken, I do not know what does.\n  The biennial budget would free up Senate floor time for other \nmatters, help us avoid having to consider an end-of-year omnibus bill, \nand provide authorizing committees more time to carry out their \noversight responsibilities. Biennial budgeting would make us more \neffective legislators and enable us to make more informed choices on \nbehalf of our constituents.\n  Biennial budgeting is necessary to return us to the path of fiscal \nsustainability and to allow Congress time to engage in meaningful \noversight of government spending. As such, this legislation is long \noverdue and it is my hope that Congress will finally institute this \nmuch needed reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1328-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING C. RAY BAKER\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I honor the life of C. Ray \nBaker, a devoted champion of Fort Smith, AR.\n  Ray Baker was a lifelong cheerleader of Fort Smith, proving his love \nfor the community through serving its citizens for 20 years as mayor.\n  Dedicating countless hours volunteering for civic service \norganizations, he brought an unmatched, contagious energy to ribbon \ncuttings, groundbreakings, awards ceremonies and special community \nevents. His commitment to Fort Smith inspired the ``Ray Baker Lifetime \nAchievement Award.''\n  He shared his enthusiasm for the community with the generations of \nstudents he taught over his 46 years as an educator. His legacy is far \nreaching beyond the halls of Southside High School where he taught for \n44 years.\n  He received numerous awards and commendations for his years in the \nclassroom including being named Arkansas PTA Teacher of the Year, a \nMilken Family National Educator, Arkansas Teacher of the Year and \nDaughters of the American Revolution National American History Teacher \nof the Year.\n  Ray is a true American hero who not only taught what it means to \nparticipate in the government, but also showed his students and the \ncitizens by the example he set.\n  Ray Baker's legacy will live on for future generations to experience \nthe projects he supported encouraged to the lives he touched in the \nclassroom and civic outings all across the region.\n  His energetic spirit has given us all strength, and we are fortunate \nto have had his leadership. During the opportunities I had to share the \nstage with Mayor Baker, I often had to follow his passionate and \nenthusiastic addresses. I would joke with the audience that I needed to \nspend a few days with the mayor so I could learn how to become as \nanimated as he was.\n  We all came to know and say his famous words he would recite after \nhis speeches and proclamations, ``Life's worth living in Fort Smith, \nArkansas.'' I am confident this will always be a motto for the \ncommunity, and thanks to Ray Baker's determination, perseverance and \ndedication, he certainly made Fort Smith a place worth living.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1328-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-825.

A bill to amend the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act to \nrepeal a duplicative program relating to inspection and grading of \ncatfish; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Coburn, in introducing legislation to repeal duplicative \nfederal regulations relating to the inspection and grading of catfish. \nSpecifically, our bill would rescind a provision in the 2008 Farm Bill, \nSection 11016 of P.L. 110-246, which aims to inhibit Vietnamese catfish \nimports as well as catfish imports of other potential trade partners.\n  Section 11016 is nothing more than the latest effort by Members of \nCongress serving the special interests of the catfish industry in their \nhome States. A similar protectionist tactic was tried in the 2002 Farm \nBill when many of these same members slipped in language that made it \nillegal to label Vietnamese catfish, ``pangasius,'' as catfish in U.S. \nretail markets. The intent there was to discourage American consumers \nfrom buying Vietnamese catfish products even though they are virtually \nindistinguishable from U.S. grown catfish. It didn't work. Vietnamese \ncatfish remain popular with American consumers because it is more \naffordable and cheaper to produce than domestic catfish grown in \naquaculture ponds. Now these special interests are relying on this \nlatest Farm Bill rider to over regulate Vietnamese catfish by, \nironically, deeming pangasius a catfish again. Under the guise of food \nsafety, the 2008 Farm Bill directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nFood Safety Inspection Service, FSIS, to inspect catfish like it does \nmeat products or eggs, except that no other fish is under the \nregulatory thumb of the FSIS. Catfish is already regulated by the Food \nand Drug Administration, FDA, which hasn't reported any safety or \nhealth problems with the Vietnamese imports. Domestic producers are \nsimply trying to create barriers for Vietnamese catfish farmers by \nforcing them to comply with a second inspection regime administered by \nan entirely different arm of the Federal bureaucracy.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, is currently engaged in the \nproposed rulemaking process for implementing this new inspection \nauthority. A recent Government Accountability Office, GAO, report \nflagged this FSIS program as ``duplicative'' and ``high risk'' for \n``fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.'' GAO estimates that the USDA \nwould spend about $30 million in taxpayer dollars to implement the \nagency's new catfish inspection program and that we would be further \nfragmenting our federal food safety system by having catfish regulated \ntwice by both USDA and FDA.\n  The provision that I am seeking to repeal is nothing more than a \nprotectionist tactic funded at taxpayers' expense. If implemented, the \nproposed USDA regulations will lead to a duplicative, costly and \ncomplex overseas inspection program that serves no real purpose but to \nprotect American catfish growers from competition while forcing \nAmerican consumers to pay more for fish. Not only is the catfish \nprovision in Section 11016 offensive to our principles of free trade, \nit flagrantly disregards our Bilateral Trade Agreement and relationship \nwith Vietnam. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1330-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1330-S1331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 93--ESTABLISHING THE COMMITTEE TO REDUCE GOVERNMENT \n                                 WASTE\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Udall of Colorado) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

PAYMENT OF EXPENSES.\n\n       The expenses of the Committee shall be paid from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, our Nation's fiscal situation has reached a \ntipping point. The debt held by the public now exceeds $9 trillion. We \nare now in our third year of trillion dollar deficits. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, by the end of 2011, our debt will be $10.4 \ntrillion. This represents 69 percent of GDP, the highest level since \n1950.\n  The picture only gets uglier if you take into account other factors. \nOur total public debt outstanding is over $14 trillion. Moreover, if \nyou assume that certain things that always happen will continue to \nhappen things like the AMT patch, tax relief for families and \nbusinesses, and a ``doc-fix'' our debt will soon be nearly 100 percent \nof GDP.\n  This is, quite simply, unsustainable. If we do not act now to get a \nhandle on this spending, the nation that gave boundless opportunity to \ngenerations of Americans will not be there for our children and \ngrandchildren. With interest payments on all this debt set to grow from \n$225 billion in 2011 to $792 billion in 2021, we are approaching a \nfiscal death spiral.\n  Congress could go a long way simply by reducing wasteful and \nredundant government spending. Last week, in response to a request from \nmy colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, the Government Accountability \nOffice released a report identifying between $100 and $200 billion in \nwasteful spending on redundant government programs alone.\n  Dr. Coburn has been doing yeoman's work burrowing into the federal \nbudget to find the sources of wasteful spending, but getting this \nreport from GAO\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\nis, in my view, his greatest achievement to date. He has given Congress \na roadmap for cuts that really should be no-brainers.\n  But Congress' record on securing cuts is less than stellar. Ronald \nReagan once said that nothing comes closer to eternal life than a \ngovernment program. Congress' committee structure is set up to \nauthorize and reauthorize new programs. It is set up to appropriate \nmoney for those programs.\n  But there are few institutionalized forums in Congress for spending \nrestraint.\n  That is why I am introducing today, with my colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Mark Udall, a Senate Resolution that will create a Committee to \nReduce Government Waste. After last week's GAO report, there is no \nlonger any doubt that the Federal Government is deluged with wasteful, \nnon-performing, and underperforming programs.\n  This committee would be required, every year, to identify wasteful \ngovernment programs and recommend legislation to either cut them or \nreduce them in scope.\n  Most importantly, the consideration of this legislation would be \nexpedited, subject to Section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  There is a precedent for a committee such as this one. In response to \nthe rising costs of World War II, Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia \nproposed the establishment of a committee to cut wasteful programs \ninstead of raising taxes. In just three years, the committee cut \nwasteful programs, resulting in more than $38 billion in today's \ndollars. Given the growth of government in the intervening 6 decades, I \nexpect that our anti-appropriations committee will have an even easier \ntime identifying wasteful spending and programs today.\n  This would be a truly bipartisan committee, with 4 members, 2 \nRepublicans and 2 Democrats, from each of the Senate Finance, Budget, \nand Appropriations Committees.\n  Ultimately, getting our budget deficits and structural debt under \ncontrol is going to take meaningful action from both sides of the \naisle. This needs to be a bipartisan process, and I could not be more \npleased that I am being joined in this effort by my Democratic \ncolleague from Colorado, Senator Udall.\n  The American people have spoken loud and clear. Every day families \nmake tough choices to balance their books, and they expect Congress to \ndo the same. Dozens of groups, representing millions of American \ntaxpayers, have come together to ask Congress to support a committee \ndevoted to eliminating government waste.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on enacting this \nresolution. Senators hear every day from interest groups seeking more \nmoney from the Federal Government. They are well organized, well \nfinanced, and well versed in the ways of the Senate. The committee we \nare proposing will make sure that the citizens who have to foot the \nbill for all of this government spending will have a venue where their \nconcerns take precedence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/07/senate-section/article/S1331-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 152.
