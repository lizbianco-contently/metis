Madam President, I rise to speak about the issues that I \nthink are most important to the American public. I appreciated the \nopportunity I had last evening, along with the Presiding Officer, to \nsit and listen to the\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\nPresident's State of the Union Address, which is an annual rite of \npassage where the President lays out his blueprint and his vision for \nthe next year. In those remarks he did, as he did last year, touch on a \nnumber of themes that I think speak to issues that are important for \nthe country to face.\n  Certainly, there were statements in that speech I agree with, in \nterms of the things he said we need to be focused on. There are some \nstatements with which I did not agree. But in terms of the broader \nagenda, what strikes me about the speech is he talked about the need \nfor tax reform, which is something I agree with. I think it is an issue \nof competitiveness. He talked about medical malpractice reform, which \nis something many of us have been trying to get to be part of the \nhealth care debate in this country for a long time. Unfortunately, that \ngot left on the cutting room floor last year. He talked about \nstrengthening Social Security and entitlement reform, also a critical \npriority if we are serious about getting spending and debt under \ncontrol. He also talked about regulatory reform, looking at government \nreform and the types of actions we might be able to take to streamline \nor shrink or make more efficient the Federal Government. He also talked \nabout the importance of enacting trade agreements, and I could not \nagree more. I think trade is a critical part of our economy. Export \nopportunities for businesses in this country would create economic \ngrowth. It would create jobs. Unfortunately, again, those are trade \nagreements that have been stalled out here for some time in the \nCongress.\n\n  What strikes me about the speech is this. Last year, we heard a lot \nof the same themes. The President this year, I forgot to mention, \ntalked about a 5-year freeze on spending. Last year, he talked about a \n3-year freeze on spending. He talked about trade agreements 1 year ago. \nMany of those same themes were struck 1 year ago. Yet we have not seen \nthe results of the rhetoric. What I would argue to the American people \nand to all my colleagues is, it is important that we judge people not \nby their rhetoric but by their actions. Don't watch what we say, watch \nwhat we do. I think that is true of anyone in public life. We all need \nto be judged by what we do and whether we are following through with \nwhat we say we are going to do.\n  So when the President talks about those priorities, I could not agree \nmore. But, frankly, in order for any of those things to happen, it is \ngoing to take Presidential leadership. If we are going to do something \non tax reform, if we are going to do something on entitlement reform, \nif we are going to do something about spending and debt, the President \nis going to have to step forward with bold proposals in order to \naccomplish that because bold things, big things, need to be done on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  The opposite example of that we saw a year ago, when the health care \nreform bill was being debated on the floor of the Senate. This is \nsomething that impacts literally one-sixth of the American economy. Yet \nyou had a bill that passed the Senate without a single Republican vote. \nIn fact, in most cases Republicans were not included, were not \nconsulted, did not have input into that legislation. So you had a bill \nthat literally impacts one-sixth of the American economy pass out of \nthis Chamber on a party-line vote. That is historic. Because in most \ncases, if you look throughout our Nation's history, when this country \nneeds to do big things, there is a bipartisan effort to try to get a \nbill that can attract broad bipartisan support.\n  So as much as I support many of the things the President said last \nnight, I would argue that the proof is in the pudding. We are going to \nwait and see now whether his actions comport with his words because the \ntalk about spending and debt rings hollow if, in fact, you are not \nwilling to take on spending in this country, spending in our \ngovernment, and willing to take on the issue of entitlement reform. In \nfact, notwithstanding the President's talk last year about a 3-year \nfreeze on spending, we saw the largest buildup, the most massive \nexpansion of government we have seen literally since the 1960s.\n  The health care bill is a $2\\1/2\\ trillion new expenditure for the \nFederal Government when it is fully implemented, at a cost, I believe, \nto be much larger than that over time when you start seeing these costs \npile up and more and more people shifted over into the government \nprogram.\n  Hopefully, we are going to have a vote here in the Senate. I believe \nwe will have a vote. Our leader has indicated that we will get a vote \non repealing health care reform. In my view, before this begins to get \nimplemented, it would make sense to throw it overboard and start over \nand do this right and do it in a way that attracts bipartisan support \nand actually does something to drive down the cost of health care \nrather than increasing it because what we have seen already is what we \npredicted would happen; that is, insurance rates are going up, not \ndown. The massive taxes on that bill, of course, get passed on, so \nconsumers end up paying more for their health care, not less. I would \nargue that we are going to see some disastrous results from some of the \npay-fors in the bill.\n  The so-called CLASS Act, which is another new entitlement program, is \nsomething that even the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, a \nDemocratic chairman, a year ago when this was being debated, said is a \nPonzi scheme of the highest order, something Bernie Madoff would be \nproud of. It has a tail on it that is going to create deficits in the \noutyears and make the financial fiscal picture we face even worse.\n  There are so many things about this bill that argue for us starting \nover and doing it right. But I want to say this morning, because I want \nto focus specifically on this issue of spending and debt, that much has \nbeen made of the fact that we are going to have a vote coming up. On \nMarch 4, the continuing resolution expires, at which point we will have \nto decide what we are going to do in terms of funding the government. I \nhope that debate or the lead-up to that vote sparks a debate about \nspending because if we don't start getting spending under control, this \nproblem we have continues to snowball. We have a $14.3 trillion debt.\n  The other point I would make is there is another big vote looming \nsometime between late March and early May--in the April timeframe most \nlikely--where we are going to have to raise the debt limit. We are \nalready $14.3 trillion in debt as a nation, and we are going to have to \nextend the nation's borrowing authority above that so that we can \nfinance the government. We have maxed out the credit card. We cannot do \nthis any longer. We don't have the luxury of time. When we are facing a \n$14.3 trillion debt, much of which we owe to other countries around the \nworld, we put ourselves at great peril. We put our economy at great \nperil.\n  I would argue it is a national security issue, and I am not the only \none saying that. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike \nMullen, said a few months back that the greatest threat to America's \nnational security is our national debt. That is the top ranking \nmilitary official in this country saying it is not the--when we talk \nabout the greatest threat to America's national security, he could have \ntalked about al-Qaida, he could have talked about the Iranian nuclear \nprogram, he could have talked about China, he could have talked about \nNorth Korea. But what did he say? The greatest threat to America's \nnational security is our national debt. That speaks volumes about what \nwe need to be focused on and what we as public officials here in the \nSenate need to devote our energies to.\n  So when we think about that, there are a couple of things that, \nobviously, we can do. I have advocated, as have others, that we go back \nto the 2008 spending levels because in the last 2 years, we have seen \nspending on the non-national security discretionary part of the budget \nincrease by 21 percent, at a time when inflation in the overall economy \nis 2 percent. So the government has grown at 10 times the rate of \ninflation in the last 2 years.\n  When the President talks about freezing spending this year, he is, in \nmy view, dealing with an issue that really--the only analogy I can \nuse--is like closing the barn door after the horse has already gotten \nout. We have a major problem. We had a dramatic runup in spending in \nthe last 2 years, and freezing it now will enshrine and\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\nlock in to the baseline that massive increase in spending.\n  If we go back to the 2008 levels, it will be painful, but we don't \nhave the luxury of not dealing with this now. It is going to be \npainful, but it is going to be necessary if we are serious about \nproviding a better future for our children and grandchildren. The \nalternative is that we continue to run up these trillion-dollar, $1.5 \ntrillion deficits year over year over year, adding significantly more \nto that debt and putting ourselves on a trajectory when I think our \neconomy is in great peril in the future.\n  That is one aspect of it. We talk about the non-national security \ndiscretionary part of the budget. Of course, the national security part \nof the budget is already being scrutinized and scrubbed. The Secretary \nof Defense, Robert Gates, has made it clear that they are going to try \nto find savings and efficiencies in there to the tune--in fact, I think \nthey have already determined they can save somewhere on the order of \n$150 to $170 billion in the defense budget over the next 5 years. But \nthen you have this other part of the budget, the entitlement programs--\nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--which, of course, Medicare and \nMedicaid are driven by health care costs, and until we figure out what \nwe are going to do on health care to rein that in, to get that cost \nunder control, it is going to be complicated to try to fix. But that \nbeing said, I think that is what argues for actually putting remedies \nin place that will put downward pressure on health care costs, on \nutilization, so we can bring health care costs back under control.\n  There are a number of good ideas out there about how to do that. The \ndebt commission made some recommendations, although most in the area of \nMedicare and Medicaid were largely cosmetic because they couldn't come \nto an agreement about how to fix health care. Social Security, on the \nother hand, is available. It can be fixed. I think the debt commission \nmade a series of recommendations that I hope the President and his team \nwill take seriously and come to the Congress. I think Republicans here \nin Congress are willing to work with him because that is something we \ncan put on a sustainable path. We ought to do it, and we ought to do it \nnow because the longer we wait, the worse the problem becomes.\n  So you have the entitlement issues, you have the non-national \nsecurity discretionary spending--things that can be done, that this \nPresident, if he is willing to put his rhetoric into action and take \nleadership, can actually put up as a record of accomplishment for the \nAmerican people. The alternative is that we continue to add to the \n$14.3 trillion debt.\n  I am not going to sit here and say for a moment that we are not all \nresponsible for this. Obviously, there were previous administrations \nand previous Congresses. We have gotten where we are today because we \ndid not make the hard choices when he should have, and now the choices \nbecome much harder.\n  I would also say that in the last 2 years, that debt has grown by \nover $3 trillion, largely because of a trillion-dollar stimulus bill \nthat we borrowed from our children and grandchildren, which didn't do \nanything to create jobs but did add $1 trillion to the debt, and the \nhealth care bill, which, again, many of the costs of that we are going \nto see into the future, but it has a profound impact on the fiscal \npicture the country is going to be considering.\n  What does it mean to finance a $14.3 trillion debt? Well, it means \nthis: We spend so much on interest that next year the amount we spend \non interest will equal the amount we spend on national security. Think \nabout that. The entire security budget to defend this country, that \namount of money will be equalled by the amount we spend on interest to \nfinance the debt, and that continues to explode in the years ahead. If \nfor some reason we were to have a runup in interest rates, if something \nhappened in the economy, which, with inflation starting to take off a \nlittle bit, generally interest rates would follow that--and at some \npoint in the not too distant future, we could see interest rates tick \nup. Well, we have been able to manage our debt by the way we financed \nit and the short-term borrowing. If you saw interest rates reset and go \nup, it would have an even more profound impact on the amount we pay to \nfinance that debt and the amount we make in interest payments.\n  Every child in America today under the age of 18 owes $114,000 \nbecause of that debt, and 6 years from now it will be $196,000. What \nare we doing to future generations when we saddle them with this \nenormous debt and put them in a position where they are going to be \nfaced with a lower standard of living and a lower quality of life than \nwhat we have experienced simply because we did not have the courage to \nmake the hard decisions that were necessary to get this situation under \ncontrol.\n  So I would suggest to my colleagues and to the President after his \nspeech last night that this is not about talk. It is not about \nrhetoric. It is about action. It is about what the American people \nasked us to come here and do. I think there were three messages coming \nout of the election last fall: The American people want us focused on \njobs and the economy, they want us focused on spending, and they want \nus focused on debt.\n  We are going to have an opportunity in the next few months, when the \ncontinuing resolution expires and we look at the issue of funding the \ngovernment into the future, to deal with the issue of spending When we \nget to the debt limit vote that will come up sometime this spring, we \nwill have an opportunity to talk about the debt. But it ought to \ngenerate and spark a serious effort here in the Congress, not a \ncosmetic one, not a superficial one, not one where we provide \nlipservice but where we are serious about reining in spending--not just \nnon-national security spending but also looking at the long-term issues \nthat are going to affect this country's balance sheet well into the \nfuture, and those are our entitlement programs. It is going to be tough \nstuff. It is not easy to do this.\n  I can't help but think that if we had made some of these hard \ndecisions a few years ago, we wouldn't be in the situation we are \ntoday. I came here as a freshman Congressman back in 1997. One of the \nfirst votes we had--big votes, I should say, on the floor of the House \nof Representatives at the time--was a vote on a balanced budget \namendment, something that I think 38 States have. Our State of South \nDakota has a balanced budget amendment, which means our legislature and \nGovernor can't go home until they balance the budget. That vote passed. \nIt takes two-thirds majorities in both the House and the Senate and 38 \nStates to ratify to get a constitutional amendment approved. We got a \nbig, larger than two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives at \nthat time. It came to the Senate, and it failed by one vote. Now, 67 \nvotes here is the magic number to get the two-thirds threshold. It got \n66 votes in the Senate 14 years ago.\n  I can't help but think how much better out financial picture would be \ntoday had we taken that step back in 1997 and put a balanced budget \namendment--enshrined that into our Constitution and imposed a \ndiscipline on the Congress that hasn't existed. Clearly, for \npoliticians here in Washington, it is too easy, when it comes down to \nmaking hard choices, to take the easy way, to hand the bill to our \nchildren and grandchildren. It is time to stop. We cannot afford this \nany longer. We are at $14.3 trillion and adding $1 trillion every \nsingle year.\n\n  So this is going to require tough decisions, hard decisions. But I \nbelieve this is a great country with great people. We have met big \nchallenges before. I think the American people are ready to step \nforward and deal with this challenge. I think they are looking for \npolitical leadership to do that, to join them in that quest. As I said \nbefore, Presidential leadership is critical. It is going to take \nleadership here in the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  We cannot afford to kick the can down the road any farther, to punt \nthe ball to the next generation. It is not fair to them. For \ngenerations in this country, we have had a sort of guiding principle; \nthat is, one generation sacrifices so the next generation can have a \nbetter life. We may be the first generation that turns that ethic on \nits ear and asks the next generation to sacrifice because we have not \nbeen willing to live within our means.\n  So I hope we can muster the courage that is necessary, and I am going \nto do everything I can to continue to shine a\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\nlight on this issue when we get into these budget debates. I, frankly, \nhave a series of budget reforms. I think that, absent a constitutional \namendment, we ought to be putting some statutory reforms in place that \nwould force downward pressure on spending.\n  I have a bill that calls for a 2-year or biennial budget where we \nbudget in one year, in the odd-numbered year, and in the even-numbered \nyear we do more oversight. So when people here are running for \nreelection, instead of worrying about how to spend more money to curry \nfavor with a particular constituency, we will be doing oversight and \nlooking at how we can save money for the next generation. So I would \nlike to get a debate on that. I think we ought to make the budget \nresolution we pass here binding and give it the teeth and the force of \nlaw which it does not have today. I think there are a series of \nprescriptions that would be worthwhile for us to not only entertain but \nhopefully implement to really take seriously the challenge that is \nbefore us.\n  I thank the chair for the time, and I look forward to engaging in a \ndebate about spending and about debt and how to better create jobs in \nthis economy for the American people, which is what I think they want \nus focused on. I hope it will be not just rhetoric but action that \nfollows.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I listened closely to the speech given \nby the Senator from South Dakota about the deficit. I was thinking as \nhe gave the speech that it was a good one, but I think a little bit of \nhistory is warranted at this moment.\n  In the year 2000, 11 years ago, President William Jefferson Clinton \nwas leaving office. We had gone through a period of budget surpluses. \nWe were taking the budget surplus generated each year and buying more \nlongevity in Social Security, as appropriate. It was a very positive \nsituation. The national debt of America when President William \nJefferson Clinton left office was $5 trillion. In other words, the \naccumulated debt of America from George Washington to the end of \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton was $5 trillion. And as President Clinton \nleft office, he said to President Bush: I want to give you, in the next \nyear, a $120 million surplus in terms of what you can anticipate to \nhappen in the next year. It was a pretty positive situation with a lot \nof job creation, businesses doing well, homes being built.\n\n  Now fast forward from 2000 to 2008, 8 years later. Let's take a \nsnapshot. What was the state of the economy? We were facing \nunemployment at record levels in numbers growing by the month. We no \nlonger had a national debt of $5 trillion. Eight years later after \nPresident George Bush, that national debt was $12 trillion, more than \ndoubled in an 8-year period. The obvious question is, what happened? \nWhy were we doing so well 8 years before and had fallen so badly 8 \nyears later?\n  We had two wars not paid for--we just added those to the national \ndebt--in Iraq and Afghanistan. We had tax cuts even to the wealthiest, \nsomething that had literally never occurred in the history of the \nUnited States, and that added directly to the debt. We had programs \nunpaid for, signed by the President into law, very expensive programs, \neven in the area of Medicare. Accumulate those things with the 9/11 \noccurrence and the downturn in the economy, and we saw our national \ndebt go from $5 trillion to $12 trillion. Instead of President Bush \nleaving new President Obama a surplus for the next year, they \nanticipated a $1.2 trillion deficit as President Bush left office. That \nis what Barack Obama inherited 24 months ago.\n  To hear some of the comments being made, one would think President \nObama had created the deficit crisis. He inherited the deficit crisis \nfrom President George Bush. He said: The first thing we need to do is \nget the economy up and running. Republicans were virtually no help. \nOnly three Republican Senators joined us in a stimulus bill which is \nnow being mocked and criticized. But, in fact, one-third of the \nstimulus was in tax cuts, tax cuts to working families to help them \nthrough a recession. Another third was a safety net, unemployment \ninsurance, as well as help to State and local governments. The final \nthird was infrastructure, building roads and bridges and things across \nAmerica for the economy. That is what the stimulus was.\n  Did it bring us back in a hurry from our recession? No. But it \nstopped the decline in our economy, and we are bringing ourselves back \nnow as more consumer confidence is being demonstrated than we have seen \nin a long time.\n  I was a member of President Obama's deficit commission. For the \nrecord, I want people to know that that deficit commission originally \nwas legislation. It was a statute. We were going to enact a law to give \nthis commission the authority to come up with a report and force \nCongress to vote on it. Powerful stuff, with a lot of bipartisan \nsupport. When this powerful piece of legislation came to the floor of \nthe Senate, seven Republican Senators who were cosponsors of the bill \nvoted against the bill that they cosponsored, this effort to try to \ndeal with our budget deficit in honest terms. After the bill failed, \nthe President said: I will create one by Executive order. I served on \nit. It was Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson cochairing an effort with 18 \nmembers. At the end of the day, 11 of us, including myself, signed on \nto the final report. I always added the caveat--and I think most \nwould--that I don't agree with all of it, but I think it was the \nclosest we were going to come to facing a terrible crisis.\n  The crisis is this: Out of every dollar we spend in Washington, we \nborrow 40 cents. That is unsustainable. Whether we are using that \ndollar to build a missile or to pay for food stamps doesn't make much \ndifference. We have to borrow 40 cents for every dollar we spend. Where \ndo we borrow the money? One of our major creditors was in town last \nweek, President Hu Jintao of China, a major creditor and a major \ncompetitor. Which takes me to the President's State of the Union \nAddress last night.\n  The Republicans are fixed on one particular area. They believe the \nsum and substance of all that we do in Washington should be focused on \nthe deficit. I think the deficit is critically important. I voted for \nthe deficit commission report. We have to do things that are unpopular \nand we have to do them in a sensible and timely way. But it isn't the \nwhole story. What the President tried to remind us last night is that \nwe also have a great American economy. We have to ask ourselves: Will \nthat economy be able to compete in the world of the 21st century? How \nwill we do against competitive nations such as China and Japan and \nGermany? Those were questions asked by the President last night.\n  I have heard many Republican Senators and Congressmen since say those \ninvestments, that spending, we don't need. What we need is to focus on \nthe deficit.\n  I think the President got it right. The President is calling for \nbalance, responsible deficit reform, and investment in America that \nmakes a difference in who we are and what we can be. The President \ntalked about the Sputnik moment, long before the Presiding Officer was \nborn, the Sputnik moment, October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Union \nlaunched the satellite Sputnik into outer space. It scared us to death. \nHere this nemesis of the United States in the Cold War, the Soviet \nUnion, with the capacity to develop a bomb that could destroy major \nparts of America, was now in outer space and we were not. They had a \nmissile that launched a satellite. It was a tiny little thing, about \nthe size of a basketball. It circled the Earth. At that time in October \nof 1957, a chill set in on Capitol\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\nHill when people got to thinking, maybe we are not as good as we \nthought when it comes to math and science and education, if the \nRussians beat us into outer space.\n  Congress did something in 1958 in response to that that was historic \nand considered radical at the time. Congress came up with something \ncalled the National Defense Education Act. It was the first time in the \nhistory of the country when we had offered college loans to those other \nthan veterans, and it was a program that was going to reach across \nAmerica and try to put more young people in college. Did it work? Look \nat the numbers. In 1940, 15 percent of college age students went to \ncollege, about a half a million students in college. In 1958, we \nstarted the loan programs. By 1960, the number of college age students \nin college had grown to 3.5 million. Two years later I was one of them.\n  Now fast forward 10 more years to 1970. By 1970, 7.5 million students \nin America were in college. Forty percent of college age students were \ngoing to college. The investment of this government into the National \nDefense Education Act and student loans democratized higher education, \ndramatically increasing the number of students in colleges and \nuniversities, and not only prepared us for a man on the Moon and NASA \nbut prepared our economy for more important things to come.\n  Let me give an example. When Sputnik was circling the globe, our \nscientists were sitting there upset and frustrated that the Russians \nwere the first in space. Up in Baltimore, there were two scientists at \na laboratory, and they decided they would try to track the Sputnik \nsatellite. The Russians, in order to prove they were actually doing \nsomething, were emitting a signal from this satellite, this little \nbasketball-sized satellite. These scientists said: Let's see if we can \nfind that signal, the frequency. They did. Then they used--and I will \nget lost here in a hurry because I am a liberal arts lawyer--the \nDoppler effect to determine where the satellite was circling the globe \nand its speed. They told some people at the Department of Defense what \nthey had found. The Department of Defense challenged them and said: If \nyou can tell us where the satellite is and how fast it is moving, could \nyou reverse that equation? We would like to know if we had a satellite \nin outer space whether we could figure out where your radio receiver \nwas. So they did the calculations and did the work, and they determined \nit.\n  The purpose in asking the question was so that we could reach a point \nin national defense when, if the Russians launched a missile with a \nbomb on it toward the United States, we could tell where it came from \nand launch one in return. We did this calculation, and we started the \ndevelopment of this in 1958, where we could figure out where the \nreceiving station was on Earth, if there was a transmitting satellite. \nIf it sounds as if it might have led to something, it did. It led to a \nsituation today where I can carry in my pocket a BlackBerry which has a \nGPS. GPS came out of that calculation. Now someone can basically \ndetermine where Durbin is by where his cell phone is. That has become \ncommon technology and science, but it was research by the Federal \nGovernment that led us 50 years later to this moment.\n\n  I say that because the President was trying to make that point last \nnight. When it comes to the future of our economy and where we will be \nand whether we will be competitive, we need to invest--it is not a bad \nword, it is a good word--in our country: in people so they have the \neducation and training, so they can compete; in businesses so they have \nbasic research and the kind of incentives for innovation so they can \nmove forward in growing their businesses and increasing the number of \nemployees; and in building the infrastructure of America that makes a \ndifference.\n  There was a company a few decades ago that became very popular named \nLands End. Most people know it. It has since sold to Sears. They own it \ntoday. But when Lands End was thriving, it was located in a small town \nin Wisconsin. A lot of people wondered how they could run a big mail \norder operation out of a small town in Wisconsin. The answer was they \nhad put together enough infrastructure that it worked. There were \nenough highways and enough ways to provide their product by mail and \nother delivery all around the United States.\n  Now we are in a new generation of challenges. That generation is \ncalling for technology. The President talked about advancing the \ntechnology of computer reach to make sure we have high speed computer \naccessibility across the United States. That technology, innovation, \nand education is going to build a platform for us to be competitive. I \nthink the President got it right. We deal honestly with the deficit, \nbut we don't do it so quickly that we make the recession worse. And we \ninvest in our people so that we are ready to compete in the 21st \ncentury.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nhis as usual right-on-the-money words about the President's speech. I \nanticipate eagerly the speech of my colleague from Rhode Island who \ngraciously yielded to me.\n  I rise to commend President Obama on the pitch perfect State of the \nUnion he delivered last night. His speech was smart and balanced, \nforward thinking, and unabashedly upbeat about the future of our \ncountry.\n  Fundamentally, the President spoke about the need to preserve the \nAmerican dream, to bequeath its promise to the next generation as our \nparents bequeathed it to us. The American dream is very simple. It \nmeans there is a strong likelihood that you will be doing better 10 \nyears from now than you are doing today and an even greater likelihood \nthat your children will be doing better than you did.\n  Many people in America think that dream is in peril today. Some \npeople even fear that America is in decline, that our greatest period \nof prosperity is behind us. To these purveyors of gloom and doom, to \nthose who are sour and dour and think America and its government can't \ndo anything right, the President sent a clear message: You could not be \nmore wrong about America. We are and will remain the most economically \nvibrant, the most culturally vibrant country in the world, with the \nbest system. We are the only country on Earth that tells a young man or \nwoman, 12 or 13 or 14 years old, whether their family has been in this \ncountry 12 or 6 generations or whether they are a new immigrant, you \ncan achieve the stars. No other country has that. That is a precious \npart of our birthright that remains alive and well today, as we see in \nthe successes of so many.\n  It is true that we live in a much different world today than the \ngeneration that preceded us. The rules have changed, and it is tougher \nto get ahead. Unemployment is unacceptably high, and the competition \nfor jobs is real. The middle class feels squeezed. But, as the \nPresident said, this should not discourage us. It should challenge us.\n  Last night, the President explained how we can rise to that \nchallenge. He outlined how we can outinnovate, outeducate, and outbuild \nthe rest of the world, tapping the creativity and imagination of our \npopulous.\n  He urged us to invest in clean energy technology and other cutting-\nedge industries and challenged us to put a million alternative-fuel \nvehicles on the road by 2015. Thanks to the ingenuity of researchers \nsuch as those at the GM fuel cell facility in Honeoye Falls, NY, I \nbelieve we can achieve this ambitious goal. I am also hopeful we can \ntake up and pass clean energy legislation in the months ahead.\n  The President also called on Congress to reform No Child Left Behind \nin order to restore America's global leadership in education. I am \nparticularly pleased that the President enthusiastically endorsed a \npermanent extension of the $2,500 college tuition tax credit I authored \n2 years ago. I would like it to be even higher, to go to $3,000 this \nyear.\n  It is no secret that much of our Nation's infrastructure is in \ndisrepair and that too many Americans do not have access to high-speed \nInternet or high-speed rail. For America to stay ahead of our foreign \ncompetitors, we need to improve the ways in which we transport people \nand information.\n  Since the days of Henry Clay, with the internal improvements, when \nour Nation builds infrastructure, economic growth follows, and this has \nclearly always been a government function. The\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\nPresident clearly understands this fact and spoke to it last night.\n  The President did not just focus on growing jobs, the economy, and \nmiddle-class paychecks last night. He showed an acute awareness of the \nneed to rein in Federal spending to get our Nation's fiscal house in \norder. I echo his call to consolidate or eliminate unnecessary \ngovernment programs and to revisit and revise regulations that have \nlong outgrown their usefulness. Of course, we need to find a balance, \nbut I am confident that more can and will be done to make our \ngovernment more agile and efficient.\n  The President had the right blend: Yes, cut out the waste, even \neliminate wasteful and inefficient and duplicative programs, but do not \nthrow out the baby with the bathwater or, as he said, do not throw the \nengine off the airplane when the plane is overweight. So the \ncombination of growth, investment in our future, and innovation, with \nfiscal moderation and reining in waste, is just pitch perfect for the \nAmerican people.\n  Lastly, I applaud the President for addressing one of the most \ncritical matters facing the country: our broken immigration system. As \nyou know, I have championed comprehensive immigration reform for some \ntime, and the President seemed to endorse many aspects of the approach. \nHe likes the approach, bipartisan, that Senator Graham and I put \ntogether. He has told us that on several occasions. So I look forward \nto working with him as well as my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle as we map a path to comprehensive reform in the 112th Congress.\n  Some pundits and handicappers said Congress seemed subdued, even \nrestrained last night. Well, if last night's speech did not seem like \nthe usual partisan pep rally, that is because it was not. The \nPresident's speech was not meant to appeal to Democrats or Republicans \nor even Independents. It was meant to appeal to Americans. In that, the \nPresident succeeded overwhelmingly. The fact that we sat together side \nby side, Democrats and Republicans, was a fine fit with the President's \nappeal to the whole of America, not to one side or the other.\n  The address last night embodied so many of the values and ideals that \nunite us as Americans. It displayed the kind of optimism we relish, \nthrive on, and believe in. It was a great speech, a wonderful moment of \ncomity. I expect this moment will not fade soon, and I hope so too.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I compliment my distinguished \ncolleague from New York on his remarks. I would like to add a few \nobservations of my own, but first I want to echo very much what he \nsaid. What the President did last night was to point a finger toward \nthe future, and some people were just capable of seeing the finger. But \nfor most people, they saw where he was pointing, and he has pointed us \ntoward an important future for our country. These are the issues we are \ngoing to have to address in the decades ahead, and we have to be \nprepared now. I want to touch on about three areas he pointed to. The \nfirst, of course, is infrastructure. I am not the only person in \nAmerica who has noticed our crumbling infrastructure. Everybody who \ndrives on our roads, everybody who goes across our bridges, everybody \nwho has been to our water and sewage plants knows we have underinvested \nin those areas for decades.\n  As the President pointed out last night, America's own engineers give \nAmerica a D for the status of our infrastructure. The Environmental \nProtection Agency has estimated that we have $662 billion in total \ncapital needs for clean water and drinking water investments over the \nnext 10 years--$662 billion that we need to put into our water and \nwater treatment system in the next 10 years. By contrast, in the so-\ncalled stimulus bill, we put in $6 billion; 1 percent of what we need. \nWe have a lot of work we still have to do to make sure America has the \nclean water treatment and drinking water it needs.\n  The infrastructure question is not just about infrastructure the \nRomans could have built. It is not just about roads and bridges and \nwaterworks. The President referred to a Sputnik moment many years ago \nand President Kennedy's drive to get us up into space and to accelerate \nour space program.\n  When President Kennedy pushed to put a man on the Moon within 10 \nyears and bring him safely home, what that delivered was not just a man \non the Moon. What it delivered was the technology that allowed a \ncompany called COMSAT, a public-private corporation, to put up into \nspace the satellite technology that became the infrastructure of our \nmodern communications system. That was done because of that call to \naction.\n  It is not just our communications system that is core infrastructure, \nas well as our roads and our bridges and our waterworks, it is also our \ninformation technology system, particularly in health care. When we \nbuild a robust health information infrastructure--so that as an \nAmerican you are no longer carrying your cardboard file-covered records \nfrom appointment to appointment, no longer having to explain who you \nare and what you have and what medications you are on and why you are \nthere for the umpteenth time because the doctor has not seen your file \nbecause it is not available to him electronically--when we fix all that \nso your pharmacy, your specialist, the laboratories you go to, the \nhospital, if you have had to visit one, are all connected to your \nprimary care provider who is directing the care for your condition, \nthat is a piece of infrastructure that, like our health care \ninfrastructure, will enable enormous growth in the private sector.\n  That is what infrastructure does. Roads are not valuable because \npeople go out with picks and shovels and bulldozers and asphalt pavers \nand make them. They are valuable because once they are made, commerce \nruns across them and the private sector expands. That is just as true \nof communications and information technology and broadband and our \nenergy grid. We need to invest in infrastructure, and we need to think \nabout our modern infrastructure, not just the infrastructure the Romans \ncould build.\n  The other point the President made that was critically important is \nthat American manufacturing is not now competing on a level playing \nfield with our foreign opponents. Many people have said this was a very \n``America first'' speech; that the President seemed more nationalistic \nthan he has been before. I suspect that is because in his years as \nPresident, it has been driven home to him how many disadvantages our \nforeign competition puts our manufacturers at. It is not fair. It \ncreates immense disabilities for them and real handicaps, and we have \nto put American manufacturing back on a level playing field with their \ncompetitors around the globe.\n  I can go to the Cranston Print Works Company in Rhode Island, which \nis one of the last remaining vestiges of the vaunted Rhode Island \ntextile industry. It was Rhode Island's textile industry that started \nthe industrial revolution. Rhode Island's textile industry propelled \nRhode Island to have more millionaires per capita than any other State \nin the country. Now it has winnowed away, winnowed away, and companies \nsuch as Cranston Print Works that has been able to hang on and survive \nand be successful keenly know how bad the disadvantages are.\n  You could have their CEO, George Shuster, give you a speech about how \nin almost every dimension of their operations they are at a \ndisadvantage, and very often a disadvantage that America has created, \nagainst their foreign competition. I just want to mention one.\n  I have introduced the Offshoring Prevention Act because if George \nShuster were to take his facility in Rhode Island and move it overseas, \nhe could choose the year he declared his profits and defer them to the \nmost advantageous tax year. When he stays in Rhode Island, he has to \ndeclare his profits in that year no matter what. There is no reason on \nEarth we should reward an American company that moves its processes \noverseas with a tax deferral advantage that they do not get when they \nare here at home. My Offshoring Prevention Act would prevent that.\n  The last thing I want to say--because I see my distinguished \ncolleague from Arizona on the Senate floor and I want to make sure I \nleave him time--is just\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\na word about our long-term debt. I was immensely gratified the \nPresident took a firm position to defend Social Security. We who are \nfamiliar with the actual facts know that Social Security has never \ncontributed a dime to our deficit, never contributed a dime to our \ndebt, and that it is solvent for more than a quarter century ahead of \nus. It is not an immediate problem, and with very small adjustments it \ncan be never a problem.\n  In States such as Rhode Island and New York, and I suspect Arizona as \nwell, we have people who count on Social Security. Social Security \ngives us freedom. Social Security gives our seniors freedom from want \nand freedom from fear. It gives them freedom from privation and freedom \nfrom poverty. It gives the younger generation freedom to pursue their \nown dreams, knowing their parents will have a dignified old age because \nof Social Security, and they can take risks and seek opportunities they \nwould never otherwise be able to take if they knew they were the only \nsupport for their parents in their old age, if the only thing that \nstood between their parents and penury was them. Thankfully, Social \nSecurity gives that liberty to young people across this country, as \nwell as the freedom it gives to old people. So I am delighted he took \nthis stand and that Social Security will not be improperly thrown under \nthe bus of the important debt and deficit reduction work we need to do.\n  With that, I will yield. I see, again, Senator McCain on the Senate \nfloor. He is a distinguished Senator and a great friend, and I do not \nwant to take time from him.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S255-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 14, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 14) honoring the victims and heroes \n     of the shooting on January 8, 2011, in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this resolution states that we honor the \nvictims and heroes of the shooting on January 8, 2011, in Tucson, AZ. \nAs we all know, and the Nation and the world knows, on January 8, a \ngunman opened fire at a ``Congress on Your Corner'' event hosted by \nRepresentative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, AZ, killing 6 and wounding \n13 others.\n  Among those who lost their lives were 9-year-old Christina-Taylor \nGreen, Dorothy Morris, Judge John Roll, Phyllis Schneck, Dorwan \nStoddard, and Gabriel Matthew Zimmerman.\n  Christina-Taylor Green was the 9-year-old daughter of John and \nRoxanna Green. She was born on September 11, 2001. She was a third \ngrader, with an avid interest in government, who was recently elected \nto the student council at Mesa Verde Elementary School.\n\n  Dorothy Morris was 76 years old. She attended the January 8 event \nwith George, her husband of over 50 years, with whom she had two \ndaughters and who was also critically injured as he tried to shield her \nfrom the shooting.\n  John Roll, whom I will talk about later on, is a Pennsylvania native \nwho was 63 years old. He began his professional career as a bailiff in \n1972. He was appointed to the Federal bench in 1991 and became a chief \njudge for the District of Arizona in 2006. He was a devoted husband to \nhis wife Maureen, father to his three sons, and grandfather to five \ngrandchildren. He heroically attempted to shield Ron Barber from \nadditional gunfire.\n  Phyllis Schneck, the proud mother of three and grandmother of seven \nand great-grandmother, from New Jersey and spending the winter in \nArizona, was a 79-year-old church volunteer and New York Giants fan.\n  Dorwan Stoddard, a 76-year-old retired construction worker and \nvolunteer at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ, is credited with \nshielding his wife Mavy, a long-time friend whom he married while they \nwere in their sixties and who was also injured in the shooting.\n  Gabriel Matthew Zimmerman was 30 years old, engaged to be married, \nand served as director of community outreach to Representative \nGabrielle Giffords and was a social worker before serving with \nRepresentative Giffords.\n  We all know Gabrielle Giffords was the target of the attack and was \ncritically injured. Overnight, we received extremely good news in that \nher condition has been upgraded from critical to good. That is \nincredible news and is heartening to all of us.\n  Thirteen others were also wounded in the shooting, including Ron \nBarber and Pamela Simon, who were both staffers to Representative \nGiffords, and several individuals, including Patricia Maisch, Army COL \nBill Badger, retired, was also wounded in the shooting. Roger \nSulzgeber, Joseph Zimudie, Daniel Hernandez, Jr., Anna Ballis and Dr. \nSteven Rayle helped apprehend the gunman and assist the injured, \nthereby risking their lives for the safety of others.\n  Some of the actions that took place during this tragedy have been \ncarried extensively in the media. The reaction of the people of Tucson \nand in Arizona to this tragedy has been incredibly uplifting and \nencouraging to all of us. There are so many stories of courage and \nbravery associated with this action. The quick reaction of our police \nand other first responders was remarkable, not to mention the \nincredible and extremely rapid care provided by the doctors and nurses \nand caregivers in Tucson. So in this great tragedy that has taken \nplace, we can be comforted with the knowledge that our citizens reacted \nin the way that Americans do--with heroism, with courage, and with \nsacrifice.\n  I think it is entirely appropriate that this resolution be passed as \none of the first acts of the new 112th Congress of the Senate and \nHouse. I wish to thank all Americans for their concern, their prayers \nand the sympathy and support they have extended not only to the victims \nand their families but also to the people of Arizona.\n  There will be discussion for weeks and months ahead as to how it was \npossible for this event to take place. I don't pretend to know all the \nanswers. It was clearly a deranged individual, an individual who \nperhaps we could argue, while I can't say for certain, his mental \nillness should have been brought to the attention of the proper \nauthorities. We do have a law that provides for such an action in the \nState of Arizona. At the same time, the question needs to be asked: The \nactions that we now have become very aware of, was the possibility of \nthose actions brought to the attention of the proper people so they \ncould take action?\n  The fact is it happened. The fact is we who are elected \nrepresentatives will continue to have contact with our constituents. We \nwill do so and not be deterred by the actions of this deranged \nindividual. We cannot allow the actions of a deranged individual to \nprevent us from interacting, in a fundamental way, with our \nconstituents. They deserve it. I am confident we will be able to \ncontinue the practice of townhall meetings, ``Congress on Your \nCorner,'' the kinds of activities that are, in some ways, not entirely \nunique to the United States of America but certainly are not practiced \nin most parts of the world.\n  So we are encouraged by the news concerning Gabrielle Giffords and we \nwill harbor the hope and pray that she will return to her duties in the \nCongress, representing the people of southern Arizona. We pray for the \nfamily of Judge John Roll and those others who gave their lives. \nSenator Kyl and I attended the various memorial services and events \nsurrounding this tragedy in Tucson and we come away obviously with deep \nsorrow over the event, yet at the same time with a great deal of pride \nand appreciation for our fellow citizens in Arizona and in Tucson who \nhave reacted in a heroic and giving and loving and sharing fashion.\n  So I guess we will be voting on this issue sometime this afternoon, \nand I know other colleagues will be speaking on behalf of this \nresolution.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain pertaining to the introduction of S. 188 \nare\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\nprinted in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with \nthe time being charged to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. S. Res. 14.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to thank Majority Leader Reid and \nour colleagues from Arizona, Senators Kyl and McCain, for bringing this \nimportant resolution to the floor of the Senate. It has been over 2 \nweeks, but our shock and sadness over what happened on that beautiful \nSaturday morning in Tucson is still very real. They were just ordinary \nAmericans, engaged in what we might call the dialog of democracy, when \na gunman stepped in and began firing. Within seconds Congresswoman \nGabrielle Giffords and a dozen innocent bystanders lay injured, and six \nirreplaceable lives were ended.\n  Most of us never had the good fortune to meet Judge John Roll, Gabe \nZimmerman, Phyllis Schneck, Dot Morris, Dorwan Stoddard, or that \nbeautiful little girl, Christina Green. While they shared the Earth \nwith us, we did not know them. But we have come to know them in the \nlast 2 weeks. They were good and decent people who loved their \nfamilies, tried to help others, and believed in the promise of this \ngreat Nation.\n  We mourn their loss. Gabby Giffords, our colleague in the House, \nbelieves in the promise of America's democracy. She believes in it so \npassionately that she chose to run for Congress, even though she \nprobably could have found a more comfortable and even more financially \nrewarding life. She believed in democracy so much that she was one of \nthose Members of Congress who would hop on an airplane and fly across \nAmerica on a weekly basis to be back home in her district in Arizona.\n  She believed in this country so deeply that she continued to reach \nout to her constituents even after the end of a spirited campaign when \na lot of Members of Congress were trying to find at least a few weeks \nto take it easy before they got back into the swing of things.\n  She was concerned about her safety. But she was dedicated to her job \nand her Nation and certainly the people she represented. We are \ngrateful to the doctors and all of the medical professionals who worked \nwonders to save her life and to heal those who were hurt. We are \ngrateful to the first responders and ordinary citizens who acted with \nsuch extraordinary courage to help the victims, tackle the gunman, and \nprevent an even more devastating loss of life.\n  We offer our deepest condolences to the heartbroken families and \nfriends of those who were lost and all those who were wounded in body \nand spirit by this tragedy. We pray that time and God in His infinite \nmercy will bring them comfort and peace.\n  A few days ago, we were encouraged to learn that Congresswoman \nGiffords was moving to a rehab hospital in Houston to begin a new phase \nof her recovery. Yesterday her overall medical condition was upgraded \nto ``good,'' certainly good news. Soon we need to begin the next phase \nin our national discussion of this tragedy, in order to lessen the \nprospects of such violence in the future.\n  We cannot simply mourn and move on. We have to have the courage to \nface this tragedy squarely. It appears this terrible carnage was caused \nby a man with a history of mental illness and a gun. It is not the \nfirst time. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan was shot by a mentally ill \nman with a gun. Nearly 4 years ago, a mentally ill student shot and \nkilled 32 people at Virginia Tech. On Valentine's Day 2008, a former \nstudent with a history of mental instability walked into the lecture \nhall at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, armed with a shotgun \nand three handguns. He killed six people including himself and injured \n21 others.\n  In 1998, a man with a serious mental illness walked into this \nbuilding, the Capitol, and before it ended he had shot and killed two \nmembers of the Capitol Police force. Some are going to argue you cannot \nstop a disturbed person who is intent on committing an act of violence. \nTo some extent that is certainly true. But you can take steps to limit \nthe harm that person can cause by keeping the deadliest of weapons out \nof that person's hands. The gunman in Tucson used a semiautomatic \nhandgun with a high-capacity ammunition clip capable of holding over 30 \nrounds. He fired off 31 shots in a matter of seconds before he had to \nreload and was tackled by brave citizens.\n  If he had had to reload sooner, say, after 10 rounds, at least 9 \npeople in Tucson would not have been shot. High-capacity clips were \nused to commit mass murder at Virginia Tech, Fort Hood in Texas, and in \nTucson. There is no legitimate sporting or self-defense purpose for \nsuch high-capacity weaponry. Hundreds of homeowners do not need to fire \n31 rounds in a matter of seconds.\n  High-capacity clips were once illegal under the 1994 Federal assault \nweapons ban signed by President Clinton, supported by Presidents \nReagan, Carter, and Ford. But that law expired 7 years ago in 2004.\n  Even former Vice President Dick Cheney, a hunter, and an outspoken \nsecond amendment rights advocate, has said in his words, ``maybe it is \nappropriate'' to reinstate the ban on high-capacity clips in the wake \nof the Tucson tragedy.\n  We also need to plug the holes in the Federal background check system \nto make it harder for people with a history of serious mental illness \nor substance abuse from getting guns. This man who was charged with the \nmurders in Tucson is someone who was rejected by our military because \nof his mental condition. He was also told to leave a community college \nbecause they feared that he was a danger to himself and others. And yet \nhe could purchase a weapon and a high-capacity clip in Arizona, in \nAmerica.\n  No one is proposing to take guns away from responsible hunters and \nlaw-abiding citizens. The Supreme Court has made it clear, individuals \nhave the right to own guns and I respect that decision. But the Supreme \nCourt has also said that the second amendment is ``not a right to keep \nand carry any weapon whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever, and for \nwhatever purpose.''\n  We ought to be able to agree to keep the deadliest weapons out of the \nhands of people who are seriously unstable. President Obama gave a very \nmoving speech in Tucson about Christina Green, the little third grader \nwho had just been elected to her student council and often wore red, \nwhite, and blue in honor of her country.\n  The President said, ``I want to live up to her expectations. I want \nour democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to \nbe as good as she imagined it.''\n  I hope we will put political agendas aside and put our heads together \nso we can lessen the chances of another tragedy such as Tucson. That \nwould be the very best memorial we could build to those who lost their \nlives, and the best we could do for America to do our job to keep it \nsafe.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to give some brief remarks \nabout the resolution we are considering today. First and foremost, this \nresolution condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the horrific \nattack that took place earlier this month in Tucson, AZ, while my \nfriend and colleague Gabrielle Giffords was giving time to her \nconstituents through a ``Congress at Your Corner'' event, an event that \nmany of us in the Congress host\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\nfor our constituents, for them to come speak to us about issues that \nmatter to them most.\n  During that attack, many lives were lost. We express our deepest and \nheartfelt condolences to the families and the friends and the loved \nones who lost their loved ones during that attack.\n  Each of those who are honored today will be remembered for all they \ngave to their communities and all they have done, including a great \njudge, John Roll, and community members Dorothy Morris, Phyllis \nSchneck, Dorwan Stoddard, and a great public servant, Gabriel Matthew \nZimmerman. They are all in our thoughts and prayers.\n  President Obama took the time to really talk about one life that was \nlost that affected me most deeply, and that was about Christina-Taylor \nGreen, the 9-year-old girl who went to the ``Congress at Your Corner'' \nevent to learn about public service, to see her Congressman do her job, \nto hear what she had to say.\n  That young girl and her life and the image President Obama talked \nabout in his speech not only in Tucson but in his speech last night I \nthought affected all of us because his speech was about the hope and \nthe dreams that every child in America has for this country, for our \ndemocracy, the true aspirations that Christina had for this government, \nthe expectations she had for us.\n  I believe last night President Obama gave a call to action to all of \nus about who we should be as Americans, what this country stands for, \nwhy we are all public servants, and why we are here to do our jobs. I \nthink it is the image and the life of Christina that gives us hope for \nthe future about what we can be and what we can do together, and I \nthink that is what last night's speech was most about.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about my dear friend Gabby, whose \ncourage and whose strength has been extraordinary and is something that \nnot only inspires me but I think inspires every one of the young people \nhere today and all of us in this country because she is surviving and \nshe is determined to overcome this horrific attack against her and our \ndemocracy and against all of us. Every day she recovers is one more day \nwhere her strength is there as a bright light for all of us, as a \nreminder of what we are all capable of and a reminder of what is best \nin each of us. I am going to go visit Gabby this weekend and sit with \nher and give her the well wishes and the prayers of all of us here.\n  Having her seat remain open last night was a stark reminder of what \ncan be so easily lost, and the importance of our presence in that \nChamber to do the people's business, that we are there not for \nourselves, we are not there as Democrats or Republicans, but we are \nthere as public servants, to do the will of the American people, to do \nour jobs, and to represent the people we are sent here to represent.\n  So I thank Gabby and her extraordinary husband Mark, whose love for \nher truly is pulling her every day across the finish line, for their \ncourage and their dedication, and I wish to let them know we will \ncontinue to pray for their recovery, we will continue to pray for all \nthose who were injured and are recovering, and we pray for all the \nfamilies who have lost their loved ones.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the debate time on the \nresolution be extended to 2:30 p.m., that all provisions of the \nprevious order remain in effect, and that the vote on adoption of the \nresolution occur at 2:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all \nquorum calls during the remainder of the debate on S. Res. 14 be \ncharged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke to the events of January 8 \nin Tucson, AZ, specifically referencing the people we are honoring by \nthe resolution that is before us today. At 2:30 this afternoon, we will \nhave an opportunity to act as a body, Democrats and Republicans from \nall parts of our country, to recognize the people who were injured, the \nfamilies of those who were killed, and, of course, the heroes of the \ntragic Tucson shooting.\n  On that morning of January 8, Representative Gabrielle Giffords \narrived at a Tucson Safeway store for her ``Congress on Your Corner'' \nevent. She was there to meet with constituents, which is something she \nenjoyed doing very much. This was the first such event of the year. She \nhad hosted others previously.\n  She was joined by members of her staff. Among them were Pam Simon, \nRon Barber, Gabriel Zimmerman, and Daniel Hernandez, an intern. They \nstood alongside as Congresswoman Giffords greeted her constituents who \nhad lined up to speak with her. One of those individuals was Judge John \nRoll, chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Arizona, a personal \nfriend of mine. Like most mornings, he had attended mass. Then he \ndecided to stop by the Safeway to thank the Congresswoman for her \nassistance in dealing with the court's overwhelming caseload. Also \nattending the event was 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, who, like \nCongresswoman Giffords, had recently won elected office. This third \ngrader had recently been elected to the student council by Mesa Verde \nElementary School. Dorothy Morris and her husband George, a retired \nmarine, were attending the event together. And Phyllis Schneck, a great \ngrandmother who spent the winters in Tucson but was actually from New \nJersey, was there as well, as were Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard. As all of \nthese people were waiting to speak to Congresswoman Giffords, a gunman \napproached and shot the Congresswoman in the head, then turning his gun \non the others in line. Gabriel Zimmerman, Judge Roll, Christina-Taylor \nGreen, Dorothy Morris, Phyllis Schneck, and Dorwan Stoddard were all \nkilled. George Morris, Mavy Stoddard, Pamela Simon, Ron Barber, and the \nCongresswoman were injured, along with eight others.\n  Those who were killed had much more to offer in their lives.\n  Gabe, the Congresswoman's director of community outreach, was only 30 \nyears old. He was engaged to be married. According to news reports, he \nwas killed while rushing to assist others. He worked closely with my \nTucson staff.\n  Judge Roll was not only a very distinguished and respected jurist but \nwas known most of all in the Tucson community for his kindness and \ncourtesy. He was killed as he tried to protect Ron Barber, who had been \nshot just moments before.\n  Christina-Taylor Green, as I mentioned, was only 9 years old, a third \ngrader.\n  Dorothy Morris was married for 50 years to George, and he was injured \ntrying to protect his wife. The couple has two daughters. I met one of \nthem when I visited with George in the facility in which he is \nrecuperating, where I was last Friday.\n  Phyllis, like others in this group, was a volunteer at her church. \nShe was also known for her cooking.\n  Dorwan Stoddard I mentioned was also a church volunteer, and he, too, \nwas shot as he dove to the ground to cover his wife, who escaped with \nwounds to her legs. I had an opportunity to visit with her again Friday \nas well.\n  As we know, the gunman was prepared to take more lives. His plans for \nmore bloodshed were thwarted by brave and selfless citizens. Their \nstories have been documented in the media in the past few weeks, but a \nfew of their heroic acts are worth recounting here.\n  After a bullet grazed his head and took him to the ground, Bill \nBadger, a 74-year-old retired Army colonel--and in good shape, I might \nadd--got up and he helped hold the gunman down until the police \narrived.\n  Anna Ballis was shopping that morning at Safeway. She was leaving the \nstore when the shooting began. According to reports, she rushed to the \naid of Barber after a bullet hit an artery in his leg. Anna is the \nmother of two U.S. marines who have been deployed to Iraq and \nAfghanistan multiple times. I mentioned yesterday visiting Ron Barber \nin the hospital, holding Anna's hand, repeating over and over again how \nshe had saved his life.\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\n  Such multiple acts of bravery and kindness.\n  Daniel Hernandez was in the gallery at the State of the Union speech \nlast night. He is a 21-year-old intern for Congresswoman Giffords. He \nrushed to her aid right after the incident. He had some training in \nfirst aid and applied pressure to her wounds, which prevented her from \nbleeding more than she did. He stayed with her even after emergency \nservice personnel arrived.\n  Sixty-one-year-old Patricia Maisch grabbed the magazine of additional \nammunition the gunman was hoping to reload in his weapon and then \nadministered first aid to a shooting victim.\n  Steve Rayle, a doctor and former emergency room physician, helped \nsubdue the gunman until law enforcement arrived, and then he, too, \nhelped to care for the injured.\n  As the gunman was trying to reload his weapon, Roger Salzgeber \nwrestled him down from behind.\n  Joseph Zamudio ran toward the scene from a nearby store when he heard \nthe shots being fired and helped subdue the gunman again until law \nenforcement officers arrived.\n  We are obviously grateful for these acts of bravery. We are proud of \nthe people I have mentioned but also all of the emergency workers who \nquickly arrived on the scene and provided lifesaving aid and comfort to \nthe injured in the very crucial moments following the attack.\n  I must mention also the incredible team of professionals, the \nsurgeons and other highly skilled personnel at University Medical \nCenter. We are proud of that facility in southern Arizona, and they \ncertainly showed their competence in dealing with all of the wounded \nand some who died.\n  It has now been more than 2 weeks since the tragedy, and the families \nwho lost loved ones are obviously still grieving. We all pray that they \nfind comfort in the days ahead, and we hope and pray that the wounded \nwill soon make full recoveries. In recent days, we have received some \ngood news in that regard as those who were wounded are beginning to \nrecover and leave the hospital. Our friend and colleague Gabby \nGiffords, although she remains in serious condition, we are heartened \nto hear positive reports from her doctors, and we wish her the very \nbest as she begins a new phase of her recovery in Houston.\n  The tragedy in Tucson was a shock to us all. It is difficult to \ncomprehend that such horror could be visited upon such fine individuals \nand their families. In some respects, however, we see once again how it \nhas brought out the best in good people.\n  In honor of the victims and the heroes of this tragic event, Senator \nMcCain and I ask our colleagues in the Senate to pass S. Res. 14. We \ncan do little to bring solace to those who lost loved ones, but we can \naffirm that this body is united in its grief for the fallen, its \nadmiration for the heroes, and prayers for the injured.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, I would like to express my \nstrong support for the resolution on the floor honoring the victims and \nthe heroes of the Tucson shooting, and I thank Senators Kyl and McCain \nfor submitting it.\n  Let me take this opportunity to express once again my sympathy to the \nfamilies of those who lost their lives that morning and to join with \nall those who are persevering in prayer for the injured, including \nCongresswoman Giffords, whose condition, thankfully, still appears to \nbe improving day by day.\n  We will never forget the heroism of those who sacrificed their own \nsafety that morning in Tucson for the good of those around them nor the \ndedication of those who attended to the wounded immediately after the \nshooting both at the scene and in the hospital rooms in the days that \nfollowed.\n  We thank all of them for giving us, in the midst of this horrific \nevent, some reason for hope and a powerful example of service to \nfollow.\n  It is my hope that today's resolution will help in some way to \npreserve the memory of the dead, the injured, and the heroes of Tucson.\n  Hopefully, out of this terrible national tragedy the rest of us can \ndraw strength and inspiration, grow in concern for those around us, and \ndeepen our sense of purpose about the work we do here every day.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. President, for 2 years I have insisted again and again that the \ntwo parties can and should work together on legislation that would spur \nthe economy, create an environment for good private sector jobs, and \nput our Nation on a stronger footing for the future. Last night, the \nPresident did the same. So this afternoon I would like to accept the \nPresident's offer to work together just as I did after last year's \nState of the Union.\n  I agree with the President that we can and should work together to \nincrease, without Federal mandates, production of more domestic sources \nof energy, including nuclear, clean coal, and natural gas; on \nstrengthening and protecting our borders and enforcing immigration \nlaws; on increasing U.S. exports by completing free-trade agreements \nwith South Korea but also Panama and Colombia; on medical liability \nreform to rein in frivolous lawsuits; on finding a bipartisan solution \nto strengthen Social Security for future generations of Americans; on \nfinishing the job in Iraq and Afghanistan; and on simplifying the \nindividual Tax Code and reducing our corporate tax rates, which are \nmaking it harder and harder for U.S. companies to compete around the \nworld.\n  Working together in all these areas would help the economy by \nencouraging the creation of private sector jobs, improving security, \nand helping us keep our commitments to our children and our parents. I \ntake the President at his word when he says he is eager to cooperate \nwith us on doing all of it.\n  But achieving each of these things should be an end unto itself. It \ncannot be contingent on some cynical bargain whereby one party agrees \nto secure the border as long as the other party agrees to amnesty for \nillegal immigrants; where one side agrees to increase domestic energy \nexploration as long as the other side agrees to cripple the economy \nwith higher fuel prices; where one side agrees to fight terror as long \nas the other side agrees to artificial timelines and preordained \nwithdrawal dates--in other words, a bargain whereby the party offering \nto work together has no real intention of working together at all. And \ntoo often that has been the approach this President and his party have \ntaken over the last 2 years.\n  Take health care. For more than a year, we offered to work with the \nWhite House and Democrats on a bill that would incorporate the best \nthinking on both sides. They refused every step of the way. In the end, \nthey got the bill they wanted: a massive government-driven system that \ncreates an unknowable number of new bureaucratic entities and two \nmassive new government entitlements, which is already leading people to \nlose the care they like, which nearly two-thirds of U.S. doctors \nsurveyed predict will lead to worse care, and which is causing already \nstruggling businesses to struggle even more with a mountain--a \nmountain--of new mandates and fees. It is only after this disastrous \nbill has become law that the President says he is now interested in \nmaking it better, even as he belittles the legitimate concerns so many \nAmericans continue to have about it.\n  He has taken the same approach to spending and debt. Two years ago, \nthe President came to Congress and told the country we needed to invest \nin the future through a trillion-dollar stimulus that was supposed to \nbe a model of transparency and efficiency. Within a year, this bill, \nwhich was sold to us as the answer to our Nation's economic woes, had \nbecome a national punch line, a tragic waste of money. And 2 years \nafter that investment in our future was signed into law, what do we \nhave? Nearly $3.5 trillion more in debt and nearly 3 million more \nAmericans out of work.\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\n  These out-of-work Americans do not want to sit around and wait for \nthe Democratic vision of the future to appear, compliments of the \nexperts in Washington. They are not particularly moved by someone's \nvision of what America could look like 40 years from now if only they \nhand over more of their paychecks or more of their freedoms now. They \nwant a job. They want Washington to stop trying to help them and let \nthem help themselves.\n\n  So the President talks a good game, but call us skeptical, because \nwhen all of the applause is over and the speeches are through, the debt \nis higher, more and more wasteful spending and job-stifling regulations \ncome to light, and millions of Americans are still asking the same \nsimple, persistent question: Mr. President, where are the jobs?\n  The President made some good suggestions on areas where we could work \ntogether, and we stand ready to do so, just as we have in the past. But \nwe have now seen enough to know that what the President says and what \nthe President does are two very different things. He has called for \ninvestments in energy before and we got the stimulus. He called for \nworking with us on trade. We are still waiting. He said before we need \nto get serious about the debt, even as it reached dizzying new heights \nas a result of his policies. He speaks like one who recognizes that \nspending is out of control, and yet his response is to propose that we \nlock in spending levels we already know are completely unsustainable. \nThis isn't progress. This is an admission of defeat. Americans don't \nwant a spending freeze at unsustainable levels. They want cuts--\ndramatic cuts--and I hope the President will work with us on achieving \nthem soon.\n  To put it simply, the President still sounds as though he is trying \nto have it both ways. His tone may be changing, but based on past \nperformance we will remain skeptical until we see actual results. \nRepublicans have pledged to the voters that we will do everything we \ncan to cut wasteful government spending, work to lower the debt, get \ngovernment out of the way of economic growth, and to work to repeal the \nhealth care bill, even as we replace that health care bill with the \nkind of commonsense reforms people actually want. The President has \nshown he is willing to talk about some of these things. Let's hope he \nsurprises us by showing a new willingness to do more than that--to \nactually work with us on achieving real results.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that all time has \nbeen used under the order that is now before the Senate. If it has not, \nlet's pretend it has and let's start the vote now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the order for the vote will \nbe changed to 2:25.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I come to the floor to honor CPT \nMartin Anthony Riggan, Jr., and his wife Nicole Riggan. Their journey \non this Earth was cut short but it was one filled with honor, purpose, \nand distinction.\n  Anthony was one of those individuals whom everyone knew would grow up \nto be exceptional, and he did. I have known him since he was a small \nchild. We went to church together. I think it was in maybe the seventh \ngrade when he approached me the first time about going to the U.S. Air \nForce Academy. I have followed his path since he graduated from Pulaski \nAcademy High School in Little Rock in 2003, where he served as class \npresident, Honor Council president, and was a representative on the \nVarsity Football Leadership Council. During this time, Anthony received \nnumerous awards for his character, service to others, and hard work.\n  Then he fulfilled his lifelong dream to attend the United States Air \nForce Academy where he continued to receive accolades for performance \nand leadership. As a member of the Board of Visitors at the Air Force \nAcademy, I was able to visit the academy from time to time. I enjoyed \nseeing the facilities and visiting with the brass, but honestly I most \nenjoyed getting to visit with Anthony in Colorado. During these times, \nhe reminded me about the true definition of selfless service.\n  In his senior year, Anthony was selected to be Group 1 Commander for \nthe Cadet Wing, overseeing 1,200 cadets and their activities. He was \nalso named cadet colonel, the highest rank possible for a cadet at the \nacademy. He shared with me how excited he was to be graduating and how \nproud he was to serve our Nation in our military. I was proud of all he \nwas achieving and he was certainly representing Arkansas well.\n  Following graduation, Anthony began undergraduate pilot training in \nColumbus, MS, flying the T-6 Texan, the T-38 Talon and the B-1B Lancer \nStrategic Bomber. He received the Top Gun Award for Formation Flying \nand was presented with the Leadership Award by the local Air Force \nassociation. Classified as ``exceptionally qualified'' to pilot the B-\n1, Anthony was scheduled to deploy this month to Qatar.\n  In life, Anthony's favorite copilot was his wife Nicole. She shared \nhis strong faith and purpose. After graduating from Colorado's Lewis-\nPalmer High School as valedictorian, Nicole participated in Serteen, a \nvolunteer program for teens and in mission trips to Peru and Guatemala.\n  She went on to study theater education at the University of Northern \nColorado, graduating magna cum laude. She pursued her theater career \nand continued leadership roles in Bible studies and youth groups. \nDuring this time, many of Anthony and Nicole's friends and families \nfound guidance through the devotionals they regularly sent.\n  Today we continue to find encouragement and inspiration through the \nselfless lives they lived. I will miss my friend Anthony and his lovely \nwife Nicole, and I look forward to the day when I see them again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S260-3", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S260-S261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A CAN-DO AMERICA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, whenever a Senator, such as \nSenator Pryor from Arkansas, has to announce to the Senate the loss of \na near personal friend, especially one he has been friends with, and \nwith their parents, for years, it is always a tremendous loss.\n  We are coming up in a couple of days on the 25th anniversary of \nanother great loss in this country, when the Space Shuttle Challenger \nexploded before our eyes on our television screens on January, 28, \n1986. It was such a shock to the Nation, and it hit deep in our psyche \nbecause the symbol of America's technological prowess was the space \nshuttle in the early infancy of the program. The Challenger was only \nthe 25th flight of the space shuttle that the Nation witnessed. In that \nrerun over and over of the close-up view of those solid rocket boosters \ngoing off in different directions 10 miles high in the Florida sky, the \nNation witnessed that extraordinary loss.\n  I will never forget the memorial service in Houston at the Johnson \nSpace Center, when the President of the United States--as sometimes \nhappens in times of grief--became not the President of the United \nStates, not the Commander in Chief, but the comforter in chief. And \nthat was again vividly illustrated a few weeks ago as President Obama \ndelivered that ringing and highly emotional speech in Tucson, AZ. So 25 \nyears ago, as all the crews gathered there at the Johnson Space Center, \nPresident Reagan touched the Nation as the comforter in chief and \npointed out that despite that tragedy, those brave souls were doing \nwhat America has in our genes. By nature, we are explorers and \nadventurers, and we don't ever give that up. Otherwise, we become a \nsecond-rate Nation.\n  Look at the history of America as explorers. Remember the criticism \nwe read about in our history books concerning President Thomas \nJefferson when he wanted to spend a paltry couple of thousand dollars \non an expedition called the Lewis and Clark expedition, to see if they \ncould find the passage to the Pacific coast. As a result of that \nmission, from which miraculously they returned and most of them were \nalive, they brought back all the artifacts of what this broad land \ncontained.\n  Remember when Tom Hanks played Jim Lovell in ``Apollo 13.'' ``Apollo \n13'' was one of the most successful American space ventures not because \nthey didn't land on the Moon, because they couldn't. Most of the \nspacecraft on the way to the Moon blew up. We thought we had three dead \nastronauts who were going to drift in space until they ran out of \nconsumables. And it was that incredible story about how all of \nAmerica's aerospace expertise resided with the astronaut who had stayed \nbehind. He had been training, but he was exposed to the measles and so \nhe was replaced. So then he was there, with all that knowledge and \ntraining for the mission and he could go into the simulator and they \nwere able to simulate in real time how they were going to convert that \nmotor of the lunar lander to get the space ship kicked out of lunar \norbit and back on a trajectory to Earth. And remember after they got \nback--as Tom Hanks is playing Jim Lovell, the commander, in the movie--\nsomeone in the audience asks the commander of the now safely returned \ncrew of Apollo 13: Well, is there really the money to continue to \nexplore space? And Lovell's answer is: What would it have been like if \nColumbus had returned from America and they never went back to follow \nin his footsteps as an explorer?\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\n  So it is, during this time of tragedy, and hearing an individual \nSenator, Senator Pryor, talk about the loss of loved ones and family \nfriends and young people with bright futures, and the reflection in a \nday or so of the anniversary of the Challenger tragedy and the loss of \nseven lives, including the teacher, Christa McAuliffe, who was going to \nteach that lesson plan to the classrooms from space, we are once again \nreminded that because we dare to venture, because we are by nature \nexplorers, there are risks, and sometimes the price to be paid is with \nhuman life. But that is not a reason not to take the risk and to boldly \nventure forth.\n  This is a good reminder for us as Americans as we face so many \nuncertainties--whether it be financial and our future of trying to get \nout of the recession, or whether it be the uncertain future in \nAfghanistan or Pakistan, or how the leadership of al-Qaida is being \nmorphed into other countries, such as Yemen or Somalia, or the constant \nuncertainty of whether we will have a job tomorrow, or whether we can \nretrain for the new kinds of jobs that are coming on line.\n  There are a lot of uncertainties--the uncertainties of our energy \nfuture. Can we remain dependent on 70 percent of our daily consumption \nof oil coming from places such as the Persian Gulf and Nigeria and \nVenezuela? No. It is time for us to venture forth, to explore new \nrealms, to develop new technologies and to be creative. And, of course, \nas the President spoke last night, we can't do that unless we have an \neducated workforce, which is so necessary for us to be creative. It is \nthat creativity, that Yankee ingenuity of Americans, that keeps us \ncompetitive in the global marketplace today because we can outinvent, \nwe can outcreate. That is the change America has.\n\n  As we reflect upon the tragedies, the individual tragedies that we \nhave, the collective tragedy that we had as a nation--25 years ago with \nChallenger, several years ago with the loss of Columbia, the losses we \nhad most recently that are seared into our hearts in Tucson--the hope \nthat springs forth for those who are wounded, that they would come back \nto lead normal lives, these are our challenges. Keep at it. Keep at it.\n  I say this also. Because it is a time of uncertainty, a lot of \npundits are having fun because it appears that NASA is in disarray. \nNASA should not be in disarray. We have a blueprint. We have a roadmap \nfor the future in the NASA bill that passed this Congress--one of the \nfew that passed in the Congress before the lameduck session. It simply \nsays let's continue to encourage the commercial companies to develop a \nservice of taking astronauts and cargo to and from the space station \nand let's see if we can do that safely, as determined by NASA, but more \nefficiently and, therefore, more cheaply, given the constraints of \nbudgets.\n  But, at the same time, we then allow NASA to do what it does best, \nwhich is to venture out and explore the heavens. In so doing, we are \ngoing to build a new rocket that will take large components up and that \nwill fulfill the President's goal, which is to go to Mars.\n  The President specifically set a timetable of 2025 to land and return \nsafely on an asteroid. That is no easy feat, given how fast an asteroid \nflies through space. But it will give us new technologies, as we \ndevelop, to go to Mars.\n  Think of the unbelievable time it would take us under conventional \ntechnology--10 months to get to Mars. Then, once you got to Mars, you \npretty well have to stay on the surface of Mars for 1 year, until the \nplanets are realigned, revolving about the Sun, so Mars comes in closer \nto the Earth for the 10-month trip back. That is why we need new \ntechnologies. An astronaut who flew seven times, Dr. Franklin Chang-\nDiaz, a plasma physicist from MIT, is developing a plasma rocket that \nwill take us to Mars in 39 days. Then, with that short time flying, at \n400,000 miles per hour by plasma thrust, we could stay on the surface 1 \nmonth, to return to Earth without having to stay 1 year.\n  These are exciting new technologies. A pilot project of that plasma \nrocket, with the acronym VASIMR, is being developed to fly on the space \nstation and provide a continuous pulse that will keep the space station \nboosted, instead of it having, in the degrading of its orbit for \nconventional technology, to keep boosting it.\n  Not only is the sky the limit, not only is the stratosphere the \nlimit, the heavens are the limit if we as Americans will assume this \ncan-do posture that is so typical of the personalities of explorers and \nadventurers; in other words, the personalities of we, the Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

and\n       (2) Haiti was ranked of 149th out of 182 countries on the \n     United Nations Human Development Index;\n       Whereas, before the earthquake, Haiti was in the process of \n     recovering from a catastrophic series of hurricanes and \n     tropical storms, food shortages, rising commodity prices, and \n     political instability, but was showing encouraging signs of \n     improvement;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama vowed the ``unwavering \n     support'' of the United States and pledged a ``swift, \n     coordinated and aggressive effort to save lives and support \n     the recovery in Haiti'';\n       Whereas Senate Resolution 392, which was agreed to on \n     January 21, 2010, by unanimous consent--\n       (1) expressed the profound sympathy and unwavering support \n     of the Senate for the people of Haiti; and\n       (2) urged all nations to commit to assisting the people of \n     Haiti with their long-term needs;\n       Whereas the response to the tragedy from the global \n     community, and especially from the countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere, has been overwhelmingly positive;\n       Whereas the initial emergency response of the men and women \n     of the United States Government, led by the United States \n     Agency for International Development and United States \n     Southern Command, was swift and resolute;\n       Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic \n     organizations throughout the United States and the \n     international community responded to the crisis by supporting \n     Haiti and its people through innovative ways, such as \n     fundraising through text messaging;\n       Whereas more than $2,700,000,000 is estimated to have been \n     raised from private donations in response to the tragedy in \n     Haiti;\n       Whereas the Haitian diaspora community in the United \n     States, which was integral to emergency relief efforts--\n       (1) has annually contributed significant monetary support \n     to Haiti through remittances; and\n       (2) continues to seek opportunities to partner with the \n     United States Agency for International Development and other \n     Federal agencies to rebuild Haiti;\n       Whereas Haiti continues to suffer from extreme poverty, \n     gross inequality, a deficit of political leadership at all \n     levels, and weak or corrupt state institutions;\n       Whereas significant long-term challenges remain as Haiti \n     works to recover and rebuild;\n       Whereas the International Organization for Migration \n     estimates that approximately 800,000 people remain in \n     spontaneous and organized camps in Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to numerous nongovernmental \n     organizations and United States contractors, the pace of \n     reconstruction in Haiti has lagged significantly behind the \n     original emergency relief phase;\n       Whereas there is an acute need--\n       (1) to increase local capacity in health care and \n     education; and\n       (2) to focus international attention on employment \n     opportunities, rubble removal, permanent and sustainable \n     shelter, reconstruction of roads, safety and security, and \n     fundamental human rights in Haiti, especially in temporary \n     camps and shelters;\n       Whereas the alleged irregularities and fraud that occurred \n     in the election held in Haiti on November 28, 2010, have \n     imperiled the credibility of the electoral process, \n     undermined the recovery effort, and further destabilized \n     security throughout Haiti;\n       Whereas political leadership is required to ensure that a \n     democratically elected government, which is respected by the \n     people of Haiti and recognized by the international \n     community, is prepared to assume office on February 7, 2011, \n     or shortly thereafter;\n       Whereas, on October 19, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was \n     detected in the lower Artibonite region of Haiti;\n       Whereas initial efforts to contain the epidemic were \n     disrupted by Hurricane Tomas and resulting widespread \n     flooding, which led to the spreading and entrenchment of the \n     disease throughout Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health \n     and Population, between the outbreak in October 2010 and \n     January 21, 2011--\n       (1) more than 3,850 people have died from cholera in Haiti; \n     and\n       (2) more than 194,000 people in Haiti have been affected by \n     the disease;\n       Whereas, according to the Pan American Health Organization \n     and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cholera \n     could spread to as many as 400,000 people within the first \n     year of the epidemic, potentially causing 8,000 deaths at the \n     current case fatality rate;\n       Whereas the United States has provided $40,000,000 worth of \n     assistance to combat the cholera epidemic, primarily through \n     the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, to assist with \n     stockpiling health commodities, equipping cholera treatments \n     centers, providing public information, and developing a safe \n     and sustainable water and sanitation system;\n       Whereas the efforts to combat the cholera epidemic have \n     helped to drive the mortality rate from cholera down from 7 \n     percent to 1 percent of all contracted cases during the 3-\n     month period ending on January 21, 2011;\n       Whereas, during the first year following the January 12, \n     2010 earthquake in Haiti, the people of Haiti have \n     demonstrated unwavering resilience, dignity, and courage;\n       Whereas at the conference of international donors entitled \n     ``Towards a New Future for Haiti'', which was held on March \n     31, 2010, 59 donors pledged approximately $5,570,000,000 \n     (including nearly $1,200,000,000 pledged by donors from the \n     United States) to support the Action Plan for National \n     Recovery and Development of the Government of Haiti;\n       Whereas the United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for \n     Haiti estimates that approximately 63 percent of the recovery \n     and development funds pledged for 2010 have been disbursed; \n     and\n       Whereas Haiti requires sustained assistance from the United \n     States and the international community in order to confront \n     the ongoing cholera epidemic and promote reconstruction and \n     development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors those who lost their lives as a result of the \n     tragic earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010;\n       (2) honors the sacrifices of the men and women of the \n     Government of Haiti, the Government of the United States, the \n     United Nations, and the international community in their \n     responses to those affected by the earthquake;\n       (3) expresses continued solidarity with the people of Haiti \n     as they work to rebuild their neighborhoods, livelihoods, and \n     country;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment of the Senate to support the \n     long-term reconstruction of Haiti, in partnership with the \n     Government of Haiti and in coordination with other donors;\n       (5) supports the efforts of the Executive Branch to prevent \n     the spread of cholera, treat persons who contract the \n     disease, provide technical assistance to the Haitian Ministry \n     of Public Health, and improve long-term water, sanitation, \n     and health systems;\n       (6) expresses support for the United States Embassy team in \n     Port-au-Prince, members of the United States Coast Guard, \n     United States Armed Forces, other United States Government \n     personnel, and all members of international organizations who \n     have persevered through adverse local conditions and continue \n     to serve Haiti and the Haitian people;\n       (7) supports the continued effort of the Interim Haiti \n     Recovery Commission, under the leadership of former President \n     Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Bellerive, in its efforts to \n     improve coordination, build state capacity, and bring donors \n     and the Government of Haiti together to effectively lead the \n     reconstruction process;\n       (8) urges the international community--\n       (A) to call on the leaders of Haiti to immediately reach a \n     democratic resolution to the current electoral crisis to \n     enable the newly elected leaders of the Government of Haiti \n     to take office by February 7, 2011, or shortly thereafter;\n       (B) to continue to focus assistance on the priorities of \n     the Government of Haiti;\n       (C) to develop, improve, and scale-up communications and \n     participatory mechanisms to more substantially involve \n     Haitian civil society at all stages of the cholera and post-\n     earthquake responses; and\n       (D) to give priority to programs that protect and involve \n     vulnerable populations, including internally displaced \n     persons, children, and persons with disabilities;\n       (9) urges aid agencies--\n       (A) to train and use Haitian local and national authorities \n     in the delivery of assistance; and\n       (B) to enhance their coordination and consultation with the \n     Haitian people and key Haitian Government ministries to \n     ensure the effectiveness of aid; and\n       (10) expresses support for--\n       (A) the continuation of the work of United States agencies, \n     nongovernmental organizations, private volunteer \n     organizations, regional institutions, and United Nations \n     agencies to confront the consequences of the crises affecting \n     Haiti;\n       (B) comprehensive assessments of the long-term needs for \n     confronting the cholera epidemic in Haiti, including the \n     construction of adequate water and sanitation infrastructure;

Madam President, I heard this morning the tributes that \nwere made by Senator John McCain and Senator John Kyl about the role \nthat was played by the very heroic judge who lost his life in the \ntragedy that took place in Tucson.\n  Shortly after the tragedy, the offices of Senators McCain and Kyl \nreached out to my committee--the committee on which I am ranking member \nand Senator Boxer is chairman. They talked about how they would go \nabout honoring Judge John Roll by naming the new courthouse that will \nbe constructed in Yuma, AZ, after him.\n  Many of us have come to know the work of Judge Roll after his tragic, \nheroic death in the recent shooting where he died protecting Ron \nBarber, Congresswoman Giffords' district director, and sacrificing \nhimself. My office knew about him before, about Judge Roll's work on \nbehalf of the judicial system in Arizona.\n  Judge Roll contacted my committee staff last year, after a GAO report \ncriticizing the way Arizona was utilizing their courthouse space. This \nis a letter from Judge Roll to us:\n\n       On behalf of the district of Arizona, I strongly disagree \n     with many of the conclusions in the report, particularly as \n     they relate to Arizona and its attempts to cope with an ever-\n     burgeoning criminal caseload largely arising from border \n     enforcement.\n\n  He hoped his response to the report would be helpful to us. It was. \nWe have learned that the problems they have in Arizona on the border \nare something they have never experienced before. It has put their \njudicial system into real problems, and consequently this judge was \ntaking a leadership role in reaching out to us to let us know that GAO \nreport was not accurate.\n  We have had a chance to talk with both Senator McCain and Senator \nKyl. I sat down with Senator Boxer, who is the chairman of our \ncommittee, and talked about what we might be able to do in a very \nexpeditious way. I believe the decision to name the Yuma, AZ, \ncourthouse after Judge Roll is a fitting tribute to a man who served \nhis State with distinction.\n  The courthouse is a new courthouse, government construction, to help \nalleviate some of the overcrowding going on in Arizona right now, \nprimarily because of the problems that exist on the border.\n  I do not know of any time in the years I have been here that a bill \nhas been introduced and then discharged the same day. We all feel \nstrongly enough that this needs to be handled in this way. It is the \nvery least we can do.\n  Judge Roll was highly regarded by his colleagues and clearly took his \njudgeship seriously, doing more than simply deciding cases and going \nhome. He was an active advocate for the judicial system in Arizona. I \nbelieve we would have had this courthouse named after him upon his \nretirement had his life not been tragically taken.\n  Today Senators McCain and Kyl introduced S. 188, and I am happy to \nannounce that Senator Boxer and I have discharged S. 188 to the floor \non this same day. Anything else I do not think would have been \nappropriate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S263-4", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S263-S265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I come to the floor pretty \nregularly to read letters from Ohioans, from people in my State, about \nthings in their lives that are important to them. I think in this \ninstitution we--all of us, myself included--too often forget the pain \nof so many people at home who have lost jobs, who have lost hopes, who \nhave lost health care.\n  I think often about--as I know the Senator from Oregon does--how \ndifficult it would be for a parent to explain to their son or daughter: \nI lost my job and we lost our health insurance and now we may have to \nmove.\n  Nobody has worked harder in the Senate than the Presiding Officer \nfrom Oregon on fixing HAMP and reforming some of the programs that can \nhelp people stay in their homes. I appreciate the work the Presiding \nOfficer does.\n  My letters today are from people all over Ohio about health \ninsurance. It was a long fight to be able to take on the insurance \ncompanies and basically say to the insurance companies: You are not \ngoing to run this health care system the way you have, excluding people \nwith preexisting conditions, denying claims after they have turned in \ntheir insurance after they have been sick, dealing with all the \nproblems people have.\n  The business model for health insurance in this country too often has \nbeen the insurance companies hire a bunch of bureaucrats to keep people \nfrom buying insurance--the preexisting condition exclusion--and then \nhire a bunch of people on the other end, when someone gets sick and \nturns in their insurance claims, to try to deny them their claims. I \nunderstand insurance companies do that. I do not even blame insurance \ncompanies because they are all competing with one another. They may \nhave to do that. But the fact is, it does not work for our health care \nsystem.\n  That is what we fixed last year, and that is what Ohioans understand. \nI guess I--I do not want to say ``resent,'' but in some ways I do \nresent when I see conservative Washington politicians, who, for 20 or \n25 years, have had taxpayer-financed health insurance for them and \ntheir families, and now they want to vote--in the House of \nRepresentatives, and some do here--to take away benefits for senior \ncitizens or take away benefits for small businesses or young people who \nhave a preexisting condition or others.\n  I will not take too long, but I wish to read three or four stories or \nmaybe a handful more than that.\n  Laura--I will only mention first names. These are letters from people \nin Ohio who have written me. Laura, from Dayton, in Montgomery County \nin southwest Ohio, writes:\n\n       My youngest nephew has juvenile diabetes and he just \n     started college in-state. Due to the new health care law, he \n     will be able to stay on my older sister's health care \n     insurance plan when he graduates from college.\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\n     My third oldest nephew can now go back on my second oldest \n     sister's insurance plan.\n       It appears [that some in Congress care] more about money \n     than the American people. Please fight for me so I won't have \n     to worry about losing my health insurance plan if I get \n     seriously ill in the future.\n\n  This story comes from Christine in Medina County, up close to where I \nlive. It is a county south of Cleveland. She writes:\n\n       My name is Christine and I want to tell you the story of \n     Carol . . . my mom. . . .\n       Nine years ago, my father was downsized. His position of \n     over 40 years was eliminated and so was my parents' health \n     coverage. My father was only a few months shy of retirement \n     so Medicare was available to him and my mom was on COBRA. My \n     mom's employer of over 20 years had just recently shut its \n     doors and while she found work through a temp agency, it was \n     only part-time and she didn't qualify for benefits.\n       A few months later my mom was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's \n     Lymphoma and Emphysema.\n       Fortunately, her life was not in immediate danger and their \n     lives were coasting along until her COBRA ran out.\n\n  COBRA is a plan you pay a lot of money for. Actually, you pay the \nemployer's and the employee's side--yours and the employer's--to get \ncoverage for up to 18 months after you lose your job and your \ninsurance.\n  Christine writes:\n\n     . . . have you ever tried to find healthcare coverage for \n     someone with a history of cancer and emphysema? I can, so \n     from personal experience, it's infuriating, but I was able to \n     find it. It would . . . cost her $1,400 per month--\n\n  Mr. President, $1,400 per month--\n\n     with a $4,000 deductible per year.\n\n  That means she would pay insurance--$1,400 a month. She would not be \nable to collect on any of her bills until she had already paid an \nadditional $4,000 out of her pocket.\n\n       This was more than my parents were bringing home each month \n     so needless to say whatever savings and retirement they had \n     was used up quickly. What other option did [they] have?\n       During this time, my mom's health deteriorated. She \n     required chemo and several hospital stays due to her lung \n     collapsing. . . . I remember sitting with her in the hospital \n     and listening to how worried she was about how she was going \n     to pay [her] bill.\n\n  As if these kinds of illnesses are not bad enough in the stress it \ncauses to a family, the anxiety it causes to a family, on top of that, \nthey just wonder: What do we do about insurance? We know people get \nsicker and recover more slowly when they have that kind of anxiety \nabout paying the bills.\n\n       My parents are good people. My dad is a veteran. They \n     worked their entire lives and sacrificed to give me and my \n     older sisters a better life than they had. They were \n     fortunate to have 3 tireless advocates always looking out for \n     them. Not everyone has that.\n\n  She then goes on:\n\n       State and Federal programs are what helped my parents. \n     Without them, I honestly don't know where they'd be today.\n       My hope is that you'll remember my mom and everyone like \n     her. Their lives are depending on it.\n\n  She says: State and Federal programs are what helped my mother.\n  This whole attitude of let's repeal the health care bill and then get \nthe government out of it, and letting individuals take care of \nthemselves is the American way--no, it is not. The American way is \nMedicare, is Medicaid, is Social Security, is private enterprise, is \nindividualism, is helping one another, is a spirit of community in our \ncommunities. It is all that, and it is not get government out of our \nlives. They are against Social Security and they are against Medicare. \nThose are not the American values I was raised with and most people I \nknow were raised with.\n  Michael from Twinsburg, north of Akron, in northeast Ohio, writes:\n\n     . . . my 22 year old son--a college student--was kicked off \n     my insurance plan because of his age last year. It now costs \n     $460 a month to insure him.\n       In January, he will be added back to my policy and it will \n     cost nothing. There is no additional charge to add my son. \n     This is due to the health insurance legislation.\n       Please [talk about] these good things. Most people do not \n     know this and other good things.\n\n  Keep in mind, as I read these, this kind of benefit that goes to \nMichael's son. If the people in this body and in the other body--the \npeople in the House of Representatives who actually voted to repeal the \nhealth care bill--if they have their way--and these are mostly people \nwho they themselves are getting taxpayer-financed health insurance--\nthey want to deny to Michael and his son, they want to deny those kinds \nof benefits we have voted for, while they, at the same time, are \ngetting taxpayer-financed health insurance. I guess one word would be \nhypocritical, another would be callous, another would be cold. I do not \nunderstand that way of thinking from some of my colleagues.\n\n  Steve from Groveport, in Franklin County, Columbus, the center of the \nState, writes:\n\n       I believe the new health care law is one of the greatest \n     things ever done for the middle class. . . .\n       I am so tired of hearing that [many in] this country [are] \n     against it. Every poll I've seen shows it's split . . . down \n     the middle. The other side . . . has got to be heard!\n\n  Steve wrote this a couple weeks ago. I think what we have seen has \nchanged, as people learn more about these benefits. For instance, come \nJanuary 1, every senior in America can go to the doctor and get, \nwithout copays and deductibles, a physical or can get a mammography \ntest or can get screened for osteoporosis or can get colorectal \nscreening.\n  Seniors also, in the so-called doughnut hole, where they continue to \npay a premium but do not get a benefit--under the Bush-constructed \nhealth care bill, there is this huge hole that costs people a lot of \nmoney--because of the health care bill, because it is law, because the \nSenator from Oregon and I and others voted for it and the President \nsigned it, those seniors now will see their drug costs during that \nperiod cut entirely in half, not taxpayer-subsidized cut in half but \nthe drug companies giving up half of what they were paid.\n  This is from Donald in Hardin County, northwest of Columbus:\n\n       I know firsthand that the lack of necessary medical and \n     dental services for children and students of all ages has \n     created a serious impediment to the learning process. \n     Families with access to a regular source of medical care are \n     more likely to keep the entire family healthy and create a \n     better learning environment within the home.\n       The health care reforms you helped pass are vital to the \n     nation's economic recovery and a crucial ingredient for great \n     public schools. . . . Moreover, passage of this reform was a \n     moral imperative. . . .\n\n  Donald, in addition to what he writes about young people--there is an \neffort in the Ohio legislature where I believe 30 Republican \nlegislators have legislation to cancel or eliminate universal all-day \nkindergarten--as if cutting back on children of that age, when \nchildren's brains are developing, and they are growing and maturing, \nespecially at those crucial ages of 3, 4, 5, 6 years old--to pull the \nrug out from under them makes absolutely no sense.\n  The last letter I will read is from Rachael, who lives in Cincinnati, \nin southwest Ohio:\n\n       I simply wanted to thank you for the Pre-Existing Condition \n     Insurance Plan. It is . . . very important . . . to me.\n       Your support for health care reform is greatly appreciated. \n     Health insurance for my pre-existing condition will become \n     one less thing I need to worry about. Thank you, thank you, \n     thank you!\n       I can now concentrate solely on finding a job to replace \n     the one I lost in January. . . .\n\n  Again, I hear people say--I have heard this for years. President Bush \nsaid it a few times, others have said it: Everybody in this country \ngets health care. If something is wrong, you go to the hospital, you go \nto the emergency room.\n  Well, the emergency room does not take care of you if you have \nchronic asthma, the emergency room does not take care of you if you \nhave cancer. The emergency room will take care of you if you go in with \na heart attack, but the emergency room does not take care of you if you \nneed preventive care to keep you out of the hospital, to make you less \nlikely to have that heart attack.\n  I read these letters about health insurance. I don't want to debate \nhealth insurance legislation anymore. I don't think we need to talk \nabout this. We have passed the law. We have made things better. We have \ngiven people who have insurance better insurance now because of these \nconsumer protections. People without insurance now will get assistance. \nPeople who have insurance and were about to get thrown off can keep it \nnow.\n  We need to focus on the real problems in this country that we haven't \naddressed well enough, one of which is job creation. I am hopeful my \ncolleagues will back off this whole idea of\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\nlet's keep debating health insurance and let's keep relitigating this \nand let's keep rediscussing it and let's try to repeal it. Instead, we \ncan fix some things, as the President said last night, make some minor \nchanges in it. But let's go back to what we need to do: create jobs in \nthis country and help manufacturing.\n  My State is the third largest manufacturing State in the country. We \nneed to do a lot to make sure that as we innovate, as we do the best \ninnovation in the world and do the best research and development, that \nthose jobs stay in the United States and don't get outsourced. That is \nour mission, to make sure these jobs are created here.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, shortly after midnight Mass during the \nearly hours of New Year's Day, a heinous suicide bombing attack at the \nSaints Church in Alexandria, Egypt, killed 21 innocent worshippers and \ninjured dozens of others.\n  My condolences go out to the families of the victims and to the \nCoptic community. This was a devastating loss for the Christian \ncommunity in Egypt and Christian communities around the world, \nincluding in my home State of Illinois.\n  I urge the Egyptian government to work swiftly and within the rule of \nlaw to bring those responsible for this heinous crime to justice.\n  The Obama administration already has offered U.S. law enforcement \nassistance, which I encourage Egypt to accept--particularly in light of \nfindings that indicate al-Qaida or other international terrorism \nnetworks were involved.\n  Unfortunately, this bombing attack is not an isolated incident in \nEgypt. Just about one year ago, three men armed with automatic weapons \nkilled six Christian churchgoers as they emerged from a Christmas Mass \nservice in the Egyptian town of Naga Hammadi, along with one Muslim \noff-duty police officer.\n  While I commend the Egyptian government's quick arrest and ongoing \nprosecution of the four suspects in that case, the fact that these \nincidents of violence against their own Christian community have \ncontinued in Egypt is very worrying.\n  Coptic Christians have been practicing their faith in Egypt since \nantiquity. Egypt is home to some of the oldest Christian schools in the \nworld, where students have been taught theology and the text of the \nBible. Coptic Christians are an important part of Egyptian society and \nmake up approximately ten percent of Egypt's population. Protecting \nthem and other religious minorities from acts of violence should be a \ntop priority for the Egyptian government.\n  The New Year's bombing in Egypt is, unfortunately, also part of a \ndisturbing pattern of violence against religious minorities in the \nMiddle East.\n  For example, on October 31, 2010, Our Lady of Salvation Church in \nIraq was the victim of a vicious attack by an al-Qaida affiliate, where \nover 50 innocent lives were taken.\n  Such despicable acts of aggression should not be tolerated. They \nforce minority communities, who deserve greater protection, to live in \nfear of random acts of violence.\n  Such violence and discrimination cause members of minority \ncommunities to become refugees in their own country or to seek refuge \nin other countries. The ability of religious minorities to worship \nfreely and safely should be a basic tenent of any modern society.\n  It is incumbent on Egypt, as a leader in the Middle East, to promote \nan atmosphere of tolerance where members of all religions are given an \nequal opportunity to thrive and participate in the life of the country.\n  Earlier, Senator Whitehouse joined me in a letter to President \nMubarak expressing our concern for the protection of minority \ncommunities in Egypt, including the lack of representation that Coptic \nChristians have in government as well as the government's failure to \nfully prosecute those responsible for acts of violence against Coptic \nChristians in the past.\n  We are concerned that the current situation may embolden extremists\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nand foster increasing religious intolerance and sectarian violence.\n  I have joined Senator Robert Menendez on a resolution condemning the \nNew Year's Day attack in Egypt and expressing condolences to all \nEgyptians who have suffered from terrorist attacks in the past.\n  Egypt has a reputation as a peaceful, moderate Arab state, where, as \nprovided under its laws, all faiths are free to practice their religion \nwithout fear of retribution or violence. Egypt is a leader in the \nregion and a close friend of the United States. But there is no place \nin Egyptian society for the kind of extremists who attacked and killed \npeaceful churchgoers on New Year's Day.\n  I again express my deepest condolences to the members of Saints \nChurch and join all of America in prayers for the victims of this \ntragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S266-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING SARGENT SHRIVER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a hero of mine, Robert Sargent Shriver. He was a man of real \ncourage, extraordinary idealism, committed to serving this country, and \na dear friend.\n  As a veteran of World War II, the founding director of the Peace \nCorps, and the driving force behind Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty, \nSarge believed in the good things government can do for people. Among \nhis many accomplishments, he gave us the Head Start program, the Job \nCorps and Legal Services for the Poor, and the Volunteers in Service to \nAmerica. Later in life he became the U.S. Ambassador to France, and \nthen president of the Special Olympics, an organization founded by his \nremarkable wife Eunice Kennedy Shriver.\n  Sargent Shriver's impact on American life was profound. Through the \nmany programs he championed, Sarge had a direct and lasting effect on \nthe lives of millions of Americans. He was wholly committed to helping \npeople and to the ideals he believed our country ought to stand for, \nand he was tireless and unrelenting in his pursuit of those goals.\n  The Peace Corps, one of Sarge's most important and long-lasting \naccomplishments, enables young Americans to serve their country by \nbuilding understanding between cultures and working to improve the \nlives of others in developing countries. Shriver's spirit lives on \nthrough the Peace Corps, and it is incumbent on all of us to ensure \nthat the agency fulfills his vision, and the vision of President \nKennedy.\n  My friend Bono, a committed advocate in the fight against global \npoverty, was himself inspired by President Kennedy's call to action and \nby Sargent Shriver's work to put it into effect. He recently wrote an \nop-ed which appeared in the New York Times entitled, ``What I Learned \nFrom Sargent Shriver.'' In honor of Sarge, I ask unanimous consent that \na copy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 19, 2011]\n\n                  What I Learned From Sargent Shriver\n\n                               (By Bono)\n\n       The Irish are still mesmerized by the mythical place that \n     is America, but in the '60s our fascination got out of hand. \n     I was not old enough to remember the sacrifices of the great \n     generation who saved Europe in the Second World War, or to \n     quite comprehend what was going on in Vietnam. But what I do \n     remember, and cannot forget, is watching a man walk on the \n     moon in 1969 and thinking here is a nation that finds joy in \n     the impossible.\n       The Irish saw the Kennedys as our own royal family out on \n     loan to America. A million of them turned out on J.F.K.'s \n     homecoming to see these patrician public servants who, \n     despite their station, had no patience for the status quo. \n     (They also loved that the Kennedys looked more WASP than any \n     ``Prod,'' our familiar term for Protestant.)\n       I remember Bobby's rolled-up sleeves, Jack's jutted jaw and \n     the message--a call to action--that the world didn't have to \n     be the way it was. Science and faith had found a perfect \n     rhyme.\n       In the background, but hardly in the shadows, was Robert \n     Sargent Shriver. A diamond intelligence, too bright to keep \n     in the darkness. He was not Robert or Bob, he was Sarge, and \n     for all the love in him, he knew that love was a tough word. \n     Easy to say, tough to see it through. Love, yes, and peace, \n     too, in no small measure; this was the '60s but you wouldn't \n     know it just by looking at him. No long hair in the Shriver \n     house, or rock 'n' roll. He and his beautiful bride, Eunice \n     Kennedy Shriver, would go to Mass every day--as much an act \n     of rebellion against brutal modernity as it was an act of \n     worship. Love, yes, but love as a brave act, a bold act, \n     requiring toughness and sacrifice.\n       His faith demanded action, from him, from all of us. For \n     the Word to become flesh, we had to become the eyes, the \n     ears, the hands of a just God. Injustice could, in the words \n     of the old spiritual, ``Be Overcome.'' Robert Sargent sang, \n     ``Make me a channel of your peace,'' and became the song.\n\n     Make me a channel of your peace:\n     Where there is hatred let me bring your love.\n     Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord,\n     And where there's doubt, true faith in you.\n     Oh, Master grant that I may never seek,\n     So much to be consoled as to console.\n     To be understood as to understand,\n     To be loved as to love with all my soul.\n     Make me a channel of your peace,\n     Where there's despair in life, let me bring hope.\n     Where there is darkness, only light,\n     And where there's sadness, ever joy.\n\n       The Peace Corps was Jack Kennedy's creation but embodied \n     Sargent Shriver's spirit. Lyndon Johnson declared war on \n     poverty but Sarge led the charge. These, and the Special \n     Olympics, were as dramatic an incarnation of the ideas at the \n     heart of America as the space program.\n       Robert Sargent Shriver changed the world more than a few \n     times and, I am happy to say, changed my world forever. In \n     the late '90s, when the Jubilee 2000 campaign--which aimed to \n     cancel the debts that the poorest nations owed to the \n     richest--asked me to help in the United States, I called on \n     the Shriver clan for help and advice. What I got were those \n     things in spades, and a call to arms like a thump in the \n     back.\n       In the years since, Bobby Shriver--Sarge's oldest son and--\n     I co-founded three fighting units in the war against global \n     poverty: DATA, ONE and (RED). We may not yet know what it \n     will take to finish the fight and silence suffering in our \n     time, but we are flat out trying to live up to Sarge's drill.\n       I have beautiful memories of Bobby and me sitting with his \n     father and mother at the Shrivers' kitchen table--the same \n     team that gazed over J.F.K.'s shoulder--looking over our \n     paltry attempts at speechifying, prodding and pushing us \n     toward comprehensibility and credibility, a challenge when \n     your son starts hanging round with a bleeding-heart Irish \n     rock star.\n       Toward the end, when I visited Sarge as a frailer man, I \n     was astonished by his good spirits and good humor. He had the \n     room around him laughing out loud. I thought it a fitting \n     final victory in a life that embodied service and \n     transcended, so often, grave duty, that he had a certain \n     weightlessness about him. Even then, his job nearly done, his \n     light shone undiminished, and brightened us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S266-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S266-S267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNIZING BRUCE RANDOLPH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BENNET. Madam President, today I congratulate Bruce \nRandolph School in Denver, which President Obama recognized in the \nState of the Union Address for its remarkable turnaround.\n  Just 3 years ago, Bruce Randolph was one of the lowest performing \nschools in my home State of Colorado, but last May, 97 percent of the \nseniors graduated, including many who will be the first in their \nfamilies to go to college.\n  I remember as superintendent working with the principal at the time, \nKristin Waters, to get these turnaround efforts off the ground, and it \nis tremendous to see all the progress that has been made on behalf of \nthe students at Bruce Randolph.\n  The Bruce Randolph community has seen firsthand that school \nturnarounds are possible, and with hard work and flexibility, we can \nimprove our schools to better prepare our kids for success in college \nand the 21st century job market. We truly can improve the lives of our \nkids when teachers, parents, principals and communities come together.\n  And now we need to work together to bring similar turnaround efforts \nto other low-performing schools in Colorado and across the country. To \nbuild on successes like these, we need to put politics aside, listen to \nthe ideas and aspirations of those closest to our kids, and work \ntogether to reform our public schools in a way that supports talented \nteaching, closes the achievement gap and equips our kids with the \nskills they are going to need to compete for the jobs of the 21st \ncentury.\n  On a more personal note, for me, for one moment, in a place that \nsometimes feels so removed from the work being done in classrooms \nacross the country, having the children and teachers of Bruce Randolph \ninvoked as an example of what is possible in public education was very \npowerful.\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\n  Congratulations again to teachers, parents, students and the \nprincipal at Bruce Randolph School.

And December 24 marked the company's 18th year \nwithout a lost time accident at its plant, a truly remarkable feat. \nThese milestones are a testament to the company's skilled workforce and \ntheir diligent efforts to promote a strong and safe working \nenvironment. I congratulate Tom Wallace, the company's president, and \neveryone at Wells Wood Turning for their dedicated service and \nimpeccable record of quality and safety over the past quarter century.\n  A member of the Maine Wood Products Association and the Wood Products \nManufacturers Association, Wells Wood Turning & Finishing has proven \nitself to be an exemplary small business. With a commitment to serving \nthe customer by providing striking wood products, designed to the \ncustomers' specifications and in a timely manner, Wells Wood Turning \nhas earned a reputation for fine craftsmanship. I again thank Tom \nWallace and everyone at Wells Wood Turning for their strong work ethic \nand extraordinary safety record, and wish them continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S267-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING GENERAL VANG PAO\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, today I commemorate the \nrecent passing of an iconic figure from a bygone era--a man who, with \nthe help of his loyal Hmong people, kept what some estimate to be as \nmany as 70,000 North Vietnamese soldiers from deploying through Laos to \nkill Americans during the Vietnam war.\n  General Vang Pao, the military leader of the mountain-dwelling \nLaotian Hmong during this era, was already at war with Pathet-Lao \ncommunist forces in Laos when the United States began working with him. \nThe goal of the U.S. in Laos at the time was to prevent North \nVietnamese from using Laos as a supply line for their attacks on South \nVietnam along what was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Unfortunately \nfor the Hmong, who lived in the mountainous jungles between Laos and \nNorth Vietnam, their homes were located along this trail.\n  Vang Pao told the New York Times in 2008 that ``There were three \nmissions that were very important that were given to us and to me . . . \nOne was stopping the flow of the North Vietnamese troops through the Ho \nChi Minh Trail to go to the south through Laos. Second was to rescue \nany American pilots during the Vietnam War. Third, to protect the \nAmericans that navigated the B-52s and the jets to bomb North \nVietnam.''\n  Bill Lair, Vang Pao's contact with the CIA, recounted Vang Pao \nsaying, ``You give us the weapons, and we'll fight the communists.'' \nAnd so began a covert war in Laos in which thousands of Vang Pao's \nHmong soldiers gave their lives, always persevering despite very heavy \ncasualties.\n  To his mountain people and even to some of his CIA contacts, Vang Pao \nhad a larger-than-life status. He shared meager food rations with his \ntroops, commanded from the field instead of his headquarters, and led \ntroops on the frontlines of battles, where he suffered bullet wounds to \nhis arm and chest.\n  Vang Pao was known to have stated, ``If we die, we die together. \nNobody will be left behind.'' These words proved tragic as the Vietnam \nwar came to an end. U.S. forces evacuated Vang Pao and his leadership \nbut were unable to mount an evacuation of the majority of his people. \nVang Pao and his top associates were forced to leave Laos as over \n20,000 of their compatriots stood on an airstrip in the mountains, \nwaiting to be evacuated by their U.S. supporters as the enemy quickly \napproached. The evacuation never occurred. Thousands were left behind \nand killed as communist forces completed their invasion.\n  Today, many Hmong reside in poverty-stricken resettlement villages in \nLaos. A few thousand still remain in the mountains, where there are \nallegations that they have been persecuted in recent years. And many \nhave resettled in the United States. Minnesota, California, Wisconsin, \nand Rhode Island are proud to have Hmong call our States their home.\n  In 1997, the Clinton administration authorized a plaque to be placed \nat Arlington National Cemetery stating that the valor of General Vang \nPao's troops would never be forgotten. As my colleague from Minnesota \ntold Minnesota's Star Tribune, there would be a few thousand more names \non the Vietnam Veterans Memorial were it not for the efforts of the \nHmong. Today, we in the Senate and thousands of Hmong throughout the \nworld remember the bravery and dedication Vang Pao and his troops \nexercised while fighting to uphold democracy and protect the lives of \nso many young Americans at War in Southeast Asia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S267-3", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S267-4", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S267-5", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S267-S268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n   IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13396 ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, WITH RESPECT TO THE \n           SITUATION IN OR IN RELATION TO COTE D'IVOIRE--PM 3\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse under \nconstruction at 98 West First Street, Yuma, Arizona, as the ``John M. \nRoll United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to introduce legislation to name \nthe United States courthouse in Yuma, AZ, the John M. Roll United \nStates Courthouse. Is that legislation at the desk?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill will be received.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce legislation, \nalong with Senator Kyl, that would designate the soon-to-be-constructed \nFederal courthouse in Yuma, AZ, to be named in honor of Chief Judge \nJohn Roll, who died tragically during the senseless act of violence \nagainst Congresswoman Giffords and other Arizonans in Tucson earlier \nthis month. I had the distinct privilege of knowing and working with \nChief Judge Roll for many years. In fact, it was my honor to recommend \nhim to President George Herbert Walker Bush for nomination to the \nFederal bench in 1991. He served with distinction. Most recently, Judge \nRoll became known by so many in the State of Arizona, the Judicial \nConference, and many in Congress as a tireless advocate for the \nplaintiffs, defendants, and judges in Arizona by working to secure \nadditional funding and resources to assist the court in its heavy \ncaseload.\n  The morning of the shooting, Judge Roll was in line to speak to \nCongresswoman Giffords, who was also a friend, about his efforts to \nhave the Ninth Circuit declared a judicial emergency in the District of \nArizona. He died doing what he did each and every day: working to \nguarantee the Federal courts in our State were capable of handling the \ngrowing caseload, while ensuring swift justice for all.\n  Judge Roll exemplified the qualities all Presidents should seek in \ncandidates for the Federal bench: intelligence, humility, integrity, \nand fidelity to the law. He embodied all these qualities and many more. \nAdditionally, he was known as a kind neighbor, a dedicated father and \nhusband, and a loyal friend. He will now be known also as a hero.\n  The Arizona Daily Star reported on January 20, 2011:\n\n       Surveillance footage of the January 8 shooting campaign in \n     Tucson showed that Judge Roll used his body as a shield to \n     cover the wounded Ron Barber. Roll then took a bullet to the \n     back and lost his life in the process.\n       ``The judge is a hero,'' Pima County sheriff's Bureau Chief \n     Rick Kastigar said.\n\n  The article states that the suspected gunman:\n\n       . . . shot Barber, Giffords' district director. Almost \n     simultaneously, Roll moved Barber toward the ground and both \n     crawled beneath\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\n     a table, Kastigar said. Roll then got on top of Barber.\n       ``Judge Roll is responsible for directing Mr. Barber out of \n     the line of fire and helped save his life,'' Kastigar said.\n\n  Barber told the Arizona Daily Star:\n\n       That just gives me more admiration for the judge than I \n     ever had. . . . John Roll was a dear, dear man.\n\n  Barber and Judge Roll had been friends for many years, dating back to \ntheir days as college students at the University of Arizona. Most \nrecently, they worked together with the Arizona congressional \ndelegation to secure funding for a new Federal courthouse in Yuma, AZ, \nto alleviate the congestion at the Tucson Federal courthouse. In fact, \nJudge Roll had just reviewed the architectural drawings of the new \ncourthouse weeks before his death and told my office he was very \npleased with the design.\n  It is the hope of myself and Senator Kyl and every Member of the \nArizona delegation that the architectural designs will soon include the \nname of Chief Judge John Roll prominently on the building. This \nesteemed jurist, friend, and hero deserves this honor and much more. \nOur State has lost a good man, a true and able advocate for justice for \nall, and a great Arizonan. For this reason, I ask my fellow Senators to \njoin me in passing this legislation to allow the new Yuma Federal \ncourthouse to be proudly known as the John M. Roll United States \nCourthouse.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my State has lost an outstanding jurist, a \ntrue and able public servant, and a great Arizonan in Judge John M. \nRoll. In his honor, my Arizona colleague, Senator McCain, and I propose \nnaming the soon-to-be constructed Yuma Federal courthouse the ``Judge \nJohn M. Roll United States Courthouse.''\n  Judge John Roll was the top proponent for the addition of a new \ncourthouse in Yuma, which is intended to help deal with the vast number \nof Federal cases in the underserved Yuma sector. He was involved in \nnearly every aspect of its approval, working tirelessly to overcome the \nmany obstacles that arose during the process and spending countless \nhours poring over designs and meeting with architects and contractors. \nWithout Judge Roll's energy and enthusiasm the project may not have \nbeen accomplished.\n  We name special places after special people not just to thank them, \nalthough we do, but to honor the qualities that make them exceptional \nand distinct.\n  I had the privilege and honor of working with Judge John Roll for \nmany years. He was known for his fairness to all who appeared in his \ncourtroom, both plaintiffs and defendants. As chief judge, he was a \nvigorous advocate, working to guarantee the Federal courts in Arizona \nwere capable of handing their extraordinary caseload. In fact, he died \nprotecting the life of a member of Representative Gifford's staff with \nwhom he had just been discussing the need to designate the need for \nmore judges as a judicial emergency.\n  We are eternally grateful for his many years of public service. I \nbelieve naming the courthouse in his honor befits the rich legacy he \nleaves behind.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in honor of my \nfriend Judge John Roll.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 193. A bill to extend the sunset of certain provisions of the USA \nPATRIOT Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Congress now faces a deadline to take \naction on the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. The bill I \nintroduce today, the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act of 2011, will \npreserve law enforcement techniques that are set to expire on February \n28, 2011, and extend them to December 2013. This bill will also promote \ntransparency and expand privacy and civil liberties safeguards in \ncurrent law. It increases judicial oversight of government surveillance \npowers that capture information on Americans. This is a package of \nreforms that all Americans should support. In fact, a bipartisan group \nof Senators on the Judiciary Committee voted in favor of it in the last \nCongress.\n  In the 111th Congress, the Judiciary Committee reported virtually \nidentical legislation, S. 1692, with bipartisan support, including the \nvotes of Senators Kyl and Cornyn. Subsequent negotiations produced a \npackage that was endorsed by the Attorney General and the Director of \nNational Intelligence. Because Congress did not act on that negotiated \npackage of reforms, but instead passed an extension of the expiring \nauthorities until February 28, 2011, I took steps to see that key \nportions of the package were implemented administratively by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Even with this progress, enacting the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset \nExtension Act of 2011 remains imperative for several reasons. First, \nsurveillance authorities are set to expire in a matter of weeks. We \nshould not play politics with national security by delaying debate over \nthese issues until the 11th hour. I am prepared to extend the sunsets \non the three expiring provisions to December 2013, the same sunset date \nI included in S.1692RS, the bill I introduced in the 111th Congress. \nEarlier this month, a bill was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives to extend the expiring provisions only until February \n2012, an expiration date chosen deliberately to try to force a debate \nover national security in an election year. My bill sets a longer \nsunset period, which law enforcement strongly favors.\n  Second, the Senate should pass the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension \nAct of 2011 to codify the steps forward that the Attorney General has \ntaken by implementing parts of the bill administratively. The reforms \nadopted by this Attorney General could be undone by a future Attorney \nGeneral with the stroke of a pen. We must ensure that the progress in \naccountability and transparency that we achieved last year is not lost \nsimply because it was never written into the statute.\n  Third, we must enact the parts of the bill that the Attorney General \ndid not or could not adopt because they require a change in the \nstatute. Chief among these is adding a new sunset on National Security \nLetters. Second is repealing the presumption in favor of the government \nthat a judge must honor when he or she reviews an application for a \nsection 215 order for business records. The government does not need \nthis presumption. In fact, the Attorney General endorsed the repeal of \nthe presumption when he expressed his support for the bill in the prior \nCongress.\n  When this bill was considered by the Judiciary Committee in the 111th \nCongress, it received a bipartisan vote. Members of the committee \nagreed to continue discussions over a handful of provisions to ensure \nthat the final language promoted transparency, protected civil \nliberties, and aided law enforcement. I appreciate the votes of \nSenators Kyl and Cornyn in favor of the reported bill. In the weeks \nfollowing the 2009 markup, this bipartisan group of Senators worked \nclosely with me and Senator Feinstein to reach an agreement on language \nthat each Senator supported, and that the Department of Justice \nendorsed. In a letter dated November 9, 2009, the Attorney General \nstrongly endorsed the bill and stated unequivocally that the bill did \nnot pose any operational concerns. That support was reaffirmed in a \nletter from the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence to Senate and House leadership on February 19, 2010.\n  The bill I introduce today is virtually identical to the product of \nthose negotiations. It includes only two noncontroversial updates. \nFirst, the new bill updates the deadlines by which the Department of \nJustice must issue public reports. This modification simply reflects \nthe fact that more than 1 year has passed since the original dates were \nwritten into the bill. Second, the section of the bill that previously \nrequired the Department of Justice to establish minimization procedures \nfor National Security Letters is redrafted to reflect that fact that \nthe Department adopted such procedures in October 2010. Otherwise, this \nbill is the same in substance as that which was supported by a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2009.\n  We must move quickly, in advance of the looming deadline, to pass \nthis bipartisan package. We can preserve the authorities currently in \nplace, which give law enforcement the tools it needs to protect \nnational security. And we can ensure that inspectors general, the\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\nCongress, and the public maintain vigilant oversight of the government, \nmaking sure these authorities are used properly and within \nConstitutional bounds. I urge all Senators to support the USA PATRIOT \nAct Sunset Extension Act of 2011.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 193\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reinstate Federal matching of State spending of \nchild support incentive payments; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Child \nSupport Protection Act of 2011 with my colleagues, Senators Cornyn, \nKohl, and Snowe. This bill continues the long-standing, bipartisan \nsupport of Congress for the Child Support Enforcement program, which \nbegan with the passage of the authorizing legislation in 1974.\n  Child support enforcement is a strong partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and State governments to help parents provide long-term \nsupport for their children. It includes a network of 60,000 dedicated \nstaff serving 17 million children across this country. It provided \n$24.4 billion to children in 2009. The Congressional Research Service \nreports that receipt of child support reduces child poverty by nearly \n25 percent. The Urban Institute estimates that $4 in child support \nexpenditures reduces spending in other public programs by $5.\n  So, the Child Support Enforcement program's results are impressive \nand it is widely recognized as one of the most effective programs \noperated by the Federal Government. In fact, the program is notable for \ncollecting $4.78 for each dollar of expenditure. It is a true bargain \nthat works well.\n  Child support programs do much more than just collect money. It works \nwith noncustodial parents who need employment so that they can make \nregular payments. Child support staff also plays a critical role in \ntimes of high unemployment, by processing adjustments to support orders \nso that noncustodial parents do not fall hopelessly behind.\n  When Congress passed the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act \nof 1998, CSPIA, it created an innovative incentive program that rewards \nefficient, results-oriented child support enforcement efforts. These \nearned performance incentives must be used for child support \nactivities. One of every four dollars from State expenditures to fund \nthe child support program comes from CSPIA incentives and matched \nFederal funds. The Deficit Reduction Act, DRA, of 2005 repealed the \nauthority to use the earned performance incentives as a match for \nFederal funds. The bill we have introduced today reverses the funding \nreduction imposed by the DRA.\n  States are using the incentives in a variety of ways. In my State of \nWest Virginia, the incentive dollars are being used to invest in \ntechnology to upgrade services and enhance customer service. Thirty \nStates or territories are investing in staff and program operations. \nSixteen States are investing in technology, and three others are \ninvesting in customer service programs.\n  The Child Support Protection Act would give States the authority to \nuse earned performance incentives to fund this important work and \ncontinue the impressive results that are being achieved. This permanent \nreversal is critical so that those in State and local government can \nbudget for the future. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to cosponsor \nthis much needed legislation that is not only important to child \nsupport enforcement, but our children, their families, and the States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 201. A bill to clarify the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the \nInterior with respect to the C.C. Cragin Dam and Reservoir, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Kyl, in introducing a bill that would clarify the jurisdiction \nof the Bureau of Reclamation over program activities associated with \nthe C.C. Cragin Project in northern Arizona. A companion measure is \nbeing introduced today in the House by Congressman Paul Gosar from \nArizona.\n  Pursuant to the Arizona Water Settlements Act of 2004, AWSA, Congress \nauthorized the Secretary of the Interior to accept from the Salt River \nProject, SRP, title of the C.C. Cragin Dam and Reservoir for the \nexpress use of the Salt River Federal Reclamation Project. While it is \nclear that Congress intended to transfer jurisdiction of the Cragin \nProject to the Department of the Interior, and in particular, the \nBureau of Reclamation, the lands underlying the Project are technically \nlocated within the Coconino National Forest and the Tonto National \nForest. This has resulted in a disagreement between the Bureau of \nReclamation and the National Forest Service concerning jurisdiction \nover the operation and management activities of the Cragin Project.\n  For more than 5 years, SRP and Reclamation have attempted to reach an \nagreement with the Forest Service that recognizes Reclamation's \nparamount jurisdiction over the Cragin Project. Unfortunately, the \nForest Service maintains that this technical ambiguity under the AWSA \nimplies they have a regulatory role in approving Cragin Project \noperations and maintenance. This bill represents a negotiated \ncompromise between the agencies and our offices that appropriately \nclarifies each agency's role with respect to the Dam and the Federal \nlands surrounding it. A similar bill was introduced during the 111th \nCongress and was reported with an amendment by the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. The version we are introducing today is \nidentical to the Committee reported bill.\n  Speedy resolution of this jurisdictional issue is urgently needed in \norder to address repairs and other operational needs of the Cragin \nProject, including planning for the future water needs of the City of \nPayson and other northern Arizona communities. This clarification would \nsimply provide Reclamation with the oversight responsibility that \nCongress originally intended. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PAUL (for himself, Mr. DeMint, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 202. A bill to require a full audit of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System and the Federal reserve banks by the \nComptroller General of the United States before the end of 2012, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nScholarships for Opportunity and Results Act--SOAR--which seeks to \nreauthorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program or OSP. And I am \nproud to be joined by a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing \nthis bill--Senator Collins, Senator Feinstein, Senator Alexander and \nSenator Ensign.\n  The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program offers scholarships to low-\nincome students, especially those from failing schools, to attend \nprivate schools where they can get a better education. This program \noffers District of Columbia students and their families a choice that \nimproves the quality of their education and significantly increases \ntheir likelihood of graduating from high school and attending college.\n  Here in Washington, there are many families who can exercise school \nchoice. They can afford to live in neighborhoods with good schools, \nthey can provide engaging supplemental and afterschool opportunities \nfor their children, or they can choose to send their children to \nprivate schools. However, there are many low-income families whose \nchildren are trapped in failing schools and do not have those options.\n  School reformers in Washington, through their hard work and, at \ntimes, controversial policies, have begun to make a difference for \nstudents in the District of Columbia. I applaud the work of Michelle \nRhee and her team in their tireless efforts to make the District's \nschools better. I am pleased that Mayor Gray has indicated he will \ncontinue school reform because there is much more work to do on behalf \nof Washington's schoolchildren. District of Columbia test scores are on \nthe rise but even so, according to recent National Assessment of \nEducational Progress data, the District of Columbia, while having one \nof the highest per pupil expenditures in the country, settles at the \nbottom of all states in reading and math for both 4th and 8th grade \nstudents. District of Columbia schools also have among the lowest \ngraduation rates in the country.\n  We all know that meaningful and effective change is slow and we still \nhave a long way to go before we can be confident that each student in \nthe District is getting the public education they deserve. Ronald \nHolassie, a high school student in the OSP, expressed the implications \nof this well when he said ``public schools in the District did not go \nbad over night and they won't get better over night.'' Students cannot \nwait for reforms to take effect in the worst of the District's public \nschools--they need a good education right now if they are going to be \nable to fulfill their potential. The Opportunity Scholarships respond \nto that immediate need.\n  One of the goals of the OSP is holistic support of the reforms that \nare helping to improve education in all sectors of education here in \nthe District. Since 2003, Congress has supported a tri-sector approach \nby appropriating new funds for District public schools, District public \ncharter schools and the Opportunity Scholarship Program. Critics of the \nOSP argue that it takes away funds from public schools. That is simply \nnot true. The scholarship program was intentionally designed to ensure \nthat any funding for Opportunity Scholarships would not reduce funding \nfor public schools. This legislation will provide additional new money \nfor the District of Columbia's Public Schools, for District of Columbia \nPublic Charter Schools, and for the continuation of the Opportunity \nScholarship Program. We have not changed the three part funding design \nof the initiative.\n  The SOAR Act also strengthens the existing requirements for all \nschools participating in the OSP by requiring a valid certificate of \noccupancy and ensuring that teachers in core subjects have an \nappropriate college degree. The bill continues to target students from \nlower income families who are attending those schools most in need of \nimprovement and it increases the tuition amounts slightly to levels \nconsistent with the tuition charged at typical participating schools. \nThe new amounts are still well below the per pupil cost of educating a \nchild in the District of Columbia public schools. While we have kept \nthe income ceiling for entry into the program unchanged, we have \nincreased slightly the income ceiling for those already participating \nin the program to ensure that parents are not forced to choose between \na modest raise in their income and the scholarship.\n  The most recent study conducted by the Department of Education's \nInstitute of Education Science shows that the offer of an OSP \nscholarship raised a student's probability of completing high school by \ntwelve percentage points overall. The offer of a scholarship improved \nthe graduation prospects by thirteen percentage points for the high-\npriority group of students from schools designated ``Schools in Need of \nImprovement'' and for those students actually using an OSP scholarship \nthe improved graduation rate went up to twenty percentage points. In \nthe District of Columbia, where the graduation rates are among the \nlowest in the country, this is important data that cannot be \noverlooked. Overall, parents of OSP students were more satisfied and \nfelt school was safer if their child was offered or used an OSP \nscholarship.\n  In a landmark education speech at the outset of his presidency, \nPresident Obama promised that Education Secretary Arne Duncan ``will \nuse only one test when deciding what ideas to support . . . : It's not \nwhether an idea is liberal or conservative, but whether it works.'' By \nthat standard, this program should be continued. It is not a \nDemocratic, Republican, or Independent program--it is not a liberal or \nconservative program--it is a program that puts children first. The \nOpportunity Scholarship Program works as evidenced by increased \ngraduation rates, higher reading proficiency, and the overwhelming \nsupport of District families. I urge Republicans and Democrats to rally \nbehind the OSP program. Last year we had a vote on the bill that \nreceived the support of 42 Senators. In this Congress, I will be \nfighting for another vote and am confident there will be more than 50 \nvotes to reauthorize the program. With these votes and the strong \nsupport of Speaker Boehner I am hopeful we can give students here in \nthe District the opportunities they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 206\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Scholarships for Opportunity \n     and Results Act of 2011'' or the ``SOAR Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\n       (1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their \n     children, including the educational setting that will best \n     serve the interests and educational needs of their child.\n       (2) For many parents in the District of Columbia, public \n     school choice provided under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001, as well as under other public school choice \n     programs, is inadequate. More educational options are needed \n     to ensure all families in the District of Columbia have \n     access to a quality education. In particular, funds are \n     needed to provide low-income parents with enhanced public \n     opportunities and private educational environments, \n     regardless of whether such environments are secular or \n     nonsecular.\n       (3) While the per-student cost for students in the public \n     schools of the District of Columbia is one of the highest in \n     the United States, test scores for such students continue to \n     be among the lowest in the Nation. The National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress (NAEP), an annual report released by the \n     National Center for Education Statistics, reported in its \n     2009 study that students in the District of Columbia were \n     being outperformed by every State in the Nation. On the 2009 \n     NAEP, 56 percent of fourth grade students scored ``below \n     basic'' in reading, and 44 percent scored ``below basic'' in \n     mathematics. Among eighth grade students, 49 percent scored \n     ``below basic'' in reading and 60 percent scored ``below \n     basic'' in mathematics. On the 2009 NAEP reading assessment, \n     only 17 percent of the District of Columbia fourth grade \n     students could read proficiently, while only 13 percent of \n     the eighth grade students scored at the proficient or \n     advanced level.\n       (4) In 2003, Congress passed the DC School Choice Incentive \n     Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-199, 118 Stat. 126), to provide \n     opportunity scholarships to parents of students in the \n     District of Columbia to enable them to pursue a high quality \n     education at a public or private elementary or secondary \n     school of their choice. The DC opportunity scholarship \n     program (DC OSP) under such Act was part of a comprehensive \n     3-part funding arrangement that also included additional \n     funds for the District of Columbia public schools, and \n     additional funds for public charter schools of the District \n     of Columbia. The intent of the approach was to ensure that \n     progress would continue to be made to improve public schools \n     and public charter schools, and that funding for the \n     opportunity scholarship program would not lead to a reduction \n     in funding for the District of Columbia public and charter \n     schools. Resources would be available for a variety of \n     educational options that would give families in the District \n     of Columbia a range of choices with regard to the education \n     of their children.\n       (5) The DC OSP was established in accordance with the U.S. \n     Supreme Court decision, Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. \n     639 (2002), which found that a program enacted for the valid \n     secular purpose of providing educational assistance to low-\n     income children in a demonstrably failing public school \n     system is constitutional if it is neutral with respect to \n     religion and provides assistance to a broad class of citizens \n     who direct government aid to religious and secular schools \n     solely as a result of their genuine and independent private \n     choices.\n       (6) Since the inception of the DC OSP, it has consistently \n     been oversubscribed. Parents express strong support for the \n     opportunity scholarship program. Rigorous studies of the \n     program by the Institute of Education Sciences have shown \n     significant improvements in parental satisfaction and in \n     reading scores that are more dramatic when only those \n     students consistently using the scholarships are considered. \n     The program also was found to result in significantly higher \n     graduation rates for DC OSP students.\n       (7) The DC OSP is a program that offers families in need, \n     in the District of Columbia, important alternatives while \n     public schools are improved. This program should be \n     reauthorized as 1 part of a 3-part comprehensive funding \n     strategy for the District of Columbia school system that \n     provides new and equal funding for public schools, public \n     charter schools, and opportunity scholarships for students to \n     attend private schools.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide low-income parents \n     residing in the District of Columbia, particularly parents of \n     students who attend elementary schools or secondary schools \n     identified for improvement, corrective action, or \n     restructuring under section 1116 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316), with \n     expanded opportunities for enrolling their children in other \n     schools in the District of Columbia, at least until the \n     public schools in the District of Columbia have adequately \n     addressed shortfalls in health, safety, and security, and the \n     students in the District of Columbia public schools are \n     testing in mathematics and reading at or above the national \n     average.\n\n     SEC. 4. GENERAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Authority.--From amounts made available to carry out \n     this section in accordance with section 14(b)(1), the \n     Secretary shall award grants on a competitive basis to \n     eligible entities with approved applications under section 5 \n     to carry out a program to provide eligible students with \n     expanded school choice opportunities.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senator \nLieberman in introducing the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results \nAct of 2011, also known as the SOAR Act. This important piece of \nlegislation will reauthorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, \nwhich has successfully provided additional educational options for some \nof our nation's most at-risk children.\n  Sadly, DC's public schools continue to underperform despite a per-\npupil expenditure rate that is one of the highest in the nation. \nExperts have carefully studied the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program \nand concluded that the educational success of the program's \nparticipants in reading has outpaced those in DC public schools.\n  Approximately 6 years ago, leaders in the District of Columbia became \nfrustrated with institutionalized failure within the public school \nsystem, and designed a unique ``three-sector'' strategy that provided \nnew funding for public schools, public charter schools and new \neducational options for needy children. Working with the District, \nCongress and the Bush administration then implemented the DC School \nChoice Incentive Act in 2004, giving birth to the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program.\n  The program is the first to provide federally funded scholarships to \nstudents, and has enabled low-income students from the District of \nColumbia public school system to attend the independent-private or \nparochial school of their choice. For many of these students, this was \ntheir first opportunity to access a high-quality education.\n  In March 2009, the Department of Education released its evaluation of \nthe program's impact after three years, which showed that overall, \nstudents offered scholarships had higher reading achievement than those \nnot offered scholarships--the equivalent of an additional three months \nof learning.\n  Studies have also shown that parents were overwhelmingly satisfied \nwith their children's experience in the program. Common reasons for \nthis higher level of satisfaction included, appreciation for the \nability to choose their child's school, the success their children are \nhaving in new school environments, and the support provided by the DC \nChildren and Youth Investment Trust Corporation, which runs the \nprogram.\n  In May 2009, Chairman Lieberman and I held a compelling hearing in \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee where we heard \nthe personal success stories of current and former participants in the \nprogram. Their testimony helped to highlight the real-world \nimplications of discontinuing the program.\n  Ronald Holassie, then a junior at Archbishop Carroll, gave compelling \ntestimony about the impact this program has had on his life. His mother \nwas so concerned about the education he had been receiving that she was \nconsidering sending him to school in her home country of Trinidad, \nuntil she found out about the Opportunity Scholarship Program. Ronald \nsaid something very near the end of our hearing in response to a \nquestion from a member of the Committee that I also found enlightening. \nHe said, ``DC schools didn't get bad over night, and they aren't going \nto get better overnight either.'' The program is critical to that \nimprovement.\n  Based on what we have learned over the past few years, Chairman \nLieberman and I drafted a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program. This effort is also being replicated \nin the House with a bill introduced by Speaker Boehner.\n  One of the reasons that I so strongly believe in the three-sector \napproach to funding for education in the District is that it reaffirms \nCongress' commitment to improving educational outcomes and \nopportunities, not just for the students attending private schools, but \nalso for all students in the District--including those attending DC \npublic and charter schools.\n  I know that each of us shares the common goal of ensuring that all \nstudents in the District are receiving the highest quality education, \nwhich is why it is incumbent upon us to act and to act now to fully \nreauthorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Whitehouse, and Ms. \n        Klobuchar):\n  S. 207. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to enhance the COPS ON THE BEAT grant program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Leahy, Reid, \nWhitehouse and others to introduce the COPS Improvement Act of 2011. \nThis legislation would reauthorize and make improvements to one of the \nDepartment of Justice's most successful efforts to fight crime, the \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services, COPS, program.\n  The success story of the COPS program has been told many times, but \nit is worth repeating. The goal in 1994 was to put an additional \n100,000 cops on the beat. Over the next 5 years, from 1995 to 1999, the \nCOPS Universal Hiring Program distributed nearly $1 billion per year in \ngrants to state and local law enforcement agencies in all 50 states to \nhire additional law enforcement officers, allowing us to achieve our \ngoal of 100,000 new officers.\n  Common sense told the American people that having more police walking \nthe beat would lead to less crime, and our experience with the COPS \nprogram proved that to be true. This unprecedented effort to put more \npolice officers in our communities coincided with significant \nreductions in crime during the 1990s. As the number of police rose, we \nsaw 8 consecutive years of reductions in crime. Few programs can claim \nsuch a clear record of success.\n  Unfortunately, the success of the COPS program led some to declare \nvictory. Beginning in 2001, funding for the COPS program came under \nattack. President Bush proposed cuts to state and local law enforcement \nprograms that totaled well over $1 billion during his tenure. Despite \nbipartisan efforts in Congress to prevent those cuts, state and local \nlaw enforcement funding consistently declined. Ultimately, the \nadministration succeeded in eliminating the COPS Hiring Program in \n2005.\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\n  These cuts have been felt by the people who work tirelessly every day \nto keep our communities safe, and the consequences have been real. \nCities across the country have seen the size of their police forces \nreduced. Many cities have hundreds of vacancies on their forces that \nthey cannot afford to fill. They have been forced to choose between \nkeeping officers employed and buying vital equipment. The men and women \nwho have sworn to protect us from ever-evolving threats cannot go \nwithout either.\n  Over the past several years, there has been a bipartisan effort in \nCongress to renew our commitment to local law enforcement by restoring \nCOPS funding. In 2009, we dedicated $1 billion to the COPS program \nthrough the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. These funds helped \nstate, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies create and preserve \nthousands of law enforcement positions. This boost has gone a long way \nto help many departments weather the economic downturn, but need is \ngreat--the COPS Office received nearly 7,300 applications requesting \n39,000 officers and $8.3 billion in funds in response to this grant \nfunding.\n  We can all agree that local law enforcement needs our unwavering \nsupport. One way we can do this is to reauthorize the COPS program \nthrough the COPS Improvement Act of 2011. This legislation will re-\nauthorize hiring programs for three specific purposes--\ngeneral community policing, local counter-terrorism officers, and \nschool resource officers. The bill steps up our commitment to community \npolicing and community cooperation by reauthorizing community \nprosecutor grants. Technology grants that cut down on investigation \ntime and paperwork are included so that officers can spend more time on \nthe beat and less time behind a desk. The bill also creates an \nindependent COPS Office within the Department of Justice, a step that \nis important to the program's continued success and oversight. Finally, \nthe legislation revitalizes a Troops-to-Cops program to encourage local \npolice agencies to hire former military personnel who are honorably \ndischarged from military service or who are displaced by base closings.\n\n  The bill makes additional improvements to the COPS program by \nincluding safeguards to ensure that our money is being spent wisely. \nFor example, it will allow the COPS Office to do more than simply \nrevoke or suspend a grant if a recipient fails to comply with its \nterms. The COPS Office, at the direction of the Attorney General, would \nbe able to take any enforcement action available to the Department of \nJustice, such as civil penalties or recoupment of funds.\n  In addition to strengthening law enforcement's ability to prevent and \nfight crime, the COPS Improvement Act directly creates jobs and helps \nlocal governments cope with the economic downturn without jeopardizing \ncommunity safety. Furthermore, by hiring more officers we will be \nbetter able to combat the crime that harms our economy by driving \nbusiness opportunities out of distressed neighborhoods, taking with \nthem economic opportunity.\n  The COPS Improvement Act of 2011 would authorize $900 million per \nyear over six years for the COPS program. It would allocate $500 \nmillion per year for the hiring officers, $150 million for community \nprosecutors, and $250 million per year for technology grants.\n  To be sure, some will argue that $900 million is too large a price \ntag. But it is hard to put a price tag on the security of our \ncommunities. Investing money in such a successful program with such an \nimportant goal is certainly worth the cost. We must also remember that \npreventing crime from occurring saves taxpayers from the costs \nassociated with victim assistance and incarceration. For that reason, a \nrecent report by the Brookings Institution found ``COPS . . . to be one \nof the most cost-effective options available for fighting crime.''\n  It is difficult to overstate the importance of passing the COPS \nImprovement Act. Because of the success of the program and the need for \na renewed commitment to it, the bill has long had the support of every \nmajor law enforcement group in the Nation, including the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the National Sheriffs Association, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Organizations, the National Organization of Black \nLaw Enforcement Officials, the International Union of Police \nAssociations, and the Fraternal Order of Police. These law enforcement \nofficers put their lives on the line every day to make our communities \na safe place to live, and they deserve our full support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 207\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe 100 percent exclusion for gain on certain small business stock; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for years I have worked to encourage \ninvestment in small businesses. We all realize that small businesses \nare the backbone of our economy. As the economy continues to recover, \nwe must help small businesses have access to capital.\n  Many of our most successful corporations started as small businesses, \nincluding AOL, Apple Computer, Compaq Computer, Datastream, Intel \nCorporation, and Sun Microsystems. As you can see from this partial \nlist, many of these companies played an integral role in making the \nInternet a reality.\n  Investing in small businesses is essential to strengthening our \neconomy. Not only will investment in small businesses spur job \ncreation, it will lead to new technological breakthroughs. We are at an \nintegral juncture in developing clean energy technology. I believe that \nsmall businesses will repeat the role it played at, the vanguard of the \ncomputer revolution--by leading the Nation in developing the \ntechnologies which result in clean energy. Small businesses already are \nat the forefront of these industries, and we need to do everything we \ncan to encourage investment in these small businesses.\n  Today, Senator Snowe and I are introducing legislation to extend the \nzero capital gains rate on certain small business stock and the \nexception from minimum tax preference treatment through 2012. During \nthe past two Congresses, Senator Snowe and I introduced legislation \nwhich would make permanent changes to the 50 percent exclusion for gain \non small business stock.\n  Back in 1993, I worked with Senator Bumpers to enact legislation to \nprovide a 50 percent exclusion for gain for individuals from the sale \nof certain small business stock that is held for 5 years. Since the \nenactment of this provision, the capital gains rate has been lowered \nwithout any changes to the exclusion. Due to the lower capital rates, \nthe 50 percent exclusion no longer provided a strong incentive for \ninvestment in small businesses.\n  Our efforts to improve this provision have been successful. The \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act temporarily increased the \nexclusion to 75 percent. The Small Business Jobs Act\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\nof 2010 temporarily increased the exclusion to 100 percent and the \nalternative minimum tax, AMT, preference item for gain excluded under \nthis provision would be temporarily eliminated. These provisions were \nfurther extended through 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance \nReauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The legislation that I \nam introducing would extend these provisions through 2012.\n  Extending the zero capital gains rate on small business stock through \n2012 would put this provision on equal footing with the extension of \nthe lower capital gains rate included in the Tax Relief, Unemployment \nInsurance, Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.\n  I believe that the additional improvements should still be made to \nthe exclusion for small business stock and I will continue to work on \nthis issue. As Congress begins its work on tax reform, encouraging \ninvestment in small businesses should be a goal of tax reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support an extension of the zero capital \ngains rate and I look forward to working on tax reform which encourages \njob creation and investment in small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/26/senate-section/article/S290-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S290-S291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 26--RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC \nEARTHQUAKE IN HAITI ON JANUARY 12, 2010, HONORING THOSE WHO LOST THEIR \nLIVES IN THAT EARTHQUAKE, AND EXPRESSING CONTINUED SOLIDARITY WITH THE \n                             HAITIAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mr. Casey, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Corker, Mr. \nMenendez, Mr. Rubio, and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 26\n\n       Whereas on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 on \n     the Richter scale struck the country of Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Geological Survey, \n     the epicenter of the earthquake was located approximately 15 \n     miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Geological Survey, \n     the earthquake was followed by 59 aftershocks of magnitude \n     4.5 on the Richter scale or greater, with the most severe \n     measuring a magnitude of 6.0 on the Richter scale;\n       Whereas, according to the Government of Haiti, more than \n     230,000 people died as a result of the earthquake, including \n     103 citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas an untold number of international aid personnel \n     also died as a result of the earthquake, including more than \n     100 United Nations personnel;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations and the \n     International Organization for Migration--\n       (1) an estimated 3,000,000 people, or nearly \\1/3\\ of the \n     population of Haiti, have been directly affected by the \n     disaster; and\n       (2) an estimated 1,300,000 people were displaced from their \n     homes to settlements;\n       Whereas casualty numbers and infrastructure damage, \n     including damage to roads, ports, hospitals, and residential \n     dwellings, place the earthquake as the worst cataclysm to hit \n     Haiti in more than 200 years and, proportionally, as one of \n     the worst natural disasters in the world in modern times;\n       Whereas the Post Disaster Needs Assessment, which was \n     conducted by the Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the \n     World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and other \n     experts, estimates that damage and economic losses totaled \n     $7,800,000,000, which is equal to approximately 120 percent \n     of the gross domestic product of Haiti in 2009;\n       Whereas the Post Disaster Needs Assessment estimates that \n     $11,500,000,000 is needed during the next 3 years for the \n     reconstruction of Haiti and to lay the groundwork for long-\n     term development;\n       Whereas Haiti was the poorest, least developed country in \n     the Western Hemisphere before the January 2010 earthquake, \n     when--\n       (1) more than 70 percent of Haitians lived on less than $2 \n     per day; and\n       (2) Haiti was ranked of 149th out of 182 countries on the \n     United Nations Human Development Index;\n       Whereas, before the earthquake, Haiti was in the process of \n     recovering from a catastrophic series of hurricanes and \n     tropical storms, food shortages, rising commodity prices, and \n     political instability, but was showing encouraging signs of \n     improvement;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama vowed the ``unwavering \n     support'' of the United States and pledged a ``swift, \n     coordinated and aggressive effort to save lives and support \n     the recovery in Haiti'';\n       Whereas Senate Resolution 392, which was agreed to on \n     January 21, 2010, by unanimous consent--\n       (1) expressed the profound sympathy and unwavering support \n     of the Senate for the people of Haiti; and\n       (2) urged all nations to commit to assisting the people of \n     Haiti with their long-term needs;\n       Whereas the response to the tragedy from the global \n     community, and especially from the countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere, has been overwhelmingly positive;\n       Whereas the initial emergency response of the men and women \n     of the United States Government, led by the United States \n     Agency for International Development and United States \n     Southern Command, was swift and resolute;\n       Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic \n     organizations throughout the United States and the \n     international community responded to the crisis by supporting \n     Haiti and its people through innovative ways, such as \n     fundraising through text messaging;\n       Whereas more than $2,700,000,000 is estimated to have been \n     raised from private donations in response to the tragedy in \n     Haiti;\n       Whereas the Haitian diaspora community in the United \n     States, which was integral to emergency relief efforts--\n       (1) has annually contributed significant monetary support \n     to Haiti through remittances; and\n       (2) continues to seek opportunities to partner with the \n     United States Agency for International Development and other \n     Federal agencies to rebuild Haiti;\n       Whereas Haiti continues to suffer from extreme poverty, \n     gross inequality, a deficit of political leadership at all \n     levels, and weak or corrupt state institutions;\n       Whereas significant long-term challenges remain as Haiti \n     works to recover and rebuild;\n       Whereas the International Organization for Migration \n     estimates that approximately 800,000 people remain in \n     spontaneous and organized camps in Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to numerous nongovernmental \n     organizations and United States contractors, the pace of \n     reconstruction in Haiti has lagged significantly behind the \n     original emergency relief phase;\n       Whereas there is an acute need--\n       (1) to increase local capacity in health care and \n     education; and\n       (2) to focus international attention on employment \n     opportunities, rubble removal, permanent and sustainable \n     shelter, reconstruction of roads, safety and security, and \n     fundamental human rights in Haiti, especially in temporary \n     camps and shelters;\n       Whereas the alleged irregularities and fraud that occurred \n     in the election held in Haiti on November 28, 2010, have \n     imperiled the credibility of the electoral process, \n     undermined the recovery effort, and further destabilized \n     security throughout Haiti;\n       Whereas political leadership is required to ensure that a \n     democratically elected government, which is respected by the \n     people of Haiti and recognized by the international \n     community, is prepared to assume office on February 7, 2011, \n     or shortly thereafter;\n       Whereas, on October 19, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was \n     detected in the lower Artibonite region of Haiti;\n       Whereas initial efforts to contain the epidemic were \n     disrupted by Hurricane Tomas and resulting widespread \n     flooding, which led to the spreading and entrenchment of the \n     disease throughout Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health \n     and Population, between the outbreak in October 2010 and \n     January 21, 2011--\n       (1) more than 3,850 people have died from cholera in Haiti; \n     and\n       (2) more than 194,000 people in Haiti have been affected by \n     the disease;\n       Whereas, according to the Pan American Health Organization \n     and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cholera \n     could spread to as many as 400,000 people within the first \n     year of the epidemic, potentially causing 8,000 deaths at the \n     current case fatality rate;\n       Whereas the United States has provided $40,000,000 worth of \n     assistance to combat the cholera epidemic, primarily through \n     the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, to assist with \n     stockpiling health commodities, equipping cholera treatments \n     centers, providing public information, and developing a safe \n     and sustainable water and sanitation system;\n       Whereas the efforts to combat the cholera epidemic have \n     helped to drive the mortality rate from cholera down from 7 \n     percent to 1 percent of all contracted cases during the 3-\n     month period ending on January 21, 2011;\n       Whereas, during the first year following the January 12, \n     2010 earthquake in Haiti, the people of Haiti have \n     demonstrated unwavering resilience, dignity, and courage;\n       Whereas at the conference of international donors entitled \n     ``Towards a New Future for Haiti'', which was held on March \n     31, 2010, 59 donors pledged approximately $5,570,000,000 \n     (including nearly $1,200,000,000 pledged by donors from the \n     United States) to support the Action Plan for National \n     Recovery and Development of the Government of Haiti;\n       Whereas the United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for \n     Haiti estimates that approximately 63 percent of the recovery \n     and development funds pledged for 2010 have been disbursed; \n     and\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\n       Whereas Haiti requires sustained assistance from the United \n     States and the international community in order to confront \n     the ongoing cholera epidemic and promote reconstruction and \n     development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors those who lost their lives as a result of the \n     tragic earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010;\n       (2) honors the sacrifices of the men and women of the \n     Government of Haiti, the Government of the United States, the \n     United Nations, and the international community in their \n     responses to those affected by the earthquake;\n       (3) expresses continued solidarity with the people of Haiti \n     as they work to rebuild their neighborhoods, livelihoods, and \n     country;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment of the Senate to support the \n     long-term reconstruction of Haiti, in partnership with the \n     Government of Haiti and in coordination with other donors;\n       (5) supports the efforts of the Executive Branch to prevent \n     the spread of cholera, treat persons who contract the \n     disease, provide technical assistance to the Haitian Ministry \n     of Public Health, and improve long-term water, sanitation, \n     and health systems;\n       (6) expresses support for the United States Embassy team in \n     Port-au-Prince, members of the United States Coast Guard, \n     United States Armed Forces, other United States Government \n     personnel, and all members of international organizations who \n     have persevered through adverse local conditions and continue \n     to serve Haiti and the Haitian people;\n       (7) supports the continued effort of the Interim Haiti \n     Recovery Commission, under the leadership of former President \n     Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Bellerive, in its efforts to \n     improve coordination, build state capacity, and bring donors \n     and the Government of Haiti together to effectively lead the \n     reconstruction process;\n       (8) urges the international community--\n       (A) to call on the leaders of Haiti to immediately reach a \n     democratic resolution to the current electoral crisis to \n     enable the newly elected leaders of the Government of Haiti \n     to take office by February 7, 2011, or shortly thereafter;\n       (B) to continue to focus assistance on the priorities of \n     the Government of Haiti;\n       (C) to develop, improve, and scale-up communications and \n     participatory mechanisms to more substantially involve \n     Haitian civil society at all stages of the cholera and post-\n     earthquake responses;
