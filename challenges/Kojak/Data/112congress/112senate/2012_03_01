Mr. President, too often cooperation is in short supply \nhere in the Senate, so I was pleased when we began consideration of a \ntruly bipartisan jobs bill.\n  As I have said here a number of times in the past week or so, if \nthere were ever a bipartisan bill, this is it. Progressive Barbara \nBoxer, conservative Jim Inhofe--they have agreed on a way to move \nforward on a bill that will save 1.8 million jobs and create about 1 \nmillion more jobs. So this would put millions of people to work right \naway.\n  Although our economy has gained momentum, there are still millions of \nAmericans out of work, so it should be obvious why we can't afford to \ndelay efforts to rebuild our roadways, our railways, and our bridges.\n  Almost 1,000 organizations, including business groups and labor \nunions that rarely see eye to eye on anything, support this commonsense \nmeasure. More than 30 of those groups, including the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and the American Automobile Association, AAA, have asked \nSenators to refrain from offering unrelated, ideological amendments to \nthis bill. As I said, almost 1,000 organizations want this done.\n  Here is what the U.S. Chamber and AAA wrote recently:\n\n       The organizations that we represent may hold diverse views \n     on social, energy, and fiscal issues, but we are united in \n     our desire to see immediate action on the Senate's bipartisan \n     highway and transit reauthorization measures.\n\n  We started on this piece of legislation on February 7. It is the \nfirst day of March now. These groups don't agree on much, but they do \nagree this legislation is too important to be bogged down with \npolitical amendments, so they spoke as one.\n  There was a time when this kind of cooperation was the standard in \nthe Senate. There was a time when two Senators who had little in common \ncould still share common purpose. There was a time when groups of \nSenators divided by political party could still be united in their \ndesire to pass worthy legislation.\n  One Senator who has always exemplified that willingness to set aside \nphilosophical and political differences and work together is my friend, \nthe senior\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\nSenator from Maine, Olympia Snowe. I have always appreciated Senator \nSnowe's ability to look at every side of an issue with a practical eye \nand not a political eye. Her courage, common sense, and moderation will \nbe missed here in the Senate.\n  Over the last 15 years, I have had the pleasure of working many times \nwith Senator Snowe on an issue now at the forefront of this debate, \nboth across the Nation and on the Senate floor. Beginning in 1997, we \nworked together to increase women's access to contraception and to make \nsure insurance companies treated contraceptives the same as other \nprescription medications. There are plenty of things on which Senator \nSnowe and I disagree, lots of things, but by finding common ground, we \nimproved women's health and reduced unintended pregnancies--something \nwe should all agree on--and there is no question that it was \naccomplished by what we did legislatively. Unfortunately, the \nbipartisan progress Senator Snowe and I made over the years is now \nunder attack.\n\n  Today the Senate will vote on an extreme ideological amendment to the \nbipartisan Transportation bill. This amendment takes aim at women's \naccess to health care. It will allow any employer or insurer to deny \ncoverage for virtually any treatment for virtually any reason. I \nrepeat: It will allow any employer or insurer to deny coverage for \nvirtually any treatment for virtually any reason. I was pleased to hear \nthat Senator Snowe intends to oppose this measure. I read that last \nnight.\n  Although the amendment was designed to restrict women's access to \ncontraception, it would also limit all Americans' access to essential \nhealth care. Here are just a few of the lifesaving treatments employers \ncould deny if this amendment passes. This is hard to comprehend, but \nhere is what some of them would be: mammograms and other cancer \nscreenings, prenatal care, flu shots, diabetes screenings, childhood \nvaccinations.\n  To make matters worse, Republicans held up progress on an important \njobs bill to extract this political vote. As the economy is finally \nmoving forward a little bit, Republicans have tried to force Congress \nto take its foot off the gas. Every Member of this body knows the Blunt \namendment has nothing to do with highways or bridges or trains or train \ntracks. This amendment has no place on a transportation bill, but with \n2 million jobs at stake, the Senate cannot afford to delay progress on \na job-creating measure any longer, so Democrats have agreed to vote on \nSenator Blunt's amendment so we can hopefully move on. Once the Senate \ndisposes of this partisan political amendment, I hope we will be able \nto resume in earnest bipartisan work on a transportation bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1160-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1160-S1162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have spent a lot of time in my Senate \ncareer defending the first amendment. Most of that time, I focused on \nthe part that deals with free speech. But recent actions by the Obama \nadministration related to the President's health care law have prompted \nmany of us here and many across the country to stand in defense of \nanother freedom that is covered in the first amendment; that is, \nreligious freedom.\n  Let me say at the outset that most of us didn't expect we would ever \nhave to defend this right in a body in which every one of us is sworn \nto uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution. Most of us probably assumed \nthat if religious liberty were ever seriously challenged in this \ncountry, we could always expect a robust, bipartisan defense of it--at \nleast from within the Congress itself. But, unfortunately, that is not \nthe situation in which we find ourselves.\n  Democrats have evidently decided they would rather defend a President \nof their own party regardless of the impact of his policies. So rather \nthan defend the first amendment in this particular case, they have \ndecided to engage in a campaign of distraction as a way of obscuring \nthe larger issue which is at stake.\n  If Democrats no longer see the value in defending the first amendment \nbecause they don't think it is politically expedient to do so or \nbecause they want to protect the President, then Republicans will have \nto do it for them. And we are happy to do that because this is an issue \nthat is greater than any short-term political gain; it gets right at \nthe heart of who we are as a people, and we welcome the opportunity to \naffirm what this country is all about.\n  What makes America unique in the world is the fact that it was \nestablished on the basis of an idea, the idea that all of us have been \nendowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights--in other words, \nrights that are conferred not by a King or a President or certainly a \nCongress but by the Creator Himself. The State protects these rights, \nbut it does not grant them, and what the State doesn't grant, the State \ncan't take away.\n  The first of these rights, according to the men who wrote the U.S. \nConstitution, is the right to have one's religious beliefs protected \nfrom government interference. The first amendment couldn't be clearer \non this point. The government can neither establish religion nor can it \nprevent its free exercise. And if the free-exercise-of-religion clause \nof the first amendment means anything at all, it means it is not within \nthe power of the Federal Government to tell anybody what to believe or \nto punish them for practicing those beliefs. Yet that is precisely what \nthe Obama administration is trying to do through the President's health \ncare law.\n  We all remember then-Speaker Pelosi saying that we would have to pass \nthe health care bill to find out what was in it. Well, this is one of \nthe things we found: It empowers bureaucrats here in Washington to \ndecide which tenets religious institutions can and can't adhere to. If \nthey don't get in line, they will be penalized.\n  According to congressional testimony delivered this week by Asma \nUddin of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, this is not only \nunprecedented in Federal law but broader in scope and narrower in its \nexemption than the 28 State mandates that some have pointed to in the \nadministration's defense.\n  Moreover, even in States with the strictest mandates, religious \ninstitutions can still either opt out of State-level mandate or self-\ninsure. But if they try that now, they run into this new Federal \nmandate, making it impossible for the first time for religious \ninstitutions to avoid punishment for practicing what they preach.\n  Some of the proponents of this mandate say that in this case, we \nshould just ignore the first amendment. That is what the proponents are \nsaying--in this particular instance, just ignore the first amendment. \nThey say that certain religious beliefs in question aren't particularly \npopular, so they don't really deserve first amendment protection. But \nisn't that the entire point of the first amendment--to protect rights \nregardless of who or how many people hold them? Isn't that the reason \npeople came to this country in the first place, as a refuge from \ngovernments that said they had to toe the majority line?\n  Some of the proponents of this mandate have also said they are \nwilling to offer a so-called compromise that would respect what they \ncall the core mission of religious institutions. But here is the catch: \nThey want to be the ones to tell these religious institutions what \ntheir core mission is. The government telling the religious institution \nwhat the core mission is--that isn't a compromise; that is another \ngovernment takeover, only this time it isn't the banks or the car \ncompanies, it is religion.\n  Who do you think has a better grasp of the mission of the Catholic \nchurch, the cardinal archbishop of New York or the President's campaign \nmanager? Who are you going to listen to on the question of whether this \nmandate violates freedom of religion, the president of one of the \nlargest seminaries on the planet, R. Albert Mohler, or some bureaucrat \nin Washington? The question answers itself.\n  Look, this is precisely the kind of thing the Founders feared. It was \nprecisely because of the danger of a government intrusion into \nreligion, like this one, that they left us the first amendment in the \nfirst place, so that we could always point to it and say: No \ngovernment--no government, no President has that right. Religious \ninstitutions are free to decide what they believe. And the government \nmust respect their right to do so.\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\n  And remember: as many of us said during the debate on the President's \nhealth care bill, this is just the beginning. If the government is \nallowed to compel people to buy health care, it won't stop there. Now, \nit is telling people what their religious beliefs are and what their \nreligious practices ought to be. I wonder What is next?\n  Let's be clear: this is not about any one particular religion.\n  It is about the right of Americans of any religion to live out their \nfaith without the government picking and choosing which doctrines they \nare allowed to follow. When one religion is threatened, all religions \nare threatened. And allowing this particular infringement would surely \nease the way for others.\n  This is something my constituents understood immediately in this \ndebate.\n  I have received a lot of letters from religious leaders and concerned \ncitizens who know that an attack on the beliefs of one religion is an \nattack on the beliefs of any religion. And many of them make the case a \nlot better than I can. So I'd like to just share for a moment some \nthoughts from my constituents on this issue.\n  I will start with the Catholic Archbishop of Louisville, Archbishop \nJoseph Kurtz. Here's what he wrote:\n\n       The federal government, which claims to be ``of, by, and \n     for the people,'' has just dealt a heavy blow to almost a \n     quarter of those people--the Catholic population--and to the \n     millions more who are served by the Catholic faithful. In so \n     ruling, the Administration has cast aside the First Amendment \n     to the Constitution of the United States, denying to \n     Catholics our nation's first and most fundamental freedom, \n     that of religious liberty. We cannot--we will not--comply \n     with this unjust law. People of faith cannot be made second \n     class citizens.\n\n  Here's Bishop Ronald Gainer of the Catholic Diocese of Lexington:\n\n       Civil law and civil structures should recognize and protect \n     the Church's right and obligation to participate in society \n     without expecting us or forcing us to abandon or compromise \n     our fundamental moral convictions. If we have an obligation \n     to teach and give witness to the moral values that should \n     shape our lives and inspire our society, then there is a \n     corresponding obligation that we be allowed to follow and \n     express freely those religious values. Anything short of \n     government protection of that freedom represents an \n     unwarranted threat of government interference. . . .\n\n  Here is the President of the University of the Cumberlands, Jim \nTaylor:\n\n       The intrusion of the administration into the right of the \n     free exercise of religion is disappointing. The choice to \n     interfere with religious hospitals, charities and schools \n     with a mandate violating their religious views is \n     disconcerting and will, in all probability, be totally \n     counterproductive, further polarizing this nation.\n\n  And, finally, I want to read a letter from Dr. R. Albert Mohler, Jr. \nI mentioned him earlier. He is the President of the Southern Baptist \nTheological Seminary, the flagship school of the Southern Baptist \nConvention and one of the largest seminaries in the world. I am going \nto quote it in full.\n\n       I write to express my deepest concern regarding the recent \n     policy announced by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services that will require religious institutions to provide \n     mandated contraceptive and abortifacient services to \n     employees.\n       This policy, announced by Secretary Sebelius, tramples upon \n     the religious liberty of American Christians, who are now \n     informed that our colleges, schools, hospitals, and other \n     service organizations must violate conscience in order to \n     comply with the Affordable Care Act. The religious exemption \n     announced by the Obama Administration is so intentionally \n     narrow that it will cover only congregations and religious \n     institutions that employ and serve only members of our own \n     faiths.\n       This exemption deliberately excludes Christian institutions \n     that have served this nation and its people through \n     education, social services, and heath care. The new policy \n     effectively tells Christian institutions that, if we want to \n     remain true to our convictions and consciences, we will have \n     to cease serving the public. This is a policy that will \n     either require millions upon millions of Americans to accept \n     a gross and deliberate violation of religious liberty, or to \n     accept the total secularization of all education and social \n     services.\n       Christians of conscience are now informed by our own \n     government that we must violate our convictions on a matter \n     of grave theological and moral significance. This is not a \n     Catholic issue. The inclusion of abortifacient forms of birth \n     control such as so-called emergency contraceptives will \n     violate the deepest beliefs of millions upon millions of \n     Christians, along with Americans of other faiths who share \n     these convictions. The religious objections to this policy \n     are rooted in centuries of teaching, belief, and moral \n     instruction.\n       This policy is an outrage that violates our deepest \n     constitutional principles and tramples religious liberty \n     under the feet of deliberate government policy. As many \n     religious leaders have already indicated, we cannot comply \n     with this policy. The one-year extension offered by the Obama \n     Administration is a further insult, providing a year in which \n     we are, by government mandate, to prepare to sacrifice our \n     religious liberties and violate conscience.\n       I, along with millions of other Americans, humbly request \n     that the Congress of the United States provide an immediate \n     and effective remedy to this intolerable violation of \n     religious liberty. Please do not allow this abominable policy \n     to stand. The protection of our most basic and fundamental \n     liberties now rests in your hands.\n\n  I will conclude with this: if there is one good thing about this \ndebate, it is that it has given all of us an opportunity to reaffirm \nwhat we believe as Americans. It gives us an opportunity to stand \ntogether and to say, this is what we are all about. This is what makes \nAmerica unique, and this is what makes it great.\n  That is why I will be voting in favor of the Blunt amendment.\n  And that is why it is my sincere hope that the President and those in \nhis administration come around to this view too--that they come to \nrealize from the outpouring we have seen over the past several weeks \nfrom across the country that the free and diverse exercise of religion \nin this country has always been one of our nation's greatest assets and \none of the things that truly sets us apart. As I said at the outset of \nthis debate, I hope the President reconsiders this deeply misguided \npolicy and reverses it. It crosses a dangerous line. It must be \nreversed. But if he doesn't, either Congress or the courts will surely \nact.\n\n\n                        STORM DAMAGE IN KENTUCKY\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about another matter related \nto my own State. We have had severe storms and tornadoes that cut \nthrough parts of the Midwest yesterday, including in my home State of \nKentucky. People across the Bluegrass State are still recovering this \nmorning from the considerable damage caused by the severe weather.\n  The National Weather Service has confirmed 4 tornadoes struck in \nKentucky with winds of up to 125 miles per hour. These funnel clouds \nwere sighted in Elizabethtown, eastern Grayson County, Larue County, \nand near downtown Hodgenville, which is home to the Abraham Lincoln \nBirthplace National Historic Park.\n  In all, the National Weather Service has confirmed at least 16 \ntornadoes across the country through seven States--Nebraska, Kansas, \nMissouri, Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, and Kentucky. Over 300 reports \nof severe weather across the region describe frightening details such \nas wind gusts of over 80 miles per hour, and golf-ball sized hail \nstones.\n  There were reports of power outages for thousands of people across \nKentucky, particularly in my hometown of Louisville, the towns of \nElizabethtown and Paducah, and in Muhlenberg and Grayson counties. \nDowned power lines and flash flooding were reported across the State.\n  News reports and accounts from my own staff tell me that there has \nbeen considerable damage across Kentucky, including dozens of homes and \nbusinesses damaged and several people injured. Two people in McCracken \nCounty near Paducah were rescued from an overturned mobile home and \nrushed to the hospital in critical condition. From what we know at this \npoint, however, thankfully it appears no lives were lost in Kentucky.\n  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said elsewhere, as the severe \nweather that raged through 6 other States has reportedly claimed at \nleast 12 lives. I join my colleagues from the affected States in \nkeeping in my thoughts today all those affected by these storms, \nespecially the families of those lost in these tragic and unforeseeable \ncircumstances.\n  I also want to extend my gratitude to the first responders in \nKentucky and across the entire Midwest who have risen to the occasion \nand provided the much-needed response and relief. Let me particularly \nthank the Kentucky National Guard, who is there to assist, as always, \nwhen disaster strikes.\n  Authorities are warning us that the threat from severe weather is not \nover.

Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 90 minutes equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong, passionate support of \nthe Blunt amendment. It is a very important amendment which we will be \nvoting on as an entire Senate at 11 a.m. this morning.\n  The Blunt amendment is an absolutely necessary measure to fix what is \na very egregious overstepping of the bounds of government in terms of \nthe newly articulated ObamaCare mandate on religion. As we all know \nthrough the debate and discussion of the last several weeks, the Obama \nadministration has made it clear that everyone, including persons of \nfaith, including religious institutions, are not only going to be \nforced to buy a product in the marketplace--and many of us think that \nitself is unprecedented and unconstitutional--but it gets worse because \nthey will be forced to buy a product in the marketplace that violates \ntheir conscience, that violates their core beliefs.\n  Catholics and many other Christians, many people of faith, do not \nbelieve in certain activity and treatment that is mandated now to be \ncovered by this mandatory insurance. That is crossing a line we have \nnever before crossed in this country, in terms of government power, \ngovernment mandates, and government intrusion into the conscience of \nothers and to the free exercise of religion. We absolutely need to fix \nthis.\n  This is a fundamental conscience issue. This is a freedom of religion \nissue. That is exactly why it is so important.\n  Let me also clarify, this is not merely about contraception. Folks on \nthe other side of the debate and most of the media constantly put it \nmerely in those terms. First of all, those measures in and of \nthemselves violate the conscience of many Americans. But, second, it is \nnot just about that, it is about abortion, it is about abortion-\ninducing drugs such as Plan B, it is about sterilization. Clearly, the \ngovernment mandating Americans to buy, to pay for, to subsidize these \nmeasures violates the conscience of tens and tens of millions of \nAmericans. That is why we must act, hopefully today, starting today, by \npassing the Blunt amendment.\n  The arguments made on the other side, when we look at them carefully, \ndo not hold water. First of all, there is President Obama's so-called \naccommodation, so-called compromise, which is not an accommodation and \nis not a meaningful compromise at all. What did he say? He said: OK. We \nare not going to make Americans, persons of faith, religious \ninstitutions buy coverage they have moral qualms with. We are merely \ngoing to make the insurance provider provide that coverage whether the \ncustomer wants it or not. Well, that is a completely superficial and \ncompletely meaningless word game. The insurer is providing this how? \nWhat payment is supporting it? The only payment the insurer is getting \nis from a customer who objects to the coverage. So who is supporting \nit? Who is paying for it? Clearly this is a word game. If it weren't \nclear enough for the typical person or institution involved, what about \ninstitutions--and there are many of them--which are self-insured? What \nabout the University of Notre Dame, Catholic University, or Catholic \ninstitutions? They don't go to an insurance company to buy insurance; \nthey are self-insured. That word game doesn't even work on the surface \nthere. Those cases number in the hundreds or thousands around the \ncountry, and that is a clear example of how that so-called compromise \nor accommodation is merely a sleight of hand and a word game.\n\n  Another argument which the other side has made in this debate is that \nsomehow correcting this situation through the Blunt amendment or \nthrough similar measures will shut down access to these services. That \nis patently not true. These services, these medicines, and other \ntreatments are widely available in every community across the country \nat little cost or no cost for folks who cannot afford it, and that is \nnot going to change. It is absolutely not necessary to tear away \nreligious liberty and violate conscience rights of millions of \nAmericans with that argument in mind. It isn't true.\n  That is why respected religious leaders, such as Cardinal-designate \nTimothy Dolan, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, \nhas argued strenuously and passionately against this mandate. Cardinal-\ndesignate Dolan said:\n\n       Never before has the Federal Government forced individuals \n     and organizations to go out into the marketplace and buy a \n     product that violates their conscience. This shouldn't happen \n     in a land where free exercise of religion ranks first in the \n     Bill of Rights.\n\n  And so that is what it comes down to, free exercise of religion and \nfundamental conscience protection. The first amendment to the \nConstitution, the first item in the Bill of Rights, it doesn't get much \nheadier or more significant than that, and that is what this is all \nabout. Again, it is all about, yes, contraception, but abortion, \nabortion-inducing pills like Plan B, and sterilization.\n  Mr. President, please assure me that the free exercise of religion is \nnot now a partisan issue. Please assure me that we are going to correct \nthis situation and not allow this egregious overstepping of the bounds \nof the power of government. We must act to stop this grave injustice, \nand I hope we start that process in a very serious way today by voting \npositively and passing the Blunt amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are engaged in the business of the \nSenate, and it is not always discernible that it is the business of the \npeople. What we see taking place these days is a principle mantra of \nRepublicans on the campaign trail seeking more freedom for the American \npeople. The Republicans like to say they ``don't want government \ninterfering in people's lives.'' Then I ask: Why the devil are we \ndebating a Republican amendment that limits a woman's freedom to make \nher own health care choices? With women, the Republicans have a \ndifferent idea about freedom. They want government to interfere in the \nmost personal aspects of women's lives.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri, the Blunt \namendment, will allow a woman's employer to deny coverage for any \nmedical service that they, the employer, have a moral problem with. \nImagine that. Your boss is going to decide whether you are acting \nmorally. The Republicans want to take us forward to the Dark Ages again \nwhen women were property that they could easily control and even trade \nif they wanted to. It is appalling that we are having this debate in \nthe 21st century.\n  Yesterday we heard something astounding. It came from Rush Limbaugh, \nwho is a prime voice of modern conservatism in this country. Yesterday \nhe said--and I had it checked because I wanted to be sure that I am not \nmisquoting anything--that a woman who wants affordable birth control is \n``a prostitute.'' Talking\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nabout your wife, your sister, your daughter, your child. This is \nhateful, ugly language, and we condemn it. Republicans like to talk \nabout the Constitution and freedom, but once again, when it comes to \nwomen, they don't get rights, they get restrictions. This foul \namendment before us tells women that you cannot be trusted to make your \nown health care decisions. Your employer may judge if your actions are \nmoral. More than 20 million women in America--including more than \n600,000 in my home State of New Jersey--could lose access to health \ncare services they need under this scheme.\n  The Republican attack on women is not just happening here in \nCongress, it is happening on the Presidential campaign trail. I show \nyou here what one of the two leading Republican Presidential candidates \nhas to say about birth control:\n\n       I'm not a believer in birth control . . . I don't think it \n     works. I think it's harmful to women. I think it's harmful to \n     our society . . .\n\n  That is the kind of judgment they want to put in employers' hands? It \nis outrageous. Imagine that in a Presidential contest, dismissing the \nkinds of things that millions and millions of women rely upon to \nprotect their health, to keep them from unwanted pregnancies, to keep \nthem from disease, to keep them from all kinds of things that can make \nlife difficult.\n  Women of America, former Senator Santorum and Republicans here almost \nrequire a tap on the head: Don't worry. We know what is best for you.\n  I want to be clear: Rick Santorum does not have a physician's \ntraining. He is a politician. And when we look at polls across the \ncountry, we see what the people in our society are thinking about \npoliticians these days. It is time for Senator Santorum and his fellow \nRepublicans to mind their business. Let's get on with the needs of the \ncountry and put people back to work, give them health care, and let \nthem have an education. No, we are going to spend time here keeping \npeople from going to work. There are thousands of jobs that are at \nstake on the legislation that is in front of us.\n\n  I have five daughters and eight granddaughters and the one thing that \nI worry about for them, more than anything else, is their health. I \nwant to know when I see those little kids--the youngest of my \ngrandchildren--I like to see their happy faces; I like to see them \nfeeling good. And if one of my daughters or my son says so-and-so has a \ncold and this one fell and broke something, that is my worry for the \nday. That is the way it is. So I want them to have doctors making \ndecisions, not some employer who has a self-righteous moral view that \nhe wants to impose on my daughters, my granddaughters, or my wife. No, \nI don't want Republican politicians making decisions about my family's \nhealth care or yours or even those who are on the other side.\n  On our side of the aisle, we believe that women are capable of making \ntheir own health care decisions, and that is why President Obama is \ntrying hard to make contraception more affordable because he knows it \nis basic health care for women and almost all women of age have used \nbirth control at some point in their lives, and yet many have to \nstruggle to pay for it. We ought to applaud President Obama for trying \nto make it more affordable. He believes they are capable of making \ntheir own decision. He wants them to be healthy. His proposal respects \nthe rights of religious organizations that don't wish to provide birth \ncontrol to their employees. Under the President's plan, women who work \nfor religious organizations don't have to go through their employer to \nget affordable contraception. These women will be able to get it \ndirectly from their insurance company, and I think it is a reasonable \ncompromise. But some of our Republican colleagues refuse to recognize \nthis.\n  Listen to what the other side is saying. You don't hear the \nRepublicans talking about empowering women or giving them more \nopportunities. No, the GOP agenda is about denying benefits, \nrestricting access, and taking away options.\n  We weren't sent here to intrude in the lives of fellow citizens or to \ndrag women back to the Dark Ages. We were sent here to offer people \noptions, not obstacles. So I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment, hold your head high and say to your family, your daughter, \nyour wife, your sister, your mother: We want you to be healthy. That is \nour prime issue in life. I ask that my colleagues turn down this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, very shortly we will be voting on the \namendment filed by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Blunt--the \nRespect for Rights of Conscience Act. I am a cosponsor of this \namendment, and I think we all ought to be cosponsors of it. Many of my \ncolleagues have supported it as well, and for good reason. It provides \nstatutory protection for one of our deepest constitutional \ncommitments--the right to free exercise of religion. It is an effort to \nfulfill our oath to protect and defend the Constitution. It is an \neffort to put the enduring constitutional rights of the American people \nfirst, over any fleeting and controversial political interests.\n  In my view, those who support this amendment have been unjustly \ncriticized over the past few days, and they have been unjustly \ncriticized on a political basis, not really on an intellectual basis. \nUnable to win this debate through a fair criticism of the amendment, it \nhas been mischaracterized and misrepresented.\n  Opponents are desperate to distract the public from one simple fact: \nThis amendment is necessary because of ObamaCare, the health care law \nthat manifests new threats to personal liberty and individual rights \nwith each passing week. It is an indictment of the President's \nsignature domestic achievement and all of those who support it.\n  ObamaCare took over and regulated the Nation's health care sector--\none-sixth of the American economy. It stripped individuals and \nemployers of their right to go without coverage and the right to \ndetermine what type of coverage they would have.\n  ObamaCare is what has brought us here today. The health care law \nrequires that women's preventive services, including sterilization and \naccess to abortion-inducing drugs, be included in health care coverage \nbeginning in 2012. This is a questionable policy in and of itself. Like \nthe rest of ObamaCare, it assumes the government is able to provide all \ngood things to the American people through a simple mandate with no \nconsequences for cost or access.\n  The problems with this mandate were compounded, however, when the \nadministration, deferring to its feminist allies, determined that the \nmandate would apply to religious citizens and institutions. To their \ncredit, these institutions, which are compelled by this regulation to \nviolate their moral beliefs, announced that they would not comply with \nthis unjust law. They refused to roll over and allow the government to \nforce them to provide sterilizations and abortion-inducing drugs to \ntheir employees. They stood as a witness for constitutional liberty, \nthe free exercise of religion, and against an administration that put \nbasic partisan politics above our beloved Constitution.\n  The President's self-proclaimed compromise does absolutely nothing to \nminimize the constitutional problems with this mandate. The Department \nof Health and Human Services never--never--consulted with the \nDepartment of Justice about the constitutionality of this mandate, and \nit shows. That is why we are here today: to undo just some of the \ndamage to our liberty and our Constitution wrought by ObamaCare.\n  All of the misleading arguments regarding this amendment run square \nto one simple fact: ObamaCare only became law in 2010. There was no \nFederal mandate for these services prior to 2010, and the regulations \nhave not yet gone into effect. In other words, nobody is taking \nanything away from anybody. But to hear the other side talk, one would \nthink the cosponsors of this amendment and the groups who support it \nare committed to a monstrous deprivation of women's rights. With due \nrespect, that is absolute hogwash.\n  I appreciate that the advocates of ObamaCare might be embarrassed by \nthis episode, but we are not going to\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\nlet them get away with a gross misrepresentation of what we are trying \nto do here.\n  Prior to 2010 and the partisan passage of ObamaCare, access to \ncontraceptives was abundant and nobody advocated that the Federal \nGovernment involve itself in those personal, moral decisions. After \n2010, access to contraceptives remained abundant, with nobody \nadvocating for restrictions on their access.\n  Here is what changed in the meantime. In 2010, ObamaCare mandated \nthat health coverage include sterilizations, abortion-inducing drugs, \nand contraceptive coverage. As a result, religious institutions and \npersons will now be compelled by the State to violate their \nconscience--compelled by the Federal Government to violate their \nconscience. It isn't just the Catholic Church; it is many churches that \nfeel just the same way as the Catholic Church does. It is a moral and \nreligious issue that should not be interfered with by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Prior to 2010 and the passage of ObamaCare, the first amendment was \nintact. Today, the first amendment is in tatters. The Democrats who \npassed this law know this to be true, so they have to distract and \nconfuse. They claim Senator Blunt's amendment is overbroad. They claim \nreligious institutions and individuals would deny critical health \nservices, such as blood transfusions and psychiatric care. The Senate \nDemocratic steering committee claims 20.4 million women who are now \nreceiving coverage for preventive services would lose that coverage \nunder this amendment. Absolutely none of this is accurate.\n  Again, all this amendment does is restore the pre-ObamaCare status \nquo. All it does is restore the religious liberties and constitutional \nfreedoms that existed prior to this government takeover of our Nation's \nhealth care system. It restores the conscience protections that existed \nfor all Americans for the past 220 years.\n  If this amendment passes, here are a few things that do not change: \nState mandates for health coverage will remain in place. Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, preventing discrimination on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment benefits \nremains in place. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act, requiring health \nplans to cover pregnancy, childbirth, and related conditions remains in \nplace. The Americans With Disabilities Act prohibiting s discriminatory \nwithholding of health care and other benefits for people with HIV or \nother disabilities remains in place. And the Mental Health Parity Act \nof 2008 requiring equitable coverage of mental illness remains in \nplace.\n  Prior to ObamaCare, very few people excluded any of the services that \nDemocrats are pointing at in their efforts to scare the American \npeople, and few will do so should the Blunt amendment pass. But our \nConstitution demands that those individuals and institutions that \nobject to providing these services on religious and moral grounds be \nprotected. That is what the Constitution demands.\n  Even though the individuals and institutions protected by the Blunt \namendment are a minority, it is that minority that our first amendment \nexists to protect. The rule agreed to by President Obama would force \nreligious organizations to violate their moral convictions. This cannot \nbe allowed to stand.\n\n  I call on my colleagues on the other side to wake up and realize what \nthey are doing. There is only so much politics that should be played \naround here, and this is an issue we should not be playing politics \nwith. It involves religious freedom and liberty.\n  There was a time when a regulation of this sort would not have been \ncountenanced by this body, let alone some of the arguments that have \nbeen made on the other side--trying to obscure and to make a political \nissue out of this.\n  I have had the good fortune of representing the people of Utah for \nmany years. It has been an honor for me. In that time, I have seen many \ngood people on both sides of the aisle serve well in the Senate. One \nthing we could always be sure of was that when it came to our first \namendment freedoms--in particular, the freedom to practice one's \nreligion without interference from the State--Republicans and Democrats \nwould join together in the defense of religious rights and liberty. Why \nare we not joining together? Yet under this administration, our Bill of \nRights has been subordinated to President Obama's desire to micromanage \nthe Nation's health care system.\n  It was not always this way. When the Senate considered President \nClinton's health care law--itself an attempt at a sweeping takover of \nthe Nation's health care system--giants such as Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, a Democrat and colleague who served as the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, stood up for broad conscience protections such as \nthe one we are considering today in the Blunt amendment.\n  I worked closely with many of my Democratic colleagues in passing the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act. I was the author of that bill. We \npassed it. It overwhelmingly passed. I was there when President Clinton \nsigned it into law. A lot of religious leaders were there and a lot of \nliberals and conservatives were there who were very happy to pass that \nlaw. But, apparently, those days of bipartisanship are laid to rest, \nand they are long past.\n  Today the administration ignores the clear dictates of the first \namendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n  ObamaCare is unconstitutional to its core. It threatens the liberties \nannounced and protected by our Declaration of Independence. This \nmandate is just one more example of how the law restricts personal \nliberty. It will force religious persons and institutions to violate \ntheir beliefs or pay a fine.\n  Defending this disaster at a townhall meeting recently, one \nDemocratic Member of the House of Representatives told her constituents \nthat they were ``not looking to the Constitution'' when they supported \nthis mandate. No kidding. Our Founding Fathers fought a revolution to \nprevent this type of tyranny; and that is what this is. This is \ntyranny. It is the political bullying of a religious group with--in the \nviews of the President's allies--unpopular religious beliefs. So for \npolitical reasons the religious groups who differ with this are being \npushed around. The media, polite society, and the administration are \npicking on religious freedom and on religious people.\n  Democrats like to claim they stand for the little guy. Not in this \ncase. In this case, the little guy is being pushed around by the State. \nI, for one, am not going to stand for it. This is discrimination \nmasquerading as compassion, and I am going to fight it. My oath of \noffice, an oath to protect the Constitution, compels me to do this.\n  I am putting the administration on notice: I am not done with you, \nand my colleagues are not done with you. Whatever happens with this \nvote today, you are going to be held to account for your actions. We \nare going to get to the bottom of how this happened and, ultimately, I \nam confident that justice will prevail.\n  Ultimately, I am confident justice will prevail.\n  I commend my colleague from Missouri and all of the Members who have \nspoken out for this amendment. It is reasonable. It is just. I urge all \nof my colleagues to vote for it.\n  The American people understand this amendment is necessary because of \nObamaCare, and they know who is responsible for this monstrosity. I \nexpect they will look favorably on those who stand up for the first \namendment today and attempt to correct their folly by restoring the \nconscience protections that preexisted ObamaCare. The reaction to those \nwho stand by this historic deprivation of first amendment rights? Only \ntime is going to tell.\n  Let me close by saying there are very few things that get me worked \nup as much as I am about this. I feel very deeply about a lot of \nthings, but the first amendment, to me, means everything. I have heard \nthe President say, well, we will just require the insurance companies \nto provide this. Give me a break. A lot of Catholic institutions are \nself-insured, and that is true of other churches as well.\n  Religious beliefs are important. The first amendment is important. \nThe free exercise of religion is important. That is what is involved \nhere.\n  My gosh, to hear these arguments that this is all about \ncontraception--that is not what it is about. It is about the right of \npeople with religious beliefs to practice their religion, unmolested by \ngovernment.\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\n  I want to commend the distinguished Senator from Missouri. It takes \nguts to stand up on these issues when they are so distorted by some on \nthe other side. I would be ashamed to make some of the arguments that \nwere made on this issue. The Catholic Church, which is the largest \ncongregation in our country, is not going to abide by this mandate. And \nI am 100 percent with them.\n  When we start going down this road, let me tell you, beware, because \nthat is when tyranny begins. The religious commitments of our Nation \nhave made it the greatest Nation in the world. I have to tell you, \nthose of you who vote against this amendment are playing with fire. \nThose of you who vote against this amendment are ignoring the \nConstitution. Those of you who vote against this amendment are wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want to, since he is on the floor, \nrecognize the Senator from Utah and his extraordinary service in the \nU.S. Senate. We do not agree on this issue, but he has done a \ntremendous job for the people of Utah over many years.\n  I rise to talk a little bit about the amendment we are considering \nthat would allow all employers and insurers to deny coverage, \nparticularly for women, on any health care procedure or service they \nobject to--not the women, but the employers and the insurance \ncompanies--on moral or religious grounds.\n  The first thing I want to do--and I have not been around here a long \ntime, but I want to first observe in what context we are discussing and \ndebating this amendment. We have devoted extensive floor time on this \namendment about contraception and the lack of coverage for women's \nhealth care in the context of a job-creation bill, in the context of \nthe Transportation bill. This is the bill I hold in my hand. This is \nthe bill that is on the floor of the U.S. Senate right now. The title \nsays:\n\n       A bill (S. 1813) to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and \n     highway safety construction programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  I would have thought those ``other purposes'' would be related to \ntransportation, transit, to job creation in the United States. I do not \nthink the ``other purposes'' that are talked about in this bill have \nanything to do with contraception or women's health. But that is what \nwe are spending our time debating this week on the floor of the Senate, \ninstead of passing this Transportation bill and putting people in this \ncountry back to work. How is this conversation relevant to job creation \nor to infrastructure? It is not.\n  In my home State of Colorado, I have held hundreds of townhall \nmeetings in red parts of the State and blue parts of the State, and I \ndo not remember a single time this issue--the issue that is of concern \nwith this amendment--has been raised by anybody--by anybody--in 3 \nyears.\n  I can tell you what people are talking about in Colorado. They want \nto know why we are not spending our time working on how to create more \njobs for them, more jobs in the 21st century in this country or how to \nfix this Nation's debt or deficit or how we pass a bipartisan \nTransportation bill that creates immediate jobs and fixes a crumbling \ninfrastructure, while maintaining the infrastructure assets our parents \nand grandparents had the thoughtfulness to build for us--another case \nwhere political games are risking our ability to provide more \nopportunity, not less, for the next generation of Americans, something \nevery single generation, until this one at least--the politicians--has \ntreated as a sacred trust. Instead, over the last several weeks, we \nhave continued to debate about women and whether they should have \naccess to the health care services they need, and whether they should \nbe the ones who are able to make the decisions about the health care \nservices they need. And we sit here and wonder why the U.S. Congress is \nstuck at an approval rating of 11 percent. Maybe it is because we are \ntalking about contraception in the context of a Transportation bill.\n  I have a wife and three daughters--12, 11, and 7. There are a lot of \nwomen in my life telling me what to do every minute of every day and \nduring the week, and thank goodness for that. One thing I know is they \ndo not need to be told by the government how to make their own health \ncare decisions--nor do the 362,000 Colorado women who would be affected \nimmediately if this amendment passed.\n  This amendment is written so broadly that it would allow any employer \nto deny any health service to any American for virtually any reason--\nnot just for religious objections. Women could lose coverage for \nmammograms, prenatal care, flu shots, to name only a few essential \nservices, and, yes--and yes--the right to make decisions around \ncontraception and their own reproductive health.\n  My State, the great State of Colorado, is a third Democratic, a third \nRepublican, and a third Independent. I can tell you, the last time \nthere was an initiative on the ballot in my State to let the government \nintervene in women's health care decisions, it was defeated by 70 \npercent of the voters. Seventy percent of the voters said: You know \nwhat. We would rather leave these decisions to women to make for \nthemselves. That is what my daughters want as well.\n  People are speaking loudly and clearly on this issue all across the \ncountry. These are not the issues we should be debating right now. We \nneed to be having the conversations people are having at home in my \ntownhalls instead of distracting them with politics: How do we create \nmore jobs? How do we reform our entitlements so Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security are here for our grandchildren and for our children? \nHow do we create an education system that is training our people for \nthe 21st century? How do we assure poor children in this country that \nthey can have a quality education and make a contribution to this \neconomy?\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and help us get back \non the road to passing a bipartisan Transportation bill that will \ncreate new jobs and make substantial improvements in our economy and \ninfrastructure. There is a time to debate this, but that time is not \nnow when we are having this infrastructure discussion, we are having \nthis transportation discussion.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rights of women all across this \ncountry and their families and reject this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the reason this amendment is being debated \nright now is because the administration issued an order that is \nunprecedented. It is unprecedented because the mandate provisions of \nthe health care bill are also unprecedented. That is the reason we are \ndebating this now. The administration brought this up. I am still \namazed by the fact that the administration would not have excluded all \nof at least the faith-based institutions from their order.\n  The Catholic hospitals, the Baptist universities, the Catholic \nschools of all kinds, the Christian schools of all kinds, the Muslim \ndaycare centers--why would they not have exempted these people? They \nsay: We exempted the church itself, as if the work of the church or the \ncharacter of the church or the faith distinctives of the church, the \nsynagogue, the mosque are only what happens inside that building.\n  There is a reason we have so much of our health care, our social \nservices provided by faith-based institutions, and one of the reasons \nis those faith-based institutions want those institutions--that they \nfund, they support, they encourage--to reflect their faith principles. \nWhat is wrong with that?\n  There are a couple of issues here. One is the separation in the \nPresident's mind of the work of the church or the synagogue or the \nmosque from the building itself. It is impossible to separate those two \nthings; otherwise, you have another high school that has a chaplain, \nyou do not have a Christian high school or you have another hospital \nthat is run by the Sisters of Mercy, you do not have a Catholic \nhospital, because you have decided you are going to define the \ncharacter of what that hospital stands for and what they provide.\n  The administration recently took a Lutheran school to court. The EEOC \ntook a Lutheran school to court and asserted that school did not have \nany special constitutional protections as to how they hired people, and \nyou could have heard all these same kinds of arguments: Well, they will \ndiscriminate\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\nagainst people; they will not hire people who otherwise should be \nhired; they will not make accessibility to the handicapped. You could \nhear all of that sort of thing, none of which would have been true, and \nthe Supreme Court voted 9 0 that the administration was wrong.\n  You can try all you want to separate these two issues, but they do \nnot separate. They are both fundamental first amendment issues.\n  Let's talk about some of the things I have heard here this morning. \nMy good friend, Senator Bennet from Colorado, said if this amendment \npassed, 362,000 Colorado women would lose their current health care \nservices. Why would that be the case at all? This amendment does \nnothing to modify State or Federal laws that are now in effect. If you \nhave those services now, there is nothing in this amendment that would \nchange the world we live in right now. People have the same protection \ntoday to exert their religious views in their health care policies that \nthey provide as an employer that they would have if this amendment \npassed. They have those protections now. They would not lose those \nrights.\n  It does not modify any State or Federal law. And there are plenty of \nFederal laws. There is a Federal law on pregnancy discrimination that \nsays pregnancy-related benefits cannot be limited to married employees. \nThat law does not go away if this amendment passes. State laws that \nrequire things to be in health care policies, if you have one, do not \ngo away if this amendment passes. It only amends the new mandate \nprovisions of title I of the new health care law, the health care law \nthat has received so much controversial attention, for good reason. And \nthis is one of those reasons.\n  Supplying respect for religious beliefs and moral convictions is \nalready part of Federal health programs of all kinds, it just does not \nhappen to be in the new law. There is no health care law since 1973 \nthat does not have these provisions in this bill that are part of the \nlaw. The law is there now, and the world does not change. No Colorado \nwoman will lose any health care benefits they have today if this \namendment passes. No New Jersey woman will lose any benefits they have \ntoday if this amendment passes.\n  Regarding any health care service people may be worried about, we \nasked one question: Are people allowed to exclude this service from \ntheir health care benefit under current State or Federal law? If they \nare not allowed to exclude it under current State or Federal law, they \nwould not be allowed to exclude it if this amendment passes. If they \nare not allowed to exclude it, they are still not allowed to exclude it \nunder this amendment. And if they are allowed to exclude such service, \nwhy haven't the critics been protesting before? This amendment does not \nchange anything in the law today. So why haven't we heard these \nspeeches before about how the law does not protect employers from \ndeciding not to offer this or not to offer that? In fact, this makes it \nmuch more difficult to exclude services than it is now.\n  In fact, it allows for an actuarial equivalent to have to be added to \na policy if you take something away. That means there is no financial \nreason--there is no financial reason--to exclude a service because if \nyou exclude a service because you believe it is the wrong thing, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services has the power to say: You have \nto come back and include a new service of equal value that we did not \nrequire.\n  I assume everybody on the other side of this debate would think that \nemployers must be motivated to exclude these services if they are not \nlegitimate religious beliefs and moral conviction; that they must \nexclude them because they would save some money. We do not allow them \nto save money. So there is no reason. The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices can say: OK. You can exclude that, but you have to include \nsomething we did not require something of equal value. That means \nsomething that is going to be equally used. That means something that \nis going to be equally costly to the employer.\n  Why would the employer do that? I mean, why are we not hearing all \nthese stories now about how--why did the 200,000 women who have these \nhealth services today--I think it is 20 million--why do they have those \nservices? There is nothing in the law that requires it. This law does \nnot change the laws today.\n  From the point of view of having a political discussion instead of a \ndiscussion about what the amendment does or why it is consistent with \nwhat we have always done, I think the other side has done a great job \nof that. But consistently we have protected this principle of first \namendment freedoms. In fact, in 1994, in the bill Mrs. Clinton, the \nFirst Lady at the time, worked so hard for, that was introduced by \nSenator Moynihan--here is what it said. This was the bill that also \nwould require people to provide insurance. You know we do not have much \nabout insurance because we have not required people to provide it \nbefore. There are some Federal health benefits about insurance I may \ntalk about in a minute that also are protected.\n  But this was a bill that required people to provide insurance, and \nSenator Moynihan said about his bill in 1994, less than 20 years ago, \n``Nothing in this title shall be construed to prevent any employer from \ncontributing to the purchase of a standard benefits package which \nexcludes coverage for abortion and other services if the employer \nobjects to such service on the basis of religious belief or moral \nconviction.''\n  The most amazing aspect of this whole debate, to me, is that in 20 \nyears, this has gone from language that would be in what was considered \nthe most progressive, liberal health care bill that had ever been \noffered, by one of the most respected Senators by Americans of all \npolitical philosophies but most agreed with by Americans of the more \nliberal political philosophy, that he would just put that in the bill--\nI have asked: Is there any indication in the debate on that bill that \nthis was a big item? The answer I hear is: No, it was not a big item \nbecause it was part of who we are. It was part of what we had been as a \nnation. It was part of protecting the first amendment.\n  This amendment does not mention any procedure because I do not know \nwhat kind of--and nobody knows what might be, at some future date, \noffensive to somebody's religious beliefs, but they have no financial \nreason to not provide a service. So the only reason they would have \nunder this amendment would be a true moral objection.\n  I had some initial hesitation myself. I said: OK. I understand the \nfaith-based institutions. I used to be the president of a Christian \nuniversity and so I understand why it is important those institutions \nkeep their faith-based distinctions. But what about other employers? \nFrankly, I did not have to think about that very long to realize that \nif someone is of a faith that believes something is absolutely wrong, \nas an employer why would they want to pay for that? They believe this \nis a wrong thing to do. Why would they want to pay for that?\n  The language of equivalency in this bill means, if they choose not to \npay for that, the Secretary can say: OK. Come up with something else \nthat would be equally used and equally valuable that they would pay \nfor. So there is no financial reason not to do it. The only reason not \nto do it is they truly believe it is a wrong thing to do.\n  Surely, every person in the Senate has at least one thing that \nbecause of religious reasons they believe is wrong to do. Do they want \nto be forced by the government to be a participant in that wrong thing? \nThe things we are talking about, in my particular faith, I am not \nopposed to all these things the President said he would require. But \nthat does not mean I should be any less concerned about people who \nlegitimately, week after week at their place of worship, express this \nto be something that they would not participate in.\n  If the congregants want to go on their own and figure out how to \nparticipate, that is one thing. If they want to go on their own and \nprovide insurance to their employees that include these things that \nthey heard at church are wrong to do, that is another thing. But if \nthey want to say, look, I am not going to do that--but under the new \nmandate, we do not do anything that eliminates the mandate. There is \nstill a mandate--under the new mandate, I am not going to do that, but \nI am going to have to add something to the policy to the mandate that \nwould be of equal financial value, of equivalent value.\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\n  So the only reason to object is they believe it is wrong, and that \nwhat the first amendment is all about. That is why, consistently, \nthrough employment law we have protected--even though the \nadministration lost a 9-to-0 case trying to interpret that the same way \nthey want to interpret this--the government knows best. If we are \nallowed to, we will abuse the hiring situation. Now they say if we are \nallowed to, we will abuse the health care providing situation.\n  I think we have taken away the financial incentive to do that. I \nbelieve what this does is protect first amendment rights. The first \nfreedom in the founding documents is freedom of religion, and we have \nprotected it over and over and over again. Every Member of this Senate \nwho has been here in any recent time, except the very newest Members, \nhave voted for bills that had this language in them, whether it was the \nClinton administration, whether it was the Moynihan proposal, whether \nit was the Patients' Bill of Rights or the religious freedom law. It \nwas all there.\n  I think it is--to come up with all these cases that they would not \ntreat prenatal care, might not treat cancer--why would they not do \nthat? Why would they not do that? If they do not treat that, they have \nto pay for something else of equal value. Look at the very last \nprovision of this amendment.\n  So there is no financial reason not to do this. The only reason is \nthat they believe it is against their religious views. The phrase we \nuse in this bill is exactly the phrase Senator Moynihan used, it is \nexactly the phrase Frank Church used, it is exactly the phrase people \non the floor at this moment voted for when they said we do not want \npeople to have to participate in capital punishment or prosecuting \ncrimes where capital punishment is a possibility because of religious \nbelief or moral conviction.\n\n  It was good enough for everything up until now, including this \nprinciple, until we get to 2012. Suddenly, we have all these reasons \npeople cannot make faith decisions that relate to providing health care \nto employees. I disagree with that.\n  I think the first amendment protects that. I believe if and when--if \nthis rule goes forward, it will go to the Supreme Court. It will be \nsomething close to that 9-to-0 decision on hiring rights. There is no \ndifference in the principle. Again, I would say, look at the last \nsection of this bill if one believes employers are going to do this to \nsave money.\n  Otherwise, what motivation do they have, besides the moral conviction \nand religious belief that is protected by the first amendment? I hope \nmy colleagues will read this amendment carefully, will understand that \nprotection currently in the law is taken away by this amendment. If one \nhas a right now, one would still have it if this amendment passed. To \nargue otherwise denies the facts of both people who have coverage today \nand 220-plus years of constitutional protections in the country.\n  Read the bill. It may not change any minds today. But this issue will \nnot go away unless the administration decides to take it away by giving \npeople of faith these first amendment protections.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to join this debate. I certainly \nrespect the Senator from Missouri for his views and for his own \ninterpretation of what he thinks his amendment does. But I could not \ndisagree more on what the amendment says, what the amendment will do, \nand what the process has been for us to get to this point.\n  We are down here, and I know my own office, myself, my focus is on \nour economy and getting our country moving again and focusing on jobs. \nSo when I see a transportation bill that is now mired in this debate, I \nask myself: How much more time are we going to waste debating and \nredebating an issue we have been debating?\n  I know some people think this is an important debate related to \ntransportation. But it seems as if the other side of the aisle, in all \nthe discussions we have been having for the last year about jobs, about \nappropriations bills, about the debt ceiling, about moving forward on \nreconciliation all come down to one thing: Let's get rid of \nreproductive health care for women.\n  In February of last year, they introduced a bill, H.R. 1. They said, \nlet's defund Planned Parenthood. Then, later in April, came a big \nmoment of are we going to move forward with the continuing resolution. \nIt was all brought to a halt until we could have a vote on defunding \nPlanned Parenthood. Then we had another vote on it.\n  In the latest discussions about the payroll deal, there were \ndiscussions about whether a rider was going to be in there that cut \nwomen's reproductive health care access and appropriations bills, just \nlast December, same issue. Every step of the way it seems as if there \nis an assault on women's reproductive choice and having access to \nhealth care.\n  I know my colleague from Missouri thinks this issue might just be \nabout something the administration has done in the health care bill, \nbut his party is making everybody in America believe we cannot get our \neconomy going and balance our budget and deal with our deficit unless \nwe defund women's health care choices. Nothing could be more incorrect \nabout that logic.\n  We are holding up the business of America just for these votes on \nbasically curtailing rights to access that women already have. It is so \nfrustrating to think we would be going backward on this. I applaud the \nchair of the Transportation Committee because she has worked hard on \nthis legislation. It is 30,000 jobs in the State of Washington by the \nDepartment of Transportation estimate.\n  I know it is going to help save about 1.8 million jobs and create \nanother million jobs on a national basis. So I certainly want to get to \nthe job at hand. When I think about the 435,000 Washington women who \nwould be affected by the Blunt amendment, by curtailing their access to \nhealth care, and while some people think it is about contraceptives, \nwhich it is about that, but it is also about breast cancer screening--\nand we have one of the highest rates of breast cancer in the country, \nso we want to make sure we get these screenings done--about wellness \nexams, about diabetes screening, about flu shots, about vaccinations, \nabout mammograms, about cholesterol, we are having this debate instead \nof talking about transportation infrastructure, about defunding these \nvital programs. The reason why I say this is so important to us and so \nimportant to us in Washington State is because we have been having this \ndebate, we have been having this debate since almost 2001, 2002, on the \nBartell drug decision.\n  So my colleague who says: These businesses would not dare do anything \nbased on costs under my amendment, I think all he has to do is look at \nthe Federal cases that were brought against major employers such as \nWalmart, such as Bartell, such as Daimler-Chrysler, and other \norganizations that were not providing full reproductive choice for \nwomen and discriminating against them in their health care benefits.\n  A Federal law, a Federal statute was used to say these practices were \ndiscriminatory. So the same debate we are having today has played out \nin State after State--in our State, the Bartell drug decision. In that \ndecision, the courts found we cannot use these principles to \ndiscriminate. It is a violation of the civil rights clause.\n  While I know my colleague thinks this is a new debate, it is not a \nnew debate. It is a debate that has been had in America among States, \nand courts have used Federal statutes to protect the rights of women. \nNow I see we are going to have this debate today. I ask my colleagues, \nhow many more times this year are we going to interrupt the business of \nthe Congress on things such as transportation, on infrastructure, to \nhave a debate that has already been settled?\n  I know my colleague thinks the amendment is very narrowly written; it \nis not.\n  It is not. I don't think that is the interpretation of any legal \nmind, that it is narrowly written. It will affect and give employers \nthe right--the courts have already said they don't have the right to \ndiscriminate. It will reopen the cases of those large employers that \nhave already been found against and say to them: Yes, you can come up \nwith a reason and curtail access to preventive health care for women \nthat is so needed at this time.\n  I ask my colleagues to turn down this amendment, and let's get at the\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\nbusiness at hand, focusing on our economy and jobs, and stop making \nwomen's health care a scapegoat for what you think is wrong with \nAmerica. It is actually what is right with America. Let's focus on \njobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have always been a very strong \nproponent of family planning programs and of measures to promote and \nprotect women's health. Like many Americans, however, I was very \nconcerned in January when the Department of Health and Human Services \nissued a final regulation to require religious universities, hospitals, \ncharities, and other faith-based organizations to pay for health \ninsurance that covers contraceptives and sterilizations regardless of \nthe organization's religious beliefs. I believe such a mandate poses a \nthreat to our religious freedom and presents the Catholic Church and \nother faith-based organizations with an impossible choice between \nviolating their religious beliefs or violating Federal regulations.\n  In February President Obama announced what he termed an \n``accommodation'' that would require insurance companies, rather than \nreligious organizations, to provide these services. But as I read the \ndetails of that ``accommodation,'' it became very clear to me that many \nparts of the plan remained unclear. A key issue, for example, revolves \naround self-insured religious-based organizations. There are many \nCatholic hospitals and universities that are self-insured and thus act \nas both the employer and the insurer, and a very important issue is how \nthe rule would treat these self-insured faith-based organizations. But \nthe rule was totally unclear. It simply said that the ``Departments \nintend to develop policies to achieve the same goals for self-insured \ngroup health plans sponsored by non-exempted, non-profit religious \norganizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage.''\n  In an attempt to clarify this critical issue, I sent a letter to \nSecretary Sebelius asking for specific clarification on how faith-based \norganizations that are self-insured and thus act as both the insurer \nand the employer would have their rights of conscience protected. This \nwas not a complicated question. It was a very straightforward question, \nand frankly, the answer to the question was going to determine my vote \non this very important amendment.\n  Sadly, the administration once again skirted the answer. In her \nresponse, Secretary Sebelius simply said the President ``is committed \nto rulemaking to ensure access to these important preventive services \nin fully insured and self-insured group health plans while further \naccommodating religious organizations' beliefs.''\n  What does that mean, Mr. President?\n  I ask unanimous consent that both my letter to Secretary Sebelius and \nher reply be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this was very frustrating to me. I asked \na key question, and I could not get a straight answer. It also \ndemonstrates many of the problems associated with employer mandates.\n  I believe the sponsor of this amendment is completely sincere. I want \nto make that clear. But this issue has become yet another sad example \nof election-year politics. I believe a good compromise could have been \nreached and should have been worked out. For example, in Maine, State \nlaw requiring contraception coverage includes a specific exemption for \nreligious employers, such as churches, schools, and hospitals. Surely \nwe could have reached a similar accommodation. Unfortunately, what we \nare left with is another example of the political pandering that has so \ntested Americans' patience.\n  Since I could not and did not receive a straightforward answer to my \nquestion about protecting self-insured faith-based organizations, I \nfeel that I have to vote for Senator Blunt's amendment, with the hope \nthat its scope will be further narrowed and refined as the legislative \nprocess proceeds.\n  Critics of the Blunt amendment have charged that employers could use \nit as an excuse to deny coverage for services simply as a means to \nreduce their insurance costs. As Senator Blunt, however, has pointed \nout, the amendment includes specific language to require that the \noverall cost of the coverage remains the same even though an employer \nexcludes certain services because of their religious beliefs. As a \nconsequence, under this amendment, employers would have no incentive to \nexclude coverage of items or services simply because of financial \nconsiderations.\n  Mr. President, while I plan to support the amendment, I do so with \nserious reservations because I think the amendment does have its flaws. \nBut when the administration cannot even assure me that self-insured \nfaith-based organizations' religious freedoms are protected, I feel I \nhave no choice.\n  I hope that the Senate will now be able to move forward to address \nthe many important and pressing issues facing our Nation such as job \ncreation, energy and rebuilding our nation's infrastructure.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2012.\n     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Sebelius: Like many Americans, I was very \n     concerned when, on January 20, 2012, the Department of Health \n     and Human Services issued a final regulation to require \n     religious universities, hospitals, charities and other faith-\n     based organizations to pay for health insurance that covers \n     contraceptives and sterilizations regardless of the \n     organization's religious objections. I believe that such a \n     broad mandate poses a threat to our religious freedom and \n     presents the Catholic church and other faith-based \n     organizations with an impossible choice between violating \n     their religious beliefs or violating federal regulations.\n       I was somewhat reassured when, on February 10, the \n     President announced an ``accommodation'' that would require \n     insurance companies rather than religious organizations to \n     provide these services. According to the White House \n     statement, ``religious organizations will not have to provide \n     contraceptive coverage or refer their employees to \n     organizations that provide contraception,'' and ``religious \n     organizations will not be required to subsidize the cost of \n     contraception.''\n       While the President has announced some changes in how the \n     new preventive coverage mandate will be administered, many of \n     the details remain unclear. A very important issue is how the \n     rule would treat self-insured faith-based institutions. For \n     example, there are many Catholic hospitals that are self-\n     insured, and therefore act as both the employer and the \n     insurer. The final rule simply states that the ``Departments \n     intend to develop policies to achieve the same goals for \n     self-insured group health plans sponsored by non-exempted, \n     non-profit religious organizations with religious objections \n     to contraceptive coverage.''\n       I would therefore like further specific clarification of \n     how self-insured faith-based organizations will be treated \n     under the rule to ensure that their rights of conscience are \n     protected.\n       Thank you for your prompt assistance on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Susan M. Collins,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     the August 2011 Guidelines on Women's Preventive Services. On \n     February 15, 2012, related final rules were published \n     exempting group health plans sponsored by certain religious \n     employers (and any associated group health insurance \n     coverage) from any requirement to cover contraceptive \n     services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act \n     and corresponding provisions in the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code, and \n     related guidance.\n       As you know, in August 2011, the Health Resources and \n     Services Administration (HRSA) published Guidelines that \n     operate to require non-grandfathered health plans to cover \n     certain preventive services for women, including Food and \n     Drug Administration-approved contraceptive services, without \n     charging a co-pay, co-insurance, or a deductible. HRSA based \n     the Guidelines on recommendations from the Institute of \n     Medicine, which relied on independent physicians, nurses, \n     scientists, and other experts, as well as evidence-based \n     research, to formulate its recommendations. Evidence shows \n     the use of contraceptives has significant health benefits for \n     women and their families, significantly reducing health costs \n     for women and society.\n       With the Departments of Labor and the Treasury, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services also published in \n     August\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\n     2011 an amendment to the July 2010 Preventive Services \n     Interim Final Rules authorizing an exemption for certain \n     religious employers' health plans from any requirement to \n     cover contraceptive services. Twenty-eight states already \n     require health insurance coverage to cover contraception, and \n     the exemption in the amendment to the Interim Final Rules was \n     modeled on one adopted by some of these states. After \n     considering the many comments received in response to the \n     amendment to the Interim Final Rules, the Departments \n     published final rules on February 15, 2012, retaining the \n     exemption.\n       At the same time, we released guidance providing a one-year \n     enforcement safe harbor for group health plans sponsored by \n     certain nonprofit employers that, for religious reasons, do \n     not provide contraceptive coverage and do not qualify for the \n     exemption (and any associated group health insurance \n     coverage). Such nonprofit employers could include religious \n     universities, hospitals, and charities.\n       In his recent announcement related to these issues, the \n     President committed to rulemaking to ensure access to these \n     important preventive services in fully insured and self-\n     insured group health plans while further accommodating \n     religious organizations' beliefs. We are engaging in a \n     collaborative process with affected stakeholders including \n     religiously affiliated employers, insurers, plan \n     administrators, faith-based organizations, and women's \n     organizations as we develop policies in this area. Our \n     preliminary discussions with a number of religiously \n     affiliated employers and faith based organizations have been \n     very productive. And, of course, the future rulemaking \n     process will afford a full opportunity for public input.\n       The Administration remains fully committed to its \n     partnerships with faith-based organizations to promote \n     healthy communities and serve the common good.\n       Again, thank you for your letter. I appreciate your input \n     on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kathleen Sebelius.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 5 minutes on the Blunt amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in Vermont and across this country, there \nis growing frustration that Members of Congress--mostly men, I should \nadd--are trying to roll back the clock on women's reproductive rights--\nin this case, the right of women to receive contraceptive services \nthrough their insurance plan. This attack is grossly unfair, and I hope \nmen will stand with women in the fight to protect this very basic \nright.\n  Let me add my strong belief that if the Senate had 83 women and 17 \nmen rather than 83 men and 17 women, a bill such as this would never \neven make it to the floor.\n  Two years ago Congress passed a health care reform bill that will \nexpand health care access for over 30 million Americans who are \nuninsured as well as millions of Americans who are covered through \ntheir employers. This bill is by no means perfect--I would go further--\nbut it is a step forward in allowing us to catch up with the rest of \nthe industrialized world that guarantees health care to all of their \npeople as a right.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment we are discussing today--Senator Blunt's \namendment--would undermine much of the progress being made for women's \nhealth care through a new version of a so-called conscience exemption. \nNot just content to attack women's rights, Mr. Blunt's amendment would \ngo even further and seeks to deny patients access to any essential \nhealth care service their employer or insurance company objects to \nbased simply on the employer's ``religious beliefs'' and ``moral \nconvictions.''\n  This amendment would especially have an adverse impact on women's \nhealth. Starting in August, women enrolled in new plans will have \naccess to a range of preventive services at no cost. But allowing the \nkind of extreme, so-called conscience clause included in the Blunt \namendment would allow an employer to refuse coverage of contraceptives, \nannual well-woman visits, or even treatments for both genders, such as \nmental health services or HIV/AIDS treatment, based not on a doctor's \nrecommendation but on the religious belief or moral conviction of a \nperson's employer. This is an absolutely unprecedented refusal right. \nThe Blunt amendment must be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n8 minutes on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is obviously a difficult time in our \npolitics--the polarization. It is a difficult time in the Senate, in \nparticular, because over the years this has been a place where we have \nprided ourselves on really working to find ways to avoid the kind of \npolarization we see today and actually to find the common denominator \non a number of sensitive issues.\n  I think our friend from Maine, Senator Snowe, spoke for many of us \nthis week when she talked about the ``my way or the highway'' \napproaches to partisan politics that have made it harder for people to \nwork with each other and actually get things done. I would never speak \nfor her, but I think given her diagnosis of what is wrong with the \nSenate today, she has made a decision not to run for reelection. I \nthink the amendment we are debating today, frankly, is exhibit A.\n  Two years ago many of us voted to end an era where many Americans \nfelt that women in particular but poor people and others also were put \ninto a position of a second-tier status with respect to access to \nhealth care in America. There were so many discrepancies. One example, \nfor instance, that was in error before the reform we passed was where \nViagra was covered for men, at no cost, by insurance companies but \ncontraception, which 99 percent of American women use, was not covered. \nSo we addressed this issue in the reform we passed, Congress sent it to \nthe President, and the President signed it.\n  The administration then took the time appropriate. Recognizing the \ndifficulty of implementing some of this, they allowed for a time period \nin order to be able to work through the rules. When they did come out \nwith the first rule, I regret that they came out with a rule that many \nof us felt--I felt and shared with others in America--a sense that it \nwas not going to work. There was a firestorm in the country over that \nfor a brief period of time. I spoke out in our caucus, and I said I \nthought there was a better way to try to deal with that that created a \nbalance between the first amendment requirements and the needs of \npeople to be able to have access and be protected. I didn't think it \nwas and I don't think today it is right to force a religiously \naffiliated institution to pay for contraception if it violates \nfundamental religious beliefs.\n  I am glad to say that the administration--the White House, which I \nthink perhaps hadn't been able to see all of the implications of what \nhad happened at that point in time--quickly moved to recognize that \nindeed the rule was not proposed as it ought to be, and they changed \nit. They responded. That was the right decision. This week, Secretary \nSebelius made it clear they are still working with the faith community \non a final rule that will address the concerns of my church and of \nother institutions which are self-insured.\n\n  But with all due respect to what the Senator from Maine, Senator \nCollins, said a few minutes ago, Secretary Sebelius said publicly, \nafter the Senate Finance Committee hearing on this subject on the \nbudget, whether it is an insured plan or self-insured plan, the \nemployer who has a religious objection doesn't have to directly offer \nor pay for contraception. So I take issue. I believe the letter the \nSenator received actually addresses this question and says they are \nworking with the community, as I believe they ought to, in order to \ncome up with a means of guaranteeing that self-insurance will be \nprotected, as I believe it ought to be protected.\n  But I don't believe we ought to embrace the Blunt amendment as this \nbroad-based opening of Pandora's box that carries with it all kinds of \nother risks and potential mischief. We don't have to do that in order \nto protect the self-insured here. I think it is important to work \ntogether with patience to try to find a way to do no harm, if you will, \nto the Constitution or to the rights of women in this country to access \nhealth care.\n  I believe in the spirit of the amendment that is in front of us \ntoday. I know the Senator from Missouri acts in good faith personally, \nand I respect that. But language is always important, critical in \nlegislating, and the language is overbroad. If there is one thing I \nknow after 27 years of legislating here, it is that when you are\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\nwriting legislation, it is critical to understand the implications of \nthe language you use. Precision matters. This amendment opens the \npotential for overly broad and vague exceptions that could allow \nchildren to be denied immunizations. It could allow a company--and a \ncompany is quite different from an individual's right to protection \nunder the Constitution--to actually object to mental health services. \nIt could allow for the denial of HIV screenings because people think \nsomehow that is a disease that belongs to a category they object to in \nterms of social life and structure in America. It would allow, \npotentially, the objection of maternity care for single mothers because \npeople have an objection to a single mother being pregnant and having a \nchild.\n  There is all kinds of mischief that could be implemented as a \nconsequence of people's assertion of a belief that is not in fact \ncovered under the first amendment but which, as a result of the \nlanguage in this amendment, could be swept into some claim, and I don't \nthink we should do that. That is not good legislating. That is \ndangerous.\n  I was interested to hear the minority leader this morning assert some \nthings about the first amendment. I think they are absolutely \nincorrect. The first amendment is a guarantee that religious liberty \nwill be protected in America and that government will not institute one \nreligion or another or establish a religion for the Nation. It also \nsays no religious view will be imposed on anybody. The Blunt amendment \nis, in fact, an assault on that protection of the first amendment \nbecause it imposes one view on a whole bunch of people who don't share \nthat view or on those who want to choose for themselves.\n  The Affordable Care Act and the President's compromise and the final \nrule leave all of the existing conscience clause provisions in place--\nit doesn't change them at all--while adding additional protection for \nchurches and for religious organizations. The administration's \ncompromise regulation, endorsed by the Catholic Hospital Association \nand other religious organizations, maintains conscience protections so \nthat any religious employer with objections to coverage of \ncontraceptive services will not be required to provide, refer, or pay \nfor these services. Furthermore, all churches and houses of worship are \nexempt from the compromise regulation.\n  In fact, as the Women's Law Center pointed out:\n\n       Under current law, individuals and entities who wish to \n     refuse a role in abortion services are protected by three \n     different federal laws, the Church Amendments (42 U.S.C. \n     Sec.  300a 7), the Coats Amendment (42 U.S.C. Sec.  238n), \n     and the Weldon Amendment, which is attached to the Labor-HHS \n     appropriations bill each year. The health care reform law \n     explicitly said it would not have any effect on these laws, \n     meaning these were the law of the land before the health care \n     reform law and continue to be the law now. So, the Blunt \n     Amendment doesn't ``restore'' these rights because they never \n     went away. What could the Blunt Amendment be about, then? \n     Before the health care reform law, refusals happened all the \n     time, and that was a big part of the problem that the health \n     care reform law was meant to address. People were refused \n     coverage for things like having had a C-section or being a \n     cancer survivor. Insurance plans refused to provide coverage \n     for services, like maternity care or mental health. But to \n     call the refusals that happened before health care reform a \n     ``conscience right'' is a mischaracterization. Refusals were \n     business as usual. They had very little, if anything, to do \n     with an individual's or insurance company's conscience. They \n     had to do with insurance companies refusing coverage for \n     things they didn't find profitable. And by granting a huge \n     loophole with its permission to refuse coverage based on \n     ``moral considerations'' the Blunt Amendment would take us \n     right back there, while hiding under the guise of \n     ``conscience rights.''\n\n  I have met with and had conversations with conscientious people in my \nChurch, because it is important to listen to help find answers to these \ndifficult questions. It has left me convinced that we don't have to \nsupport a back-door dismantling of health care rights to protect \nreligious liberty. The administration's dialogue with the faith \ncommunity to reach a final accord that protects patients, including \nwomen, and also protects religious liberty is a far better outcome than \nto have the Senate rush to undercut that effort and pass something that \nis overly broad, risking dangerous unintended consequences.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would be a mistake--for women, for \nhealth care, for millions of Americans who don't want to go back to the \ndays when they could be denied care for any reason. We don't need to \ndrive another wedge in our politics. We need to drive towards that \ncommon denominator, that common ground--and that is why this amendment \nmust be defeated.\n  I would simply close by saying the Senate should not rush to undercut \nthe protections already in place and which, ultimately, would undermine \nthe teachings of my church, which argues that social conscience and \nvalues ought to be primarily established by caring for our sick, and \nthis would in fact deny that, to some degree.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address Senator Blunt's \namendment to the surface transportation bill, which deals with the \nObama Administration's recent proposal to require group and individual \nhealth insurance plans, with the exception of those issued to churches \nor other houses of worship, to cover contraceptive care for all women.\n  I believe the administration's proposal is inadequate, but I will not \nsupport the Blunt Amendment because I believe it is too broad. I want \nto discuss how this amendment came before the Senate and then I will \nlay out the reasons why I will vote against it and offer a different \nway forward.\n  The question before us deals with one of the most controversial \nmatters raised by the Affordable Care Act--which is finding a balance \nbetween requiring health insurance plans to cover a core level of \nbenefits and respecting the religious rights and moral beliefs of those \nwho will be mandated to purchase these health insurance products. This \nis a difficult issue because religious freedom, as enshrined in the \nBill of Rights, is literally the first of our freedoms. And the issue \nof access to quality health insurance for every American is at the \ncornerstone of the Affordable Care Act.\n  I would like to quickly review how the administration has addressed \nthis question in its regulations implementing the Affordable Care Act. \nThe ACA, as adopted by Congress, directs all health insurance plans to \ncover a number of preventative care services, without cost sharing or \ncopays, to include some immunizations, preventive care and screenings \nfor children and adolescents, and with respect to women, additional \npreventive care and screenings that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices has determined should include contraception and contraception \nscreening.\n  In explaining its decision to include contraceptive services within \nthat mandate, the administration has referenced the Institute of \nMedicine's conclusion that there are significant health benefits \nderived from providing women with access to contraceptive care. I agree \nwith the Institute of Medicine and the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans who believe that having access to contraceptive care is \nimportant for women and is a right protected by U.S. Supreme Court \nprecedent. But then we have to ask, must the cost of contraceptive \ncoverage be covered by the health insurance plans of every employer?\n  In answering this question, we are required to address the concerns \nof those who oppose the use of contraceptives based on their religious \nor moral convictions. The administration provided, correctly in my \nview, a total exemption from this mandate for houses of worship that \noppose the use of contraception on moral and religious grounds. But the \nadministration did not extend this total exemption to such church-\naffiliated, non-profit organizations as hospitals, charities, and \nschools.\n  In response to the public outcry to the original regulation, the \nPresident amended his proposal in order to allow church-affiliated, \nnon-profits, such as hospitals, schools, and charities, to exclude \ncontraceptive coverage in the health insurance plans they provide to \ntheir employees, but only if their insurer directly contacts each \nemployee covered under their health insurance plan and makes them aware \nthat they are eligible to obtain contraceptive coverage at no cost if \nthey choose to do so. In my view, this proposed compromise falls short \nof protecting the values and beliefs of America's faith-based \ninstitutions. It can and should be strengthened to give religiously \naffiliated organizations the same protection\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nof their religious beliefs as the administration would give to houses \nof worship.\n  I do not see why religious affiliated institutions like hospitals, \nuniversities and their employees should be treated differently from \nchurches, synagogues and their employees. Many States, ever the \nlaboratories of our democracy, have already addressed this question in \na reasonable and responsible way that is different from the \nadministration's response. In fact, many States have established their \nown mandates with regard to contraceptive coverage, and along the way \ndevised their own approaches to respect the balance between requiring \nhealth insurance plans to cover a core level of benefits and respecting \nthe right of conscience for those who purchase or offer a private \nhealth insurance plan to their employees.\n  Specifically, I believe that Connecticut's approach to this question \nis one that could serve as a model of how to address this issue on a \nnational level.\n  In Connecticut, health insurance plans are required to cover \ncontraceptive care for all women, but the law provides a full exemption \nfor health insurance plans purchased and provided by churches and \nchurch-affiliated organizations, acknowledging their unique, faith-\ninspired mission and core religious values. Specifically, the law in \nConnecticut states that churches and their affiliated institutions, may \nbe issued a health insurance policy that, ``excludes coverage for \nprescription contraceptive methods which are contrary to the religious \nemployer's bona fide religious tenets.'' The law in Connecticut also \nallows any individual beneficiary in any health insurance plan to opt \nout of contraceptive coverage as long as she or he notifies their \ninsurance provider, ``that prescription contraceptive methods are \ncontrary to such individual's religious or moral beliefs.''\n  Unlike Connecticut's approach, Senator Blunt's amendment would \nprovide a broad based exemption from all mandated health insurance \nbenefits required by the Affordable Care Act--by allowing any business \nor organization to refuse to offer any coverage to its employees that \nit finds objectionable on a religious or moral basis. Such a broad \nexemption could undermine the intent of Congress in mandating coverage \nfor such essential services as maternity care, mental health, and \nimmunizations.\n  In conclusion, the experiences of many of our States, including \nConnecticut, shows that it is possible to find a better balance between \nrequiring health insurance companies to offer a quality health \ninsurance product and respecting the religious liberties of our \nNation's religious-affiliated organization than either the \nadministration or this amendment offers. There is a better way forward \non this important decision than the options that have been presented so \nfar and I hope to work with my colleagues in the Senate to develop one.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate is considering a bipartisan bill that would \nreauthorize critical infrastructure investments and that will protect \nan estimated 1.8 million jobs if enacted before the end of this month. \nUnfortunately, in order to move forward on this important legislation, \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle have demanded that we first \nconsider an amendment entirely unrelated to transportation or even job \ncreation. We have now spent the past 2 days considering a Republican \namendment that would roll back access to health care for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Access to health care for women has come under attack in recent weeks \nafter the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would \nfollow the recommendations of the nonpartisan Institute of Medicine and \nrequire that under the Affordable Care Act, health plans must cover a \nrange of preventative services for women, including contraception. This \nis not a novel solution. Twenty-eight States, including Vermont, \nalready require such coverage. The new rule will also include no-cost \npreventative coverage of a range of services for women including \nmammograms, prenatal screenings, cervical cancer screenings, flu shots, \nand much more.\n  Some religious institutions were apprehensive about the policy and, \nin response, the Obama administration made further accommodations to \naddress these concerns. The new policy strikes a reasonable balance and \nis a solution that continues to recognize the obvious truth that women \nhave a right to affordable and comprehensive health care, just as men \ndo. One thing we all should agree on is that availability of birth \ncontrol has improved women's health and reduced the number of teen \npregnancies and the rates of abortion. This should be applauded.\n  Unfortunately, this compromise did not satisfy some who insist on \npoliticizing women's health. At a House Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee hearing a few weeks ago, a thoughtful Georgetown law student \nwas prevented from testifying about her experiences because she was \ndeemed not ``appropriate and qualified'' to testify at the hearing by \nits Republican chairman. Not surprisingly, the all-male panel failed to \nraise any first-hand concern about women's health care needs. Rather \nthan demonizing women who speak out on behalf of the millions who use \ncontraception, we should be having a principled debate about access to \nhealth care. Last year, Congress nearly shut down the government over \nfunding for Planned Parenthood and other title X providers. States have \nrecently followed suit by passing laws limiting women's access to \nhealth care services. Our focus should be on improving access to \nquality and affordable health care for all Americans, not arbitrarily \nrestricting important services needed by millions of women.\n  The Republican amendment marks just the latest overreach and \nintrusion into women's health care. While this debate began as one \nfocused on access to birth control, the amendment has a far greater \nreach and jeopardizes virtually any health care service that an \nemployer or insurance plan deems contrary to its undefined ``moral \nconviction''--whether the employer is a religious institution or not. \nFor example, any plan or insurer could deny coverage of vaccinations or \nHIV/AIDS treatment based on a moral or religious objection. The pending \namendment would allow any employer or insurer to refuse contraceptive \ncoverage, annual well-women visits, gestational diabetes screening, and \ndomestic violence screenings. This amendment could allow an insurance \nprovider to refuse coverage of health care services to an interracial \ncouple or single mom because of a religious or moral objection.\n  At the core of the Affordable Care Act was the principle that all \nAmericans, regardless of health history or gender, have the right to \naccess health care services. This amendment turns that belief around \nand would take decisions out of the hands of patients and doctors and \nplace them with businesses and insurance plans. This serves only to put \nbusinesses and insurance companies in the driver's seat, allowing them \nto capriciously deny women coverage of health care services. The \namendment is a direct attack on women's health that would have public \nhealth consequences for all Americans.\n  Today marks the first day of Women's History Month. Instead of \nconsidering legislation that might promote women's equality such as the \nPaycheck Fairness Act or the Fair Pay Act, we are being forced to vote \non the amendment that undermines the ability of women to access basic \nhealth care. I will vote today in favor of the health of women and \nagainst the proposed amendment. I urge my fellow Senators to do the \nsame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 5 minutes, and that Senator Murray conclude our side with \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have news for the supporters of the \nBlunt amendment: We were not born yesterday. And no matter how many \ntimes they say this is nothing more than a restatement of old laws, the \nfacts are not with them. We have never had a conscience clause for \ninsurance companies. And if you wanted to give them a chance to say no, \na lot of them don't have any conscience, so they would take it. And \nthis is what Blunt does. It\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nallows any insurance company that doesn't want to provide a service--\nmaybe an expensive service--to say, oh, I meant to tell you, I have a \nmoral objection to this.\n  What a situation. How many people have struggled with their insurance \ncompanies to get them to cover what they have paid for for years and \nyears and years, only to have the insurance company say, sorry, sue us. \nNow Mr. Blunt is giving insurance companies a way to say, oh, we feel \nsorry that you have cancer; we are sad you have diabetes; we are torn \napart you might have a stroke, but, you know what, we have a moral \nobjection to the kind of therapies that are out there today, so we are \nsorry.\n  That is what the Blunt amendment does.\n  Should anyone think I am making it up, let's look at the words in the \nBlunt amendment. They are right here. They are right here. So the \nSenator from Maine can say whatever she wants about it, the Senator \nfrom Missouri can talk about what he wants to, but the fact is they say \nif you deny any coverage from the essential health benefits package or \nthe preventive health package it is fine as long as you hide behind--my \nwords--a moral objection.\n  This started out with birth control. There was a hearing over in the \nHouse, and this iconic picture will last through my lifetime and yours. \nHere is a photograph of a panel discussing women's health care over in \nthe Republican House. A discussion on women's health care. Do you see \none woman there? I don't. They are all men. And these men are waxing \neloquent about birth control and the fact that, oh, it is just a moral \nissue with them and they do not think women should have the right to \nhave it. Not one of them suggested men shouldn't have their Viagra, but \nwe will put that aside. We will put that aside.\n  Not one woman was called. And when a woman raised her hand in the \naudience and said, I have a very important story to tell about a friend \nof mine who lost her ovary because she couldn't afford birth control, \nwhich would have controlled the size of the cyst on the ovary, you know \nwhat Mr. Issa said over there? He said, you are not qualified. You are \nnot qualified to talk about women's issues. I guess only men are \nqualified to talk about women's issues. We have men on the other side \nof the aisle here, for the most part--with a little assist--telling \nwomen what their rights should be.\n  I cannot believe this battle is on a highway bill, on a \ntransportation bill, where 2.8 million jobs are at stake. We have been \ndiverted with this amendment about women's health. Look at the \ndifferent important benefits that any insurer or any employer could \nwalk away from. Because if this amendment passes, they would have the \nright to do so. They would no longer have to cover emergency services, \nhospitalization, maternity care, mental health treatment, pediatric \nservices, rehabilitative services, ambulatory patient services, \nlaboratory services. They would no longer have to offer breast cancer \nscreenings, cervical cancer screenings. All they have to do is say, oh, \nI am sorry, we believe prayer is the answer. We don't believe in \nchemotherapy. If someone is heavy and they are obese and they get \ndiabetes, we have a moral objection to helping them because, you know \nwhat, they didn't lead a clean life. So they could deny any of these \nthings--flu vaccines, osteoporosis screening, TB testing for children, \nautism screening.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote down this dangerous \namendment. Vote it down. We will have a motion to table, and I urge my \ncolleagues to stand for the women and the families of this Nation and \nlet's get back to the highway bill. Get rid of this thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I want to thank \nthe Senator from California and the many Senators who have stood \nproudly to fight for a woman's right to make her own health care \ndecisions. Certainly in this year of 2012, after decades of fighting to \nmake sure women have the rights and opportunities to be whoever they \nwant and to make their own health care choices, this vote today is an \naffirmation of that, if we can beat back this Blunt amendment.\n  We are at a very serious time in our Nation's history. Our economy is \nstruggling, and though we are getting back on track, millions of \nfamilies get up every day and are concerned about whether they can \nafford their mortgage or send their kids to college. I have to say, I \nam sure millions of women in this country did not think they would have \nto get up this morning and worry about whether contraception would be \navailable to them depending on who their employer was.\n  This is a serious issue. We have heard a lot of rhetoric about what \nthe Blunt amendment is. My colleague from California just described it \nfor us. It is terrible policy. It will allow any employer in America to \ncut off any preventive care for any religious or moral reason. It would \nsimply give every boss in America the right to make health care \ndecisions for their workers and their families. It is a radical assault \non the comprehensive preventive health care coverage we have fought so \nhard to make sure women and men and families across this country have. \nIf this amendment were to pass, employers could cut off coverage for \nchildren's immunizations, if they object to that. They could cut off \nprenatal care for children born to unmarried parents if they object to \nthat.\n  The American people are watching today. Young women are watching \ntoday. Is the Senate a place where their voice will be heard and their \nrights will be stood up for?\n  We have watched this assault on women's health care for more than a \nyear now. A year ago, almost to this very day, we were working to make \nsure we kept the government open by putting together our budget \nagreement. In the middle of the night, all the numbers were decided, \nall the issues were decided, and we were ready to move forward within \nhours to make sure our government did not shut down. What was the last \nissue between us and the doors of this government closing? The funding \nfor Planned Parenthood.\n  I was the only woman in the room, and I stood with those men and I \nsaid, no, we will not give away the funding for this over this budget. \nThe women of the Senate the next morning stood tall. We gathered all \nour colleagues together and we fought back and we won that battle. And \nthose who are trying to take away the rights of women to make their own \nhealth care choices and to have access to contraception in this country \ntoday have been at it every day since.\n  We are not going to allow a panel of men in the House to make the \ndecisions for women about their health care choices. We are not going \nto allow the Blunt amendment before us today to take away that right. \nWe believe this is an important day. In fact, this happens to be March \n1, the beginning of Women's History Month in this country. Let us stand \ntall today in this moment of history and say the United States Senate \nwill not allow women's health care choices to be taken away from them.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote with us to table the Blunt amendment and \nto tell women in this country everywhere that we stand with them in the \nprivacy of their own homes to make their own health care choices.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to table the Blunt amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I see the Senator from Arkansas on \nthe Senate floor. I will follow the Senator from Arkansas on another \npiece of legislation about which I hope to speak, but I do want to take \nabout 5 minutes to read the letter William Barret Travis sent from the \nAlamo. 176 years ago tomorrow, March 2, 1836, is the anniversary date \nof Texas' independence.\n  I am going to read this letter in commemoration of Texas Independence \nDay because it was on that date that Texas declared its independence \nfrom Mexico. Fifty-nine brave men signed the Texas Declaration of \nIndependence, putting their lives, and the lives of their families, on \nthe line to declare that ``the people of Texas do now constitute a \nfree, Sovereign, and independent republic.''\n  I am proud that my great-great grandfather, Charles S. Taylor, was \nwilling to sign that document that declared our freedom. In fact my son \nHouston is named Houston Taylor Hutchison for that Texas patriot. I am \nhumbled to hold the seat that was first held by another signer, and one \nof Charles S. Taylor's best friends, and that was Thomas Rusk, who was \nthe Secretary of War who defended the Declaration of Independence by \nfighting at the Battle of San Jacinto.\n  As was the case in the American Revolution, our freedom was \nultimately secured through the actions of the brave Texans who fought \nand died on the battlefield. The late Senator John Tower started the \ntradition of a Texas Senator reading the Travis letter, and it was \ncontinued by Phil Gramm, and I took it over in 1994. This is something \nwe do to tell America and to assure that Texans always remember this \nday in our history because after this, of course, we became a republic \nand we were a republic for 10 years before we became a part of the \nUnited States.\n  So it is with pride that I read--for the last time as a Senator \nrepresenting Texas--the wonderful letter that was written by COL \nWilliam Barret Travis. He said:\n\n       To the people of Texas and all Americans in the world--\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots--I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     walls. I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism \n     and everything dear to the American character to come to our \n     aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements \n     daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in \n     four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined \n     to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier \n     who never forgets what is due his own honor and that of his \n     country. Victory or Death.\n\n\n                 William Barret Travis Lt. Col. Comdt.\n\n  True to his word, he did not surrender. The Mexicans did have \nthousands of reinforcements. He drew a line in the sand at the Alamo. \nAll but one man bravely crossed that line or was carried over it on a \nstretcher to accept the challenge to stay and fight. These men knew \nthey would never leave the Alamo alive, but they heroically defended \nthe Alamo for 13 days; the 13 days of glory, as it is known, against a \nforce that eventually outnumbered them by more than 10 to 1.\n  William Barrett Travis, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and the rest of the \n189 men at the Alamo gave their lives fighting for something greater \nthan themselves. It was that delay that gave GEN Sam Houston the time \nto organize his men and retreat to a point they could defend, which \neventually became the Battle of San Jacinto. Just seven weeks later, on \nApril 21, 1836, Sam Houston--because of that delay that was given to \nthem by William Barret Travis and the 189 men at the Alamo--was able to \ntake a stand at the Battle of San Jacinto, and Texas was a republic \nfrom that time forward, for 10 years. Texas is the only State that was \na republic when it entered the United States. With that distinction, we \nlike to share our vivid history.\n\n  It has been a wonderful opportunity for me to be able to read this \nletter every year. I feel sure it will be continued by Senator Cornyn \nor my successor in this seat. We will always make sure people know we \nfought for our freedom just as the American patriots did, and we are \nvery proud to have that rich and colorful history.\n  So I thank the Senator from Arkansas, and I look forward to serving \nthe rest of my term, but this will be the last time I get to share this \npiece of history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I think it is unanimous on this side of \nthe aisle that we are going to miss the Senator from Texas when she \nleaves, and it is sad to hear about her doing something for the last \ntime in the Senate. She has been a wonderful Senator and colleague and \nall of us on the Democratic side, and I am sure the Republican side as \nwell, will greatly miss her.\n  I wish the Record to reflect that Texas does have a glorious history. \nOne of the things we are proud of in our State is that many of the men \nwho gave their lives for the republic of Texas at the Alamo actually \npassed through Arkansas because that was the Southwest Trail back in \nthose days. Many of those men passed through the State--actually, it \nwas a meeting place, maybe a tavern I think they might have called it \nback then--near Hope, AR. So we share a little piece of that history in \nour State as well.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nArkansas for his kind remarks. I have so enjoyed serving with his \nfather before him and then him. It is a point of history for Arkansas \nthat this Senator\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\nPryor followed his father into the Senate. I appreciate so much that we \nare contiguous with the State of Arkansas and that so many of the \npeople who settled the West did come through Arkansas. Some stayed \nthere and some came on to Texas. Our whole history of the West is so \nexciting, and I am glad people remember it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1174-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I thank the Chair for the recognition. I \nwish to talk about something that is on everyone's mind. When I was in \nArkansas last week for the recess, I did four or five townhall meetings \nand pretty much everywhere I went, this was the topic of discussion; \nthat is, gas prices in our State.\n  I know it hurts every American when gas prices go up because gasoline \nprices and diesel prices have a way of working their way through the \nentire economy and causing economic difficulties for this country. One \nof the things people pointed out to me is this roller coaster effect we \nhave seen on gas prices over the last year or so. One thing my friends \nin Arkansas noticed is that the price there has gone up about 30 cents \na gallon just in the last couple months. So it has been a very dramatic \nincrease and it is something people are very concerned about.\n  I wish to make three points about this. One is that I think the \nCongress--House and Senate--as well as the White House should look at \nthis problem of speculation. When we look at the numbers, some are \nsaying a fairly large percentage of the costs of a gallon of gas--some \npeople say 20 cents a gallon and some people say 40 cents a gallon--\nactually goes to the speculators. So what that means is a lot of these \nguys have no intention of ever taking the product and doing anything \nwith it, other than just trading it, to try to profiteer in a volatile \nmarket. That is a big concern.\n  We actually passed something 2 or 3 years ago to get the CFTC to \nissue some regulations on how to handle this, and now those apparently \nhave been challenged in court. Of course, the people challenging this \nare the people who are benefiting from the speculation. So I think we \nneed to find that balance.\n  When we have a market, there are going to be speculators in the \nmarket and they are going to get out there and try to make some money \nin the marketplace. That is the nature of the business. Sometimes they \nwin; sometimes they lose. That is legitimate. But I think there are \npeople and companies, some invest billions and billions of dollars, but \nthey are trying to profiteer off the volatile oil situation. So we need \nto focus on speculation.\n  We also need to focus on the supply of oil in this country. The good \nnews is we are seeing more and more acreage being drilled and permitted \nto be drilled in this country. After the terrible gulf spill a couple \nyears ago, those permits are starting to be issued again down in the \nGulf of Mexico, as I understand it. Also, I am a supporter of the \nKeystone Pipeline as well. We need to continue to develop our domestic \nsupply, and even our near domestic supply in Canada, of oil. We also \nneed to have diversity in our energy portfolio. There needs to be \nalternatives to gasoline and diesel. We need to find different ways to \nrun our vehicles, whether it is natural gas or whatever it may be. It \ncould be electricity. It could be lots of different products. We need \nto continue to innovate in this country and try to do great things.\n  That brings me to my third point, which is the real reason why I am \non the floor. Certainly, it touches on gas prices, and that is very \nimportant. We don't want to see gas prices slow down our economic \nrecovery we are undergoing right now.\n  We also need a more comprehensive and smarter national energy policy. \nI think an important first step toward that is for us to evaluate all \nthe energy programs we happen to have on the books already--what the \nDepartment of Energy is doing, what other various departments are \ndoing. Someone needs to be looking at all the tax credits and tax \nincentives when it comes to energy. We need a comprehensive analysis of \nwhere we are as a nation: what our strengths are, what our weaknesses \nare.\n  What I am proposing is a bill, the Quadrennial Energy Review. It is a \nbill we have introduced, and I am fortunate enough to have Senator \nBingaman, the chairman of the Energy Committee, as well as Senator \nMurkowski, the ranking member of the Energy Committee, as cosponsors. \nWe would love to have other Senators look at this, maybe relatively \nsoon, because we would like to start moving this through the process, \nif at all possible.\n\n  A quadrennial energy review is based on what they do at the \nDepartment of Defense. Every 4 years, the DOD goes through this very \ndetailed, top-to-bottom analysis of all the things they need to \nconsider in the Department of Defense, and they come out with the QDR--\nthe Quadrennial Defense Review. Basically, it looks at what we have and \nit presents a roadmap for where we need to go.\n  That is what we need to do with energy. We already have this model \nthat works. This idea would be more governmentwide--not just the \nDepartment of Energy but governmentwide. I encourage all my colleagues \nto look at this and if they wouldn't mind having their staff check back \nwith my office because we would love to have other colleagues as \ncosponsors if they are interested. I don't think it is controversial. I \ndon't think there is much money or much requirement involved. I think \nit is good government and smart government to come up with a \ncomprehensive energy policy for our Nation.\n  In Washington we hear the American people loudly and clearly. We are \nconcerned about gas prices as well on lots of different levels and we \nwill certainly be focused on that and paying a lot of attention to that \nissue over the next several weeks and, hopefully, we can do some good \nfor the market and do some good for the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have had, over the last couple \nweeks around my State of Ohio, a number of conversations with workers \nand management both who work for auto companies, from foreign-owned \nHonda in central Ohio to the big three auto companies, which are very \ninvolved in the Ohio economy--Chrysler, GM, and Ford--and a number of \nconversations with auto suppliers: those companies that are less well \nknown, companies such as Magna and Johnson Controls and companies that \nare smaller than that that are so-called tier 1, 2, or 3 suppliers, \nthose companies that sell components into the manufacturing supply \nchain that ultimately end up in a Jeep Wrangler made in Toledo or a \nChevy Cruze made in Lordstown, OH, near Youngstown.\n  In almost all these conversations, these companies, these executives, \nand workers are simply incredulous that the auto rescue is still being \ndebated--that it worked or it did not work.\n  One just has to come to Ohio, and not just northern Ohio, where the \nassumption is that is sort of where the auto industry is in Ohio--it is \ntrue, but it is also in the rest of the State--but people all over Ohio \nand all over the whole industrial Midwest and I think all over the \ncountry understand the auto rescue worked.\n  We remember back when Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow and Senator \nVoinovich, a Republican from my State who has since retired, took to \nthe floor--and in committee hearings and all that--in December of 2008, \nwhen President Bush realized the auto industry needed, at a minimum, \nsome bridge loans to stay in business, not because we have any interest \nin the government owning auto companies but because we knew hundreds \nand hundreds and hundreds of thousands of workers and thousands of \nsmall businesses that manufacture goods in our State and in Michigan \nand in Indiana and all over the region, all understood it would be \neconomic devastation. I think and I think most economists think and \nmost auto people think and I think most Ohioans think it would have led \nto a depression. That was in December of 2008.\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\n  Because of a whole bunch of reasons, this place decided not to do \nwhat President Bush thought we should do. Then, later on, a few months \nlater, when President Obama said we have to step up and do the right \nthing, it was still a difficult vote. It passed, with some Republican \nsupport but not as much as we had hoped. But it passed. This was in \nDecember 2008 and then early 2009 when President Obama took the oath of \noffice. We can now look at what has happened in this country.\n  Fundamentally, we see an auto industry that is so important to \nmanufacturing in our country and so important to building a middle \nclass. We can see what that has meant to our country. I will give you \none big example. From 1997 to 2010, every single year we have seen a \ndecline in manufacturing jobs in our country--every single year. In my \nState, and I know in the Presiding Officer's State of North Carolina, \nin which manufacturing has been a huge presence, they have suffered as \nevery State has. From 2008 to 2010, every single year there have been \nmanufacturing job losses. But you know what, since the auto rescue, for \nthe last 20, 21, 22 months, we have seen manufacturing job growth--\nmanufacturing job growth every single month for the country and for my \nState of Ohio. Every single month, we have had more manufacturing jobs \nthan the month before. That is not good enough because it is not enough \ngrowth, but it is clearly going in the right direction.\n  In auto alone, you can see what is happening in my State. The four \nlarge auto companies in Ohio--Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, and \nHonda--all four of them have announced major expansion plans, major \ninvestments in our State, including building a new car in some cases, \nbuilding a new line of cars, and in other cases expanding \nsignificantly.\n  Look at a car like the Chevy Cruz. Its engine is made in Defiance, \nnear the Indiana border. Its bumper is made in Northwood. Its \ntransmission is made in Toledo. Its speakers are made in Springboro, \nnear Dayton in southwest Ohio, so the Dayton-Cincinnati area. There are \nbrackets made in, I believe, Brunswick and other places. The steel \ncomes from Cleveland. The aluminum comes from Cleveland. Stamping is in \na plant in Parma--the stamping, I believe, of the components to the \ncar. The assembly is ultimately in Lordstown, and 5,000 people work in \nLordstown, OH, stamping and assembling this small car that has been one \nof the best sellers of any car in the United States of America.\n  In Toledo, where the Jeep Wrangler is assembled, prior to the auto \nrescue, only about 50 percent of the components in a Jeep Wrangler were \nAmerican made--only 50 percent. So half of them came from production \noutside of the United States. Today about 75 percent of the Jeep \nWrangler--the components to the Jeep Wrangler are assembled in the \nUnited States--is so-called domestic content. What does that mean? That \nmeans jobs.\n  That is why it is so important that the President continue to move \nforward--and I hope more aggressively--on the whole issue of auto \nsupply parts. We saw how just 10 years ago we had a deficit with China \nof about $1 billion in auto parts. Today we have a trade deficit with \nChina in auto parts of almost $10 billion. So I know how concerned the \nPresident is.\n  I know that American auto companies, including Honda, want to source \nmore and more of their products in the United States of America. They \nwant those products to be manufactured here in addition to being \nassembled here. And manufactured here obviously means it will be close \nto the final assembly point in the critical mass that these \nmanufacturers want to grow jobs.\n  So we are seeing a partnership now that we have never seen in my \nlifetime, I believe, between the auto industry and the U.S. Government, \nnot for the government to have ownership, not for the government to \ntell the auto industry what to do, but for the government to make the \nbusiness climate for these auto companies more and more favorable. That \nis what is good. That is what has come out of the auto rescue for \nToledo--the assembly of the Jeep Wrangler. That is what has come out of \nthe auto rescue in Youngstown--in Lordstown, the Youngstown area--for \nthe Chevy Cruz. All of that is good news, that economic growth, that \nmanufacturing job growth we have seen for more than 20 months. It \nclearly takes us in the right direction.\n  It is important that the naysayers just kind of drop--I mean, they \ncan say whatever they want about the auto rescue. They are going to say \nwhat they want for political reasons. But it is clear that we as \npolicymakers--you know Presidential candidates are going to do what the \nPresidential candidates are going to do in both parties. I don't really \nmuch care. But I do care that this body, the Senate, focus its efforts \non how do we cooperatively grow this industry. It means more union auto \nworkers going to work. It means more nonunion supply chain workers \ngoing to work. All of these are good-paying jobs. What do we care about \nmore here than preparing an environment for good-paying jobs that put \npeople back to work and can help them join the middle class.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I, along with Senators Graham, Hoeven, \nBlumenthal, and Sessions, had a very interesting trip last week, where \nwe visited various countries and learned a lot at each one. The reason \nwe are here on the floor today is to talk a bit about the recent \nrelease--thank God--of Americans who were in the American Embassy and \nwere subject to trial and prosecution by the Egyptian Government. This \nwas a humanitarian issue from the standpoint that no American citizen \nshould be treated that way, especially by an ally, but it was also a \nlarger issue in that the outcome could have significantly impacted \nrelations between our country and Egypt.\n  Egypt, as my friend from South Carolina well knows, is the heart and \nsoul of the Arab world. What happens in Egypt affects the entire Arab \nworld. Our relationship with Egypt is one that is vital not just for \nEgypt but our national security interests are that the region remain \npeaceful and that there not be conflict and abrogation of the treaty \nthat was concluded between Egypt and Israel as a result of the Camp \nDavid agreements.\n  I think it is important to recognize that Egypt is in a bit of \nturmoil. These young people, from the National Democratic Institute, \nthe International Republican Institute, and Freedom House, \nunfortunately, had to go to our embassy because they were going to be \nprosecuted under then-Egyptian law.\n  I wish to begin by saying that our Ambassador to Egypt, Anne \nPatterson, may be one of the finest diplomats this Nation has produced. \nThe more the Senator from South Carolina and I travel, and the more we \nmeet with and have discussions with representatives at our U.S. \nEmbassies, we realize these people are enormously good, and we are \nproud they represent the United States, particularly Anne Patterson.\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\nShe has worked tirelessly since this whole crisis began. I believe the \nmajority of the credit for this successful outcome, as far as our \nAmerican citizens are concerned, can be directly attributed to her \ndedication, her hard work, and her tireless efforts day and night on \nbehalf of these young people. So we are extremely proud of her.\n  I wish to ask my friend from South Carolina what he thinks were the \nreasons why the Egyptian Government changed what they had previously \nsaid would be a judicial prosecution of these American citizens to \nallowing them to leave Egypt and return to the United States, as they \nare now on their way?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I wish to add my gratitude and \nrecognition of Ambassador Patterson and her whole team--the State \nDepartment team on the ground. They did a very good job making the case \nto the Egyptian Government. But we have to all realize Egypt is in \ntransition. They have just had their elections for the lower house, the \nParliament. The upper house has not been seated yet, and they have not \nelected a President. They have gone from a dictatorship to an emerging \ndemocracy, and this case comes along, the NGO prosecutions.\n  I think both of us--our entire delegation--think this is offensive. \nThe IRI, the NDI are Republican-Democratic organizations funded by the \ngovernment and the private sector that try to help emerging democracies \nall over the world. They have been in every country hotspot you can \nname--after the collapse of the Soviet Union--doing great work. So the \naccusations were the people involved in these organizations--and \nSenator McCain is the head of IRI--were involved in spying and \nespionage, and I wanted to take the floor to say I found the \naccusations offensive and without merit.\n  The Egyptian coworkers, Egyptian citizens who were working with the \nIRI and NDI, are still in custody in Egypt, facing criminal \nprosecutions for helping these fine organizations, and we will not take \nour eye off of that and we will keep pushing to make sure we get the \nright answer.\n  But how did this end? We know how it started. I think it was a \npolitical effort to try to justify Mubarak-era law that was used to \noppress and keep out of the country people who were helping to bring \nabout change. One of the bright spots of this engagement was that the \narmy--and General Tantawi was as helpful as he could be, given the \nconstraints of the army in this new government formation.\n  But when we engaged the Muslim Brotherhood, the Freedom and Justice \nParty, the largest bloc in Parliament, Senator McCain, in his first \nengagement, the first thing he said to the representative was this NGO \nsituation and how damaging it was to Egypt-American relationships, how \nunfair it was, how out of bounds it was in terms of the law. The \nresponse was from this group that we find the NGO law unacceptable, \nunjust, and we are wanting to change it. Once that statement was made \npublicly, it allowed this momentum to withdraw or lift the \nadministrative travel ban. The cases may still go forward, but our \npeople are coming home.\n  I think the reason this happened is because of the collaboration \nbetween the State Department, the delegation, every aspect of the \nAmerican Government, and the people on the ground in Egypt I think \nunderstood the value of the United States-Egyptian relationship, and \nthe judicial system finally made a wise decision. To those left behind, \nwe are certainly standing with you, and you will not be forgotten.\n  But this could have ended the United States-Egyptian relationship.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Hoeven, let me ask a question to you both. \nIf this had not ended well, if they had insisted on prosecuting and \nhaving the American citizens questioned appear in cages before an \nEgyptian court based on an outlandish acquisition, what kind of \nreaction would we have had in the United States and what damage would \nit have done to United States-Egyptian relationships, in your opinion?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator from South Carolina knows, there was a \npending amendment to cut off the $1.3 billion. I would emphasize to my \ncolleagues that $1.3 billion was a commitment that was made at the time \nof the Camp David agreement which led to a peace agreement between \nEgypt and Israel, which, if that amendment had been enacted, I am \nconfident would have been cause for the Egyptians to abrogate the peace \ntreaty with Israel. The consequences of all that I am not sure of.\n  I wish to emphasize to my friend--and I see Senator Hoeven here--we \ndid have meetings with the speaker of their Parliament and his \ncolleagues. We did have meetings with the chairman of their committee \non human rights, who happens to be the nephew of Anwar Sadat, one of \nthe signatories to the Camp David agreement--the signatory, along with \nMenachem Begin. We did meet with the Muslim Brotherhood, who then \nagreed with us that NGOs are important and the law needed to be \nrevised. Of course, we met with Marshal Tantawi, the head of the \ninterim military government.\n  What confused us a bit at first, I ask my colleague from North \nDakota, was that everybody said: We are with you. Yet, they were \ngridlocked. In the words of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nwho had been over there, they were paralyzed. It seemed to me that the \nstatement of the Muslim Brotherhood--who all of us I know have concerns \nabout, but it was the statement of the Muslim Brotherhood supporting \nNGOs, supporting revision of the Mubarak law that seemed to be a major \nfactor in unsticking what had clearly been a situation which day by day \ngrew more and more of a crisis. I would ask my friend from North Dakota \nif he had that same impression.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to thank the esteemed Senator from Arizona for \nallowing me to join him on the floor today to talk about this very \nimportant issue that has had a favorable outcome. Even more \nimportantly, I want to express my great appreciation and gratitude to \nSenator McCain and Senator Graham for organizing the opportunity for us \nto go over to Egypt, and to not only meet with our NGO workers at the \nU.S. Embassy, but to engage in conversations and meetings with military \nand government leaders on this very important issue.\n  It is not just these seven Americans we are very concerned about, and \ntheir safety--which obviously is paramount. But as Senator Graham \nindicated, this situation clearly had ramifications for the \nrelationship on a longer term basis between Egypt and the United \nStates, and Egypt and Israel, particularly in regard to the peace \ntreaty.\n  So taking this initiative to sit down with Field Marshal Tantawi, who \nis the leader of the military council, but also the leaders of the \nFreedom and Justice Party--which is the majority party now in the \nParliament. Of course, that is the Muslim Brotherhood. We sat down with \nthe Muslim Brotherhood as well. I think those meetings were extremely \nimportant in helping to foster an understanding that broke the logjam.\n  I too want to commend the work of our Ambassador, Ambassador Anne \nPatterson. She did an outstanding job. I want to thank Secretary \nClinton and the people at the State Department for their diligent \nefforts. But I must say, having the opportunity to be part of a \ndelegation led by Senator McCain and Senator Graham gave us the \nopportunity to talk to the Muslim Brotherhood, gave us the opportunity \nto talk to the leaders of the Freedom and Justice Party. And the next \nday they put out a statement, which I agree was very important in \nhelping move things forward, because what they said in that statement \ninvolved two things, two things that I do think helped break the \nlogjam; first, that they support nongovernment organizations. They \nsupport nongovernment organizations. They recognize that these NGOs do \nimportant work, and they want to address the laws in Egypt to make sure \nthey have good laws that will enable the NGOs to continue.\n  The second thing they said, which I thought was particularly \nimportant, is they also expressed their concern about NGO workers, and \nthat those NGO workers be treated fairly.\n  As Senator McCain said, I hail from the State of North Dakota, and he \nknows I am going to say this. I can see the smile sneaking up on his \nface already. One of the NGO workers, one of the Americans detained \nunder the travel ban whom I had the opportunity to visit with at the \nEmbassy is a woman named Staci Haag. She has been over\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\nthere working. Needless to say, I was worried about all of our \nAmericans. I was really worried about Staci, and making sure that she \nand her fellow workers--and of course, Secretary LaHood's son, Sam \nLaHood, but all of them, that they were able to get home safely.\n  Again, I think it was important in terms of fostering an \nunderstanding that I hope now will continue as we work to build \nrelations with Egypt and their new government.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I will, to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And I will turn it back over to Senator McCain.\n  I can tell you that very few people in Egypt, almost no one in Egypt \nrealized somebody from North Dakota was being held. You were on \nmessage. You were very effective. I hope Staci and her family \nappreciate it, and I know they do. But for everybody--Sam, the NDI \nworkers, the whole gang--we are proud of what they do.\n  Senator Blumenthal is here, and I want people to know this is a \nbipartisan delegation. We had kind of a dinner meeting, when things \nwere not going so well, about the idea of bringing our American \ncitizens down to Egyptian court to be put at risk securitywise and \nmaybe to be put behind cages--which would have destroyed the \nrelationship. I think Senator Blumenthal made it crystal clear that was \nnot a good idea. And thank God it didn't happen.\n  With that, I yield back to Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with my colleague from South Carolina. Senator \nBlumenthal was very important, one, for bipartisanship, but also his \nbackground as a prosecutor.\n  At one point in all of this back and forth, one of the lawyers--who \nwill be unnamed--said to Senator Blumenthal that: Well, we probably \nhave to go along with the advice of the lawyers. And Senator \nBlumenthal, in a very succinct way, said: Well, maybe it is time to \nfire the lawyers.\n  So I want to thank Senator Blumenthal for his involvement and the \nexpertise and knowledge that he brought to this whole scenario because \nof his background as a prosecutor and attorney general of his State.\n  I guess I wonder, from my friend from Connecticut, if he believes \nthat this kind of thing is something we should be emphasizing, these \nNGOs, so maybe we can prevent this in the future.\n  For example, when we visited Tunisia, the Tunisians have enacted a \nlaw that encourages the participation of these dedicated men and women \nwho come and live and work in their country and help them build \ndemocracy. That was what was so--not enraging, but certainly it was so \nfrustrating to hear these people who are only trying to build \ndemocracy. They weren't there to make money. They weren't contractors. \nThey weren't anybody who was in business. They were just trying to help \nthem build democracy, and they end up in the situation that they were \nin--which caused us from time to time to maybe grit our teeth, I would \nask my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank my colleague from Arizona who led this trip. \nVery enthusiastically and emphatically I would say the answer is, yes, \nwe should be encouraging these nongovernmental organizations that are \ncommitted to the cause of democracy and human rights and civil society. \nTheir work in Egypt and in places such as Tunisia and other areas of \nthe Middle East, as well as around the globe where democracy and \nfreedom are at risk and sometimes at great peril, has been enormously \nimportant.\n  I was so proud and grateful to be part of this trip led by Senator \nMcCain, and to hear and see the kind of respect there is in the world \nfor his views, for his leadership, as well as for Senator Graham's. And \n``receptiveness'' is probably an understatement that Field Marshal \nTantawi, leaders of Parliament, and others in Egypt had for his \nstatements about the importance of allowing these Americans, these \nseven Americans, who committed no crime, to leave that country. The \npower of his and Senator Graham's statements, the ability of our \ncolleagues such as Senator Hoeven and Senator Sessions to speak--not on \nbehalf of the United States, because we were not there to negotiate--\nbut on behalf of public opinion in the United States I think was very \ninstrumental and shows the importance of the interchanges and the \nrelationships that can be built when we interact face to face, on the \nground, with our peers and contemporaries in foreign countries. Not \nthat we were speaking as military people or as diplomats, but simply in \nreflecting the opinion of people in the United States that these \nAmericans, innocent of any crime, should be permitted to leave the \ncountry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Didn't my friend from Connecticut find it striking that \nthese new parliamentarians were most eager to have interparliamentary \nassociation with us? They wanted to come to the United States to have \nfurther relations between the two elected bodies. I was very impressed \nby that.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I would say, yes, indeed. I was extraordinarily \nimpressed by their eagerness to see what democracy looks like as it \nworks. Remember, some of these individuals have been in prison for long \nperiods of time, some of them under the most brutal conditions, many of \nthem tortured while they were there, with little exposure to the real \nworld of democracy.\n  In answer to the question of the Senator from Arizona, it would be \nvery helpful to them. In fact, on a number of occasions we invited them \nto come to this country.\n  But I would ask the Senator from Arizona and perhaps my other \ncolleagues who are on the floor today to look ahead and to comment \nperhaps on what we can do to move in a positive way from here, because \nI think all of us feel Egypt is a linchpin for our relationship to that \narea of the world going forward. So much that is exciting is happening \nin that part of the world, and Egypt is so critical to it. So I would \nask my friends from Arizona and South Carolina and North Dakota what \nthey feel perhaps are positive steps we can take to build on this good \nstep forward.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Very briefly, before I turn to my other two colleagues, \nthe day we arrived in Egypt there was a suppliers conference, companies \nand corporations from all over the world, ranging from companies such \nas General Electric, Boeing--the major corporations. It is very clear \nthat the one thing they need is jobs--jobs and jobs and jobs. Their \ntourism has collapsed. Unless their economy improves, I think they are \ngoing to face some very significant challenges.\n  At least I was very happy to see a lot of American participation in \nthat gathering. I think they said there were like 600 people in that \nroom, all of them representing various businesses in the United States. \nAnd of course they are experiencing a hard currency crunch right now \nthat is very significant.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think this is a very good topic to be talking about--\nthe future--because this is an episode that could have destroyed the \nrelationship before it had a chance to mature. What am I concerned \nabout? I am still concerned about the development in Egypt. The \nConstitution will be written here in the coming months, by the summer. \nI want to make sure America's voice is heard about who we are. We hope \nthat the Egyptian people embrace tolerance; that the Coptic Christians \nare going to be welcomed as they have been for centuries in Egypt; that \nreligious minorities will be protected; that women will not be taken \nback into the darkness; that the Constitution will reflect an Islamic \nnation that understands the concepts of tolerance and free enterprise.\n  The Muslim Brotherhood will be the leading organization politically. \nIt is up to them to create an environment where the world feels \nwelcome. It is up to them to create an economy, working with their \ncoalition partners. We will be watching. It is not what you say in \npolitics, it is what you do. Apply that to all of us here. I think we \nare failing our people back in the United States by talking way too \nmuch and doing too little.\n  Between now and the summer can really be outcome-determinative for \ndecades in Egypt. I am urging the Egyptian political leadership, the \nMuslim Brotherhood included, to write a constitution and create an \nenvironment where people believe they can come and visit Egypt and do \nbusiness. Senator McCain is dead-on. There is a lot of money to be made \ninteracting with the Egyptian people, and they are\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\na proud people and smart people, and I want to get our businesses on \nthe ground. I want to help the Egyptian economy develop through the \nprivate sector, not just the public.\n  I am the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, working \nwith Senator Leahy, the chairman. We will be continuing to provide \neconomic assistance, but the end game is to create a functioning \nsociety we can do business with where we can create jobs in America.\n  The main thing to do in the short term is maintain the military \nrelationship. The reason Egypt did not become Syria when people were \nrising against the autocratic regime is because the Army stood by the \npeople. The relationship we have had with the Egyptian military over 30 \nyears really paid dividends. Egyptian officers coming to American \nmilitary academies and schools has been invaluable.\n  As we go forward, maintain that relationship between us and the \nEgyptian Army, honor the treaty with Israel, make sure you write a \nconstitution worthy of a bright future in Egypt, and to all the \npolitical leaders in Egypt: The world is watching, the Arab world is \nwatching, and if you have a narrow agenda, if you have an exclusive \nagenda, you will be doing your country a disservice. We will be a \nwilling partner but not under any and all circumstances. Maybe we have \nlearned our lesson--that you cannot have partnerships without basic \nprinciples.\n  We look forward to working with the Egyptian Parliament and people. \nThey have a chance to change the course of history in the Arab world \nand the Mideast. Don't lose the opportunity.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I echo the sentiments of the good Senator from South \nCarolina. What I would like to add is I think that is exactly the right \nquestion to pose. The Senator from Connecticut says: Where do we go \nfrom here? I think that is right-on. There is no question in my mind \nbut that the relationships Senator McCain and Senator Graham have built \noverseas made a difference for the United States and our foreign \npolicy. This is a clear example of it.\n  When we sat down with Field Marshal Tantawi, when we met with other \ngovernment leaders, even when we met with the Muslim Brotherhood, \nbecause of the fact that there was a relationship there, that they knew \nthese individuals, there was some level of trust there that enabled us \nto engage in very important communications that produced a message that \nI think was integral to the resolution of this situation, which could \nhave been a very bad one.\n  These relationships matter when we talk about working with other \ncountries, particularly in that part of the world. There are so many \ndifferences between our countries and how we operate that having some \nrelationships where people can sit down, have these discussions, and \ntalk about how we work together and foster some future agreement and \nsome mutual understanding is vitally important.\n  At the meeting with the Freedom and Justice Party parliamentary \nmembers, we invited them to come visit us. I think that would be very \nhelpful and very important, not only so these new leaders and their \nparliament have a better sense of the United States and how we work and \nthe kinds of relationships we can foster in both business and \ngovernment but also so the Members of this Senate, of this Congress, \nand our people here get a better sense of them as well. I believe that \nis very important as we track forward with this new, young government \nthat is now embarking on writing a constitution and governing in a \nvitally important country in the Middle East.\n  At this point, I would like to turn things back to the good Senator \nfrom Arizona, with my sincere gratitude.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleagues and dear friends. It was an \nexciting trip and a very interesting one. I would just like to say that \nwhen you go to a country such as Libya and see the challenges they have \nwith the militias and yet the dedication of their leadership toward a \nfree and democratic country; when you go into Libya, where both the \nPrime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister both attended school or \nwere professors at the University of Alabama, it really does show the \nincredible effect of an education in the United States of America.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for just 1 second?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Extremist, but anyway----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Not only did we meet with people who came back to Libya \nfrom the University of Alabama--if there had been anybody from North \nDakota, I would have known about it, I assure you.\n  We met a person who was detained at Gitmo--you talk about a small \nworld and how the world changes--someone detained at Guantanamo Bay \nbecause they had been involved with some very unsavory characters but \nwho did not adopt the al-Qaida agenda but will be a key player between \nthe United States and Libya.\n  I want to mention--I think my colleagues will verify this--you have \nbeen nice to Senator McCain and myself, but let me tell you, having the \nthree Senators there, as Senator Blumenthal said, echoing public \nopinion in America--we were not negotiators, we were trying to tell \npeople the way it was here at home--we could not have done it without \nthe three of you saying, here is the way it is.\n\n  But let me say, when Senator McCain turned to the former Guantanamo \nBay detainee and said: You know, I have been in prison, too, and about \nforgiveness and about starting over and starting a relationship in \nVietnam--Senator McCain and Senator Kerry did that--and about \nunderstanding that the future is what we want it to be, I thought it \nwas a very moving moment. I think the interaction between the two \nindividuals gave me a sense that there is hope out there.\n  I want to acknowledge that was an unusual moment, when you meet \nsomeone who had been in Guantanamo Bay, who is now one of the future \nleaders of Libya, and have a Senator from the U.S. Senate who served \nhis country and was a prisoner of war--that was an incredible exchange. \nI hope something good comes from it.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. It was an extraordinary moment but even more so \nbecause Senator McCain asked a number of them--one in particular--about \nthe impacts on their families and in that case, I believe, the impact \non his wife. We tend to forget in this country--all too often we tend \nto take for granted the immense protections we enjoy in this country, \nthe value of our freedoms.\n  That moment was profoundly moving for me, and his reaction in the \nrealization of how far he has come as a leader in his country, how much \nhe has endured, how much pain and travail for him and his family. It \nwas a striking reminder about the importance of democracy and freedom \nand the protections we often take for granted and the great work being \ndone by those nongovernmental organizations in fostering freedom and \ndemocracy, sometimes at peril or risk to themselves.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has hit a very important point, and \nit ties to what Senator McCain said about the suppliers conference in \nEgypt. These principles and the growth of democracies in that part of \nthe world are important, not just because we like democracy and not \njust because of the strategic value, militarily, and the interests that \nour national security has, but also they are potential markets for our \nexports. The Senator from South Carolina used that word. People should \nunderstand that there is an important interest that we have in \npromoting jobs in those countries because it will be jobs for us. That \nis, at a very basic level, one of the values of this trip, trying to \npromote and expand those markets, as Senator McCain did in speaking at \nthe suppliers conference in Cairo to hundreds of Egyptian businessmen \nwanting to do business, buy our products, and expand their markets.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of my colleague from Vermont. I once \nagain thank my colleague. Every once in a while we can think we did a \nlittle bit of good around the world, and thanks to the five of us, I \nthink we really did. I think we can be proud.\n  We are also proud that we represent, still, in their view and our \nview, the greatest Nation in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I request 10 minutes to speak in regard \nto a resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hoeven and Mr. Blumenthal pertaining to the \nsubmission of S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment, strike ``5 days'' and insert ``4 days''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me take a moment where we are in this \nimportant surface transportation reauthorization bill. No one disputes \nthe fact that this is a job creator. Millions of jobs, plural. Today \nwith the Senate's vote to dispose of the Blunt amendment, the Senate \ncompleted an important step to advance this bill. The Republican \nleaders on the Republican side made clear that they would not allow the \nSenate to move forward on this piece of legislation until they got a \nvote on contraception. We waited and waited. It is done. Now we can \nmove on to attempting to process other amendments to this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Not everything ground to a halt while the Senate was working toward \nprocessing the Blunt amendment. The bill's able managers have been \nworking to clear amendments offered by a number of Senators. As I have \nsaid before, the managers of this bill--multiple in nature--are \nseasoned and know what is going on legislatively. They worked together, \nSenators Boxer and Inhofe especially, because there is more of what \nthey have in this bill than what other committees have. But we have the \nBanking Committee, the Finance Committee, the Commerce Committee, and \nthey have all worked together in coming up with a number of cleared \namendments. All of these Senators have worked closely together. They \nworked so closely even before the work over the past week, and on \nFebruary 9, 85 Senators voted on cloture to proceed to the bill. And as \nI have indicated, over the last several weeks they have continued to \nwork together and clear numerous amendments that Senators have filed.\n  I offered a revised amendment a few minutes ago. This amendment \nincludes the very same consensus that comes from the product of these \nthree committees regarding my earlier amendment. It includes matters \nreported unanimously by the Banking Committee, strong bipartisan vote \nwith the Finance Committee, matters negotiated between the chairman and \nranking member of the Commerce Committee.\n  What is new in the amendment I just offered is that it now also \nincludes 37 additional amendments cleared by the managers of this bill \nand, where appropriate, cleared by other committees, specifically the \nCommerce Committee and the Banking Committee. Thirty-seven amendments. \nSo that is now part of my substitute that is now before the Senate.\n  I would be very satisfied if the Senate adopted this amendment, and \nprovided that it serve as additional text for purpose of further \namendment. The two managers will work to clear additional amendments.\n  We need a path forward on this bill, and we don't have it now. We \ncontinue to work on an agreement to have votes on a number of \nnongermane amendments which the Republican caucus says they want. And \nour side, if they want amendments, we could have some nongermane \namendments also. I would rather we disposed of the nongermane \namendments, and I am thinking seriously of coming to the floor today \nand asking consent that we move forward on this bill with no irrelevant \nor nongermane amendments.\n  It is vital that we complete work on this surface transportation \nreauthorization bill. I am determined that the Senate will do so and do \nso as quickly as possible. Doing so will take cooperation from \ndifferent Senators, so we\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\nneed to keep our eye on the road. We need to get this legislation \npassed. Saving or creating up to 2.8 million jobs is the destination of \nthis path that we are seeking. Let's work together to get there as soon \nas possible.\n\n\n                     St. Croix River Valley Bridge\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I come to the floor today on another topic; that is, \nto thank and congratulate the House of Representatives, which earlier \nhanded a great victory to the people of Wisconsin and Minnesota by \npassing legislation that will finally allow construction to begin on a \nstronger, safer bridge in the St. Croix River Valley. After 30 years of \ndebate and delay, we have finally gotten it done, and I am proud to say \nit was done with broad support in both Chambers.\n  The legislation I introduced in the Senate to allow this bridge to be \nbuilt passed unanimously in January, and our Senate bill has passed the \nHouse today with the overwhelming backing of 339 Members, making the \nfinal vote count 339 to 80. This was truly a team effort, and it is an \ninspiring example of what we can accomplish when we are willing to put \npolitics aside and come together to do what is right for the people we \nrepresent.\n  I thank my colleagues in the House for their hard work and dedication \nin moving this legislation forward: Representatives Ron Kind, Sean \nDuffy, Michele Bachmann, Chip Cravaack, and Tammy Baldwin. I also thank \nSecretary Ray LaHood and his staff at the Department of Transportation, \nas well as Governors Mark Dayton and Scott Walker for their leadership \nat the State level.\n  In both Minnesota and Wisconsin, there is overwhelming consensus \nabout the critical need for a new bridge in the St. Croix River Valley. \nThere are sometimes disputes on what that bridge should look like, but \nthere tends to be consensus that we simply can't have a lift bridge \nbuilt in the 1930s, with 18,000 cars going over it. The current lift \nbridge was built in 1931. Chunks of rusting steel and concrete fall off \nand into the river below. Traffic backs up behind it, especially in the \nsummer months, sometimes for a mile. Cars are lined up by houses, cars \nare lined up by businesses, and it is not a desirable situation for \nanyone in the town of Stillwater.\n  The Minnesota Department of Transportation has listed the bridge as \nbeing ``structurally deficient'' and ``fracture critical,'' meaning if \none component of the bridge fails, the entire structure fails. Simply \nput, the bridge cannot meet the needs of the region either in terms of \npublic safety or in supporting traffic caused by a growing population.\n  As the bridge has aged, we have seen significant increases in \ncongestion. This is an especially big problem in the summer months when \nthe bridge lifts frequently to allow watercraft to pass, causing \ntraffic to back up on both sides of the bridge, increasing gridlock and \nair pollution, hindering economic activity, and threatening public \nsafety, particularly when emergency vehicles are unable to pass \nthrough.\n  Here are the numbers: The current structure was designed to support \n11,200 vehicles a day. It cannot handle the average of 18,400 cars that \ncross it every day, let alone anticipated increases in usage. But with \nthis new bridge, 48,000 vehicles will be able to cross safely and \nefficiently every day. This is important from a public safety \nperspective, but it also means new channels for economic growth. \nWithout a new bridge, anticipated usage would reach 23,500 by 2030. \nWith a new bridge, anticipated usage will meet 43,000 vehicles per day. \nThose 20,000 additional vehicles will mean more opportunity for local \nindustry and more customers for local businesses made possible by an \ninfrastructure capable of supporting new growth and development.\n  When we look at the numbers, it is easy to see why my Senate \nlegislation was able to pass not only the Senate without any \nopposition, but it is easy to see why the House passed the bill by such \na wide bipartisan margin. We are less than an inch away from the finish \nline. Now we need the President of the United States to sign the bill.\n  I spoke with Secretary LaHood this morning. I don't anticipate there \nwill be an issue. He was very positive about the bridge. But we need a \nprompt signature. The people of Minnesota and Wisconsin have already \nwaited 30 years. They cannot afford to wait any longer. We cannot \nafford to delay. It is time to finally get this bridge done.\n  I, once again, thank all of my colleagues who worked hard to advance \nthis bill. Michele Bachmann in the House led the effort on the \nMinnesota side, and I led the effort in the Senate. I thank the other \nSenators who were so good to support this bill, including Senator \nFranken, Senator Kohl, and Senator Johnson.\n  I look forward to standing with all of my colleagues when the \nPresident signs this bill into law. I look forward to standing with my \ncolleagues again on that proud day in the near future when we finally \nbreak ground on a stronger, safer bridge for the St. Croix River \nValley.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                      Progress for Deamonte Driver\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I come to the Senate floor to mark \nthe fifth anniversary of Deamonte Driver's death. Deamonte was a 12-\nyear-old who lived in Prince George's County, MD, only a few short \nmiles from here. He died 5 years ago at the Children's National Medical \nCenter in Washington, DC, from a brain infection caused by an untreated \ntooth abscess.\n  The Driver family, like many families across the country, lacked \ndental insurance. At one point his family had Medicaid coverage, but \nthey lost it because they had moved into a temporary shelter and their \npaperwork fell through the cracks. When advocates for the family tried \nto help, it took more than 20 calls just to find a dentist who would \ntreat him.\n  Deamonte began to complain about headaches on January 11. Then, an \nevaluation at Children's Hospital led beyond basic dental care to \nemergency brain surgery. He later experienced seizures, and a second \noperation was required. Even though he received additional treatment \nand therapy, and he appeared to be recovering, medical intervention \ncame too late. By the end of his treatment, the total cost to our \nhealth care system exceeded $\\1/4\\ million--more than 3,000 times the \n$80 it would have cost for a tooth extraction.\n  Deamonte Driver passed away on Sunday, February 25, 2007. Deamonte's \ndeath was a national tragedy. It was a tragedy because it could have \nbeen prevented if he had received timely and proper basic dental care. \nIt was a tragedy because it happened right here in the United States, \nin one of the most affluent States in the Nation. It happened in a \nState with one of the best dental schools in the Nation--the University \nof Maryland's. It happened in Prince George's County, whose border is \nless than 6 miles from where we are standing in the U.S. Capitol.\n  I have spoken on the Senate floor about Deamonte Driver several times \nsince that tragedy, and in the intervening years, in both my home State \nof Maryland and nationally, we have made progress. When Deamonte's case \nwas brought to light, I believe it served as a wake-up call for our \nNation. It brought home what former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop \nonce said: ``There is no health without oral health.''\n  Medical researchers have discovered the nexus between tooth plaque \nand heart disease, that chewing stimulates brain cell growth, and that \ngum disease can signal diabetes, liver ailments, and hormone \nimbalances. They have identified the vital connection between oral \nhealth research and advanced treatments such as gene therapy, which can \nhelp patients with chronic renal failure. They know investing in basic \ndental care can save money down the road in costly medical \ninterventions for other diseases.\n\n  But for all the research findings, without insurance coverage and \nadequate access to providers, we know millions of children and adults \nwill have oral health care needs that remain unmet. That is why the \nprogress we have made over the past 5 years is so important to \nAmerica's health. So I have come to the floor today to talk about what \nwe have achieved and how we can move forward as a nation to ensure \nbetter access to oral health care.\n  The Maryland delegation is proud that Maryland has emerged as a \nnational leader in this area, launching a $1.2 million oral health \nliteracy campaign, raising Medicaid reimbursement rates for dentists, \nand providing some\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\nallied health professionals and hygienists the opportunity to practice \noutside of clinics. Today, the Deamonte Driver Dental Project Van, \nwhich was dedicated in front of the U.S. Capitol in May 2010 provides \nservices in underserved neighborhoods in Prince George's County, thanks \nto the efforts launched by members of the Robert T. Freeman Dental \nSociety. This society, an arm of the National Dental Association, is \nnamed for Dr. Robert Tanner Freeman, who in 1869 became the first Black \ngraduate of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.\n  Congressman Elijah Cummings and I were joined that day by Mrs. Alyce \nDriver and her sons; the project's cofounders Drs. Hazel Harper and \nBelinda Carver-Taylor; and the National Dental Association President, \nDr. Walter Owens.\n  In 2009, 2 years after Deamonte's death, Congress took up the \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. In a \nfrustrating attempt to locate a dentist for her child, Deamonte \nDriver's mother and her advocates had to contact numerous offices \nbefore locating one who would treat him.\n  For a variety of reasons, it is difficult for Medicaid and CHIP \nenrollees to find dental care, and working parents whose children \nqualify for those programs are likely to be employed at jobs where they \ncan't spend 2 hours a day on the phone to find a provider. So part of \nthe CHIP reauthorization now requires HHS to include on its Insure Kids \nNow Web site a list of participating dentists and benefit information \nfor all 50 States and the District of Columbia.\n  Also, in 2009, Congress passed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America \nAct. That law created the Healthy Futures Corps, which provides grants \nto the States and nonprofit organizations so they can fund national \nservice in low-income communities. It will allow us to put into action \ntools that can help us close the gap in health status--prevention and \nhealth promotion. For too long we have acknowledged health disparities, \nstudied them, and written reports about them. With the help of the \nsenior Senator from Maryland, my colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski, \nwe added language to that law specifying oral health as an area of \nfocus.\n  Now the Healthy Futures Corps can help recruit young people to work \nin the dental profession, where they can serve in areas that we have \nshortages of providers in urban and rural areas. It will fund the work \nof individuals who can help parents find available oral health services \nfor themselves and their children. It will make a difference in the \nlives of the Healthy Futures Corps members who will work in underserved \ncommunities and in the lives and health of those who get improved \naccess to care.\n  Then, in 2010, we passed the Affordable Care Act which guarantees \npediatric oral health care as part of each State's essential benefit \nhealth care package. The law also establishes an oral health care \nprevention education program at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention targeted toward key populations, including children and \npregnant women, and it created demonstration programs to encourage \ninnovation in oral health delivery. It also significantly expanded \nworkforce training programs for oral health professionals.\n  Moving forward, the States have a critical role to play in ensuring \nthat the Affordable Care Act benefit is designed to incentivize \nprevention, recognize that some children have greater risks of dental \ndisease than others, and deliver care based on their level of risk. \nAmong the most cost-effective ways to improve children's health care \nare investments in prevention. Dental sealants--clear plastic coatings \napplied to the chewing surfaces of molars--have been proven to prevent \n60 percent of tooth decay at one-third the cost of filling a cavity. So \nwe must make sure prevention is a key part of every State's benefit \npackage.\n  Further, in 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nlaunched its oral health initiative, establishing a coordinated \nmultiagency effort to improve access to care across the Nation.\n  Yet for all the progress we have made, we know more must be done. In \n2009, the last year for which we have complete data that is available, \nmore than 16 million American children went without dental care. That \nis not acceptable.\n  Our Nation has made significant progress in improving children's \ndental care in the 5 years since the death of Deamonte Driver, but \nthere is still much work to be done.\n  Case in point: Last summer, 24-year-old Kyle Willis of Ohio died from \nan untreated tooth infection that spread to his brain. In fact, the \nhealth of millions of Americans is jeopardized because they cannot get \ntreatment for tooth decay.\n  The access problem has become so severe that many people are forced \nto seek treatment for tooth pain in the Nation's emergency rooms, \nincreasing the overall cost of health care and receiving uncoordinated \ncare in the least cost-efficient setting. In fact, more people seek \ntreatment in emergency rooms for tooth pain than they do for asthma.\n  The Pew Children's Dental Campaign produces report cards that grade \nthe States on eight policies that are evidence-based solutions to the \nproblem of tooth decay.\n  Maryland received an A grade in both reports for meeting or exceeding \nthese benchmarks, which include dental sealant programs, community \nwater fluoridation, Medicaid reimbursement and enrollment, and \ncollection of data on children's dental health.\n  This is even more striking because in the late 1990s, Maryland had \none of the worst records in the Nation regarding oral health care for \nits underserved population. But in 2011, the Pew Center on the States \nranked Maryland as the top State in the country for oral health.\n  However, the access issues remain. As Mrs. Driver's efforts to find \ncare for her son showed, low-income families have great difficulty \nobtaining care due to a shortage of dentists willing to treat Medicaid \npatients.\n  Nationally, the National Health Service Corps addresses the \nnationwide shortage of primary care oral health providers in dental \nhealth professional shortage areas by offering incentives in the form \nof scholarships and loan repayments to primary care dentists and \nregistered dental hygienists to practice in underserved communities.\n  I will continue to work to increase funding for grants to States and \nexpand training opportunities for dentists. We do not have enough \nprofessionals who are trained and available to treat children and \nadults with dental problems, and it is our responsibility to fix that. \nWe must improve reimbursement to dental providers in offices and \nclinics so no one who needs dental treatment will be turned away.\n  I conclude my remarks with congratulatory wishes to Mrs. Alyce \nDriver. For as painful as Deamonte's passing was for all of us, nothing \ncan compare to the loss of one's own child. Yet Mrs. Driver has worked \nhard and she has been awarded a dental tech degree. She is now out \nthere helping others with dental care. She will be going back to school \nnext month to receive training in radiology. Yes, in Maryland and \nthroughout the Nation, there are signs of hope for the future of oral \nhealth care.\n  February is National Children's Dental Health Month, and I wish to \nexpress my appreciation to the many nonprofit organizations, \nuniversities, and providers who are also working across the Nation to \nmake sure we will never forget Deamonte Driver and never forget our \nresponsibility to improving oral health care for America's children.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about \nsomething that is on the minds of people in my home State of Wyoming \nand people across the country, the high cost of\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\ngasoline. When I filled up on Sunday evening in Wyoming and on Monday \nmorning on the way to the airport I noticed that the price of gasoline \nin Wyoming was 10 cents higher per gallon than it was Sunday night when \nI filled the tank. I am heading back this weekend, later today, to \nWyoming, and we will see what the cost of a gallon of gasoline will be. \nI know absolutely that the price of diesel fuel is much higher, almost \nby a dollar a gallon, than the price of regular unleaded gasoline.\n  I think it is something that is happening all across the country \nbecause even in this morning's New York Times, Thursday, March 1, 2012, \non the front page, a headline reads ``Tensions Raise Specter of Gas At \n$5 a Gallon.'' That is on the front page of the New York Times. It \nsays, ``Gasoline for $5 a gallon? The possibility is hardly far-\nfetched.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       With no clear end to tensions with Iran and Syria and \n     rising demand from countries like China, gas prices are \n     already at record highs for the winter months--averaging \n     $4.32 in California and $3.73 a gallon nationally on \n     Wednesday, according to the AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. As \n     summer approaches, demand for gasoline rises, typically \n     pushing prices up.\n\n  Again, ``no clear end to tensions in Iran and Syria and rising demand \nfrom countries like China. . . .''\n  It is interesting because, obviously, China is the country that told \nthe Prime Minister from Canada recently: We will buy all that extra oil \nyou have that apparently the President of the United States isn't \ninterested in, as he continues to block the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  That is what the American public is facing today, rising prices and \nan administration that continues to block access to an important source \nof safe, secure energy, as opposed to sending so much money overseas. \nHere we are with high gasoline prices, which is continuing to cause \nadditional hardship for American families and American businesses. When \nfamilies pay more at the pump, it impacts the quality of their lives. \nFamilies are dealing with mortgages, goods and services, and their kids \nas they continue to see the money going to fill the tank. This also \nhurts economic growth and our ability to create jobs.\n  When companies pay more for gasoline, they have less money to expand \ntheir businesses and create new jobs. Wyoming families and businesses \nknow this all too well because in Wyoming we drive longer distances \nthan most Americans. The President also knows this impacts the economy. \nThat is why he continues to give speeches on energy.\n  It is clear the President is defensive on this issue, and it is \nunderstandable because the average price of gasoline, regular unleaded, \nthe day he became President--today it is 103 percent higher, over \ndouble what it was the day President Obama took office just 3 years \nago. Again, the price of gasoline is 103 percent higher than the day \nthe President took office.\n  There are a lot of factors at play. What this does show is that the \nPresident's policies are at best ineffectual; at worst they are \ncontributing to the higher gas prices. People on both sides of the \naisle know this and are hearing it at home. This week, actually, one \nSenate Democrat wrote to the Obama administration and pointed this out. \nSpecifically, he pointed out that these are ``the highest prices we \nhave ever seen for this time of year.''\n  Unfortunately, that Senate Democrat's solution is to request that \nSaudi Arabia produce more oil. I will repeat that. His solution is to \nhave the Secretary of State ask Saudi Arabia to produce more oil.\n  Of course, the President is also considering other proposals as well. \nLike asking Saudi Arabia to produce more oil, the President's ideas \nwould put national security at risk. There I am referring to the \nPresident's threat to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This will be \nthe second time that President Obama has tapped the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. Prior to the President's decision to do that last June, it had \nonly been tapped twice for emergencies since 1975. So between 1975 and \n2011, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve had only been tapped twice for \nemergencies--in 1991 upon the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war and then \nagain more recently following Hurricane Katrina.\n  In both of these instances we are talking about actual supply \ndisruption. However, when President Obama tapped the Reserve last year, \nthere was no substantial prospect of a supply disruption. The decision \nwas based on politics, as would be the decision this time. That is why \nJay Leno, earlier this week during his nightly television show, called \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve President Obama's strategic \n``reelection'' reserve.\n  A number of my colleagues and I think there are other ways to address \nhigh gasoline prices. We understand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is \nfor emergencies, not political disasters.\n\n  It is interesting because just earlier today, the House minority \nleader Nancy Pelosi endorsed tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--\nnot because of an emergency or a crisis or supply disruption, but she \nsays ``to combat rising gas prices.''\n  There is only so much oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The \namount that was taken last year was never put back in to fill the tank. \nThe amount taken out last year was sold. If we use that money to fill \nthe tank, it is not enough--almost $1 billion more this year to fill \nthe tank than what they got for selling what they took out last year.\n  So we have a tank at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that is not \nfull, still waiting to be filled from what was taken from it last year. \nNow, here we are a year later, and the President, as well as Nancy \nPelosi, is considering tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve again, \ndrawing it down again, making us that much more vulnerable in case of a \ntrue emergency.\n  The President actually has some options that make a lot of sense to a \nlot of Americans. An option, of course, is to increase American energy \nproduction. The President can begin to follow through on his words in \nMiami a week or so ago, when he said, ``I'll do whatever I can to \ndevelop every source of American energy.''\n  The President can provide more access to Federal lands and waters. \nThis week we learned the oil and gas production on Federal public lands \nand public waters is down. In 2011 there was a 14-percent decrease in \noil production on public lands and water from 2010--less energy \nproduced in Federal lands and waters. There was an 11-percent decrease \nin gas production from 2010.\n  In Miami, the President said he has ``directed my administration to \nlook at every single area where we can make an impact and help \nconsumers in the months ahead, [including] permitting. . . .''\n  Again, the President needs to follow through on his words. He can \nbegin by increasing the number of permits issued for development in the \nGulf of Mexico. I understand that the administration has issued only 21 \npermits so far this year. In 2010 the administration issued 32 permits \nby this time.\n  The President can also increase access to other offshore areas. He \ncan provide access to offshore areas in the Atlantic and the Pacific \nOceans, not just the Gulf of Mexico. In November he proposed an \noffshore leasing plan that excluded the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific \nOcean. What kind of offshore leasing plan is that? The President \nexcluded areas off the coast of Virginia, even though both Senators and \nthe Governor of Virginia supported such energy exploration. The \nPresident said no.\n  The President can also increase access to onshore areas. The \nPresident can open areas in Alaska, and he can support proposals to \nopen ANWR. Both Senators from Alaska--one Republican and one Democrat--\nand the Governor strongly support opening ANWR for exploration. The \nPresident should too. The President should also take steps to \nfacilitate onshore exploration in the West. Specifically, he should \nscrap new regulations requiring what is called ``master leasing and \ndevelopment plans.''\n  These regulations were put into place over 2 years ago by the \nSecretary of the Interior. It is unclear why the Secretary issued such \nregulations. They add more redtape and cause more bureaucratic delay \nand slow down American energy production.\n  Of course, there are other regulations that drive up the cost of \nAmerican energy--specifically, the EPA's forthcoming tier III \nregulations which will affect America's refineries. A recent study says \nthis rule could increase the\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\ncost of manufacturing gasoline, which will add to what Americans are \npaying at the pump and will add to the pain at the pump. They could \nalso raise operating costs for refineries by anywhere from $5 billion \nto $13 billion a year. They could force as many as seven U.S. \nrefineries to shut down and could lead to a 7- to 14-percent reduction \nin gasoline supplies for American refineries. These policies, by this \nadministration, are completely unacceptable. The President should, at \nthe very least, delay the issuance of this current rule.\n\n  In addition to providing more access to Federal lands and Federal \nwaters and eliminating burdensome regulations, the President should \nfollow through on his words--his words--and address what he called \ndelivery bottlenecks. Specifically, he should address the bottlenecks \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline would relieve. I am referring to 100,000 \nbarrels of oil a day that the pipeline would be able to ship from \nMontana and North Dakota.\n  That is right; we are talking about homegrown American energy. Of \ncourse, the President ought to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline coming \nin from Canada. It is North American oil from Canada but specific and \nsignificant amounts of oil--100,000 barrels a day--from Montana and \nNorth Dakota. Right now, there isn't sufficient pipeline capacity out \nof North Dakota and Montana. They are shipping the oil on trucks and \ntrains, and that is much more expensive than shipping it by pipeline. \nApproving the Keystone XL Pipeline is an easy decision and the \nPresident should make this decision immediately.\n  It was interesting today to see in Politico--one of the local papers \non Capitol Hill--an article quoting Bill Clinton as saying, ``We should \nembrace'' the Keystone XL. The first sentence of the article says:\n\n       Bill Clinton says it is time to build the Keystone XL \n     Pipeline.\n\n  Perhaps President Obama ought to listen to President Clinton.\n  Finally, the President says there are no silver bullets. That doesn't \nmean the President should sit on the sidelines. It doesn't mean his \nonly options are asking Saudi Arabia to boost production or opening the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. The President needs to promote American \nenergy production. He can eliminate costly regulations and he can \napprove the Keystone XL Pipeline. Those are the steps the President \nneeds to take, and he needs to do that in the very near future because \nI believe we are going to continue to see headlines such as the one in \ntoday's New York Times: ``Tensions Raise Specter of Gas at $5 a \nGallon.''\n  With that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Death of Marie Colvin in Syria\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, Marie Colvin died last week, \nWednesday, in Syria. As I speak, her body is still in Homs because the \nAssad regime refuses to honor the centuries-old tradition of human \ndecency that even in war you are allowed to recover your dead.\n  An American official in a position to know about the circumstances of \nher death has used with me the word ``murder,'' and this is not an \nofficial who uses such words loosely. News reports have suggested Marie \nwas targeted using her cell phone signals. Why was she killed? Marie \nonce said: ``Covering a war means going to places torn by chaos, \ndestruction, and death, and trying to bear witness.''\n  She was killed because she was doing what she was passionate about \nand what her gift was; that is, to bear witness.\n  Marie was in Syria to bear witness to the massacre of the innocent in \nthe city of Homs by the Assad regime. Her last report to the BBC was of \na baby killed by shrapnel, dying in its mother's arms. That baby had no \nvoice and that mother had no voice, but Marie was there. She was there \nmaking sure the dead did not die unheralded and the killers did not \nescape unwatched. She was there so they wouldn't get away with it. She \nwas there to bear witness.\n  The dictionary tells us that to bear witness means ``to see, to be \npresent at, or know at firsthand.'' It means to ``testify.'' It means \n``to show by your existence that something is true.''\n  This was Marie. Over and over she put herself in harm's way as she \nfollowed her calling to bear witness to the atrocities of our world.\n  In Sri Lanka's brutal conflict, she was hit by the explosion of a \nrocket-propelled grenade, and in addition to other injuries, she lost \nsight in one eye. She was shot at that day after calling out, ``I'm a \njournalist.''\n  In the Balkans and Chechnya, at Libya and around the world, she went \nto bear witness to suffering and corruption. I think she spent more \ntime on the ground in Libya than any other Western correspondent.\n  Marie was proud of this work, saying:\n\n       We can and do make a difference in exposing the horrors of \n     war and especially the atrocities that befall civilians.\n\n  Sometimes she managed to do more than just expose atrocities. In East \nTimor, she went to bear witness to the massacres. When the U.N. \nthreatened to pull out of a base, leaving local employees and those \nsheltering there to the mercies of the massacre, Marie announced, ``I'm \nstaying with them.''\n  That created a new predicament for the U.N. leadership, and faced \nwith Marie's courage, they decided to stay. Massacre averted.\n  Marie was special. Her friends all knew it. Her colleagues knew it. \nThe people who were trapped in the wars and conflicts she covered and \nwho saw her there, sharing their risks and their suffering, and who \nknew someone would bear witness knew it. The Bible talks of bearing \nwitness. It tells that John the Baptist ``came as a witness, to bear \nwitness about the Light, that all might believe through him.''\n  There is a parallel. Marie went as a witness. She went to bear \nwitness in the places cloaked in darkness, that we all might perceive \nthrough her. With her death, it is our turn to bear witness. Marie \nColvin had a calling, and it is our turn to bear witness to the courage \nand the passion of that calling. It is our time to bear witness to the \ngrace and humor and brains and skill with which Marie Colvin pursued \nthat calling. It is worth noting Marie did this all with style. I don't \nthink Marie would want the record to fail to reflect that she had \nstyle.\n  There has been an outpouring since the news of Marie's death spread \naround the world. From heads of state, famous writers, press \ncelebrities, from old friends and colleagues, and from those whose \npraise she valued the most, the small band of brothers and sisters who \npracticed the dangerous craft of conflict journalism, there has been a \ntorrent of grief and praise. I have culled from this torrent a \ncollection of remembrances, reflections, tributes, and obituaries about \nMarie that I now ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Yale Daily News, Feb. 23, 2012]\n\n          From the Archives: Colvin '78 Relects on Yale Career\n\n                           (By Marie Colvin)\n\n       The piece below, titled ``Running out of time,'' was \n     written by Marie Colvin '78 for the special issue of the News \n     handed out at Commencement 1978. Colvin, a seasoned war \n     correspondent, was killed by a mortar strike on Wednesday \n     while covering the escalating violence in the city of Homs.\n       The most memorable event of my Yale career occurred in the \n     dining hall. At Silliman lunch last week, I was eating and \n     commiserating with a group of fellow seniors, slaphappy at \n     the thought of all the work to be done in the last week of \n     term. Everyone had a how-to story, the kind that only \n     circulates at finals time, like the one about the student who \n     handed in a bluebook with ``IV'' written on the cover, \n     inscribed with one sentence on the first page: ``and that's \n     the way it was in seventeenth century England,'' and received \n     a final grade of ``B'' from some T.A.; talk about surefire \n     dean's excuses and where to catch a quick 24-hour bug, always \n     good for a night at DUH.\n       At a pause in the conversation, during which I flashed on \n     the twelve pages per day I'd have to write for the next week, \n     a friend next to me sighed and said profoundly, ``There's \n     just not enough time.'' It came out of the blue, but it was \n     the most relevant non-sequitur ever uttered.\n       It sums up my Yale career. I've spent the last weeks of \n     every semester holed up in the Sillibrary, coffeepot by my \n     side, moving from one stack of books and clutter of papers to \n     the next like a guest at the Mad Hatter's Tea Party. The last \n     week of my senior year I was there again, drinking coffee by \n     the pot,\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\n     sleeping two hours nightly, marshaling enough credits to \n     graduate.\n       That's why I wasn't a varsity athlete, or an editor of the \n     Oldest College Daily, why every room I've ever lived in has \n     been almost furnished. It's why my papers come back marked \n     ``good potential, inadequately realized.'' And it's why I \n     can't tell you what it feels like to be finished with Yale, \n     whether it's euphoric or just anti-climatic, because I'm not, \n     and by the time I am everyone will have left and I won't even \n     be able to ask anyone.\n       It takes everybody but the football team four years to \n     realize that there is no way to do the work expected of you, \n     that teachers and deans don't really expect you to do it all \n     and that the real test of intelligence is to do the minimum \n     amount of work for the maximum reward. The football team \n     somehow learns freshman year what it takes everyone else \n     three years (it took me four). The most important things to \n     look for when choosing a course are not relevancy to future \n     career, interesting subject, or something you should know. \n     Number of papers and pages per paper, number of exams, and \n     Course Critique grade point spread are all you need to look \n     for. And if the football team shows up for the first lecture, \n     you've chosen correctly.\n       The finer points of course selection involve arranging \n     enough of a workload so that when you do go out to Rudy's, \n     Mory's, or the Elizabethan Club for tea you can feel a twinge \n     of guilt. And so that you can participate in end-of-semester-\n     conversations.\n       The worst thing about graduating is that I can't remember \n     what I did all semester. I thought I was working, but that \n     seems impossible. I've started promoting the theory that Yale \n     is centered in a time warp. Time doesn't just seem to pass \n     twice as fast, it does. We have only one week to the \n     universal two.\n       I haven't accepted the fact that I am not going to do \n     everything I kept putting off. I am not graduating Phi Beta \n     Kappa, I don't have 48 credits and 47 A's, I will never read \n     the bookcase of course books diligently bought in the Co-op, \n     lined up neatly with their binders unwrinkled. I will not \n     paint the fourth wall in my bedroom. I will probably never \n     even find out the name of that curly-haired boy in my English \n     seminar I've been flirting with all year.\n       It's hard to say even what I've learned here. I don't think \n     I've finished adjusting yet. I have nothing striking to say \n     about anything and it seems like I should. I've changed from \n     a regular science major to a science major who only takes \n     English courses (there was no time to change majors), learned \n     about weenies, jocks, and turned-up collars, learned how to \n     run, not fast but far enough to enjoy the sweat, learned how \n     to do footnotes. Unlearned a lot too--like weenies and jocks \n     don't exist and that turned-up collar means zilch. And I've \n     learned how ridiculous it is to try to convince people that \n     you are serious about something, that you have a direction. \n     Best of all, I missed all the deadlines--LSAT, GRE, \n     scholarships, grants, and fellowships--not enough time--so I \n     guess I'll wake up Tuesday morning and start thinking about \n     it. Or else just buy a plane ticket.\n       The one realization I have come to after four years is that \n     I can still make all the mistakes I want and it doesn't \n     matter. I remind myself of this often, whenever I feel the \n     ``let's get serious mood'' coming on, or I lunch with law-\n     business-medical school prospectives, or read an article \n     about shopping bag ladies in the New York subway system. Not \n     that there's anything at all wrong with going to law-\n     business-medical school, but enough people stick up for it, \n     and that's not the point anyway.\n       The point is that it doesn't matter if you mess up, choose \n     the wrong road, flop in Vegas. What's important is to throw \n     yourself in head first, to ``go for the gusto.'' And if you \n     blow it, you blow it. What we have to worry about now is \n     success. Once you're successful, it becomes embarrassing to \n     make mistakes, and more difficult to grab onto the nearest \n     straw and hold on. You can always be a star, so what's the \n     rush?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Marie Colvin--The Natural\n\n                          (By Allison Silver)\n\n       I have been reading all day about Marie Colvin, the \n     terrific London Sunday Times foreign correspondent who was \n     killed Wednesday in Syria. David Remnick wrote a lovely piece \n     about her. It captures her coolness and professionalism.\n       Marie was a remarkable writer--and person. Talented and \n     persistent: An unbeatable combo.\n       I knew her back at Yale, and she often cited me as the \n     person who started her writing. And I think I was. Her \n     mother, Rosemarie Colvin, described Wednesday how her \n     daughter had decided to be a journalist back when she was \n     writing for The Yale Daily News.\n       I was an editor on the Yalie Daily when Marie was in a \n     seminar with me. She was funny and savvy and amazing looking. \n     Tall and slim, with a baby face surrounded by masses of black \n     corkscrew curls. Her best friend was equally tall--and they \n     stood out on campus.\n       She hung out with all the campus ``writers''--who took \n     prestigious writing classes but wouldn't deign to take part \n     in the hurly-burly of daily campus journalism. They were \n     serious writers--and serious partiers. I knew most of them--\n     but her least of all. She was not quite regarded as a \n     ``writer,'' like they were.\n       In that class, I realized Marie had a clear, clean talent \n     for writing. So I kept on her to write for me at the News. \n     She started doing longer reported feature pieces--and \n     thrived.\n       I could see she was jazzed by the process of reporting. She \n     had started off insisting that she was not the writer of the \n     group. And I kept saying to her you can do this. So do it! \n     And she did. She was a natural.\n       With all that persistence, of course she pursued it and \n     went on to serious international reporting. I remember, back \n     in the 90s I think, she was one of the elite Middle East \n     reporters who attained an interview with Qadhafi--a feat she \n     pulled off again recently.\n       Meanwhile, I'm still a desk jockey. As my career took me to \n     Los Angeles, New York and DC, she was reporting from hot \n     spots around the globe. I rarely saw her, which is something \n     I will always regret. But whenever I ran into her, we talked \n     about Yale and our varied paths from there.\n       She lived the life she wanted to. And that is to be \n     admired.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Tribute to Marie Colvin\n\n                           (By Gerald Weaver)\n\n       Marie Colvin sat across the table from me in the kitchen of \n     her Thames-side home in the Hammersmith neighborhood of \n     London on October 18, 2011, as she looked me in the eye and \n     gave me a completely unexpected answer to a question I had \n     long planned to asked her. ``So, Marie, do you have some kind \n     of a death wish or something?'' I had asked, waiting and \n     watching her intently. I had expected that she maybe she \n     would react a bit too defensively or that she might have \n     otherwise partially admitted to the premise of the question. \n     But I realized immediately that it had been the \n     quintessential stupid question. The gist of her answer was \n     that these were normal people who were being attacked, \n     bombed, uprooted and murdered in the stories she was \n     uncovering and reporting. The normal people who would read \n     her reports should have a normal reaction to them, she said. \n     And by that, she meant they should be appalled and horrified. \n     So for Marie it was merely normal to pick up and go find the \n     most terrible story that no other reporter would cover and \n     then report it as a matter of fact. The danger simply did not \n     occur to her. She neither feared nor courted it. As I \n     listened to her, I heard the word ``human'' for the word \n     ``normal.''\n       She also had no interest in romanticizing or aggrandizing \n     what it was that she did in her work. She used to laugh it \n     off when I would call her ``the distaff Ernest Hemingway of \n     Great Britain.'' I was in London those four months ago at her \n     urging, because I had just written the first three chapters \n     of a novel that I had only started and only because she had \n     urged me to write it, and which I have only recently \n     completed with her encouragement and through her help. She \n     then started talking to me about us contacting literary \n     agents in London that she knew and it occurred to me ask her \n     when she was going to write her own book about her very \n     interesting, exciting and inspiring life. I knew that the \n     possibility of such a book would be why agents would have \n     wanted to court her. She only laughed and suggested that \n     maybe I should write her book. She was only interested in \n     reporting, not in making herself the story. She was in her \n     life and in her death utterly heroic, but she would have been \n     the last person to think that or to want to even talk about \n     it.\n       Marie also had that same good natured disinterest when it \n     came to politics, or to her more difficult role as a woman in \n     her profession, or to moving about in a part of the world \n     that was not particularly easy for a woman. For the almost \n     forty years that I knew her, she only ever addressed politics \n     obliquely. I always assumed she was a liberal. But it was \n     more than that and it was much different. She was, through \n     her work and her life, a liberalizing force within the world. \n     She hoped to speak to a better part within us all that she \n     felt simply must empathize with the least fortunate, the \n     terrorized, the forgotten and the innocents who are under \n     attack. And when she called me on her satellite phone one \n     night this past December, it was only in passing that she \n     mentioned how she had been chased through Tahrir Square on \n     the same night that many women had been assaulted there. And \n     even then she only spoke of her gratitude to the Egyptians \n     who had saved her and not of the special dangers to her as a \n     woman.\n       She used to always apologize for often being out of touch, \n     for answering with one phone call three or four weeks of \n     daily emails, for disappearing for weeks or months on end. I \n     have no doubt that for many of us who were even her closest \n     friends that her columns in the Sunday Times were perhaps the \n     most reliable way for us to hear her voice and know what was \n     on her mind. It was almost as if she was expressing her worry \n     that her relationships were like her politics or what she \n     might say about her work or what it meant to her to be a \n     woman war correspondent. They came after her need to tell the \n     story. My best insight into this came the day after I had \n     asked my stupid question, on October 19, 2011, the day it was \n     reported that Muammar Gadaffi had been killed.\n       I watched her at her home in that morning as she \n     accomplished what would have taken anyone else several days. \n     She juggled several phones, gave an interview to National \n     Public Radio, made calls in English and French to\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\n     make arrangements for two separate clandestine border \n     crossings, made flight arrangements, coordinated with other \n     reporters, communicated with her office, dug up leads, \n     tracked down reports. And that was all the while she was \n     packing and gathering up several different phones and \n     communications uplinks, taking deliveries at the front door, \n     and pulling out her helmet, her flak jacket and all her other \n     protective gear, which was all marked, ``Marie Colvin, O +,'' \n     for her blood type. She laughed about that too, and all the \n     time she was apologizing for cutting our visit short. She was \n     generous to a fault and she showed her idiosyncratic \n     disinterest when it came to compliments. And when I pitched \n     in and helped her prepare to leave in what limited ways I \n     could, she was surprised by it and slightly embarrassed.\n       But what I noticed that morning has stuck with me now that \n     she is gone. There can be no doubt of the magnitude of the \n     loss that is encompassed by her death, personally to her \n     family and friends, professionally in the realm of \n     journalism, and even to the world in what has been lost in \n     the reporting of stories that are the most harrowing and \n     dangerous to reporters and perhaps the most important for the \n     rest of us to know. When I read what has been written and \n     what I write about her passing, and even when I read what has \n     been reported about what Marie herself had said about the \n     importance of reporting these stories, I realize that all of \n     it is true but that all of it is necessarily a reduction of \n     what she actually was. That morning she was incredibly alive \n     with a passion to get to the story and to tell it. And she \n     was filled with what can only be called joy. In all the moods \n     and stages of her life in which I had witnessed her, at that \n     moment of going to cover the story she was the most of who \n     she really was, and she was at one with it.\n       She was a tirelessly brave and compassionate female war \n     correspondent, true. But to me she really was what few people \n     ever get the opportunity to be and what almost none of us \n     have the will to be. She was a free artist of herself and of \n     her life. Her commanding if almost sole interest was in being \n     our eyes and ears in places where most people would be afraid \n     to look or to go. I think the joy I saw in her was that she \n     knew how rare such a life can be, and that she was fortunate \n     to be living it. That is the small personal consolation that \n     I draw from her death. It would be tremendous if something \n     positive would come out of it in terms of expediting the \n     end of the massacre in Syria, but I believe that is \n     something even she would not have expected and would have \n     been something for which she had only hoped. The possible \n     larger consolation would be to the way in which her death \n     might speak, in the same way that her life and her \n     reporting had, to that part of us that should care for the \n     world's innocent and obscure victims. And I also hope that \n     it might speak to some others who might be inspired to go \n     in her wake and report those same kinds of stories to the \n     world, and do so regardless of the personal risk and do it \n     heroically, as did my friend, Marie Colvin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            For Marie Colvin\n\n                           (By Katrina Heron)\n\n       I've spent my adult life refusing to envision an obituary \n     for Marie. I planned with all my conscious powers never to \n     read one, and I promised myself that I would never have to \n     write one. Along with her family and her great caravan of \n     other friends, I celebrated Marie's determination to put \n     herself in harm's way, to ``bear witness'' as a foreign \n     correspondent in so many parts of the world--Lebanon, Libya, \n     Israel, the Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank, \n     Chechnya, Sri Lanka, East Timor, Iraq--and waited each time \n     she went out on assignment, fretting, for her to signal the \n     all-clear. ``Will call when I'm outta here,'' she would write \n     as she filed her last story from the danger zone.\n       From our mid-20s until yesterday, that fragile insistence \n     of mine mostly held. There were terrifying moments, and Marie \n     was gravely wounded in 2001; caught in a firefight in Sri \n     Lanka, she lost sight in one eye and nearly died from \n     shrapnel wounds. But she survived, and when she arrived back \n     in New York, we went together to interview ophthalmological \n     surgeons (waving away, regretfully, the very handsome young \n     doctor who eagerly auditioned with his grasp of geopolitics), \n     shopped for eye patches and drank quite a lot of Champagne. I \n     didn't stop worrying after that, but my hope swelled to a \n     greater confidence. Marie took the greatest possible \n     precautions in conflict areas, so far from rash or merely \n     impulsive that other journalists often looked to her for \n     guidance on the risk calculus of a given situation. She \n     focused on bringing back the story and didn't dwell \n     personally on the dire circumstances in which she found \n     herself except insofar as they served her formidable powers \n     of description and, often, hilarity.\n       I look back over the last year or so of scattered emails, \n     sitting there innocently in the queue. She wrote last June: \n     ``I am STILL in Misrata, Libya, and the ever brutal Gadaffi \n     is ruining any chance of a social life or indeed a life by \n     selfishly refusing to Go. Despite all the graffiti on walls \n     here giving excellent advice, ``Just Go!''\n       I had one of my best offers ever today. A rebel fighter on \n     the front ambled over, on his break from firing, so to speak, \n     and said, ``Hey, do you want to shoot the mortar?'' It is \n     definitely a sign that I may have been here too long because \n     I REALLY WANTED TO SHOOT THE MORTAR. I mean, when will I ever \n     get a chance to shoot a mortar again?''\n       A couple of days later: ``I am sitting in the gloaming on \n     the stern of a Turkish boat in Misurata harbor, looking out \n     over an ugly seascape of cranes and broken concrete and \n     blasted buildings from months of bombing. I am finally \n     homeward bound, a day's journey to Benghazi, a few days in \n     the rebel capital for a story then an overnight drive to \n     Cairo. It gives one respect for travel, having to run the \n     spectrum of transport. It will be strange coming out of this \n     world that, however mad, has a simplicity to it of sand and \n     courage and bombs and sleep and canned tuna and a few shirts, \n     washed out in a bowl when the dust threatens to take over.''\n       A bit farther on, there's an invitation to connect with her \n     on LinkedIn, which prompted some hazing about whether she was \n     trying to beat the rap on her famously abysmal grasp of basic \n     networking technology (she used a satellite phone but was \n     flummoxed by her iPhone). In truth, she was a technical \n     wizard of a different sort, a skilled sailor who had done a \n     lot of deep-water racing and had recently, proudly, earned \n     her yachtmaster qualification. She grew up sailing in Long \n     Island Sound, and the loss of vision had slowed her down not \n     a bit.\n       There's a quick back and forth toward fall on a subject we \n     talked about often by phone and during our last couple of \n     visits--me going to London, where she lived, or her coming to \n     California, where I am. She kept saying she wanted to spend \n     less time in the Middle East and more time at home--and on \n     the ocean. She had briefly tried a desk job at her paper, the \n     Times of London, but of course it drove her nuts. Still, the \n     job was getting more perilous. Tim Hetherington, the \n     photojournalist killed in Misrata in April 2011, had been \n     very generously helping me on a book I was editing about \n     Liberia, where he'd spent a good deal of time. Marie knew \n     about the project and had written me: ``Weirdly, I went by \n     the place today where Tim and [photographer] Chris Hondros \n     were killed. A shiver of mortality. The forecourt of the car \n     repair shop still bears the mark of the mortar shell that \n     killed them, and a starburst of chips in the concrete where \n     the metal flew out as shrapnel.''\n       Around Thanksgiving, the messages trail off for a bit, as \n     they often did. But even when I didn't know exactly where she \n     was, I didn't worry desperately. I was used to periods of \n     silence, plus there was a group of us that always passed \n     around bits of her itinerary. Sightings by other journalists \n     would filter back or someone would see her on CNN or hear her \n     on NPR. She knew she could call day or night, and I could \n     always reach at least her voice--I was thinking tonight that \n     her cell is probably still on, with its years-old, soft and \n     slightly lilting greeting. But I couldn't bear to hear it now \n     so I won't try. Christmas Day she there in my inbox, brief \n     but joyful.\n       A couple of weeks ago, Marie wrote that she was going to \n     Syria. I think her colleagues were uneasy, and I know now \n     that several of our friends tried to talk her out of it. I \n     felt fairly calm, which just goes to show you how great is \n     the power of willful optimism. In the last email I have from \n     her, she wrote: ``I am now in Beirut, negotiating with \n     smugglers to get me across the border. After six weeks in \n     Libya this year, under shelling and that low level of anxiety \n     every day brings, I had said I'll do a bit less of the hot \n     spots, but what is happening in Syria, especially Homs, is \n     criminal, so I am once again, knapsack on back with my \n     satellite phone and computer, clambering across a dark \n     border.''\n       I was fast asleep in my bed in Berkeley yesterday when \n     Marie was killed in Homs. I woke up to what the world was \n     learning--that the house she and several others were camping \n     out in had been hit by rockets; that with Marie in the lead, \n     the group had just run down the stairs to the front door when \n     a blast obliterated the entryway; that a 28-year-old French \n     photographer, Remi Ochlik, also died, and three others were \n     wounded. Right now, all of us are panicked about the \n     condition of the injured journalists, not knowing whether \n     rescue workers will be allowed in to Homs to get them. It \n     brings me back to those frantic, terrible hours in 2001 when \n     all we knew was that Marie was wounded in Sri Lanka and had \n     yet to be evacuated.\n       I have been walking around all day talking to her, asking \n     her dumbly where she is. Ever since we first met and became \n     roommates in college, we've been inseparable in one way or \n     another. In that same last email she said we should charter a \n     boat this summer--sail merrily to the ends of the earth: \n     ``More when I am back from Syria. I love you very much.''\n       The phones and email and all the rest have been humming \n     with misery, and with Marie's love. So many wonderful people \n     adored her and she them that I've been swathed in stunned, \n     overflowing warmth all day. At the same time, it's impossible \n     to believe she's dead, but then I'm scared of the moment when \n     it will be impossible not to.\n       Further tributes to Marie Colvin can be found at http://\nwhitehouse.senate.gov/.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. On behalf of a group of old friends who are stricken \nby her loss, I offer this in affection, in appreciation, and in \nmemorandum.\n  Marie's mother, Rosemarie Colvin, said of Marie:\n\n       Her legacy is: be passionate and be involved in what you \n     believe in. And do it as\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\n     thoroughly and honestly and fearlessly as you can.\n\n  Indeed.\n  With those words, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I did not know Marie personally, as my \nfriend and colleague from Rhode Island did. But his words, his passion, \nhis emotion allow us all to know her a little bit better.\n  Even just reading the newspaper accounts, she was a remarkable \nperson. But hearing from Sheldon, both here and speaking to him \nprivately, it is obvious that those who knew Marie were privileged and \nwere touched by her life long before her untimely death. She leaves an \namazing mark.\n  I just wish to say to my colleague Sheldon, there are times that \nmeasure the mettle of a person and one of them is when they go through \ngrief and tragedy. My respect for him, as high as it was before, is \nhigher still knowing what he is going through and how he has worked to \nhandle this difficult situation.\n  I rise simply as a New York Senator who represents the area, Long \nIsland, where Marie Catherine Colvin came from. We are working--Sheldon \nabove all--desperately, to bring her home to her mother Rosemarie, so \nher family can provide her with a final resting place, providing her \nwith the dignity she deserves.\n  Marie had a remarkable career. It is no doubt that not only, as \nSheldon said, the small band of journalists but many larger than that \nand anyone she knew will mourn her death for years to come because we \nhave not just lost a daring journalist, but we also have lost a \nhumanitarian, one who took her abilities as an investigator and a \nstoryteller to speak for the voiceless. It is clear from Sheldon's \nremarks and from reading the biographical accounts and her obituary \nthat this was a woman of both courage and passion who managed to sort \nof weave the two into an amazing life where she served so many.\n  Marie grew up on Long Island, attended Oyster Bay High School, and of \ncourse, as we know from what Sheldon has said, went on to study at \nYale. She studied anthropology. She moved to New York City, worked as a \nUPI police reporter on the midnight to 6 a.m. shift. That is the time \nwhen most crimes occur. That is the times in the dark, particularly in \nthose days in New York City, to be a journalist was difficult. It took \ncourage. But even then, Colvin didn't shy away from tough jobs.\n  She worked her way up, moving to Paris and later to work for the UK's \nSunday Times and became their Middle East correspondent in 1968. She \nhas been doing this kind of dangerous and important work that \ninevitably and inexorably saved lives for so many years, 27 years. \nColvin focused on years when the Middle East was not calm. It hasn't \nbeen the warmest climate for women and certainly was not an area for \nthe weak of heart. But she didn't just stay for a year or two. She \nstayed at the front, and after each conflict ended, she went to the \nnext one because I think she knew--and, again, Sheldon would know this \nmuch better than I. But just reading about her, she knew her talents \nwere unique; that there wasn't anybody else who might fill those gaps \nand be able to do the kind of reporting that might bring change. So she \nfollowed the conflicts in Chechnya and the Balkans, East Timor, Sierra \nLeone, Zimbabwe. She was not just in the Middle East. She was there.\n  For those who cannot instantly remember some of her coverage, I am \nsure they remember her eye patch. This is from her work in Sri Lanka, \nwhere she defied a government ban on journalists' access, traveled over \n30 miles through the Vanni jungles to report on the terrible war crimes \nof the Sri Lankan civil war. I remember reading them at the time and \nbeing moved to try and do something.\n  Colvin suffered. She never threw in the towel. If anything, it pushed \nher to work even harder. Her quests to help the women and children from \nevery single war-torn country she entered endeared her to those women, \nthose communities, those members of our global community who knew and \nknow that her type of bravery was so rare indeed.\n  This brutal regime has broken families, torn apart homes, and forever \nchanged the way of life for the Syrian people. There is darkness that \nhas descended over Syria by design, by this awful regime. There was \nColvin, shining a candle, letting the world know, and now we are all \ndeprived of an incredible journalist.\n  With her, we lose an international role model. We lose the story she \nwould tell, the light she would bring to the darkest lives, most \nrecently in Syria but throughout the world, and we lose the voice she \nwould have found wherever the next merciless regime tried to suppress \nit. Yes, Marie Colvin would have been there.\n  While there is currently no official U.S. diplomatic presence in \nSyria due to the awful human rights tragedy being carried out by the \nAssad regime, we are working as best we can to explore every avenue to \nhelp Sheldon and her family bring closure and to help her mother, in \nparticular, who made clear that she will not rest until her daughter \nreturns home.\n  On behalf of all my colleagues, I offer my condolences to Rosemarie \nColvin in East Norwich, Marie's mother, and to the many people who will \nmiss the work of one of the greatest correspondents of this generation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of OHIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 20 minutes and to yield at the conclusion of my first 10 \nminutes to Senator Portman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          High School Tragedy\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I join my fellow colleague from \nOhio Senator Portman to offer our condolences and prayers to the people \nof Chardon, OH, who experienced a terrible tragedy earlier this week.\n  On Monday morning, February 27, a troubled young boy opened fire in \nthe crowded cafeteria at Chardon High School. Three students were \nkilled. Two students were wounded. The entire community remains shaken.\n  As fathers, we cannot imagine the loss of a child and the loss of \ninnocence of children who will now grow up knowing tragedy all too \nearly in life. As Members of the Senate, we couldn't be more proud of \nthe resiliency and the love and the compassion the people of Chardon \nhave shown in the wake of such fear and sorrow.\n  During the shooting, teachers and school administrators risked their \nlives to protect and save the lives of their students. Assistant \nFootball Coach Frank Hall chased the gunman out of the cafeteria, \nPrincipal Andy Fetchik called 911, and countless other teachers and \nstudents provided safety and comfort until help could arrive.\n  Chardon law enforcement and first responders--from the 911 \ndispatchers to the police, to the emergency medical people--arrived at \nthe scene to apprehend the suspect and restore calm and order.\n  Chardon Police Chief Tim McKenna and his team--especially the three \nofficers who rushed to the school--did an outstanding job. Hospital \nstaff at MetroHealth and Hillcrest cared for the victims and counseled \nthe families of lost ones. Out of this week's turmoil and tragedy, we \nremain proud of the community that has come together through vigils and \nprayer services, through support and red ribbons worn.\n  The day after the shooting, more than 1,000 people crammed into the \nSt. Mary's parish across from Chardon High School. The overflow crowd \nof another 1,000 was outside listening to Principal Fetchik express how \nproud he was of the students.\n  Yesterday, President Obama spoke to Principal Fetchik to say how \nproud he was--as Senator Portman and I are--of the school and of the \ncommunity.\n  At the prayer service, Superintendent Joseph Bergant explained why \nthe school would close for a few days this week to reflect, for \nstudents and families to get the help they need, for parents to hug \ntheir children, and for children to hug their parents.\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\n  Yesterday, I spoke with Superintendent Bergant to express Connie's \nand my gratitude and prayers. The investigation into how and why this \nhappened continues, but resilience, compassion, and love, we know, will \nremain.\n  Tomorrow classes resume in Chardon and at Lake Academy and Auburn \nCareer Center, where students and staff are also dealing with this \ntragedy. Tomorrow, Chardon High School students will march together \nfrom the town square to the school in a show of solidarity and unity. \nThey will remember Joy Rickers and Nicoloas Wajczak, who are still \nrecovering from their injuries. They will honor those fellow students \nno longer with them. Daniel Parmertor was a 16-year-old high school \njunior. Known as Danny, he was a student who loved snowboarding and \nvideo games and computers. He enjoyed wing nights at Cleats with \nfriends and was excited about starting his first job in a bowling alley \nand picking up his first paycheck.\n  His father Bob, a boiler technician with First Energy, and his mother \nDina, a nurse at Hillcrest Hospital, were finishing their night shifts. \nIf we can imagine, they were finishing their night shifts when they \nlearned of the shooting.\n  In their statement, the family said:\n\n       Danny was a bright young boy, who had a bright future ahead \n     of him. The family is torn by this loss.\n\n  He is survived by his parents, siblings, grandparents, a great-\ngrandmother, and numbers of aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n  Russell King, Jr., was 17 years old. His friends described him as \nsociable and who got along with everyone. A junior, he was enrolled in \nChardon High School and the Auburn Career Center. He was studying \nalternative energy such as solar and wind power as so many young people \nare today.\n  Demetrius Hewlin was 16 years old, affectionately known as ``D'' to \nhis family and friends. Demetrius was interested in healthy living, \nstaying active, playing computer games, and reading books.\n  In their statement, his family said:\n\n       We are saddened by the loss of our son and others in our \n     Chardon community.\n       Demetrius was a happy young man who loved life and his \n     family and friends.\n       We will very much miss him, but we are proud he will be \n     able to help others through organ donation.\n\n  Imagine that, the parents and the family thinking of others so \nimmediately.\n  He is survived by his parents, grandparents, a brother and sister, \nand numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n  On behalf of all Ohioans, the Senate, and joining with Senator \nPortman, we offer our continued prayers and condolences to the Chardon \ncommunity.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise with my colleague Senator Brown, \nwho has just spoken about this terrible tragedy that occurred in our \nState on Monday at Chardon High School in Geauga County. I was calling \ninto a radio program in the Cleveland area on Monday morning when the \nfirst reports started to come in. Frankly, it was unbelievable that \nthere could be a shooting anywhere but certainly in a high school and \nin this community that I visited that Senator Brown and I both know. \nUnfortunately, the rumors ended up being true and the tragedy is--as \nSenator Brown has just described so well--that lives were cut short and \nthese were lives full of promise. We will never know those young people \nSenator Brown was just talking about as adults, but we will always \nremember them, and now they are memorialized in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  My wife Jane and I have been keeping the families in our prayers, and \nfor that matter the entire Chardon High School community. We continue \nto pray for the healing of those who were injured in flesh and in \nspirit through this terrible act. As the parent of a high school \nstudent who is about the same age as these young people, I cannot \nimagine what the parents have gone through over the last 4 days. \nChardon is a beautiful community. It is almost a New England-style town \non the Western Reserve, with a beautiful town square. It is a place of \ncertainty, and that certainty, of course, now has been shattered. It \ntouches so many people around Ohio.\n  One of my staff has two cousins who attend the school, and along with \ntwo other cousins who have already graduated from the school, \nfortunately, their family members are all OK. But it shows that despite \nbeing a big State, all of us in Ohio are tied together.\n  We have been in touch with the Chardon officials offering to help \nwhere it is appropriate. I know Senator Brown has made a call, as has \nthe Governor, and the President has made a call. We all want to be \nthere and help in any way we can. We can draw some hope from the \nheroism of the day.\n  Unbelievably, the assistant football coach and teacher, Frank Hall, \nchased the shooter with his gun and showed a lot of bravery. A math \nteacher, Joe Ricci, rescued one of the injured students. We draw hope \nfrom the rank and leadership of Principal Andy Fetchik, Chardon schools \nSuperintendent Joe Bergant, Geauga County Sheriff Dan McClelland, \nChardon Police Chief Tim McKenna, and the first responders who \nresponded as they always do, and we appreciate and commend them for \ntheir reactions and their ability to deal with a very difficult \nsituation.\n  The community has received a lot of support and will need it as they \ncome together to grieve and to heal. The reports I have heard about, \nthe vigils and gatherings over the last week have been moving. I am \ntold as students returned to school for the first time today, they \ngathered in that town square I talked about and walked together in \nunison.\n  We need to make sure we continue to pull together and continue to \nsupport the community and school. For the parents to heal is a journey, \nand the journey has just begun.\n  I have been moved by the expressions of support from other local high \nschool students too. Apparently, other students of the Cleveland area \nhave gone Hilltopper red and black, which is the mascot, to show their \nsupport for other students. We are in the Chamber with some of our \npages who are about the same age as these students and that show of \nsupport and love is appreciated and it shows the character of our \nState. We pull together in Ohio. We pull together in times of tragedy, \nthrough tears and through pain. We will get through this.\n  Again, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with my colleague about \nthe tragedy and to be sure that in the Record we are memorializing this \nevent and ensuring that those students whose lives have been cut short \nwill all be remembered.\n  God bless Chardon and the Chardon community.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our \nNation's energy policy.\n  Georgians, as well as folks all across America, are shocked every \ntime they pull up to the gas pumps, both at the price of gas per gallon \nand at the jaw-dropping total cost each time they fill up their tanks. \nWith rising food prices and a weak economic recovery, skyrocketing gas \nprices could not come at a worse time. This situation illustrates why \nit is imperative for Congress to focus on creating a policy to expand \nand diversify our energy sources so the American people are no longer \nheld hostage by prices at the pump.\n  The necessity of congressional action has become all too clear as gas \nprices continue to rise and unrest in the Middle East threatens the \nglobal economy. We cannot afford to keep sending hundreds of billions \nof dollars per year to foreign countries, many of which are not \nAmerica's friends, to meet our energy needs. Doing so poses a threat to \nour national security and further harms our Nation's struggling \neconomy.\n  Unfortunately, the President and his administration have made some \ndecisions that contribute to rising gas prices and that prevent us from \nbeing able to take advantage of vast energy\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nresources located right here in North America.\n  First, the President's recent decision to reject the Keystone XL \nPipeline was extremely disappointing. Canada is a trusted ally and \nfriend to the United States, and by tapping into its vast oil reserves, \nwe could have substantially lessened our need to import oil from other, \npotentially hostile, nations. Not only would this project instantly \nhave created many jobs, it would also have helped secure our Nation's \nenergy future.\n  In addition, the long line of burdensome regulations coming from the \nadministration threatens both economic growth and energy costs in the \nUnited States. Instead of navigating through this unprecedented \nregulatory environment, more and more industries will choose to take \ntheir business overseas. This could potentially include refiners and \nother businesses essential to domestic energy production. In fact, we \nare already seeing the movement of the deep oil rigs in the Gulf of \nMexico to China--a classic example of what could happen even more so in \nthe future.\n  Rather than hindering domestic production of oil and gas, we must \nencourage the development of the abundant energy resources we have \nright here in the United States, and we must do so in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner. I will continue to support domestic \noil and gas exploration and production. It is an essential component of \na comprehensive energy policy that will enable America to become more \nenergy independent.\n  As I hear more reports of new oil and natural gas deposits found \nwithin our borders and off America's shores, I am stunned that we are \nnot doing more to encourage the development of these resources. I can't \nthink of a better means of improving our economy, by both reducing \nAmerica's energy imports and encouraging job growth. Unfortunately, the \nadministration continues to hold up and unnecessarily delay the \napproval of drilling leases and permits. Now is not the time to tie up \nvaluable and much needed American energy production in bureaucratic \nredtape.\n  A responsible energy policy that includes increased domestic energy \nproduction; improved energy efficiency through technology; improved \nconservation; and a diversified energy supply with the use of renewable \nfuel sources will keep gas prices low, lessen our dependence on foreign \noil, and strengthen our economy. I am hopeful we will take action on \nsome form of comprehensive energy legislation during this Congress. For \nthe sake of our national security and our economy, we need to tackle \nthis issue now instead of procrastinating and letting others handle it.\n  I made this same speech 4 years ago when we saw gas prices approach \n$4 a gallon. Here we are 4 years later with the same hurdles standing \nin front of us with respect to the lack of a long-term energy policy in \nthis country. So I hope that in a bipartisan way we can develop an \nenergy policy, even if it is short term and even if it is narrowly \nfocused, that will provide relief to Americans with respect to the \nrising gas prices, which are going to impact every single product that \nis made in America today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Chambliss pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 2151 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask that I be \nfollowed by Senator Brown of Ohio, who assured me he would be waiting \nin the Chamber when I concluded.\n  But since I see he is not here, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nmy amendment to the transportation reauthorization bill that I have \nintroduced with Senator Blunt. I am grateful this amendment has been \nincluded in the base bill of Leader Reid's substitute amendment.\n  I will take a couple of minutes to explain this amendment. It is a \nsimple commonsense amendment. I am glad it has been accepted. It is \nalso particularly significant to my home State of Minnesota.\n  On August 1 of this year, we will mark the fifth anniversary of the \ntragedy in my home State of the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge \nin Minneapolis. The collapse killed 13 people and injured 145. That \ntragedy should have been a wake-up call in America and in this body. \nBridges should not collapse in the United States of America.\n  Unfortunately, the state of many of our bridges today is still \nextremely concerning. According to the most recent data compiled by the \nFederal Highway Administration, one in nine highway bridges in this \ncountry is classified as ``structurally deficient.''\n  Let me say it another way. One of nine bridges in our country needs \nsignificant rehabilitation or replacement and requires yearly \ninspection.\n  In Minnesota alone, more than 1,100 bridges were listed as being \nstructurally deficient. The bill we are debating today consolidates \nmany varied surface transportation programs into five main pots of \nmoney. The Highway Bridge Program would be consolidated in the new \nNational Highway Performance Program, and of this new program, 60 \npercent would have to be spent on restoring National Highway System \nroads and bridges into a state of good repair. The other 40 percent is \nmore flexible and can be spent on a variety of projects, including \nFederal-aid highways that are not on the National Highway System, or \nthe NHS.\n  However, if those non-NHS roads have a bridge that needs repair, that \nproject would not have been an allowable use of this flexible pot of \nmoney. My amendment, which is now included in the base bill, fixes \nthat. It allows the 40-percent pot of money to be used to repair \nbridges on non-NHS Federal-aid highways.\n  It is common sense. If roads are eligible for this funding, then \nbridges along these roads should be eligible as well. This is a no-\nbrainer to me, especially given the poor state of our bridges today. \nThe I 35W bridge collapse was a tragedy. It was a monumental failure of \npolicy. I am determined not to let that happen again.\n  I thank Senator Blunt for joining me in this effort. I also wish to \nthank Transportation for America and Smart Growth America for their \nsupport on this important fix.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I would like to talk about an \nimportant part of the transportation jobs bill the Senate is debating \nthis week. The bill is about creating jobs by modernizing our roadways \nand highways, about making our bridges safer--we know what that means \nin Minnesota, the State of the Presiding Officer--and about improving \npublic transportation and reducing congestion across the country. But \nit is also about improving the public safety of the vehicles that \ntravel our country.\n  We know about the success we have had as a nation because of the \npartnership between the auto industry and the government and adopting \nsafety rules and working with the industry and making our travel safer. \nWe know about the very impressive increase in safety on our Nation's \nhighways. And there is still work to be done.\n  Five years ago tomorrow, a fatal motorcoach accident rocked a small \nOhio community and brought national attention to the need for \ncommonsense safety measures that could save lives.\n  Bluffton University is a small university in Bluffton, OH, near \nInterstate 75 in Allen and Hancock Counties in the northwest part of \nthe State. The school's baseball team was on their way to Florida for \nspring training when their bus lost control on a poorly marked exit \nramp outside Atlanta. The bus toppled from the overpass. Like the\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nmajority of fatal motorcoach accidents, when the bus rolled over, the \npassengers were ejected from their seats and thrown through the bus \nwindows. Seven people were killed and dozens were injured.\n  John and Joy Betts of Bryan, OH--a couple who have become friends of \nmine--lost their son David, one of the students who died that day. He \nwas a baseball player and student at Bluffton. I have gotten to know \nthe Betts family since the accident. They have been courageous \nadvocates in raising awareness of motorcoach safety and demanding \ncongressional action. To the family's credit, they used the loss of \ntheir son to save the sons and daughters of many others who will not \nface those tragedies because of the work the Betts family is doing on \nbehalf of this motorcoach safety legislation.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board's final report from the \nBluffton motorcoach accident--released almost 4 years ago--echoed \nrecommendations the NTSB has been urging for years. For nearly 5 years, \nI have been working with Senator Hutchison, whose State has seen its \nshare of tragic motorcoach accidents, to put those recommendations into \nlaw. In a bipartisan manner, we are fighting to make motorcoaches safer \nfor the millions of passengers who ride them every day.\n  Today, because of the Betts family, other courageous families, and \nactivists, we are taking a step in the right direction if we pass the \nbill.\n  In the 110th, 111th, and now the 112th Congress, Senator Hutchison \nand I have introduced the bipartisan Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act, \nwhich includes many of the NTSB's ``most wanted'' safety improvements. \nSpecifically, the bill would address many of the major safety \nshortfalls from the Bluffton accident, which have plagued tour bus \noperations for too long. It would mean better protection systems for \noccupants and stronger passenger safety standards. It would improve \nsafety equipment and devices and the need for onboard recorders with \nthe capability to collect crash data. These safety measures are neither \nexotic nor complicated; they are commonsense safety features that have \nbeen and in many cases are widely used. But since they are not required \nby law, they have not been installed in most American motorcoaches. \nInstead of saving lives, the public safety remains at risk.\n  Some who oppose improved tour bus safety standards will tell you that \nthis isn't a motorcoach problem, that they have a problem with rogue \nbus companies or bad drivers. Certainly, that is part of the problem, \nbut we cannot simply look the other way and reject the idea that \nimproving the safety of motorcoach manufacturing and motorcoaches is \nunnecessary or fiscally imprudent.\n  John Betts said:\n\n       It is necessary through our current regulations to get bad \n     operators off the road. However, it is not sufficient as it \n     does nothing to ensure safety once the crash has occurred.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. We can get bad operators off the road, but \nthat is not enough to ensure passenger safety in the tragic event of an \naccident. If the technology to save lives and reduce injury in \nmotorcoach accidents exists, we must put that technology to use. This \nbill does that.\n  Last year in Cleveland I was joined by John's sister and brother-in-\nlaw, Pam and Tom Bryan of Vermillion, OH. We met with a Greyhound bus \ndriver who showcased new Greyhound buses equipped with some commonsense \nsafety measures that clearly will save lives and protect both \npassengers and motorists on the road.\n  The Betts family and operators like Greyhound understand the urgent \nneed and have too often relived the painful reminders that safety \nimprovements for tour bus operations are long overdue. That is why this \nMotorcoach Enhanced Safety Act is important, and it is why Greyhound's \nendorsement of this bill is so critical to turning public sadness and \noutrage into public action. Bus operators such as Greyhound think we \ncan do this, and manufacturers do too. The technology is there.\n  The bill is common sense, bipartisan, and it will save lives. How \nmany more motorcoach deaths--in Ohio, Texas, and most recently in New \nYork and New Jersey--do we have to witness before bus companies start \ndoing the right thing? As a father and Senator, it is disturbing to \nknow that students are still traveling in motorcoaches without even the \noption of buckling up. Our laws should ensure that our vehicles and \nroads are safer, not less safe, for students, families, and elderly \npeople, who often take motorcoach charters to events and concerts and \nsuch.\n  Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of the Bluffton University tragic \nmotorcoach accident. Our legislation is in the underlying \nTransportation bill we are debating on the floor. I urge its passage. I \nurge continued inclusion of these provisions, as Senator Hutchison and \nI have asked. It is commonsense, middle-of-the road, bipartisan \nlegislation that will save lives, undoubtedly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

THACKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho dedicated many great years of service to the residents of Pike \nCounty, KY, Sheriff's Deputy James I. Thacker of Elkhorn City, KY.\n  Sadly, Deputy Thacker was recently killed in a tragic automobile \naccident in the line of duty on Monday, January 23, on U.S. Highway 460 \nnear Marrowbone, KY. He was 53 years old. I would like to take a moment \nto share with my colleagues the legacy that was left behind by this \ngreat man and humble public servant.\n  When asked to comment on the untimely death of Deputy Thacker, Pike \nCounty Sheriff Charles ``Fuzzy'' Keesee said, ``He was kind and \ncompassionate; he treated everyone else like he wanted to be treated. \nHe was that kind of person, just an excellent officer.'' Deputy Thacker \nwas genuinely devoted to the people of Pike County, whom he had \ndedicated his life to serve. James has been described as the type of \nman you could call on day or night, with anything you may need, no \nmatter how big or how small.\n  Deputy Thacker held an array of jobs in Pike County throughout his \nlife. He served his country as a Marine early on in his life. Later on \nhe became a Pike County road foreman. Next, he spent 8 years as Pike \nCounty's constable before assuming the role of Deputy Sheriff a little \nover a year ago.\n  Deputy Thacker most assuredly left an incredible legacy in each of \nthe positions he held in his lifetime. He was cherished and appreciated \nby the citizens of Pike County, and this was proven when hundreds of \nfriends, colleagues and family members attended his visitation to pay \ntheir respects. Among\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\nthose assembled, people felt that anyone who knew James was truly \nblessed, and could find joy in simply being in his company. ``He was \nvery likeable and he was the type of person that once you knew him, it \nseemed like you knew him forever,'' said Sheriff Keesee.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my U.S. Senate \ncolleagues to join me in commemorating this fallen law-enforcement \nofficer, and recognizing the legacy that he has left behind by making \nElkhorn City, Pike County, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky a great \nplace.\n  A news story on the tragic death of Sheriff's Deputy James I. Thacker \nrecently aired on WYMT TV News of Hazard, Kentucky, and was published \non WKYT.com. I ask unanimous consent that said story be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From WKYT.com, January 24, 2012]\n\n                    Sheriff Remembers Fallen Deputy\n\n                          (By Angela Sparkman)\n\n       Pike County Sheriff's Deputy James I. Thacker died while on \n     duty after a car crash Monday night near Marrowbone on U.S. \n     460.\n       Sheriff Fuzzy Keesee says Thacker was serving papers on his \n     way home to Elkhorn City when the wreck happened.\n       State police spent most of Tuesday investigating the three-\n     vehicle crash and say an SUV crossed the center line and hit \n     Thacker's cruiser. Another vehicle also hit the cars after \n     the collision.\n       The sheriff says Thacker will always be remembered for his \n     service to Pike County.\n       ``He was kind and compassionate, he treated everyone else \n     like he wanted to be treated. He was that kind of person, \n     just an excellent officer,'' Sheriff Keesee said.\n       Keesee says Thacker joined the department just last year \n     but served as a constable for four years before becoming a \n     sheriff's deputy.\n       A Pike County Sheriff's cruiser now sits in front of the \n     courthouse, draped in black and a wreath on top in memory of \n     53-year-old James I. Thacker.\n       Sheriff Charles ``Fuzzy'' Keesee says Thacker always \n     answered the call of duty to help people. Monday night, the \n     call for help was for Thacker.\n       The Sheriff says Thacker was serving papers on his way home \n     to Elkhorn City. He never made it.\n       The dozens of police who answered the call to help Thacker \n     could not save him. He died at the scene. It was a scene the \n     sheriff will never forget.\n       ``His family was there. I talked to them, had a prayer with \n     them. We were all saddened,'' said Sheriff Keesee.\n       State police are still investigating what caused the SUV to \n     allegedly lose control and cause the crash. Troopers are \n     reconstructing the wreck on U.S. 460.\n       Meanwhile, the Sheriff's department is coming together to \n     remember their friend and fallen officer.\n       ``It's going to be a great loss to the community around \n     us,'' said Sheriff Keesee.\n       The visitation for Thacker starts Wednesday night at the \n     Community Funeral Home in Coon Creek. His funeral is Friday \n     at 1 p.m. at East Ridge High School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1190-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         California Casualties\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I recently had the privilege of speaking \nat an event sponsored by the Center for the National Interest which \nhonored our colleague from Michigan, Senator Carl Levin, with their \n2012 Distinguished Service Award. In addition to being my colleague, I \nam proud to call Carl Levin a dear friend, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat my remarks honoring Senator Levin be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Remarks by Senator John McCain in Honor of Senator Carl Levin, \n                     Delivered on February 15, 2012\n\n       Thank you. I'm glad to be here, and I'm grateful to the \n     Center for giving me an opportunity to say a few words about \n     your honoree, my friend, Carl Levin.\n       Carl and I have served on the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee together since I first came to the Senate, which it \n     pains me to recall, was over a quarter century ago. That's \n     not as long as Carl has been there, however. I think you were \n     elected shortly after the Spanish American War, weren't you, \n     Carl? No? I thought I had read you had been on the committee \n     when it refused to authorize Teddy Roosevelt's Great White \n     Fleet.\n       As you all know, Carl is a proud Democrat, and I'm not. \n     That difference is quite obvious on any number of issues \n     before the Senate. What I hope has always been just as \n     obvious is how greatly I admire and respect the man.\n       We have our moments on the committee. Debate among the \n     members can get a little passionate at times, though I hope \n     never rancorous. The members are quite proud of the \n     committee's tradition of bipartisan cooperation. I think we \n     appreciate the gravity of our responsibility to help maintain \n     the defense of our country, and the obligation we have to do \n     right by the men and women of the United States Armed Forces, \n     who have risked everything on our behalf. I think Carl and I \n     both feel their example of selfless sacrifice would make us \n     feel ashamed if we let the committee descend into the \n     partisan posturing that often makes it hard for Congress to \n     serve the national interest. When members disagree on the \n     committee, even heatedly, more often than not, it's because \n     we feel sincerely passionate about whatever issue is in \n     dispute. And even then, I think we try to maintain civility \n     and respect for one another, and we do not let it prevent us \n     from completing the committee's business.\n       That we have managed to keep that reputation in these \n     contentious times is a tribute to the man who has served as \n     the Committee's chairman or ranking Democrat since 1997. He \n     has kept the committee focused on its duties and not on the \n     next election or the latest rush-to-the-barricades partisan \n     quarrel that has momentarily consumed the Senate's attention. \n     He does so in a calm, measured, patient and intelligent \n     manner. He seems to become even calmer and more patient in \n     moments of disagreement when tempers and emotions among the \n     membership start to rise. He and I have slightly different \n     leadership styles, of course. I'm much gentler and less \n     confrontational. But Carl's style seems to work for him.\n       The committee has a heavy workload every year, and Carl \n     manages to keep us all in harness and working together at a \n     pace and in a constructive, results oriented approach that is \n     the envy of the dozen or so lesser committees of the Senate. \n     Our principle responsibility is to produce the defense \n     authorization bills one of the most important and \n     comprehensive pieces of legislation the Senate considers on \n     an annual basis. The committee has never failed to report the \n     bill, and the Senate has never failed to pass it. That's not \n     an accomplishment that some of those lesser committees I just \n     referred to can claim every year. And no one deserves more of \n     the credit for it than Carl Levin.\n       When Carl first joined the committee, he explained his \n     reason for seeking the assignment this way: ``I had never \n     served, and I thought there was a big gap in terms of my \n     background and, frankly, felt it was a way of providing \n     service.'' He might have never served in the military, but he \n     has surely served it, and served it well. And he has served \n     the national interests our armed forces protect in an \n     exemplary manner that the rest of us would be wise to \n     emulate.\n       He is a man of principle, ability, and serious purpose. He \n     has the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \n     We all listen to him, and we listen closest to him on the \n     occasions when we disagree with him. That's a great \n     compliment from a Senator. It is a tribute paid to only the \n     most revered members of the Senate. But the greatest \n     compliment one senator can pay another is to credit him or \n     her as a person who keeps their word. Why that's so rare in \n     our work is a mystery. But I can attest Carl possesses the \n     virtue. He has never broken his word to me.\n       We recently found ourselves in a dispute with the \n     administration over how and where to prosecute detainees \n     captured in the war on terror. Most people on my side of the \n     aisle agreed with my position. Many people on Carl's side and \n     in the administration disagreed with his. But he never \n     wavered. He never backed out of a deal, and he argued our \n     case far more effectively than I could. We did what we \n     usually do on the committee under Carl's leadership. We found \n     a way to settle the dispute without abandoning our \n     responsibilities. Carl deserves most of the credit for that, \n     too.\n       On a personal note, that controversy reminded me again of \n     one of the great satisfactions in life. And that, my friends, \n     is when you fight for a common cause with someone you haven't \n     always agreed with, whose background, views and personality \n     are distinctly different than yours, and you discover that \n     despite your differences, you have always been on the same \n     side on the big things.\n       Thank you, Carl, for your friendship and your example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1191-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1191-S1192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the current \njudicial vacancy crisis. We have in many instances abrogated our \nresponsibility to advise and consent in the nomination process. An \nestimated 160 million people live in districts with a courtroom vacancy \nthat could have been filled last year with the cooperation of Senate \nRepublicans. There are currently 20 nominees who have been approved by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee or are waiting a simple up-or-down vote \nwhich Republicans have historically supported. One of these nominees is \nRonnie Abrams.\n  Ms. Abrams was nominated in July of 2011 by President Obama to serve \nas a Federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. She is currently a lawyer with the law firm Davis \nPolk & Wardwell. She is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Law \nSchool, teaching a seminar on the investigation and prosecution of \nFederal criminal cases. Prior to her current positions, Ms. Abrams \ndistinguished herself as a prosecutor, rising to deputy chief, Criminal \nDivision, at the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New \nYork. As deputy chief, she supervised over 160 prosecutors in cases \ninvolving violent crimes, white-collar crimes, public corruption, \nnarcotics trafficking, and computer crimes. In recognition of her \nservice, she was awarded the Department of Justice Director's Award for \nSuperior Performance as a Federal Prosecutor. Ms. Abrams is a highly \nexperienced and exceptional attorney, who is extremely well qualified \nto serve as a Federal court judge. A nominee of this caliber deserves \nto be quickly confirmed by the Senate.\n  In particular, we should have a renewed, bipartisan commitment to \nconfirming more women to the bench. Over the past three decades, an \nincreasing number of women have joined the legal profession. In recent \nyears, law schools have seen the number of female students increase. \nAccording to the National Women's Law Center, women now make up nearly \nhalf of all law students. But the number of women in the Federal \njudiciary has stagnated and women are woefully underrepresented. It is \nof critical importance to increase the representation of women and \ncommunities of color on the Federal bench. Today, women make up roughly \n30 percent of the Federal bench. When women are fairly represented on \nour Federal courts, those courts are more reflective of our society.\n  What is disturbing about this vacancy crisis is that the total number \nof Federal circuit and district court judges confirmed during the first \n3 years of the Obama administration is far less than for previous \nPresidents.\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nFor instance, the Senate has confirmed only 124 of President Obama's \nFederal circuit and district court nominees, compared to 168 Federal \ncircuit and district court judges confirmed at this point in the \nPresidency of George W. Bush and 183 Federal circuit and district court \njudges confirmed at this point in President Clinton's administration.\n  To give you an even better breakdown, there are 20 judicial \nnominations reported favorable by the Judiciary Committee, 15 of which \nhave been pending since last year, 18 of which have strong bipartisan \nsupport. So why is there a delay in confirming these nominees? Senate \nRepublicans have failed to offer an answer.\n  Nominees such as Ronnie Abrams deserve better by receiving a swift \nup-or-down vote. The American people deserve better by having \nrepresentation in their district and circuit courts. We need to give \nthese nominees, most of whom have strong bipartisan support, a full up-\nor-down vote by the Senate. If we continue down this road of rejecting \nnominees simply because their nomination originates across the aisle, \nwe are establishing an impossible standard that no nominee will ever \nmeet. We ought to have the same respect for the judicial system that we \nhave for the legislative system in which we ourselves work. I urge my \ncolleagues to help move these nominees forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1192-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOSEPH NIALL DALEY\n\n Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I wish today to \nrecognize LTC Joseph Niall Daley, who is retiring after over 20 years \nof dedicated service in the U.S. Air Force and Massachusetts Air \nNational Guard.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Daley was commissioned as a second lieutenant in \nthe U.S. Air Force in 1990 and served on Active Duty for 10 years as an \naviator, at which time he joined the Massachusetts Air National Guard. \nHe flew combat missions in Bosnia, 1997, and Iraq, 1998 and 2003.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Daley has had a distinguished military career, \nbecoming an O/A 10A aircraft commander where he maintained a mission-\nready status in support of worldwide deployment requirements. As an \naviator he acquired an in-depth knowledge of U.S., allied, and enemy \ntactical and electronic warfare capabilities. He led and instructed \nformations of multiple O/A 10A aircraft in many diverse missions in \nboth the day and nighttime environments. These missions included close \nair support, air interdiction, combat search and rescue, airlift \nescort, and joint air attack team tactics.\n  While serving in the Massachusetts Air National Guard as an expert O/\nA 10A pilot with the 131st Fighter Squadron, Lieutenant Colonel Daley \ndirectly contributed to the success of the unit by providing sound \nleadership and experience. Assigned to the 131st Fighter Squadron as \nthe Assistant Charlie Flight Commander, and one of the Squadron's top \ninstructor pilots, he ensured his flight members were prepared to \nemploy the aircraft at its optimal performance when called to \ndeployment in 2003. Lieutenant Colonel Daley was instrumental to the \nwing as one of the primary trainers to implement the Litening II Pod \nduring its initial test phases. His oversight and dynamic vision were \ncritical during both peace-time and war-time missions. Following the \n2005 base realignment and closure, Lieutenant Colonel Daley accepted a \nkey role in the wing staff, serving as the base historian. His efforts \nensured the activities of the unit were documented and preserved, \nallowing the wing the opportunity to be recognized by the National \nGuard, Air Force, and the Department of Defense. Lieutenant Colonel \nDaley's accomplishments culminate a distinguished career in the service \nof his State and country and reflect great credit upon himself, the \nMassachusetts Air National Guard, and the U.S. Air Force.\n  I would like to thank Lieutenant Colonel Daley for his tremendous \nservice to our Nation. I know that his wife, U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte, \ntheir children, Katherine and Jacob, as well as the people of New \nHampshire and Massachusetts are extremely proud of his selfless \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1192-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Dr. \nHeath Morrison, who has been recognized as the 2012 American \nAssociation of School Administrators--AASA--National Superintendent of \nthe Year. My home State of Nevada is proud and privileged to \nacknowledge such an extraordinary educator and leader.\n  Since 2009, Dr. Morrison has served as superintendent for the Washoe \nCounty School District where he has proven to be an innovator in \neducation. During his tenure, the Washoe County School District has \nachieved higher test scores and has seen their graduation rate rise to \n70 percent. Outside the classroom, Dr. Morrison continues to encourage \nand develop student performance by creating personal connections with \nthe local community.\n  Engaging with Washoe County residents has allowed Dr. Morrison to \nfoster relationships with parents, volunteers, and local businesses in \norder to create and enhance scholastic opportunities for students. I \ncommend Dr. Morrison for his strong leadership and positive influence \non Nevada's youth.\n  I admire and recognize the desire of our educators to uphold high \neducation standards for our nation. Their guidance and encouragement \nprovide students with the ability to become lifelong learners with a \nthirst for knowledge. Now more than ever, it is of paramount importance \nto prepare our children and grandchildren to compete in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Nevada is fortunate to have such great educational leadership serving \nthe students across our great State. I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Dr. Morrison and celebrating the achievements of our \nNation's teachers, administrators, and staff who help to guide our \nstudents to educational excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1192-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING SOUTH ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nhonor the 125th birthday of South St. Paul, MN. First, I feel the need \nto clarify for this body that South St. Paul isn't exactly directly \nsouth of Saint Paul. West St. Paul is. And I know that's confusing. \nSouth St. Paul is closer to Southeast. And West St. Paul is South. And \nMinneapolis is, of course, West. I'm sure there's a very good reason \nfor the confusing names, but I have no idea what that would be.\n  South St. Paul is the perfect example of the kind of hard-working, \nMidwestern industrial town that has been the anchor of America. The \nSouth St. Paul Stockyards opened in 1886 and eventually grew to be one \nof the leading livestock centers in the world, with millions of \nlivestock being sold from its pens. A shifting marketplace finally \nforced the stockyards to close in 2008, but like much of America, South \nSt. Paul has adapted along with the changing world.\n  The stockyards, which had existed since South St. Paul's founding, \nleft an indelible mark on the city even after they closed. The people \nof South St. Paul are instilled with a hardy work ethic, which will \nserve the city well in its next 125 years.\n  As a part of the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area where I grew \nup, I know the sky is the limit for the people of South St. Paul. It is \nmy distinct pleasure to represent them in the United States Senate. \nCongratulations to the residents of South St. Paul.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1192-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1192-S1193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING ROY CITY DIAMOND JUBILEE\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Roy City, \nUT for reaching the 75th anniversary of its original incorporation in \n1937.\n  Roy City was first settled in 1873 by William Evans Baker. At the \ntime, the area was seen as dry and desert-like, not a likely place for \na town. Baker convinced three brothers-in-law to join him, eventually \nforming what would come to be affectionately known as ``Cousin Street'' \nbecause all of the residents along the road were cousins. The settlers \ncame up with an industrious way to bring much-needed clean water to the \narea, digging a canal from nearby mountains. With water came a sense of \npermanence for the town.\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\n  Twenty-one years after the first settlement, the area's residents \nagreed to establish a post office, which required that the town be \ngiven an official name. It had been called many things, from Central \nCity to Sandridge to Lakeview. The decision was to be made in the wake \nof a tragic death, that of Roy Peebles, the young son of Reverend David \nPeebles. Locals decided that the town should be named after Roy, and on \nMay 24, 1894, Roy had a name and a post office.\n  Roy remained a quiet, sparsely populated area until the 1940s, when \nHill Field was established nearby. Roy City suddenly grew rapidly, \nforcing an equally rapid expansion of services. For a brief period, \noverflowing classes for schoolchildren were held in the halls. A semi-\npermanent solution was found in busing students across Ogden to other \nsolutions, and a permanent solution was finally completed in 1965 in \nthe form of Roy High School. It became the largest high school in Weber \nCounty, and has been ranked as one of the top ten high schools in the \ncountry.\n  Thanks to spending by members of the military working at Hill Air \nForce Base, the Navy Supply Depot, and the Defense Supply Depot, \nbusinesses in Roy City expanded quickly during and after WWII. In 1953, \nthe city was granted a charter to establish Utah's first branch bank, \npaving the way for branch banks to spread throughout Utah.\n  In recent years, Roy City has been called ``Weber County's Fastest \nGrowing City,'' boasting over 35,000 residents. It has also been \nregularly lauded as one of Utah's most fiscally well-managed cities. \nRoy City now offers its citizens a host of modern businesses, \nconveniences, and services, from biking trails to an aquatic center.\n  To mark this year's special anniversary, Mayor Joe Ritchie will be \npresiding over the burial of a time capsule that is to be opened in 25 \nyears, exactly one century after the city's incorporation. May the last \nquarter of that journey be as productive and successful as the first \nthree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1193-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1837.

 By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Udall \n        of Colorado, Mr. Franken, Mr. Coons, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        and Mr. Udall of New Mexico):\n  S. 2146. A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \nof 1978 to create a market-oriented standard for clean electric energy \ngeneration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to describe \nthis legislation for my colleagues and, hopefully, urge them to \nseriously consider the legislation. It is introduced by me with several \ncosponsors: Senator Wyden, Senator Sanders, Senator Mark Udall of \nColorado, Senator Franken, Senator Coons, Senator Kerry, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator Tom Udall from my home State of New Mexico. All \nof those individuals strongly support what we are trying to do in this \nlegislation.\n  I particularly want to thank the staff of the Senate Energy Committee \nfor the hard work they put into developing this proposal, and \nparticularly Kevin Rennert, who worked very hard on this proposal and \ngot a lot of very useful input from many sectors and many individuals.\n  This is a simple plan to modernize the power sector and guide it \ntoward a future in which more and more of our electricity is generated \nwith cleaner and cleaner energy. The purpose of the legislation is to \nmake sure that, as we continue to grow and power our economy, we \nleverage the clean resources we have available today and also provide a \ncontinuing incentive to develop the cheaper, cleaner technologies that \nwill be needed in the future.\n  We want to make sure we drive continued diversity in our energy \nsources and allow every region of the country to deploy clean energy \nusing the appropriate resources for that region. We want to make sure \nwe do all of this in a way that supports homegrown innovation and \nmanufacturing and that keeps us competitive in the global clean energy \neconomy. The plan we are putting forward with this legislation would \nimplement a clean energy standard, or CES for short.\n  Let me describe how it works. Starting in 2015, the largest utilities \nin the country would meet the clean energy standard by showing that a \ncertain percentage of the electricity they sell is produced from clean \nenergy sources. The initial percentage for 2015 is within the \ncapabilities of those utilities today, and each year after 2015 they \nwould be required to sell a little bit more of their electricity from \nclean sources. They can do so either by making incremental adjustments \nto their own energy mix to become cleaner and more efficient or by \npurchasing clean energy from those who provide it at the lowest cost or \nby purchasing credits on an open and transparent market.\n  To be considered clean, a generator must either be a zero carbon \nsource of energy, such as, renewables and nuclear power, or a generator \nmust have a lower carbon intensity than a modern, efficient coal plant. \nBy carbon intensity, I mean the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per \nmegawatt hour of electricity generated. Generators with low or no \ncarbon intensity receive credits based on that criterion.\n  For example, renewables will receive a full credit per megawatt hour. \nMost natural gas generators would qualify for something around a half \ncredit, and the more efficient natural gas generators would be \nincentivized compared to less efficient generators. A coal powerplant \nwould receive some credits if it lowered its carbon intensity by \ninstalling carbon-capture technologies, by co-firing with renewable \nbiomass.\n  Accounting for clean in this way means the cleanest resources have \nthe greatest incentive. Also, it means every generator has a continuing \nincentive to become even more efficient. As the standard increases over \ntime, the generation fleet will transition naturally toward cleaner and \ncleaner sources to meet it. The clean energy standard sets an overall \ngoal for clean energy, but the optimal and the cheapest set of \ntechnologies to use will be determined by the free market. The rate of \ntransition is predictable and it is achievable and the rules of the \nroad are transparent and they are clear.\n  In addition to driving cleaner electricity generation in the power \nsector, the clean energy standard also rewards industrial efficiency. \nCombined heat and power units generate electricity while also capturing \nand using the heat for other purposes, and these units are treated as \nclean generators under this proposal for the clean energy standard. \nThis will help to deploy this kind of efficiency throughout our country \nand will provide another source of inexpensive clean energy.\n  Let me also describe what this proposal does not do. The clean energy \nstandard does not put a limit on overall emissions. It does not limit \nthe growth of electricity generation to meet the demands of a growing \neconomy. All that the clean energy standard requires is that the \ngeneration we do use in future years and that we add to our fleet \ngradually becomes cleaner over time.\n  The clean energy standard does not cost the government anything, and \nit does not raise money for the government to use either. If any money \ndoes come to the Treasury as a result of the program because of refusal \nto participate or to comply, that money would go directly back to the \nparticular State from which it came to fund energy-efficiency programs.\n  Finally, the clean energy standard will not hurt the economy. This \npast fall I asked the Energy Information Administration to analyze a \nnumber of clean energy standard policy options. The results of their \nstudy showed a properly designed clean energy standard would have \nalmost zero impact on gross domestic product growth and little or no \nimpact on nationally averaged electricity rates for the first decade of \nthe program. The Energy Information Administration analysis did show \nthat a clean energy standard would result in a substantial deployment \nof new clean energy and carbon reductions between 20 percent and 40 \npercent in the power sector by 2035, which is the timeframe provided \nfor in the proposal.\n  I have asked the Energy Information Administration to update their \nmodeling to reflect this final proposal that we are introducing today, \nand when they have completed that analysis in the next few weeks I plan \nto hold hearings on the proposal to further explore the benefits and \neffects of the clean energy standard in the Energy Committee.\n  The goal of the clean energy standard is ambitious. It is a doubling \nof clean energy production in this country by 2035. But analysis has \nshown that the goal is achievable and affordable. Meeting the clean \nenergy standard will yield substantial benefits to our health and to \nour economy and to our global competitiveness, and, of course, to our \nenvironment.\n  The bill we are introducing today is simple. It sets a national goal \nfor clean energy. It establishes a transparent framework that lets \nresources compete to achieve that goal based on how clean they are, and \nthen it gets out of the way and lets the market and American ingenuity \ndetermine the best path forward.\n  I think this is a very well thought out proposal and one that \ndeserves the\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nattention of all colleagues. I hope they will look at it seriously, and \nI hope we can attract additional supporters and cosponsors as the weeks \nproceed in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for research, monitoring, and observation \nof the Arctic Ocean and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about legislation I am \nintroducing today aimed at providing a better understanding of the \nArctic Ocean and its resources.\n  A changing climate is radically reshaping this part of the world. \nThis change brings challenges and opportunities. As you may recall, \nnearly 3 years ago, I delivered my first speech to this body on the \nchanging Arctic and what our Nation needs to do in order to prepare for \nit. That work continues today.\n  Retreating sea ice is leading to dramatic increases in shipping \ntraffic of both goods and tourists. Our Nation's energy needs demand we \ninvestigate and responsibly produce the massive amounts of oil and gas \nfound in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. These resources are now \navailable due to retreating sea ice, the state of technology and the \nprice of oil. Meanwhile, Native Alaskans have depended on and thrived \nfor thousands of years because of the living resources of the Arctic \nOcean.\n  In order to manage this change, we need a better understanding of the \nArctic Ocean, and the legislation I am introducing today provides a \nfirm foundation for that work. It establishes a new coherent research \nstrategy to gather baseline information and to provide a holistic look \nat the Arctic Ocean.\n  Importantly, it doesn't create any new bureaucracy. It assigns this \ntask to the North Pacific Research Board, a well regarded institution, \nand requires a high degree of coordination with other existing \nentities, including the Arctic Research Commission whose job it is to \nestablish Arctic research priorities and coordinate the massive federal \ninvestment in this area across many agencies.\n  I would argue that most people are unaware of just how much Arctic \nscience and research is underway. For most people in the lower 48 \nStates, it is out-of-sight and out-of-mind. The Bureau of Ocean Energy \nManagement has spent about half of its total research budget on the \nArctic for the past 6 years, approximately $60 million. The National \nScience Foundation has spent more.\n  However, the Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observing Act \nwill be important to provide funds not tied to particular projects. \nThis legislation is intended to provide a firm foundation in our \nunderstanding of the basic science of the Arctic Ocean that can \nunderlie all of our decision-making in the Arctic.\n  I am always happy to inform my colleagues about how we do things \nright in Alaska. We're a natural resource development state. Because \nour economy is so dependent on that development, we bear the \nresponsibility of doing it right. That is making sure that nonrenewable \nresource development doesn't harm the renewable resources of our great \nstate.\n  I am confident we can continue to do that as we explore and develop \nthe approximately 26 billion barrels of oil and 100 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. However, we have to \nmake prudent investments in order to meet that goal, and that is what I \nam suggesting we do today.\n  With companion legislation I will be introducing in the next few \ndays, I also have a plan to create an endowment to fund this critical \nresearch program. Baseline science and monitoring requires steady, \ndependable funding in order to have the long term data sets that can \nhelp us make good decisions. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and the administration on this important need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arctic Ocean Research, \n     Monitoring, and Observing Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States is an Arctic Nation with--\n       (A) an approximately 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean;\n       (B) more than 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic \n     Circle; and\n       (C) an even broader area defined as Arctic by temperature, \n     which includes the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.\n       (2) The Arctic region of the United States is home to an \n     indigenous population that has subsisted for millennia on the \n     abundance in marine mammals, fish, and wildlife, many of \n     which are unique to the region.\n       (3) Temperatures in the United States Arctic region have \n     warmed by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius over the past half-century, \n     a rate of increase that is twice the global average.\n       (4) The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing and \n     thinning, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration estimates the Arctic Ocean may be ice free \n     during summer months in as few as 30 years.\n       (5) Such changes to the Arctic region are having a \n     significant impact on the indigenous people of the Arctic, \n     their communities and ecosystems, as well as the marine \n     mammals, fish, and wildlife upon which they depend.\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\n       (6) Such changes are opening new portions of the United \n     States Arctic continental shelf to possible development for \n     offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, \n     and tourism.\n       (7) Existing Federal research and science advisory programs \n     focused on the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of a \n     changing Arctic Ocean lack a cohesive, coordinated, and \n     integrated approach and are not adequately coordinated with \n     State, local, academic, and private-sector Arctic Ocean \n     research programs.\n       (8) The lack of research integration and synthesis of \n     findings of Arctic Ocean research has impeded the progress of \n     the United States and international community in \n     understanding climate change impacts and feedback mechanisms \n     in the Arctic Ocean.\n       (9) An improved scientific understanding of the changing \n     Arctic Ocean is critical to the development of appropriate \n     and effective regional, national, and global climate change \n     adaptation strategies.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     permanent environmental sentinel program to conduct research, \n     monitoring, and observation activities in the Arctic Ocean--\n       (1) to promote and sustain a productive and resilient \n     marine, coastal, and estuarine ecosystem in the Arctic and \n     the human uses of its natural resources through greater \n     understanding of how the ecosystem works and monitoring and \n     observation of its vital signs; and\n       (2) to track and evaluate the effectiveness of natural \n     resource management in the Arctic in order to facilitate \n     improved performance and adaptive management.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVI of the Social Security Act to \nclarify that the value of certain funeral and burial arrangements are \nnot to be considered available resources under the supplemental \nsecurity income program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce valuable, \nbipartisan legislation that would codify the current policy of the \nSocial Security Administration, SSA, to protect access to the \nSupplemental Security Income, SSI, program for those who prepay burial \nand funeral expenses.\n  When individuals are fiscally responsible, and plan ahead for their \nend-of-life costs, it makes no sense to penalize them. Under the \ncurrent policy, if funds or life insurance are set aside, irrevocably--\nso the individual cannot take them back even if he or she wants to--\nthen those resources do not count against the individual when \ndetermining whether or not they are eligible for SSI. This is a good \npolicy, and I applaud the SSA for maintaining it.\n  Regrettably, this has not always been the case. When Congress passed \nanti-fraud legislation in 2000, the next year SSA misinterpreted \nprovisions in the new law because it did not specifically carve out the \nexclusion for burial trusts. Therefore, SSA had the power to end the \nexclusion--and in fact, it did. SSA later realized its mistake and \nrestored the exclusion. However, in the meantime, this hiccup created a \nwave of chaos for responsible seniors who were wrongly denied access to \nSSI. This bill will codify the exclusion, so this or future \nadministrations will not even have the possibility of making that \nmistake again. In doing so, we will not only provide clarity to the \nadministrative agencies, but will also give certainty to SSI enrollees \nand applicants. They will be ensured that planning ahead to protect \ntheir loved ones from the costs associated with death will in no way \npenalize them when applying for assistance.\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\n  We are all aware that Americans are facing difficult times with \nunacceptably high unemployment and an economy that continues to sag. \nThat is why it is unfair to penalize individuals who are fiscally \nresponsible; rather we should further encourage them to plan ahead. \nThis is not a loophole or a giveaway; this is current policy at SSA, \nand remember that this exclusion is only for funds or insurance that \nare absolutely going to be spent on burial costs. They are called \n``irrevocable trusts'' because once you put the money aside, you cannot \nget it back. This bill has negligible revenue effect, because it merely \ntells the government, firmly, to keep doing what it is already doing.\n  I should also point to the fact that we are talking about SSI \nenrollees-- individuals who generally do not have a lot of resources. \nIf they are fiscally responsible and plan ahead for their burial and \nfuneral costs, this reduces the likelihood of these costs falling on \nthe obligation of State and local governments.\n  I know that we want agencies like SSA to be able to use their \ndiscretion and be nimble enough to adapt to a changing environment. \nHowever, we have gone that route before, and because of the SSA's \nmistake in reversing the exclusion in 2001, we need to be absolutely \nclear about the intent of Congress on this policy. It is unconscionable \nfor seniors to have their applications erroneously delayed or denied, \nand it is incumbent upon us to enact this simple, straightforward, \nuncontroversial fix.\n  Americans sacrifice a portion of every paycheck in order to support \nthe programs SSA administers. They do so willingly, knowing that when \nthey retire, or should they become disabled or fall on hard times \nduring old age, programs like SSI will be there for them. This is a \npromise that we in Congress made to Americans. Enacting this fix is \npart of keeping that promise.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, I worked with SSA \nin developing this language. Many members have expressed support both \nfor this legislation, and for the underlying policy that it codifies. I \nurge my colleagues to support enactment of this bill, so that we can \nkeep our promise to the Nation's seniors, provide certainty, and reward \nfiscal responsibility and prudent planning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve information security, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the \nStrengthening and Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research, Education, \nInformation and Technology Act, also known as the SECURE IT Act. I am \njoined today by Senator Hutchison, Senator Chambliss, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Coats, Senator Burr, and Senator Johnson of \nWisconsin. My colleagues and I believe that passage of this act would \nbe a significant step towards improving our Nation's cyber defenses.\n  It is clear to most policy makers that the Internet has transformed \nnearly all aspects of our lives by breaking down barriers and \nincreasing information efficiencies. Whether you are a student \nsearching for an article to complete a homework assignment or a fireman \ntrying to remotely determine the landscape of a forest to safely \nextinguish a fire, the Internet has improved our lives because it has \nso greatly transformed how and when we are able to access information.\n  While progress is clear, not a week goes by without fresh media \nreports of a major compromise of a cyber network in the United States. \nA recent report by the Government Accountability Office stated that \ncyber attacks against the United States are up 650 percent over the \nlast 5 years, and according to one leading cybersecurity firm, the \nannual cost of cyber crime itself is nearly $388 billion. That cost is \nclose to the sum of all of the profits of the top 75 Fortune 500 firms \nfor 2011. My friends, if the top 75 American businesses lost all of \ntheir profits in one year, we would be working night and day to solve \nthe problem.\n  Most of us don't need an analogy like that to appreciate the need to \nimprove the current state of cybersecurity in this country. But the \nreality is that advancing much needed legislation has been extremely \ndifficult. I will be the first to admit there are honest differences \nwithin the cybersecurity debate. However, over the course of the last \nfew years, several cybersecurity solutions have been brought forth that \nI believe can be advanced and offer insight as to where progress can be \nachieved. These solutions are not insignificant and their passage would \ndo plenty to improve our country's cybersecurity defenses. I believe \nthat inaction is no longer an option. The stakes are too high and the \nthreat is too real.\n  The SECURE IT Act is a serious response to the growing cyber threat \nfacing our country. Our bill seeks to utilize the world-class engineers \nemployed by our private sector, not compliance attorneys in billable by \nthe hour law firms. This is why a primary objective of our bill is to \nenter  into a cooperative information sharing relationship with the \nprivate sector, rather than an adversarial one rooted in prescriptive \nFederal regulations used to dictate technological solutions to \nindustry.\n\n  The centerpiece of the SECURE IT Act is a legal framework to provide \nfor voluntary information sharing. Our bill provides specific \nauthorities relating to the voluntary sharing of cyber threat \ninformation among private entities, between a private entity and a non-\nfederal government agency such as a local government, and between any \nentity and a pre-existing Federal cybersecurity center. In setting \nforth our information sharing framework, we do not create any new \nbureaucracy.\n  Further, the SECURE IT Act includes no government monitoring, no \ngovernment take-overs of the Internet, and no government intrusions. \nThere are plenty of laws that deal with those issues--this bill is not \none of them. The goal of the information sharing title is to remove the \nlegal hurdles which prevent critical information from being shared with \nthose who need it most.\n  In drafting the information sharing title of our bill, my colleagues \nand I were very sensitive to the issue of privacy and we worked very \nhard to put forth understandable privacy protections. First, we limit \nthe type of information involved in information sharing\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\nto ``cyber threat information'' as it is narrowly defined in the bill. \nThere are no legal protections for entities using, receiving, or \nsharing information that falls outside that narrow ``cyber threat \ninformation'' definition. Second, we include techniques like \ninformation anonymizing and specifically state that entities can \nrestrict the further dissemination of shared information. Additionally, \nafter the first year, and then every other year, we will receive \nreports from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board which will \ntell us how these authorities are being implemented. We take the issue \nof privacy very seriously.\n  In addition to information sharing, the SECURE IT Act requires the \nFederal Government to improve its own cybersecurity by reforming the \nFederal Information Security Management Act--the law that governs \nfederal networks. These updates are meant to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment transitions from paper-based reporting on network security \nto real-time monitoring--a huge step in federal cybersecurity which \nwill go a long way to improve how the government addresses its own \ncyber threats. This transition from a checklist approach to continuous \nmonitoring will not happen without an associated cost. However, we \nbelieve our approach to this necessary improvement is the most fiscally \nresponsible because we require agencies to meet these requirements by \nusing existing budgets, rather than by authorizing new federal \nspending.\n  We are all aware that federal government also plays a critical role \nin cybersecurity research. The Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency, the Department of Energy laboratories and the National Science \nFoundation are all world-class leaders in research that is essential to \nunderstanding how to best protect our cyber country's infrastructure. \nThis work serves an important purpose and should be a Federal priority \neven in a time of significant budget constraints. However, the \nsignificance of these programs does not provide us with an excuse to \nauthorize new spending or establish new programs. The SECURE IT Act \nignores this temptation and does not authorize new spending or \nprograms.\n  Finally, our cybersecurity bill updates our nation's criminal laws to \naccount for new cyber crimes and assists the Department of Justice to \nprosecute cyber criminals.\n  In sum, it is our belief that the provisions included in the SECURE \nIT Act will dramatically improve cybersecurity in this country. More \nimportantly, the approach taken in the SECURE IT Act has a real chance \nof being enacted into law this year. This is real progress that will \nimpact nearly all Americans. After all, we are all in this fight \ntogether, and as we search for solutions, our first goal should be to \nmove forward together.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a bill that was \nintroduced this morning. The bill is the Strengthening and Enhancing \nCybersecurity by Using Research, Education, Information, and Technology \nAct, which we refer to as the SECURE IT Act.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation because we know that \ncyber attacks are a threat to our country and we need to strengthen our \nlaws to ensure we are protecting our assets, our communication systems, \nand all of the infrastructure that is run by communications systems.\n  We are working as a group. Senators McCain, Chambliss, Grassley, \nMurkowski, Coats, Burr, and Johnson are original cosponsors. All of us \nare the ranking members on the relevant committees that must deal with \ncybersecurity.\n  Senator McCain, the lead sponsor, is, of course, the Armed Services \nranking member. I am the ranking member of Commerce, Senator Chambliss \nof Intelligence, Senator Grassley certainly of Judiciary, and Senator \nMurkowski of Energy.\n  It is very important that our relevant committees have come together \nwith our ranking members, and we hope very much to gain support from \nthe Democratic side as well on a bill that we think can get through all \nof Congress and be signed by the President because the parts of our \nbill that will strengthen our cybersecurity in this country are, I \nthink, accepted by those who have expertise in this area. For instance, \nour bill will help prevent the spread of cyber attacks from network to \nnetwork and across the Internet by removing barriers to sharing \ninformation about threats, attacks, and strategies for improvement of \ndefenses. We remove these barriers through addressing the antitrust \nlaws that would allow companies that are sharing information not to be \nthreatened with antitrust suits, because this is a security issue, it \nis not a competitive issue. Secondly, we want to have liability \nprotection for those who disclose cyber threat information with their \npeers.\n  These are things that would be in everyone's interest for us to do, \nand we do need to address them in legislation. The liability and \nantitrust protections are available to all companies that would share \ninformation, not just those that share with the government but when \nthey can talk to each other, to understand each other's systems.\n  Further, the SECURE IT Act would require that Federal contractors \nproviding electronic communication or cybersecurity services to Federal \nagencies share cyber threat information related to those contracts. Of \ncourse, when they have contracts with the government, that information \nis going to be very important so we would require the sharing of \ninformation about threats that might jeopardize the system's security.\n  In addition, the government will develop procedures for the timely \nsharing of classified, declassified, and unclassified information to \nensure that information needed to secure networks is fully accessible \nto trusted parties.\n  We are concerned that there are other bills out there that will add \nanother new bureaucracy, another layer of regulation that is not \nnecessary and brings in another agency that would overlay the security \nagencies that already have systems in place. It would also allow the \nregulatory bodies for certain areas of interest to handle the \ncybersecurity rather than another overlay of a new department.\n  I think so many people in our country who are in business feel they \nare overwhelmed with duplicative regulations and different agencies \nthey have to report to. We want to streamline whom they have to report \nto and try to use existing structures and existing regulatory \nauthorities to deal with each individual company or industry so that we \ndon't have to give them yet another new bureaucracy that would then \nhave regulations, if they are deemed to be critical infrastructure. \nThat is when it becomes the regulatory threat.\n  We believe the private sector is more aware of individual security \nneeds and better equipped than the Department of Homeland Security to \nsecure its own networks, working with its own regulators. According to \nthe Office of Management and Budget, the government itself has had \ngreat difficulty in preventing attacks on Federal systems. So we do \nrequire that the reporting of Federal contractors go to the Federal \nsecurity agencies, but we don't think the Federal agencies being in \ncharge of everything is necessarily an improvement.\n  We want to make sure the Federal Information Security Management Act, \nwhich is the law, is actually updated so that the new forms of cyber \nthreats are accommodated in FISMA, the Federal Information Security \nManagement Act, and to strengthen that with the updates.\n  The legislation also updates the Criminal Code to address cyber \ncrimes, strengthening penalties, improving the Department of Justice's \nability to prosecute this kind of criminal who would take down whole \nsystems of our government.\n  Our bill will prioritize cybersecurity research and development so we \ncan harness innovation to protect our country and our private \nindustries from cyber attacks.\n  I am very pleased that we have been able to introduce this \nlegislation as an alternative to some of the other bills that have come \nout. I believe that if we can go forward with negotiating, perhaps we \ncan come to an accommodation with the bills that have been introduced \nwith other sponsors. But we don't think the bills that have been \nintroduced address our concerns and we want to ensure that we do not \nhave another big Federal bureaucracy, that we do not overlay the \nregulators who already have expertise in this area with new regulators \nwhom we have to train\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\nand deal with. We think the defense agencies--the National Security \nAgency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the CIA, DHS--all of those \nwith their cybersecurity assets already in place are the better place \nto put the strength, not reinventing the wheel but better utilizing the \nsystems we already have.\n  I think it is time for our Senate to address cyber security. I think \nwe have good proposals out there; perhaps we can take the best of \nthose. I think this is the right approach, and Senators McCain, \nChambliss, Grassley, and Murkowski were key to drafting this \nlegislation that I think will get the support of all of the \nstakeholders, as well as the House of Representatives, to actually pass \na bill to improve our systems and take it to the President for \nsignature.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nStrengthening and Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research, \nInformation, and Technology Act of 2012, otherwise known as the SECURE \nIT Act. This bill provides a strong foundation for Congress to enact \nwhat I hope can be a truly bipartisan approach for improving the \nability of all Americans to protect themselves against the ever-\nincreasing cybersecurity threat.\n  This bill was dropped today under the leadership of Senator McCain, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Grassley, Senator Murkowski, and myself, and \nI am very pleased to be a part of that group who has worked very hard \non this bill for a number of months.\n  There are a few who dispute the significance of the problem posed by \nthe threat of cyber attacks. The financial harm inflicted by these \nattacks is now costing Americans billions of dollars each year. Denial-\nof-service attacks have been shutting down the Internet presence of \nbusiness and organizations for years. Beyond the economic costs, \nmalicious cyber activity is damaging our national security. Every day, \ncyber criminals and foreign adversaries steal large amounts of \nsensitive information from the networks of government and private \nsector entities. These trends need to be reversed before these \nmalicious activities are measured in terms of lives lost rather than in \nterms of dollars as we are seeing today.\n  For years the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following the \ngrowing cybersecurity threats. Early on, one of the most common \nquestions asked in the cybersecurity context was, Who is in charge? \nWhile this seems like the natural place to start, it is important to \nunderstand why this is really not the right question.\n  First, there is no consensus on who should be in charge. Some have \nargued it should be the Department of Defense. Some say it should be \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Others think it might be best to \nstart from scratch. All of these options have very obvious drawbacks.\n  Second, and more important, we have been looking through the wrong \nend of the telescope in trying to answer this question. Rather than \ntrying to find a governmental entity that should be in charge of \ncybersecurity, it turns out that the answer is actually much simpler: \neach and every one of us is in charge of our own cybersecurity. I know \nsome people will scoff at this answer because it is too simplistic for \nsuch a complicated problem or they just don't trust us to act in our \nown best interests. I think they are wrong on both counts.\n  So, if we--and by ``we,'' I mean all of us who use and rely on \ncomputer networks, whether individuals, groups, organizations, \ncorporations, or government agencies--are in charge of our own \ncybersecurity, the real question then is, What should be done to reduce \nthe threat of malicious cyber activity? I believe the answer to that \nquestion is contained in the bill called the SECURE IT Act that we have \nfiled today.\n  The SECURE IT Act consists of four key areas of common ground \nidentified in various legislative efforts: first, information sharing; \nsecond, Federal Information Security Management Act reform; third, \nenhanced criminal penalties; and fourth, cybersecurity research and \ndevelopment.\n  We have seen firsthand the positive impact better information sharing \ncan have on our national security. Since the 9/11 terrorist attack, \nimproved information sharing throughout the government and especially \nwithin the intelligence community has greatly enhanced our national \nsecurity. I believe a similar improvement to information sharing in the \ncyber context will pay huge, long-term dividends in terms of our safety \nand national security.\n  Once there is an understanding that information sharing will work \nbest if it empowers the individual rather than a discrete government \nentity, the move from a regulatory approach to one that encourages \nvoluntary sharing of cyber threat information by removing unintended \nbarriers quickly follows. The information-sharing title of the SECURE \nIT Act is based on this voluntary approach and on the principle that \ngovernment cannot and should not solve every problem.\n  The cosponsors of this bill relied upon a number of principles and \npractical considerations to develop the information-sharing provisions \nin this bill.\n  First, private sector innovation is the engine that drives our \neconomy. Private sector entities have a vested interest in protecting \ntheir assets, businesses, and investments. What they often lack is \ninformation to help them better protect themselves. Therefore, our \ninformation-sharing provision authorizes private sector entities and \nnon-Federal Government agencies to voluntarily disclose cyber threat \ninformation to government and private sector entities. The only time \ncyber threat information must be shared with the government is when it \nis directly related to a contract between a communications service \nprovider and the government, which ordinarily is a term included in \nthat contract anyway. The only new requirement is that such information \nwill ultimately need to be shared with a cybersecurity center.\n  Information sharing is and must be a two-way street, but there are no \nquid pro quos here. Because the government often sees different threat \npictures than the private sector, our bill also encourages the \ngovernment to immediately share more classified, declassified, and \nunclassified cyber threat information. As one example, consider how \nimproved information sharing might safeguard transportation industry \nsystems. Suppose a commercial airline company detects a virus in their \nreservation system. The virus is stealing information, including \ncustomers' credit card numbers, and sending it to a hacker's server \noverseas. The airline, after investigating internally, determines where \nthe stolen data is being sent. Under our bill, the airline may share \nthe Internet address that is receiving the stolen credit card \ninformation with any other companies, such as other airlines, as well \nas with the government. With this warning from the first airline, other \ntransportation companies can check their systems to see if any of their \ndata is being sent to the hacker's server. Moreover, using the hacker's \nInternet address, law enforcement is able to begin an investigation to \nidentify other victims of the same hacker.\n  The cybersecurity centers will also be able to notify private \nentities of the nature of this particular threat. In this example, it \nis unlikely that the airline will ever need to share or release any \ncustomer's personally identifiable information.\n  Second, my cosponsors and I intentionally omitted a critical \ninfrastructure title because we believe a top-down regulatory approach \nwill stifle the voluntary sharing of cyber threat information by the \nprivate sector. Consistent with this principle, our information-sharing \ntitle does not provide any additional authority to any government \nentity to impose new regulations on the private sector. In fact, the \nbill prohibits government agencies from using any shared cyber threat \ninformation to regulate the lawful activities of an entity. In short, \nthe bill leaves the existing regulatory regime unchanged.\n  The real difficulty with trying to regulate in this area is that \nmalicious cyber activities occur in real time and are constantly \nchanging. The bureaucracy-driven regulatory process is simply not \nnimble enough to keep up with the leading cybersecurity practices. \nAnother disadvantage to a regulatory approach is that it gives hackers \ninsight into existing cybersecurity performance requirements and, as a \nresult, potential vulnerabilities. As industry representatives have \ntold us, this could actually make us less safe, not more safe.\n\n[[Page S1204]]\n\n  Thirdly, our bill does not create any new bureaucracy to facilitate \nthe sharing of cyber threat information. Rather, it relies upon the \nexisting cybersecurity centers and gives private entities the \nflexibility to share their cyber threat information with any cyber \ncenter. To ensure thorough dissemination within the government, each \ncybersecurity center is required to pass on to other centers any cyber \nthreat information it receives from an entity. Ultimately, we expect \nthat our current decentralized cybersecurity center structure will be \nenergized by an increase in shared cyber threat information. We also \nthink these centers, with their ongoing relationships with many private \nentities, provide a more robust and secure environment for information \nsharing than creating new cybersecurity exchanges or a new national \ncenter.\n  Another advantage of our ``no new regulatory authorities'' and ``no \nnew bureaucracy'' approach is it is also a ``no new spending'' \napproach. Our bill does not authorize any new spending, which is \nparticularly important given our current economic situation.\n  Fourth, our bill contains clear and unconditional protection from \ncivil and criminal liability for entities that rely upon the \nauthorities in the information-sharing title. Specifically, a private \nentity cannot be sued or prosecuted for using lawful countermeasures \nand cybersecurity systems to defend its networks and identify threats. \nIn addition, neither a private entity nor a Federal Government entity \ncan be sued or prosecuted for using, disclosing, or receiving cyber \nthreat information or for the subsequent action or inaction by an \nentity to which they gave cyber threat information.\n  These clear liability protections are necessary to encourage robust \ninformation sharing. If they are watered down or made conditional on \nsharing with the government, private sector lawyers will likely \ndiscourage their clients from sharing cyber threat information and, at \na minimum, sharing will be delayed while lawyers have to be consulted.\n  The final practical consideration that governed the drafting of our \ninformation-sharing title was to provide sensible safeguards for the \nprotection of personal privacy. We accomplished this in a number of \nways.\n  This information-sharing title is focused on the sharing of only \n``cyber threat information.'' It is a key definition in the bill. If \nyou study it carefully, you will see it is limited primarily to \ninformation related to malicious cyber activities. There is no \nauthorization or liability protection for using, sharing, or receiving \ninformation that falls outside of this definition. Nor can private \nentities use their cybersecurity systems to get information that falls \noutside this definition. Moreover, it helps to remember that people \nengaged in malicious cyber activities are essentially trespassers who \nhave no standing to assert privacy interests.\n  Besides this relatively narrow definition of ``cyber threat \ninformation,'' there is an additional privacy mechanism that limits the \ncollection and disclosure of cyber threat information for the purpose \nof preventing, investigating, or mitigating threats to information \nsecurity. In other words, if what you are doing is not for these \npurposes, then you cannot do it under this bill.\n  Another way this bill protects privacy is by requiring the government \nto handle all cyber threat information in a reasonable manner that \nconsiders the need to protect privacy and allows the use of anonymizing \ninformation.\n  Since information sharing is voluntary under our bill, private sector \nentities can take any steps to protect their own privacy interests and \nthe privacy of their customers. Moreover, our bill allows private \nsector entities to require the recipients of their cyber threat \ninformation to seek their consent before further disseminating the \ninformation.\n  Finally, Congress will be able to conduct its oversight since our \nbill requires an implementation report to Congress within 1 year of \nenactment, with follow-on reports every 2 years thereafter. These \nreports will give Congress detailed insight into a number of areas, \nincluding the degree to which privacy may be impacted by the provisions \nin this title.\n  Now that I have identified the key components and advantages of our \napproach to information sharing, let me explain why we were compelled \nto draft this separate bill.\n  All of the cosponsors of the SECURE IT Act agree with Senators \nLieberman and Collins and the White House that Congress needs to \naddress the cybersecurity threat. When we attempted to participate in \nthe cyber working groups, it became clear pretty early on that it was \ngoing to be difficult to come up with a consensus product.\n  My experience with working on bipartisan bills such as the \nIntelligence Authorization Act is that we generally start from scratch \nand only put in those provisions that are agreed to by both sides. If a \nprovision receives an objection, it is not included, but it is \nunderstood it may be an amendment during markup or on the floor. This \napproach always gives us a great starting point that enjoys the \noverwhelming support of both sides.\n  Since the working group process had essentially reached an impasse on \nthe issue of critical infrastructure regulation and how best to promote \ninformation sharing, the cosponsors of the SECURE IT Act joined \ntogether to develop a bill that would cover ``common ground'' and could \nserve as a better starting point for negotiations. We have listened to \nall sides in putting this bill together--government, industry, private \ngroups, cybersecurity experts, and our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in both the Senate and the House. There should be nothing \nsurprising in our bill. Our ranking member group has been telegraphing \nour priorities for months now.\n  If we are serious about passing cybersecurity legislation in this \nCongress--and I hope we are--we should be working together to pass a \nbill with the support of a large group of Senators far in excess of the \n60 we need, as we have done in the past on many major pieces of \nlegislation. I believe the ``common ground'' approach of the SECURE IT \nAct puts us on a clear path to reaching this goal.\n  This is important national security legislation. Fortunately, Leaders \nReid and McConnell have an outstanding record of garnering overwhelming \nbipartisan support for national security legislation, and I am \nconfident they will seek to do so again. I look forward to continuing \nthese discussions and getting a strong bipartisan bill signed into law.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak \nabout cybersecurity legislation--legislation we hope will soon be \nbefore the Senate.\n  There is no question--no question at all--that this is a critical \nissue that should be addressed by this Congress, and I am certain that \nevery Member of this body is concerned that our Nation may be \nvulnerable to cyber-attacks that could truly have very severe economic \nand security ramifications. We see stories about cyber-attacks daily--\nwhether they are attacks on individuals, on companies, on government--\nand I believe it is time for us to take steps to protect ourselves \nagainst this emerging threat.\n  In the coming weeks, the Senate is expected to take up legislation to \naddress this very real problem, and I am hopeful this effort will \nresult in legislation we can all agree is worthy of sending to the \nPresident. But right now it appears we are on track to follow an all-\nor-nothing approach. The problem I see with the bill that is expected \nto come to the floor--featuring text that was recently released by the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee--is that it has \nnot gone through regular order and, I fear, amounts to regulatory \noverreach. If that is our only option here, it will ultimately prevent \nus from making progress on cybersecurity here in Congress, which I \nthink would be an unfortunate outcome.\n  Because that outcome is unacceptable, I have introduced an \nalternative bill this morning, along with a number of ranking member \ncolleagues. I know Senator Chambliss from Georgia was here on the floor \nearlier, and many of us spoke to it earlier in the day. We call our \nbill the Strengthening and Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research, \nEducation, Information, and Technology Act of 2012. It has an acronym, \nof course. It is called SECURE IT for short. The bill follows a \ncommonsense approach to address our ever-increasing cyber threats.\n  Our bill focuses on four different areas we believe can draw \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S1205]]\n\nsupport and result in good public law. Those four areas are: \ninformation sharing, FISMA reform--which is intelligence-sharing \nreform--criminal penalties, as well as additional research.\n  What the SECURE IT bill does not do is equally important, because it \ndoes not simply add new layers of bureaucracy and regulation that will \nserve little purpose and achieve meager results. The Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee bill would arm the Department of \nHomeland Security with expansive new authorities to review all sectors \nof our economy and designate what is termed ``covered critical \ninfrastructure'' for further regulation. What we hear out there from \nindustry is that this amounts to regulation almost for regulation's \nsake. In the electricity industry's case, this is resulting in \nduplicative regulation that I am afraid will lead to a ``compliance \nfirst'' mentality. Companies will focus on meeting their new Federal \nrequirements and passing a seemingly endless stream of audits, but \nthese heavyhanded statistic requirements from yet one more Federal \nregulator will not necessarily address the very real threats we face. \nSo again, the concern is we will have industry focused on how do we \ncomply, how do we avoid a bad audit, instead of using their ingenuity \nand their resources to ensure we stay ahead of any future cyber-attack. \nWe need to be more nimble. We have to have a more nimble approach to \ndealing with cyber-related threats that are constantly growing and \nconstantly changing. The threat we see today is not necessarily the \nthreat we might anticipate tomorrow, so we have to stay ahead of the \ngame. This is important, and this is where our SECURE IT bill comes in. \nI think we have simply taken a more pragmatic approach by focusing on \nthe areas where we know we can find some bipartisan support.\n  One area I think we can all agree on is that the Federal Government \nneeds to form a partnership with the private sector. We share the same \ngoals, that is clear. The goals are to keep our computer systems and \nour Nation safe from cyber intrusions. We need the private companies to \nbe talking with each other and with the government about the cyber \nproblems they face as well as the potential strategies and the \nsolutions to combat them. To achieve this goal, our legislation \nencourages the voluntary sharing of much needed information by removing \nlegal barriers to its use and its disclosure. At the same time, we are \nvery careful to safeguard the privacy and prohibit information from \nbeing used for competitive advantage.\n  Our bill also provides necessary updates to the Federal Information \nSecurity Management Act. This is the FISMA I spoke to a minute ago. \nThese FISMA reforms require real-time monitoring of Federal systems. It \nwill modernize the way the government manages and mitigates its own \ncyber risks. And unlike other legislation on this subject, the cyber \nbill we have introduced today will update criminal statutes to account \nfor cyber activities. Finally, we support advanced cybersecurity \nresearch by leveraging existing resources without necessarily spending \nnew Federal dollars. That is very important for us.\n  This straightforward approach to cybersecurity, I think, can go a \nlong way in tackling the problem. Clearly, our own government agencies \nhere need to be communicating a little bit better with one another. An \nexample of this is that the White House and Department of Homeland \nSecurity are staging an exercise next week. All Members have been \ninvited to attend and go through this exercise. It is a mock scenario \nthat will feature a cyber-attack on the Nation's grid. And while I \nabsolutely think this is a useful exercise, and something that is well \nworthwhile, I do find it quite surprising--quite surprising--that DHS \nwould set up a grid attack scenario and fail to include the grid's \nprimary regulators. These would be the electric reliability \norganization--what we call NERC--and the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, or FERC. These are the two regulatory agencies currently in \nplace that provide for that cyber regulation. It is mandated within our \ngrid that these agencies tend to just this issue. So it does make me \nquestion if DHS is even aware the electric industry is the only \nindustry already subject to mandatory cyber standards, or that the NERC \nhas the ability to issue time-sensitive alerts to electric utilities in \nthe event of emergency situations. It is kind of hard for me to \nunderstand why DHS would proceed with a grid attack simulation and not \ninclude the existing governmental entities that already have these \nsafeguards in place. It also begs the question as to whether Congress \nshould provide DHS with such significant and expansive new authorities \nin the cyber arena.\n  Before I close, I wish to take a moment to talk about the process \nbehind cybersecurity legislation. While my colleagues and I have \nhighlighted the substantive and procedural problems that are associated \nwith the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee bill, the \nmajority, and even the press, have attempted to dismiss our arguments \nas nothing more than partisan stall tactics.\n  I stand before you to tell you that is simply not true. I want to \ntake action on cyber. I know all of the ranking members who have joined \ntogether on this issue want to take action on cyber. We need to do it. \nI have been calling for action and for legislation since last Congress. \nWe have been working on it in the Energy Committee and have moved out \nthat cyber energy piece. But I do think it is important around this \nbody that there is some meaning to the process; that process really \ndoes matter. That is how strong, bipartisan pieces of legislation are \nenacted. When we forego that process and refuse to do the hard work in \nthe committee--and it is hard. But if we don't do that, we put \nourselves on a path to failure with that legislation.\n  So when we have seven ranking members taking issue with how a bill \nhas been put together, I think we had better pay attention. I think we \nneed to look at whether our process is working.\n  The SECURE IT bill we introduced today is a strong starting point for \nus. Some may argue we need to go a little further. But additional \nlayers of bureaucracy and regulations are not the answer at this time. \nLegislating in the four areas we have highlights--in the information \nsharing, the FISMA reform, criminal penalties, and research--these are \nnecessary first steps that will make a tremendous amount of difference. \nIf we need to do more in the future, we in Congress can certainly make \nthat determination. But let's not take an all-or-nothing approach to \ncyber legislation and ultimately end up empty-handed.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look at what we have presented today \nand consider supporting the SECURE IT Act so we can continue to ensure \nour citizens, our companies, and our country are protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1205-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1205-S1206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 385--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN FOR ITS \n     CONTINUED PERSECUTION, IMPRISONMENT, AND SENTENCING OF YOUCEF \n                  NADARKHANI ON THE CHARGE OF APOSTASY\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Kirk, \nMr. Blunt, and Mr. Hatch) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 386\n\n       Whereas democracy, human rights, and civil liberties are \n     universal values and fundamental principles of United States \n     foreign policy;\n       Whereas an essential element of democratic self-government \n     is for leaders to be chosen and regularly held accountable \n     through elections that are organized and conducted in a \n     manner that is free, fair, inclusive, and consistent with \n     international standards;\n       Whereas governments whose power does not derive from free \n     and fair elections lack democratic legitimacy;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a \n     signatory to the United Nations International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, adopted December 16, 1966 \n     (ICCPR), which states that every citizen has the right to \n     vote ``at genuine periodic elections'' that reflect ``the \n     free expression of the will of the electors'';\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     regularly violates its obligations under the ICCPR, holding \n     elections that are neither free nor fair nor consistent with \n     international standards;\n       Whereas elections in Iran are marred by the \n     disqualification of candidates based on their political \n     views; the absence of credible international observers; \n     severe restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and \n     association, including censorship, surveillance, and \n     disruptions in telecommunications, and the absence of a free \n     media; widespread intimidation and repression of candidates, \n     political parties, and citizens; and systemic electoral fraud \n     and manipulation;\n       Whereas the last nationwide election held in Iran, on June \n     12, 2009, was widely condemned inside Iran and throughout the \n     world as neither free nor fair and provoked large-scale \n     peaceful protests throughout Iran;\n       Whereas, following the June 12, 2009, election, the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran responded to \n     peaceful protests with a large-scale campaign of politically \n     motivated violence, intimidation, and repression, including \n     acts of torture, cruel and degrading treatment in detention, \n     rape, executions, extrajudicial killings, and indefinite \n     detention;\n       Whereas, on December 26, 2011, the United Nations General \n     Assembly passed a resolution denouncing the serious human \n     rights abuses occurring in the Islamic Republic of Iran;\n       Whereas authorities in Iran continue to hold several \n     candidates from the 2009 election in indefinite detention;\n       Whereas authorities in Iran have announced that nationwide \n     parliamentary elections will be held on March 2, 2012;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     banned more than 2,200 candidates from participating in the \n     March 2, 2012, elections, including current members of \n     parliament;\n       Whereas no domestic or international election observers are \n     scheduled to oversee the March 2, 2012, elections;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     continues to hold leading opposition figures under house \n     arrest;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     seeks to prevent the people of Iran from accessing news and \n     information by incarcerating more journalists than any other \n     country in the world, according to a 2011 report from the \n     Committee to Protect Journalists; disrupting access to the \n     Internet, including blocking e-mail and social networking \n     sites and limiting access to foreign news and websites, \n     developing a national Internet that will facilitate \n     government censorship of news and information, and jamming \n     international broadcasts such as the Voice of America's \n     Persian News Network and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's \n     Radio Farda;

and\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\n       (C) allowing the Internet to remain free and open and \n     allowing domestic and international media to operate freely;\n       (7) further calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran to allow international election monitors to be \n     present for the March 2, 2012, elections; and\n       (8) urges the President, the Secretary of State, and other \n     world leaders--\n       (A) to express support for the universal rights and \n     freedoms of the people of Iran, including to democratic self-\n     government;\n       (B) to broaden engagement with the people of Iran and \n     support efforts in the country to help promote human rights \n     and democratic reform, including by providing appropriate \n     funding to civil society organizations for democracy and \n     governance activities; and\n       (C) to condemn elections that are not free and fair and \n     that do not meet international standards.\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Hoeven-Blumenthal \nresolution, and also, in addition to requesting 10 minutes, I request \nthat my cosponsor on the resolution, Senator Blumenthal, be allowed to \nengage with me in this discussion.\n  We have submitted a resolution calling for free and fair elections in \nIran. Those elections will be held tomorrow, March 2. It is the first \ntime the Republic of Iran has had parliamentary elections since June \n12, 2009. I thank Senator Blumenthal for joining me in this resolution \nand also Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Joe Lieberman, and Senator \nKelly Ayotte. As I say, I think we have now over 60 sponsors on this \nresolution, working to see that it can pass the Senate here very \nquickly. It expresses a sense of the Senate clearly calling for open, \nfree, and fair elections in the Republic of Iran. The problem is that \nthe elections they will be holding tomorrow are neither free nor fair. \nThey are certainly not consistent with international standards.\n  As I said, these will be the first nationwide parliamentary elections \nsince June 12, 2009. Those elections were neither free nor fair, and \nthey provoked widespread protests throughout Iran. Those protests were \nbrutally repressed, put down by the regime, Ayatollah Khamenei and \nPrime Minister Ahmadinejad, trampling human rights and taking political \nprisoners who remain in prison to this very day.\n  Since the last elections, uprisings, popular movements for self-\ndetermination, have taken place throughout the Middle East--often \nreferred to as the Arab spring--in countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, \nLibya, and other places as well. We want to support that right to self-\ndetermination in Iran for the people in Iran as well.\n  Right now the only people who can run for office in Iran are people \nwho are approved to run by the regime itself. They have the Council of \nGuardians, and the Council of Guardians has to approve anyone who wants \nto run for office, so the reality is the government of the regime \nitself decides whether you can run for office. About over 5,000 \nindividuals applied to run for government, and of those 5,000 about \n3,000 were approved by the Iranian regime to run. More than 2,000 were \ndenied, so they cannot even run. Well, how can you have a free or a \nfair and or an open election that meets independent standards when the \ngovernment decides who can run and who cannot run? It doesn't work. \nThat is not the way elections should work.\n  America truly is a force for freedom and for democracy in the world, \nand that is why we are working to call the attention of the world to \nthese elections. It is particularly important at this time that we \nstand with the Iranian people in calling for free and fair elections as \nwe impose sanctions to try to prevent government from developing a \nnuclear weapon. We want to make very clear that while we need to impose \nstrong, consistent sanctions that prevent the Iranian regime from \nobtaining a nuclear bomb, at the same time we support the Iranian \npeople's right to self-determination.\n  Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Connecticut for working \nwith me on this resolution and recognizing the right of the Iranian \npeople. I also want to thank our colleagues, as I say, now more than \n60--who have joined us on this resolution and also look forward to \nquick passage.\n  With that, I wish to turn the floor over to my colleague, the good \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for his leadership on this very important issue. I want to thank \nhim for his perseverance and his vision in seeing the importance--along \nwith Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and Senator Sessions--of this kind \nof effort, which had its genesis in the trip that we took to \nAfghanistan, Egypt, Israel, Tunisia, and Libya.\n  What impressed us so much is how democracy is growing and starting \nthere, and in that part of the world how the dictatorship and tyranny \nof Iran are such contrasts with the hopeful, burgeoning democracies \nthat are growing there. That is the reason so many of our colleagues--I \nbelieve that over 60--have joined.\n  I want to ask unanimous consent that Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored today to speak in support \nof the Hoeven-Blumenthal resolution calling for free and fair elections \nin Iran and condemning the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \nfor its ongoing violations of human rights. These violations are \nbrutal, tangible, and real in their impact on individual lives in that \ncountry, and our hearts go out to the people of Iran, particularly the \nindividuals there fighting for freedom and democracy.\n  The world has watched the Arab spring bring down dictators in Tunisia \nand Tripoli, and the people of Iran continue to be denied those basic \nhuman rights that we hold dear and which should be universal.\n  I also want to thank Secretary Clinton for her tireless work in this \nregion. She arrived in Tunisia shortly after we left to consult with \nall nations interested in aiding the Syrian people and she showed, \nagain, her dedication to this same cause of human rights through her \nleadership there.\n  I saw in our meetings with a new generation of leaders that is \nemerging in the Middle East how dramatic the statements we make here \nand the actions that we take impress them in their fight for basic \nhuman rights. How we are speaking out here for universal suffrage and \nfreedom has an impact on what they do, and perhaps many in our own \ncountry need to be reminded about the importance of what we say and do \nhere.\n  The parliamentary elections that will occur on Friday in Iran will be \nneither free nor fair. They have already taken actions to assure that \nit will be, as one observer said, the fakest one yet. But the brutal \noppression in human rights going on there is too real for those who \nsuffer at that government's and that regime's hands. As the resolution \nmakes clear, Iran has already disqualified 2,200 candidates from \nactually running for office simply based on their political views.\n  It maintains severe restrictions on the press, strangling a free \npress, preventing even the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe from \nreaching the people of Iran, having created a sham election, a \ntravesty, and a tragedy. The Iranian regime now will force Iranians to \nvote at the polls in an effort to show popular support, and force them \nto vote simply to show this sham support. The truth is it has no such \nsupport. Allowing international monitors to bear witness, as we demand \nin our resolution, would reveal these acts of oppression for what they \nare and for the world to see.\n  The last nationwide election held in Iran, on June 12, 2009, was \nwidely condemned throughout the world. Following the election, there \nwas brutal repression documented all too dramatically by the videos and \nother evidence that, in effect, was smuggled out of Iran, although in \nreal time. That large campaign of politically motivated violence, \nintimidation, repression, torture, cruel and degrading treatment, \nincluding rape, executions, and extrajudicial killings, and indefinite \ndetention is all well documented.\n  On December 26, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly passed a \nresolution denouncing the serious human rights abuses occurring in \nIran. The Hoeven-Blumenthal resolution lets the people of Iran know we \nare with them, they are not alone; that we side with them, and we stand \nand speak out on their behalf because they are not forgotten in their \neffort for democracy.\n  The future of the Middle East will be determined first and foremost \nby the\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\npeople of the Middle East themselves, but American strength, vision, \nand leadership are absolutely essential. So in that regard I am very \nproud and grateful for the 62 cosponsors of this resolution--now 63 \nwith Senator Klobuchar--and I again thank the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I, too, wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Blumenthal and to all our cosponsors, and I look forward to the \nSenate agreeing to this important resolution.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 387\n\n       Whereas in 1776, the United States of America was imagined, \n     as stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a new \n     country dedicated to the proposition that ``. . . all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness . . . .'';\n       Whereas the first Africans were brought involuntarily to \n     the shores of America as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African-Americans suffered enslavement and \n     subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, \n     and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of \n     citizenship;\n       Whereas inequalities and injustices in our society still \n     exist today;\n       Whereas in the face of injustices, people of the United \n     States of good will and of all races distinguished themselves \n     with a commitment to the noble ideals on which the United \n     States was founded and courageously fought for the rights and \n     freedom of African-Americans;\n       Whereas many African-American men and women worked against \n     racism to achieve success and have made significant \n     contributions to the economic, educational, political, \n     artistic, literary, scientific, and technological \n     advancements of the United States;\n       Whereas the greatness of the United States is reflected in \n     the contributions of African-Americans in all walks of life \n     throughout the history of the United States;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Colonel Allen Allensworth, Muhammad Ali, \n     Constance Baker Motley, James Baldwin, James Beckwourth, \n     Clara Brown, Ralph Bunche, Shirley Chisholm, Frederick \n     Douglass, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ralph Ellison, Alex Haley, \n     Dorothy Height, Lena Horne, Charles Hamilton Houston, Mahalia \n     Jackson, Martin Luther King, Jr., the Tuskeegee Airmen, \n     Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, Bill Pickett, Jackie Robinson, \n     Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman each lived a life of \n     incandescent greatness, while many African-Americans lived, \n     toiled, and died in obscurity, never achieving the \n     recognition they deserved and yet paved the way for future \n     generations to succeed;\n       Whereas, pioneers such as Maya Angelou, Arthur Ashe, Jr., \n     Carol Moseley Braun, Ronald Brown, Ursula Burns, Kenneth \n     Chenault, David Dinkins, Alexis Herman, Mae Jemison, Earvin \n     ``Magic'' Johnson, Sheila Johnson, James Earl Jones, David \n     Paterson, Marian Wright Edelman, Alice Walker, and Oprah \n     Winfrey have all benefitted from their forefathers and have \n     served as great role models and leaders for future \n     generations to come;\n       Whereas on November 4, 2008, the people of the United \n     States elected an African-American man, Barack Obama, as \n     President of the United States;\n       Whereas African-Americans continue to serve the United \n     States at the highest levels of government and military;\n       Whereas on February 22, 2012, President Barack Obama and \n     First Lady Michelle Obama, along with former First Lady Laura \n     Bush, celebrated the groundbreaking of the National Museum of \n     African American History and Culture on the National Mall in \n     Washington, DC;\n       Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick \n     Douglass inspired the creation of Negro History Week, the \n     precursor to Black History Month;\n       Whereas Negro History Week represented the culmination of \n     the efforts of Dr. Carter G. Woodson to enhance knowledge of \n     black history through the Journal of Negro History, published \n     by the Association for the Study of African American Life and \n     History, which was founded by Dr. Woodson and Jesse E. \n     Moorland;\n       Whereas Black History Month, celebrated during the month of \n     February, dates back to 1926 when Dr. Woodson set aside a \n     special period of time in February to recognize the heritage \n     and achievement of black Americans;\n       Whereas Dr. Woodson, the ``Father of Black History'', \n     stated, ``We have a wonderful history behind us. . . . If you \n     are unable to demonstrate to the world that you have this \n     record, the world will say to you, `You are not worthy to \n     enjoy the blessings of democracy or anything else.' '';\n       Whereas since the founding, the United States has been an \n     imperfect work in making progress towards noble goals; and\n       Whereas the history of the United States is the story of a \n     people regularly affirming high ideals, striving to reach \n     those ideals but often failing, and then struggling to come \n     to terms with the disappointment of that failure before \n     committing to trying again: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges that all of the people of the United \n     States are the recipients of the wealth of history given to \n     us by black culture;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of Black History Month as an \n     opportunity to reflect on the complex history of the United \n     States, while remaining hopeful and confident about the path \n     that lies ahead;\n       (3) acknowledges the significance of Black History Month as \n     an important opportunity to recognize the tremendous \n     contributions of African-Americans to the history of the \n     United States;\n       (4) encourages the celebration of Black History Month to \n     provide a continuing opportunity for all people in the United \n     States to learn from the past and to understand the \n     experiences that have shaped the United States; and\n       (5) agrees that while the United States began in division, \n     the United States must now move forward with purpose, united \n     tirelessly as one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and \n     justice for all, and to honor the contribution of all \n     pioneers in this country who help ensure the legacy of these \n     great United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1208-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1208-S1209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 388--COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR \n     OF 1812 AND ``THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER'', AND RECOGNIZING THE \n HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE, HEROIC HUMAN ENDEAVOR, AND SACRIFICE OF THE \nUNITED STATES ARMY, NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AND REVENUE MARINE SERVICE, AND \n                 STATE MILITIAS, DURING THE WAR OF 1812\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Portman, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nLevin, and Mr. Sessions) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 388\n\n       Whereas the period beginning in 2012 and ending in 2015 \n     marks the bicentennial celebration of the War of 1812 and \n     ``The Star Spangled Banner'';\n       Whereas the War of 1812, which has been referred to as the \n     ``Second War of Independence'', confirmed the independence of \n     the United States from Great Britain in the eyes of the world \n     and shaped the expansion and growth of the United States in \n     later decades;\n       Whereas the United States declared war on Great Britain on \n     June 18, 1812, to redress wrongs including--\n           (1) the impressment of United States sailors;\n           (2) the violation of the neutrality rights of the \n     United States; and\n           (3) the violation of the territorial waters of the \n     United States;\n\n       Whereas, despite the vastly superior size of the military \n     of Great Britain, the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, \n     and Revenue Marine Service (a predecessor of the United \n     States Coast Guard), and State militias (the predecessors of \n     the National Guard), won a number of significant victories, \n     ensuring that the liberties won by the United States during \n     the Revolutionary War were not lost;\n       Whereas major battles of the War of 1812 that were fought \n     on the water, including the battle between U.S.S. \n     Constitution and H.M.S. Guerriere, the Battle of Lake \n     Champlain, and victories on the Great Lakes, showcased the \n     might, bravery, and war-fighting tactics of the United States \n     maritime forces;\n       Whereas the decisive victory of Oliver Hazard Perry over a \n     British fleet near Put-In-Bay, Ohio in the Battle of Lake \n     Erie ensured that--\n           (1) the United States gained control of the Great \n     Lakes; and\n           (2) portions of the Old Northwest Territory, such as \n     Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, remained \n     part of the United States;\n\n       Whereas State militias, the oldest component of the Armed \n     Forces of the United\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\n     States, answered the call to service, defending their \n     communities and their country from aggression by Great \n     Britain;\n       Whereas United States forces seized the city of Mobile from \n     Spanish control in 1813, built Fort Bowyer to protect the \n     city, and in 1814 successfully repelled a vastly larger \n     British force from the city, resulting in Mobile becoming one \n     of the few permanent land concessions gained by the United \n     States during the War of 1812;\n       Whereas Great Britain unleashed grievous attacks on the \n     capital of the United States, Washington, D.C., burning to \n     the ground the United States Capitol Building, the White \n     House, and much of the rest of the city;\n       Whereas, after 2\\1/2\\ years of conflict, the British Royal \n     Navy sailed up the Chesapeake Bay in an attempt to capture \n     Baltimore, Maryland;\n       Whereas United States forces at Fort McHenry, stationed in \n     the outer harbor of Baltimore, Maryland under the command of \n     Brevet Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead, withstood nearly \n     25 hours of bombardment by the British forces and refused to \n     yield, thereby forcing the British to give up the invasion \n     and withdraw;\n       Whereas Francis Scott Key, a United States lawyer who was \n     being held by the British on board a United States flag-of-\n     truce vessel in the harbor, saw ``by the dawn's early \n     light'', as Key would later write, an American flag still \n     flying over Fort McHenry after the horrific attack;\n       Whereas Francis Scott Key immortalized the event in a poem \n     entitled ``Defense of Fort McHenry'', which was later set to \n     music and called ``The Star-Spangled Banner'';\n       Whereas ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' became the national \n     anthem of the United States on March 3, 1931, when President \n     Herbert Hoover signed Public Law 71 823;\n       Whereas General Andrew Jackson, who would later become the \n     seventh President of the United States, won the Battle of \n     Horsehoe Bend and then triumphed in the decisive Battle of \n     New Orleans, which, although fought after the signing of the \n     Treaty of Ghent, was a great source of pride to the young \n     United States and provided momentum for growth and prosperity \n     in the years that would follow;\n       Whereas, since 1916, the people of the United States have \n     entrusted the National Park Service with the care of national \n     parks and sites of historical significance to the country, \n     including Fort McHenry and more than 30 other sites and \n     National Heritage Areas that tell the story of the War of \n     1812;\n       Whereas the diverse historic sites relating to the War of \n     1812 include homes, battlefields, and landscapes that \n     highlight the contributions made by a wide range of people in \n     the United States during the war;\n       Whereas one such historic site is the Fort McHenry National \n     Monument and Historic Shrine, the birthplace of ``The Star \n     Spangled Banner'', where the symbols of both the flag and the \n     national anthem of the United States come together;\n       Whereas the people of the United States are grateful for \n     the rights defended through hard fighting during the War of \n     1812 by the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and \n     Revenue Marine Service, and State militias, including the \n     protection of United States citizens at home and abroad, \n     unrestricted trade, free and open ports, and the protection \n     of the territorial integrity of the United States against \n     aggression; and\n       Whereas, during the bicentennial years of the War of 1812 \n     and ``The Star Spangled Banner'', it is fitting that the \n     bravery and steadfast determination of the United States land \n     and maritime forces be celebrated by the grateful people of \n     the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the memory of all the people of the United \n     States who came together during the War of 1812, particularly \n     the fallen heroes who gave their lives during the ``Second \n     War of Independence'';\n       (2) commends the men and women of the United States Army, \n     Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, and the State \n     National Guards, who preserve the ideals of freedom, \n     democracy, and the pursuit of happiness that were guaranteed \n     by the victories of the War of 1812;\n       (3) congratulates the Armed Forces of the United States, \n     the National Parks Service, the Maryland War of 1812 \n     Bicentennial Commission, and all other organizations and \n     individuals who are involved in preserving and promoting the \n     history of this great country, and supports their \n     commemoration of the War of 1812 and ``The Star Spangled \n     Banner''; and\n       (4) calls on all people of the United States to join in the \n     commemoration of the bicentennial of the War of 1812 and \n     ``The Star Spangled Banner'' in events throughout the United \n     States, to celebrate that at the end of the war, as Francis \n     Scott Key wrote, ``our flag was still there''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1209-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 35--TO ESTABLISH THE JOINT CONGRESSIONAL \n     COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES FOR THE INAUGURATION OF THE \n   PRESIDENT-ELECT AND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES ON \n                            JANUARY 21, 2013\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution;

Res. 387\n\n       Whereas in 1776, the United States of America was imagined, \n     as stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a new \n     country dedicated to the proposition that ``. . . all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness . . . .'';\n       Whereas the first Africans were brought involuntarily to \n     the shores of America as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African-Americans suffered enslavement and \n     subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, \n     and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of \n     citizenship;\n       Whereas inequalities and injustices in our society still \n     exist today;\n       Whereas in the face of injustices, people of the United \n     States of good will and of all races distinguished themselves \n     with a commitment to the noble ideals on which the United \n     States was founded and courageously fought for the rights and \n     freedom of African-Americans;\n       Whereas many African-American men and women worked against \n     racism to achieve success and have made significant \n     contributions to the economic, educational, political, \n     artistic, literary, scientific, and technological \n     advancements of the United States;\n       Whereas the greatness of the United States is reflected in \n     the contributions of African-Americans in all walks of life \n     throughout the history of the United States;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Colonel Allen Allensworth, Muhammad Ali, \n     Constance Baker Motley, James Baldwin, James Beckwourth, \n     Clara Brown, Ralph Bunche, Shirley Chisholm, Frederick \n     Douglass, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ralph Ellison, Alex Haley, \n     Dorothy Height, Lena Horne, Charles Hamilton Houston, Mahalia \n     Jackson, Martin Luther King, Jr., the Tuskeegee Airmen, \n     Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, Bill Pickett, Jackie Robinson, \n     Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman each lived a life of \n     incandescent greatness, while many African-Americans lived, \n     toiled, and died in obscurity, never achieving the \n     recognition they deserved and yet paved the way for future \n     generations to succeed;\n       Whereas, pioneers such as Maya Angelou, Arthur Ashe, Jr., \n     Carol Moseley Braun, Ronald Brown, Ursula Burns, Kenneth \n     Chenault, David Dinkins, Alexis Herman, Mae Jemison, Earvin \n     ``Magic'' Johnson, Sheila Johnson, James Earl Jones, David \n     Paterson, Marian Wright Edelman, Alice Walker, and Oprah \n     Winfrey have all benefitted from their forefathers and have \n     served as great role models and leaders for future \n     generations to come;\n       Whereas on November 4, 2008, the people of the United \n     States elected an African-American man, Barack Obama, as \n     President of the United States;\n       Whereas African-Americans continue to serve the United \n     States at the highest levels of government and military;\n       Whereas on February 22, 2012, President Barack Obama and \n     First Lady Michelle Obama, along with former First Lady Laura \n     Bush, celebrated the groundbreaking of the National Museum of \n     African American History and Culture on the National Mall in \n     Washington, DC;\n       Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick \n     Douglass inspired the creation of Negro History Week, the \n     precursor to Black History Month;\n       Whereas Negro History Week represented the culmination of \n     the efforts of Dr. Carter G. Woodson to enhance knowledge of \n     black history through the Journal of Negro History, published \n     by the Association for the Study of African American Life and \n     History, which was founded by Dr. Woodson and Jesse E. \n     Moorland;\n       Whereas Black History Month, celebrated during the month of \n     February, dates back to 1926 when Dr. Woodson set aside a \n     special period of time in February to recognize the heritage \n     and achievement of black Americans;\n       Whereas Dr. Woodson, the ``Father of Black History'', \n     stated, ``We have a wonderful history behind us. . . . If you \n     are unable to demonstrate to the world that you have this \n     record, the world will say to you, `You are not worthy to \n     enjoy the blessings of democracy or anything else.' '';\n       Whereas since the founding, the United States has been an \n     imperfect work in making progress towards noble goals; and\n       Whereas the history of the United States is the story of a \n     people regularly affirming high ideals, striving to reach \n     those ideals but often failing, and then struggling to come \n     to terms with the disappointment of that failure before \n     committing to trying again: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges that all of the people of the United \n     States are the recipients of the wealth of history given to \n     us by black culture;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of Black History Month as an \n     opportunity to reflect on the complex history of the United \n     States, while remaining hopeful and confident about the path \n     that lies ahead;\n       (3) acknowledges the significance of Black History Month as \n     an important opportunity to recognize the tremendous \n     contributions of\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\n     African-Americans to the history of the United States;\n       (4) encourages the celebration of Black History Month to \n     provide a continuing opportunity for all people in the United \n     States to learn from the past and to understand the \n     experiences that have shaped the United States; and\n       (5) agrees that while the United States began in division, \n     the United States must now move forward with purpose, united \n     tirelessly as one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and \n     justice for all, and to honor the contribution of all \n     pioneers in this country who help ensure the legacy of these \n     great United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1369-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR OF 1812 AND ``THE STAR \n                           SPANGLED BANNER''\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 388) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 388\n\n       Whereas the period beginning in 2012 and ending in 2015 \n     marks the bicentennial celebration of the War of 1812 and \n     ``The Star Spangled Banner'';\n       Whereas the War of 1812, which has been referred to as the \n     ``Second War of Independence'', confirmed the independence of \n     the United States from Great Britain in the eyes of the world \n     and shaped the expansion and growth of the United States in \n     later decades;\n       Whereas the United States declared war on Great Britain on \n     June 18, 1812, to redress wrongs including--\n       (1) the impressment of United States sailors;\n       (2) the violation of the neutrality rights of the United \n     States; and\n       (3) the violation of the territorial waters of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, despite the vastly superior size of the military \n     of Great Britain, the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, \n     and Revenue Marine Service (a predecessor of the United \n     States Coast Guard), and State militias (the predecessors of \n     the National Guard), won a number of significant victories, \n     ensuring that the liberties won by the United States during \n     the Revolutionary War were not lost;\n       Whereas major battles of the War of 1812 that were fought \n     on the water, including the battle between U.S.S. \n     Constitution and H.M.S. Guerriere, the Battle of Lake \n     Champlain, and victories on the Great Lakes, showcased the \n     might, bravery, and war-fighting tactics of the United States \n     maritime forces;\n       Whereas the decisive victory of Oliver Hazard Perry over a \n     British fleet near Put-In-Bay, Ohio in the Battle of Lake \n     Erie ensured that--\n       (1) the United States gained control of the Great Lakes; \n     and\n       (2) portions of the Old Northwest Territory, such as Ohio, \n     Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, remained part \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas State militias, the oldest component of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States, answered the call to service, \n     defending their communities and their country from aggression \n     by Great Britain;\n       Whereas United States forces seized the city of Mobile from \n     Spanish control in 1813, built Fort Bowyer to protect the \n     city, and in 1814 successfully repelled a vastly larger \n     British force from the city, resulting in Mobile becoming one \n     of the few permanent land concessions gained by the United \n     States during the War of 1812;\n       Whereas Great Britain unleashed grievous attacks on the \n     capital of the United States, Washington, D.C., burning to \n     the ground the United States Capitol Building, the White \n     House, and much of the rest of the city;\n       Whereas, after 2 \\1/2\\ years of conflict, the British Royal \n     Navy sailed up the Chesapeake Bay in an attempt to capture \n     Baltimore, Maryland;\n       Whereas United States forces at Fort McHenry, stationed in \n     the outer harbor of Baltimore, Maryland under the command of \n     Brevet Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead, withstood nearly \n     25 hours of bombardment by the British forces and refused to \n     yield, thereby forcing the British to give up the invasion \n     and withdraw;\n       Whereas Francis Scott Key, a United States lawyer who was \n     being held by the British on board a United States flag-of-\n     truce vessel in the harbor, saw ``by the dawn's early \n     light'', as Key would later write, an American flag still \n     flying over Fort McHenry after the horrific attack;\n       Whereas Francis Scott Key immortalized the event in a poem \n     entitled ``Defense of Fort McHenry'', which was later set to \n     music and called ``The Star-Spangled Banner'';\n       Whereas ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' became the national \n     anthem of the United States on March 3, 1931, when President \n     Herbert Hoover signed Public Law 71 823;\n       Whereas General Andrew Jackson, who would later become the \n     seventh President of the United States, won the Battle of \n     Horsehoe Bend and then triumphed in the decisive Battle of \n     New Orleans, which, although fought after the signing of the \n     Treaty of Ghent, was a great source of pride to the young \n     United States and provided momentum for growth and prosperity \n     in the years that would follow;\n       Whereas, since 1916, the people of the United States have \n     entrusted the National Park Service with the care of national \n     parks and sites of historical significance to the country, \n     including Fort McHenry and more than 30 other sites and \n     National Heritage Areas that tell the story of the War of \n     1812;\n       Whereas the diverse historic sites relating to the War of \n     1812 include homes, battlefields, and landscapes that \n     highlight the contributions made by a wide range of people in \n     the United States during the war;\n       Whereas one such historic site is the Fort McHenry National \n     Monument and Historic Shrine, the birthplace of ``The Star \n     Spangled Banner'', where the symbols of both the flag and the \n     national anthem of the United States come together;\n       Whereas the people of the United States are grateful for \n     the rights defended through hard fighting during the War of \n     1812 by the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and \n     Revenue Marine Service, and State militias, including the \n     protection of United States citizens at home and abroad, \n     unrestricted trade, free and open ports, and the protection \n     of the territorial integrity of the United States against \n     aggression; and\n       Whereas, during the bicentennial years of the War of 1812 \n     and ``The Star Spangled Banner'', it is fitting that the \n     bravery and steadfast determination of the United States land \n     and maritime forces be celebrated by the grateful people of \n     the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the memory of all the people of the United \n     States who came together during the War of 1812, particularly \n     the fallen heroes who gave their lives during the ``Second \n     War of Independence'';\n       (2) commends the men and women of the United States Army, \n     Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, and the State \n     National Guards, who preserve the ideals of freedom, \n     democracy, and the pursuit of happiness that were guaranteed \n     by the victories of the War of 1812;\n       (3) congratulates the Armed Forces of the United States, \n     the National Parks Service, the Maryland War of 1812 \n     Bicentennial Commission, and all other organizations and \n     individuals who are involved in preserving and promoting the \n     history of this great country, and supports their \n     commemoration of the War of 1812 and ``The Star Spangled \n     Banner''; and\n       (4) calls on all people of the United States to join in the \n     commemoration of the bicentennial of the War of 1812 and \n     ``The Star Spangled Banner'' in events throughout the United \n     States, to celebrate that at the end of the war, as Francis \n     Scott Key wrote, ``our flag was still there''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/01/senate-section/article/S1369-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MARCH 2, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.
