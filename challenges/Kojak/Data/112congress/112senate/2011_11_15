The Republican leader and I will make a few remarks today. \nAfter that, the majority will hold the first half and the Republicans \nthe final half of 1 hour in morning business. Following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will be in executive session to consider the \nGleason and Rogers nominations. At this stage, we have two scheduled \nvotes. We are going to work with the managers, Senators Leahy and \nGrassley, and see whether we need that second vote, and that decision \nwill be made later this morning. At around 12, there will be, as I \nindicated, up to two rollcall votes on confirmation of these \nnominations. Following that vote, the Senate will recess until 2:15 \np.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings. At 2:15, we will resume \nconsideration of the Energy and Water appropriations bill.\n  As I indicated yesterday, we have a lot to do. Thanksgiving is the \nweek after the day after tomorrow, and we have a lot of things we have \nto complete.\n  I gave my word that we are going to do the Defense authorization \nbill. It still hasn't been worked out to the satisfaction of everyone, \nbut there comes a time when we have to stop negotiating and move to the \nlegislation. We are going to do that following our finishing the next \nminibus we have. It will be wonderful if we can complete that quickly. \nAs I indicated yesterday, I am not going to fill the legislative tree, \nbut I don't know how much time we are going to be able to spend on this \nwith never-ending amendments. What I would like to do is what we have \ndone in the past, which is to have people offer amendments. But we have \nto have some kind of a limit that will be self-imposed--that we will \nhave maybe 10 stacked amendments and we will have to figure out some \nway to dispose of those before we move to another batch of amendments. \nWe will work our way through that. Our staffs, Mr. Myrick and Mr. \nSchiappa, have been working to see if they can help us work through \nthese issues we have.\n  We also have the CR we have to do. We hope we will have the first \nminibus conference completed on that, and we will finish that this work \nperiod.\n  So there is a lot to do. When we come back after Thanksgiving, we \nonly have 3 or 4 weeks until we are there at Christmas.\n  As I said yesterday, it looks as if we are going to be able to finish \nour work here at a reasonable time this week. I hope we don't have to \nwork this weekend, and I hope we don't have to work next week. I don't \nthink we will have to do that, but everyone should be prepared in case \nwe do because we have some things that have to be done, such as the CR.\n  When we come back after the Thanksgiving recess, I tell everyone now \nthat we are not going to be able to do our normal short weeks here. So \npeople are going to have to spend less time at home because the \nworkload after Thanksgiving is really full of lots to do. Again, we \nhave expiring tax provisions we have to work on. If we are fortunate, \nif the committee comes up with something, that is 30 hours they will \nhave to debate that issue. So we have to be prepared after Thanksgiving \nto just be here until we are ready to leave for Christmas.\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7422-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is impossible to open a newspaper or \nwatch cable news these days without hearing my Republican colleagues \ntalk about the evils of ``job-killing regulations.'' Each day, they \narrive on the Senate floor to rail against the safeguards that keep our \nwater clean, our air fresh, and our mines safe. According to the GOP, \nthese safeguards are actually the source of all this Nation's economic \nwoes--these terrible, horrible, time-consuming government regulations \nthat hinder the economic progress of America.\n  Republicans will have you believe that these commonsense rules that \ncheck the greed of Wall Street banks, keep huge corporations honest, \nand stop Big Oil's unnecessary risk-taking are also causing small \nbusinesses great harm. Indeed, that would be a terrible thing if that \nwere true. And it isn't.\n  While it is proper to guard against and remove onerous regulations--\nand we need to do that--my Republican friends have yet to produce a \nsingle shred of evidence that the regulations they hate so much do the \nbroad economic harms they claim. That is because there isn't any.\n  Conversely, there is plenty of evidence to prove those regulations \nsave lives, prevent asthma attacks, and ensure that mom-and-pops face a \nfair fight against these multinational corporations and moneyed \ninterest groups. There is plenty of evidence to prove that disasters \nsuch as the BP oilspill and the financial crisis of 2008 could have \nbeen prevented by better, stronger government watchdog regulations.\n  But Republicans aren't relying on evidence as they propagate the myth \nof the job-killing regulations; they are relying on repetition. There \nare many people, but let's just take one--Bruce Bartlett, an adviser to \nPresident Ronald Reagan, a Treasury official under President George \nH.W. Bush, and a trusted conservative voice on economics. I had many to \nchoose from, but I chose this one to talk a little bit about today. He \noffered a number of strong words on the regulation monster under big \nbusiness's bed:\n\n       No hard evidence is offered for this claim: It is simply \n     asserted as self-evident and repeated endlessly throughout \n     the conservative echo chamber . . . In my opinion, regulatory \n     uncertainty is a canard invented by Republicans that allows \n     them to use current economic problems to pursue an agenda \n     supported by the business community year in and year out. In \n     other words, it is a simple case of political opportunism, \n     not a serious effort to deal with high unemployment.\n\n  Listen to what he said again because it is worth repeating.\n\n       No hard evidence is offered for this claim: It is simply \n     asserted as self-evident and repeated endlessly throughout \n     the conservative echo chamber . . . In my opinion, regulatory \n     uncertainty is a canard invented by Republicans that allows \n     them to use current economic problems to pursue an agenda \n     supported by the business community year in and year out. In \n     other words, it is a simple case of political opportunism, \n     not a serious effort to deal with high unemployment.\n\n  But why use regulations proven to protect the health of every mom, \ndad, man, woman, and child in this Nation as a scapegoat? What are the \norigins of this myth?\n  I believe, as Bartlett does, that Republicans are attacking \nregulation because they don't have a plan to create jobs and turn our \neconomy around--no plan. While Democrats have been pushing time-tested \nremedies for a flagging economy, such as infrastructure investments or \nmiddle-class tax cuts, Republican colleagues have been peddling a cure-\nall tonic of deregulation.\n  Bartlett says:\n\n       People are increasingly concerned about unemployment, but \n     Republicans have nothing to offer them.\n\n  They have offered up the spectre of overreaching government \nregulation to distract from the fact that they haven't offered a single \nidea for how to put America back to work. They use the argument to \njustify rolling back everything from clean air and water safeguards to \nWall Street and health insurance industry reforms. We voted on a number \nof those last week.\n  What is more, they spread the tall tale that removing these \nregulations and letting big business do exactly as it pleases will not \nonly prevent job losses but actually create new jobs. Bartlett called \nthat logical leap ``nonsense. It's just made up.''\n  So let's talk fact, not fiction. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, which asked executives why they downsized, only a tiny, \ntiny fraction of layoffs had anything to do with tighter regulation. \nLast year, only three-tenths of 1 percent of people who lost their jobs \nwere let go principally because of government regulations or government \nintervention. On the other hand, 25 percent of them were laid off \nbecause of no business, lack of business. In a recent survey by the \nSmall Business Majority, only 13 percent of small businesses cited \nregulation as their biggest concern. Half said economic uncertainty was \nthe greatest challenge they had.\n  That is why Democrats have been offering real solutions to our job \ncrisis and policies that help small firms hire, grow, and thrive again. \nThe truth is, we have enough to worry about in these tough economic \ntimes. We can't allow the myth to distract us from the real crisis of \nhigh unemployment facing this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7422-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, over the past few weeks I have \nhighlighted some of the good work Republicans in the House are doing in \nidentifying jobs legislation that Members of both parties can agree on, \nand I have suggested that the Democratic majority here in the Senate \nfollow the lead of House Republicans and take up bipartisan legislation \nthat has already passed in the House and pass it here in the Senate. \nThe American people want us to do something about jobs. They want us to \nwork together. Here is the formula. Let's apply it.\n  We made some progress last week with the Veterans bill and the 3-\npercent withholding bill, but there is a lot more we could do. The \nHouse has now passed more than 20 pieces of jobs legislation, many of \nwhich have companion bills that are ready to go here in the Senate. I \noutlined some of them last week. Why don't we take them up?\n  Let's acknowledge the fact that we live in a two-party system and \nthat if we are going to make progress, we need to do it on a bipartisan \nbasis. That means doing precisely what Republicans in the House have \nbeen doing for the past year--finding areas where the two parties can \nactually agree and passing bills that reflect those areas of agreement. \nThat is how legislation works. It is easy to push partisan legislation \nand then complain, when it doesn't go anywhere, that the other party is \nintransigent. The more difficult job and the one we were sent here to \ndo is to work together to find solutions, to accomplish more than \nfodder for campaign ads and bus tours.\n  This morning, I would like to call on our Democratic friends again to \ntake up these bipartisan House-passed bills. One of these bills, for \nexample, makes it easier for businesses to raise the capital they need \nto expand and to create jobs. Senators Tester and Toomey have companion \nlegislation right here in the Senate.\n  Another one increases the number of shareholders who are allowed to \ninvest in a community bank before that bank is required to shoulder \ncostly new burdens from the SEC.\n  Senators Hutchison and Pryor have companion legislation to this bill \nin the Senate. Senators Toomey and Carper have a bill that would expand \nit, by applying it to businesses other than banks. Let's take them both \nup and let's pass them.\n  Two other bipartisan House-passed bills give small businesses a new \navenue to raise capital and small investors a new opportunity to invest \nin them by allowing small businesses to raise money over the Internet \nand through social media without having to shoulder the same kind of \nregulatory obstacles as big businesses.\n  We all know access to capital is one of the key ingredients to \neconomic growth. Here is a way to make it easier for folks to get \ncapital that also creates new avenues for the little guy to invest--and \nto start hiring. Senators Thune and Scott Brown have companion bills in \nthe Senate. Why don't we take them up and pass them?\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\n  This is the kind of approach we should be taking in the Senate, \nputting aside these great big partisan bills that Democrats know have \nbipartisan opposition and focusing on smaller proposals that can \nactually pass. On their own, these bills will not solve the jobs \ncrisis. Frankly, no piece of legislation can, large or small--but they \nwill help, and they make it easier for businesses to start hiring.\n  They will show the American people something they do not believe we \ndo enough of around here; that is, to work together on their behalf. \nThis is how divided government works, through real cooperation and a \nsearch for common ground and solutions. This is what Republicans on the \njoint committee have been trying to do for the past several weeks. It \nis what House Republicans have been doing all year.\n  I say let's take up these bills and pass them and then send them on \ndown to the President for signature. The administration supports many \nof these House-passed bills. Democrats in the House strongly support \nmany of them and Republicans support them overwhelmingly. So let's do \nit. Let's build on the momentum we have from last week after passing \nthe 3-percent withholding and the veterans bill, and let's show the \nAmerican people we have hit upon a formula for legislative success \naround here.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7423-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to address one of the most \nimportant issues facing the supercommittee; that is: Where does Social \nSecurity fit into their plans? The Chair knows because she is very \nclose to the people of New Hampshire, she knows all over her great \nState, and mine in Maryland, people are getting ready for Thanksgiving. \nAs they get ready, they first of all give gratitude for living in the \nUnited States of America, the land of the free and the brave. But they \nare also wondering what kind of country are we living in right now \nbecause the Chair and I know they are worried about paying their bills. \nAs they get ready for their holiday dinner and the family gathering and \nall the wonderful traditions that go into this very special holiday \nthey are saying: Where are we? Have we lost our way? Are we so mired in \npartisanship we cannot seem to find a path forward?\n  They think we are the turkeys. They want us to stuff it. They want us \nto get on and start worrying about the table, worry about their kitchen \ntable, and bring everybody to the table here and begin to solve \nnational problems and to do it in a way that brings the country \ntogether. What do they want us to do? While maybe at the kitchen table \nthe children will argue over who gets the wishbone, they want us to \nhave backbone to make the tough decisions that these times call for but \nnot to be tough on one another.\n  As I think about this, I think about Social Security. We say \neverything should be on the table. I think everything should be on the \ntable that caused our deficit. I think everything should be on the \ntable that caused our debt. Social Security did not cause our deficit. \nSocial Security did not cause our debt. Do we need to take a look at \nSocial Security to ensure its safety and solvency for the rest of the \ncentury--or certainly well beyond 2050 or 2070? Absolutely. But I say \nthis: While the supercommittee is charged with looking at a more frugal \ngovernment, we must maintain the social contract. The social contract \nin the United States of America is the contract that the U.S. \nGovernment made with its people. It said, if a person went by the rules \nand they paid their dues, al la the payroll tax, there will be a \nbenefit for them. It will be a defined benefit. It is called Social \nSecurity. It will be undeniable, it will be reliable, and it will be \ninflation-proof.\n  Every President has agreed there is a social contract. Every \nPresident has taken a look at how to provide for that. Some ways we \nhave agreed with, some we have disagreed with. Where we agreed was the \ngreat, wonderful way we worked in the 1980s when Social Security was \nfacing challenges and President Reagan reached out to Tip O'Neil, Bob \nDole, Bob Byrd, Howard Baker, and we made Social Security solvent for \n30 or 40 years. We did the same under President Bill Clinton.\n  President George Bush, the No. 2 Bush, ``W,'' wanted to privatize \nSocial Security. We stopped that. We do not believe in the \nprivatization of Social Security. We did not want to turn Social \nSecurity over to Wall Street. We believed Wall Street got enough, they \ndidn't have to get Social Security. If a person were older or sick, we \ndidn't want them to rely on the bull of political promises or the bear \nof a market.\n  Social Security affects so many people. There are 50 million \nAmericans who rely on Social Security: retired workers, their spouses, \npeople with disabilities. For two-thirds of the people on Social \nSecurity, their benefit is between $14,000 and $15,000 a year. It makes \nup all or more than half their income. In my own State, 500,000 workers \nare on Social Security, so protecting the social contract is clearly in \nour national interest.\n  What brings me to the floor today? Two things. No. 1, I don't think \nSocial Security should be in the debate about how to reduce our debt or \nour deficit. I do think Social Security should be discussed in a \nrational, calm, nonpartisan way to ensure safety and solvency and \nreliability.\n  The other issue that brings me to the floor is how do we put our arms \naround the cost-of-living problem? It is indeed vexing. How do we meet \nthe needs of the people but not exacerbate the drawdown in the trust \nfund? These are valid conversations. Wise people should talk about it. \nBut one thing I am opposed to is called the chained CPI--isn't that a \nterrible word, ``chained'' CPI? In our country, the very word \n``chains'' has such a negative connotation.\n\n  What I worry about is that its Draconian effect will have a chain \nreaction on seniors that will cause a tremendous crash. I am concerned \nwe are about to shred the social contract. Let me tell you what the \nchained CPI is. It would actually cut Social Security by over $100 \nbillion over the next 10 years. It does it by changing the cost of \nliving as calculated. It is based on a theory. It is based on social \nengineering, some kind of abstract concepts about human behavior, that \ninvisible hand that Adam Smith talks about. I worry that this invisible \nhand will actually pinch Social Security. It assumes consumers will \nsubstitute lower cost items for what they normally purchase; that is, \nif the price of apples increases, they will go buy oranges. I am afraid \nwhat we are doing is we are going to buy lemons.\n  The chained CPI is inappropriate because actually seniors have a \nfixed market basket. They not only have a fixed income, but they have a \nfixed market basket. Their primary expenditure is health care, over \nwhich they have little control. The cost of health care continues to \nrise. Their next one is energy, then food, and then housing. For \nseniors, this is not like giving up opera tickets for movie tickets. It \nis not like giving up a latte for Dunkin' Donuts. For them, it is not \ngiving up Whole Foods, it is having no food. We have to get real about \nthe market basket of seniors.\n  I wish to make three points about the myths. No. 1, the chained CPI \nis not a technical fix. Despite popular notions, op-eds, editorial \nboards, it is not just a technical corrective. It would actually \nfundamentally restructure Social Security. It could very well have a \nchain reaction, pushing old people into poverty. Under the way the CPI \nis calculated, if a person is now getting $15,000 a year when they are \n65, when they are 75, they will have $5,000 less, and if they live to \n85, it will be reduced by $1,000.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n  I have this in this chart. The numbers I am giving do not come from \nBarb Mikulski. They don't come from some wonky, lefty think tank, this \ncomes from the Social Security Actuary, the keeper of the books and the \nprojections for Social Security. For a single woman on Social Security \nunder the chained CPI, from the time she is 65 until the time she is \n80, she could lose as much as $6,000. In other words, the older we get, \nthe worse it will get. Remember, under chained CPI, the older we get, \nthe less we will get; the older we get, the worse it will get.\n  Myth No. 2 is, this is not an immediate cut. Oh, it is going to go \ninto future beneficiaries. Oh, it is a long way off. Whomever it hits, \nit will hit hard. Remember the chain reaction. But it is a myth. \nAccording to the Social Security Actuary, the chained CPI will affect \neveryone, and if we pass it as part of the supercommittee, it will go \ninto effect December 2012. It will go into effect immediately, December \n2012. That is a pretty big deal.\n  The third myth is, this change would mirror people's behavior, but it \ndoesn't take into account health care costs, the cost of prescription \ndrugs, copays, and premiums. Remember, one way or the other we are \ngoing to change Medicare.\n  What I want to do at this time is sound the alert. I want to ring the \nbell. I am at my battle station. I am at my duty station. I want every \nSenator, when they vote on this, to have informed consent. I want \npeople to read about it and know about it and make up their own minds. \nI oppose the chained CPI. I oppose Social Security being in the \nsupercommittee. I am not drawing a line in the sand today. I want to \nsay for the supercommittee, God bless them in their work, they are \ntruly pursuing this in a duly diligent way, and we hope we can come to \na great resolution where we can reduce our debt, reduce our deficit, \nand do it in a way that is a balanced approach but does not balance all \nthis on the backs of senior citizens.\n  FDR signed this bill 75 years ago. Every President, regardless of \nparty, said we will keep the social contract, pay your dues through \nthis payroll tax, Social Security is going to be there for you. We want \nSocial Security to be there for the seniors, and we need to be there \nfor the Social Security Program.\n\n  I hope my colleagues put due diligence into understanding this \npolicy.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Madam President, our country is at a crossroads. Anybody \nwho is watching Europe will find that they have been very slow to \naddress the real underlying problems of debt and deficits there. They \nhave a much more difficult time than what we should because they have a \nmonetary union without a political union. We have a monetary and \npolitical union.\n  The fact is that over the next 10 years we are going to have a debt--\nincluding borrowing money for student loans, borrowing money to pay \nback Social Security, what has been stolen--we are going to have a true \ndebt of about $27 trillion to $28 trillion. It is absolutely \nunsustainable. It won't happen--according to Ben Bernanke--because his \nstatement is, the world will not loan us the money.\n  What is going on in Europe today? What is going on in Europe today is \nthe markets are punishing the countries that have excessive debt-to-GDP \nratios. We sit at 100 percent debt to GDP. We see what has happened \njust in the last 2 weeks to bond rates for Italy. The differential \nbetween an Italian bond rate and a German bond rate is now about 430 \nbasis points, a 4.3 differential for the same length maturity bond for \nItaly versus Germany. What is the difference? Germany is living within \nthe confines of its economic capability. Italy didn't. How does that \napply to us? It applies to us in that we are not and what will happen \nto us if we don't make the difficult changes that are necessary.\n\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric on both sides of the aisle and there \nhas been rhetoric from the President in terms of us looking at who pays \nwhat in terms of taxes in this country. But nobody is looking at what \nwe are doing with our Tax Code that enables those who are the wealthy \nin this country to pay less taxes. So I had my staff put together a \nlist of the subsidies for the wealthy in this country, because the \nanswer isn't just to raise taxes; part of the answer is to quit \nsubsidizing these behaviors.\n  We came up with a piece that we put out called ``Subsidies for the \nRich and Famous.'' It is a report that looked at every government \nprogram. We looked at everything we do. What we found is every year, \nfor people having adjusted gross incomes above $1 million, we give $28 \nbillion worth of benefits in the Tax Code or through our programs. I \nwill tell my colleagues that if we wanted--I am one of those who thinks \nwe ought to reform our Tax Code, we ought to lower the rates, we ought \nto make it where it actually increases productivity in this country, \ncreates capital investment. But one of the first steps in doing that is \nto make sure our Tax Code and our safety net programs are for those who \ntruly need it and not for those who don't.\n  We went through the total tax breaks of $113.7 billion over the last \n4 years. Mortgage interest: $27.7 billion in tax breaks to people who \nare making more than $1 million a year. That is a lot of dough.\n  Rental expenses. The writeoff of rental expenses for those making \nmore--we are not talking businesses. None of these are business \ndeductions. These are personal deductions for the very wealthy in this \ncountry who are making more than $1 million adjusted gross income a \nyear. We allow them to write off $64.3 billion in rental expenses.\n  Gambling losses. We allowed the rich and famous to reduce their taxes \nby $21 billion because we allow them to gamble, and if they lose money, \nthey get to write it off. So we are subsidizing the loss. We are \nsubsidizing their gambling losses.\n  Canceled debt, debt writeoffs, debt forgiveness. We have allowed $128 \nbillion in terms of writeoffs for those people making more than $1 \nmillion adjusted gross income.\n  Business entertainment--and this is not through business, though, not \nrun through a business; this is personal deductions for business \nentertainment--$607 billion.\n  Electric vehicle. What are we seeing? Who are the people taking \nadvantage of our messing in the economy and creating an incentive for \nsomebody to buy an electric vehicle? The vast majority are the people \nwho don't need the writeoff in the first place. What we have is $12.5 \nmillion last year alone in tax credits for the very wealthy to take a \n$7,500 or $8,500 tax credit for buying an electric car.\n  Childcare, nanny care for the very wealthy last year: $18 million.\n  Renewable energy tax credits for the very wealthy: $75.6 million.\n  The whole point of putting this report out is we are schizophrenic \nwith our Tax Code. We have it upside down. When people talk about how \nthey want millionaires to pay more--they are paying plenty. The top 1 \npercent pays 38 percent, the top 20 percent pays 80 percent of all of \nthe taxes in this country. But if we want to start getting at this, the \nway we do it is start taking away the things that reduce their tax \nburden that don't make sense, that aren't smart, and that don't help \nthose who need the true safety net in our country. These people aren't \ndependent on these. They will do fine without them. The whole purpose \nfor most of these programs was to create and sustain a safety net for \nthose who are less fortunate.\n  When we allow $113.7 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy over 4 \nyears, what could we do with that money? Well, we could run a NASA that \nis twice as big. We could not borrow $113 billion because the interest \nrates on that are significant; another $4 billion or $5 billion a year \nin interest that we\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\nwouldn't have to borrow. We wouldn't have to make some defense cuts \nthat are going to have to come. We could maybe put more money into \nMedicare prevention and disease prevention rather than what we have \ndone. There are all sorts of things we could do.\n  The point behind the report is that most Americans don't realize how \nwe are subsidizing through tax credits the very wealthy in this \ncountry. I don't have any real problem with them taking the tax \ncredits. We put it out there. The real question we ought to be asking \nis why are we doing all of this in the first place. Does the economy \nitself in a free market not allocate resources better than we can do? \nHow many Chevy Volts have been sold this year? The answer is 5,000. So \n5,000 times $7,500 is what we paid in tax credits to have the Chevy \nVolt sold because everybody who bought it got a $7,500 tax credit. If \nit is a viable product, then let people buy it. If it is not, they \nwon't. Yet who are the people who bought most of the Chevy Volts? \nPeople making significantly more than the average American.\n  If we are going to play in the Tax Code, what we ought to do is play \non a very level playing field. If we want to create incentives, then we \nought to create incentives that actually will do something for the \neconomy rather than benefit those who make the most money in the \neconomy.\n  I would say what this spells is a case for us to totally reform our \nTax Code. Most people don't realize this is one of the side effects. \nThat is not to say there are not some good side effects. But the fact \nis when we are running $1.3 trillion deficits, do we want to be \nsubsidizing the rich and famous in this country with our programs? I \nwould say no.\n  When Medicare Part B started, 50 percent of the cost of Medicare Part \nB was to be borne by the Medicare recipient. We are at 25 percent now. \nThere was never any thought--and, remember, nobody ever paid anything \nfor that. In other words, that is all borrowed money to do that. Nobody \never contributed into a Part B fund. They contributed into a Part A \nfund which, by the way, will be bankrupt in 4\\1/2\\ years. What about \nthose on Part D? Nobody ever paid a penny, and we have $13 trillion in \nunfunded liability in Part D. Why should the very wealthy get \nsubsidized drugs in this country? Why should they get subsidized Part \nD? In other words, we ought to ask ourselves a question.\n\n  Think about Social Security. Why is Canada's Social Security system \nnot in trouble? Because Canada looks at how much income a person is \nmaking every year, and at certain levels a person gets half of their \nSocial Security because they obviously don't need it because their \nincome is up there, and at a certain other level they get none of it. \nWhy? Because it is based on a means-testing mechanism that says this \nprogram is designed to be an underpinning for those who need it. We \nhave gone completely the other way.\n  My point is we have all this discussion about what we should do. We \nare wringing our hands. The first thing to do is to fix the Tax Code \nand the best way to fix it is to say 3 months from now it is going \naway, and have Finance and Ways and Means Committee in the House come \ntogether with a new Tax Code that fixes all of this. Everybody in \nWashington says that can't be done. Nobody outside of Washington says \nit can't be done, but we say it can't be done. It can be done. It needs \nto be done.\n  If we want a healthy future, we need to reform our Tax Code to \ngenerate greater investment, greater job opportunity. We need to lower \nthe rates, and we need to eliminate things such as these that don't \ntruly help the economy, but help those who were smart enough to figure \nout how to play the game, who are the wealthiest in this country. I am \nproud of them. I want them to be more successful. But in these \ndifficult times, we need to ask them to contribute more. We need to not \nhave these kinds of programs in our Tax Code that actually subsidize \nthose who need no subsidy.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour for debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I am glad the Senate will confirm two \nmore highly experienced Federal judges this morning. I wish to take a \nmoment to speak in support of the nomination of one of Alaska's finest \nState judges to the Federal bench.\n  Today, the Senate will vote to confirm the nomination of Judge Sharon \nGleason to be a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of \nAlaska. I know Sharon quite well, and I recommended her to the \nPresident for this opening.\n  I can say without hesitation that she is one of Alaska's finest. She \nis smart, she is compassionate, well rounded, and possesses an ample \nsupply of common sense.\n  Alaska's judicial candidates are rated by their peers, and Judge \nGleason consistently receives among the highest marks possible. For \nthese reasons, and many others, I hope all my Senate colleagues will \njoin me in supporting her nomination.\n  Her confirmation will make Judge Gleason the first female judge \nappointed to the Federal bench in Alaska history. That is truly \nmomentous for our State and long overdue.\n  I know many Alaskans back home--and 4 hours earlier--are watching \nthese floor proceedings today because of the significance of this \nappointment.\n  Sharon was appointed to the Anchorage Superior Court in 2001 by Gov. \nTony Knowles, who was my boss when he served as mayor of Anchorage. On \nthe Superior Court, Judge Gleason has presided over a large variety of \ncases, including complex civil litigation, divorce and custody \nproceedings, child-in-need-of-aid proceedings, and criminal cases.\n  Judge Gleason now serves as the presiding judge of the Third Judicial \nDistrict in Alaska. That position is responsible for overseeing 70 \npercent of the caseload of the entire State trial courts and includes \n40 judges and 20 magistrates.\n  Her record as a judge has been excellent. She is widely praised for \nher judicial temperament, her fairness on the bench, and especially her \npioneering work on behalf of families and children. For that work, she \nwas awarded the prestigious Light of Hope award in Alaska.\n  Sharon is an active member of her community, serving on numerous \nlegal committees. She also is a heck of a clarinet player, and she has \nbeen playing in the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra for more than 25 \nyears.\n  Judge Gleason received the unanimous bipartisan support of every \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The American Bar Association \nhas rated her ``unanimously well qualified,'' their highest possible \nrating for a Federal judge.\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\n  If confirmed, Judge Gleason will follow a long line of excellent \nFederal judges in Alaska. She will replace retiring Judge Jack Sedwick, \nwho has served our State with distinction for nearly a decade on the \nFederal bench.\n  Judge Sharon Gleason is one of my State's finest legal minds, and I \nam confident she will continue to fairly and effectively serve Alaskans \nfrom the Federal bench.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support her nomination to the U.S. \nDistrict Court.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, this is a big day for us in Alaska \nand in Alaska's legal history. The Senate is today considering the \nnomination of Sharon Gleason. Sharon is the first woman to be nominated \nfor United States district court judge in Alaska. She is an outstanding \nnominee and I regard it as a privilege to speak in support of her \nnomination today.\n  Sharon Gleason is a native of Rochester, NY. She earned her \nbachelor's degree from Washington University in St. Louis. She received \nher law degree from the University of California-Davis. Upon graduation \nfrom Davis, Sharon was elected to the Order of the Coif, which is the \nnational legal honor society. Following her graduation, she clerked for \nEdmond Burke, who was the chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court.\n  This was the beginning of an exceptional legal career in the State of \nAlaska for Sharon Gleason. After 17 years in private practice, Sharon \nwas selected to serve on the Alaska Superior Court for the Third \nJudicial District in Anchorage. She came to the bench in 2001. In 2009, \nSharon was elevated to the role of presiding judge for the Third \nJudicial District. This is the judicial district that is the busiest of \nour four judicial districts in the State of Alaska.\n  I think it is important to take a moment here to explain how the \nprocess works in the State of Alaska for appointment as a judge. Sharon \nwas selected, again, to serve on the Superior Court. All applicants for \nState judicial positions are vetted by the Alaska Judicial Council. \nThere is a commission that is composed of attorneys and of public \nmembers, and the top candidates are recommended to the Governor for \nconsideration and ultimate appointment. That merit process was created \nby the Alaska constitution, and it was intended to keep the politics \nout of the judicial selection process, and it is a process that many of \nus in the State of Alaska are quite proud of. We think it is a very \neffective process and works well. Every candidate is formally evaluated \non issues such as integrity, professional competence, fairness, \njudicial temperament, and suitability of experience.\n  As a member of the Alaska bar, I get the bar survey polls to evaluate \nthe individuals as their names go forward, and you look through the \ncategories to rate each candidate. I think if you were to ask any \nAlaska attorney about the rigor of this process, you would get the same \nanswer, that it is a very effective process. The grading is tough, and \nthose who are not up to the challenge do not slip through any cracks. \nThe Governor may only appoint a candidate who has been recommended by \nthe Alaska Judicial Council.\n  Once selected, a Superior Court judge must stand for periodic \nretention elections. The Alaska Judicial Council reevaluates each judge \nstanding for retention and then makes a recommendation to the voting \npublic on whether that judge should be retained. Once again, the \nprocess is quite rigorous. The judicial council surveys attorneys, \njurors, law enforcement, court employees, social workers, guardians ad \nlitem, and court-appointed special advocates. The scores then are made \npublic. So it is a very open process. It involves many, many within the \nAlaska legal community and is quite transparent.\n  Sharon Gleason last stood for retention in 2010, and she scored high \non measures of legal ability, impartiality, integrity, temperament, and \ndiligence. In her 2010 retention questionnaire, Judge Gleason stated \nthis about her job:\n\n       The workload is particularly demanding . . ., involving \n     many long days and weekends. But I continue to love going to \n     work just about every day . . . I strive to be the best \n     judicial officer that I can be in every case that comes \n     before me.\n\n  Those were the words of Judge Gleason. I think that is an excellent \noutlook for a member of our judiciary, and Alaskans clearly agreed. The \nAlaska Judicial Council recommended her retention and she was retained \nwith nearly 61 percent of the vote.\n  As a product of the Alaska court system, Sharon Gleason has \nfunctioned with great distinction in a merit-based, nonpartisan, and \nnonpolitical environment. In advance of the vote we will hold here in \nthe Senate in about a half hour, I took the opportunity to survey some \njudges who either worked with Sharon in Alaska or who have had the \nopportunity to work with her. One of them reported that Judge Gleason \nhas presided over complex technical cases that lasted several weeks and \nrequired her to pour over thousands of pages of exhibits and \ntranscripts. She has also presided over child custody cases, making \nsure that she understands the needs of each child and how to assist or \nrequire the parents to raise their children appropriately. She is at \nwork late each night and at least one full weekend day every week. She \ninsists upon litigants being respectful of one another in litigation \nand during the hearings. She spends many hours evaluating herself to \nensure that she is not only meeting her own standards about being fair \nto all sides but also behaves in a manner that leaves the parties to \nknow she is being fair. She takes great pains to articulate to parties \nhow she will run a hearing and why she is ruling as she does. She has \ntremendous control of her own demeanor so that she maintains control of \nproceedings. As a result, parties almost universally leave a hearing or \na case feeling she has understood them and thought carefully about her \ndecision. She acts with an appreciation that for the litigants involved \nthe case before her is the most important thing in their lives at the \ntime. She is, and I believe will continue to be, a superb judge.\n  Another judge said: Sharon's skills as a capable trial court judge \nand an excellent presiding judge are well known to Alaskans. She will \nbe missed by her colleagues in the State court but she will make a \nfantastic addition to the Federal district court.\n  The American Bar Association has evaluated Judge Gleason as being \n``well qualified'' for elevation to the U.S. district court. I think \nshe will make an exemplary U.S. district court judge. I am proud to \nsupport this nomination, and I would encourage my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm two more \nof President Obama's judicial nominees. If my colleagues feel like they \nhave been spending a lot of time on the Senate floor voting on judicial \nnominees, I would tell them they have. In just a little over a month, \nwe have confirmed 20 article III judicial nominees for lifetime \nappointments. In total, the Senate has confirmed 71 percent of the \nPresident's judicial nominees since he took office.\n  I would like to say a few words about the nominees.\n  First, Sharon Gleason is nominated to be United States District Judge \nfor the District of Alaska. Judge Gleason received her bachelor of arts \nfrom Washington University in St. Louis in 1979 and her juris doctorate \nfrom the University of California, Davis, School of Law in 1983. She \nthen served as a law clerk for Chief Justice Edmond Burke of the Alaska \nSupreme Court.\n  After her clerkship, Judge Gleason became an associate at the law \nfirm Reese, Rice, and Volland in Anchorage, AK, where she worked on a \nvariety of civil litigation. Judge Gleason became a partner in 1989 and \nremained at the firm until 1995 when she became a sole practitioner.\n  In 2001, Judge Gleason was appointed to the Anchorage Superior Court \nby then-Governor Tony Knowles. She was retained by voters in 2004 and \nagain in 2010.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\nJudiciary has rated Judge Gleason with a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \nrating.\n  We will also be voting on Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. She is nominated to \nbe United States District Judge for the Northern District of \nCalifornia.\n  Judge Gonzalez Rogers earned her bachelor's degree from Princeton \nUniversity in 1987 and her juris doctorate from the University of \nTexas, Austin School of Law in 1991.\n  She began her legal career with Cooley LLP and served as a member of \nthe General Business Litigation practice and the Real Estate Litigation \npractice. She focused on large and complex civil litigation matters, \nincluding real estate and technology-related litigation.\n  In addition to her legal practice, Judge Gonzalez Rogers also chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee for the northern California Hispanic National \nBar Association and the San Francisco La Raza Lawyers Association. In \nthese roles, she investigated candidates for the judiciary and \nrecommended endorsement where appropriate.\n  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed Judge Gonzalez Rogers as a \nsuperior court judge for the State of California on July 25, 2008. She \nwas reelected without opposition in 2010.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Judge Gonzalez Rogers with a unanimous \n``Qualified'' rating.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we are \nconsidering the historic nomination of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to \nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia.\n  When she is confirmed, she will be the first Latina district judge in \nthe Northern District of California.\n  Judge Gonzalez Rogers first came to my attention through a bipartisan \nJudicial Advisory Committee that I have set up in California. This \ncommittee recommended her to me, and I interviewed her personally.\n  Judge Gonzalez Rogers is a tested judge with a proven track record of \nsuccess and dedication to the northern California community. It was my \nprivilege to recommend her nomination to President Obama.\n  She lives in Piedmont, CA. She and her husband have three children--\nChristopher, Maria, and Joshua.\n  Judge Gonzalez Rogers was born in Houston, TX. Her parents were each \nthe oldest of nine siblings and grew up in south Texas. Spanish was \ntheir first language.\n  Her father served in the U.S. Army and went to college with \nassistance from the G.I. Bill.\n  Out of a large extended family, she was one of only three family \nmembers to attend college.\n  She earned her undergraduate degree from Princeton University, where \nshe excelled, graduating cum laude in 1987.\n  During school breaks and weekends, she spent her time cleaning houses \nand cutting grass to help pay her tuition.\n  She attended law school at the University of California at Berkeley, \nultimately earning her law degree from the University of Texas at \nAustin.\n  She began the practice of law at the prestigious San Francisco firm \nCooley LLP. At that time, no Latina woman had been elected into the \npartnership of any major San Francisco law firm.\n  In her own words, Judge Gonzalez Rogers ``worked hard to break that \nmold by becoming an excellent attorney worthy of invitation to the \npartnership.'' She was elevated to Cooley's partnership in 1998.\n  In her application to my committee, she described her story as the \n``American dream,'' and she said that she ``would be honored to spend \nthe remainder of [her] professional career serving the country that has \ngiven [her] so much.''\n  She currently serves as an Alameda County superior court judge. Judge \nGonzalez Rogers is an impressive jurist--smart, personable, and with \nmainstream views of the law--who I believe would serve very well as a \nFederal district judge.\n  On the Superior Court, she has presided over both a criminal and \ncivil calendar. She currently oversees a docket of more than 500 civil \ncases.\n  She has also been active in the community. She was appointed by the \npresiding judge to serve as foreperson of the Alameda County Civil \nGrand Jury--an active investigative body that examines complaints about \nthe administration of county government.\n  She served as cochair of Citizens for Piedmont Schools, leading a \ncampaign to pass ballot measures for the benefit of the local school \nsystems. Each measure passed with over 80 percent of the vote.\n  Her dedication to her community is admirable, as is her dedication to \nthe law.\n  As she said in her own words, ``I have a deep respect for judicial \nleadership, for judges who manage the process and their courtrooms \nwell, apply the law fairly, and explain their reasoning clearly. \nReasonable people can disagree. We need judges who will listen and then \ndecide. I hope to have a long judicial career to live up to this \nstandard.''\n  I have no doubt she will live up to that standard, and I strongly \nbelieve she will be an outstanding Federal judge.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported her nomination by voice vote in \nSeptember, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm her nomination \ntoday.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nCalifornia Superior Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers as the Senate \nprepares to vote on her confirmation to the U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of California. Judge Gonzalez Rogers was recommended \nto the President by my colleague, Senator Feinstein, and will be a \ngreat addition to the Federal bench.\n  Judge Gonzalez Rogers has been a skilled lawyer and judge during her \ncareer. After graduating from the University of Texas School of Law, \nshe practiced complex civil litigation at Cooley Godward in San \nFrancisco, becoming a partner at the firm in 1999. In 2008, she was \nappointed by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to the Alameda County \nSuperior Court, where she currently serves. She has also served as \nregional president for the Hispanic National Bar Association.\n  I congratulate Judge Gonzalez Rogers and her family on this important \nday and urge my colleagues in the Senate to join in voting to confirm \nthis highly qualified nominee to the Federal bench.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate is going to finally \nconsider two of President Obama's highly qualified nominees to fill \nFederal district court vacancies in Alaska and the Northern District of \nCalifornia. They were unanimously voted out by the Judiciary Committee \n2 months ago. I am sorry it has taken so long because of objections on \nthe other side, but I am glad they now will be considered.\n  Both Sharon Gleason and Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers have the strong \nsupport of their home State Senators and both were reported by the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously over 2 months ago. I thank the majority \nleader for securing votes on their nominations. I am disappointed that \nthe Senate Republican leadership would not agree to a vote on the other \n23 judicial nominees waiting for final Senate action. These delays are \ninexcusable and damaging.\n  All 25 nominees on the Senate calendar are qualified and have the \nsupport of their home State Senators, Republican and Democratic. \nTwenty-one of these judicial nominations were unanimously approved by \nthe Judiciary Committee. Senate Democrats are prepared to have votes on \nall these important nominations. I know of no good reason why the \nRepublican leadership is refusing to proceed on the 23 other judicial \nnominations that they have stalled before the Senate.\n  The Senate Republican leadership has, again, insisted that the Senate \nskip over two circuit court nominees who would fill judicial emergency \nvacancies on the Second and Ninth Circuit. They, too, were reported \nunanimously and have the support of their home State Senators. There is \nno good\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\nreason that the Senate is being prevented from confirming the \nnominations of Judge Chris Droney of Connecticut to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Second Circuit and Morgan Christen of Alaska \nto fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked together to ensure that each of \nthese 25 nominations was fully considered by the Judiciary Committee \nafter a thorough, fair process, including completing our extensive \nquestionnaire and questioning at a hearing. This White House has worked \nwith the home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats, and each of \nthe judicial nominees being delayed from a Senate vote is supported by \nboth home State Senators. The FBI has conducted a thorough background \nreview of each nominee. The American Bar Association's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary has conducted a peer review of their \nprofessional qualifications. When the nominations are then reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee, there is no reason for months \nand months of further delay before they can start serving the American \npeople.\n  With the vacancy rate on Federal courts throughout the country near \n10 percent, the delay in taking up and confirming these consensus \njudicial nominees is damaging. Last week, The Wall Street Journal \nreported on the impact of these vacancies at a time when the criminal \ndocket on Federal district courts is growing. The article states:\n\n       Exacerbating the problem are vacancies on the Federal \n     bench. Despite the surge in case loads, the number of \n     authorized federal judgeships has risen just 4% since 1990. \n     Of the 677 district court judgeships currently authorized, \n     about 9.5% are vacant. (``Criminal Case Glut Impedes Civil \n     Suits'')\n\n  As a result, according to Judge McCuskey of the Central District of \nIllinois, ``civil litigation has ground to a halt.'' These delays \naffect both individuals and businesses. The article highlights that \nover 2,000 citizens of Merced, California who filed suit in 2007 over \ntoxic chemical contamination stemming from a 2006 flood are still \nawaiting resolution, and only one civil trial has been held in the \nmatter. In the article, Senior Judge W. Royal Furgeson of the Northern \nDistrict of Texas is quoted warning that if decisions on contracts, \nmergers and intellectual-property rights ``can't be reached through \nquick and prompt justice, things unravel for business.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of this article at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. A report published last month by the Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts demonstrates the extent of these delays in Federal \ncourt. Across the country, there are over 15,000 civil cases that have \nbeen pending for more than three years without resolution. The \nAdministrative Office's data show that many of the circuits with the \nhighest number of vacant district judgeships also have the highest \nbacklog of pending cases. The Ninth Circuit has over 1,700 civil cases \nthat have been pending for more than three years. There are currently \n14 district judgeships vacant in that circuit, including five vacancies \nthat the Administrative Office has classified as judicial emergency \nvacancies. The Fifth Circuit has over 1,300 civil cases that have been \npending for more than three years. There are eight district judgeships \nvacant in that circuit, six of which are emergency vacancies.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. While 3 years may be necessary for some of the most \ncomplex business disputes, it is unacceptable for hardworking Americans \nwho are seeking their day in court. When an injured plaintiff sues to \nhelp cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, that plaintiff \nshould not have to wait for 3 years before a judge rules on his or her \ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  With almost one in 10 Federal judgeships currently vacant, the Senate \nmust come together to address the serious judicial vacancies crisis on \nFederal courts around the country. Bill Robinson, the president of the \nAmerican Bar Association, warned recently in a letter to Senate leaders \nthat excessive vacancies and high caseloads, ``deprive . . . our \nfederal courts of the capacity to deliver timely justice in civil \nmatters and has real consequences for the financial well-being of \nbusinesses and for individual litigants whose lives are put on hold \npending resolution of their disputes.'' Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy \nand Chief Justice Roberts have also warned of the serious problems \ncreated by persistent judicial vacancies. This is not a partisan issue, \nbut an issue affecting hardworking Americans who are denied justice \nwhen their cases are delayed by overburdened courts.\n  During President Bush's first 4 years, the Senate confirmed a total \nof 205 Federal circuit and district court judges. As of today, we would \nneed another 89 confirmations over the next 12 months to match that \ntotal. That means a faster confirmation rate for the next 12 months \nthan in any 12 months of the Obama administration to date. That would \nrequire Senate Republicans to abandon their delaying tactics. I hope \nthey will. This is an area where the Senate must come together to \naddress the serious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around \nthe country that has persisted for well over 2 years. We can and must \ndo better for the millions of Americans being made to suffer by these \nunnecessary Senate delays.\n  More than half of all Americans--almost 164 million--live in \ndistricts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled \ntoday if Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations now \npending on the Senate calendar. As many as 25 states are served by \nFederal courts with vacancies that would be filled by these \nnominations. Millions of Americans across the country are harmed by \ndelays in overburdened courts. The Republican leadership should explain \nwhy they will not consent to vote on the qualified, consensus \ncandidates nominated to fill these extended judicial vacancies.\n  I have heard some Senators excuse the delays and the extraordinary \nnumbers of nominations left pending on the Senate calendar by claiming \nthat our progress on nominations this year has been among the best in \nhistory. This is not true on its face, and ignores the Senate's failure \nto confirm judges in the first 2 years of the Obama administration, a \npractice which has led to historically high vacancies. The 56 circuit \nand district court nominations we have confirmed thus far this year is \nwell behind the 68 we confirmed in the third year of President George \nW. Bush's first term. What makes the claim of progress even more \nmisleading is that of the 56 nominations we confirmed this year, 17 \ncould have and should have been confirmed when they were reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee last year and instead took us until June of \nthis year to consider. Even including these nominees on this year's \ntotal, the Senate's progress this year barely cracks the top 10 years \nfor confirmed nominees in the last 35 years.\n  The truth is that the actions of the Senate Republican leadership in \nstalling judicial nominations during President Obama's first 2 years \nled to confirmation of few judges, leading to high vacancies. \nRepublican leadership allowed the Senate to confirm only 47 circuit and \ndistrict court nominations last year and set the modern record for \nfewest nominations confirmed with only 13 the year before--a total of \n60 nominees confirmed in President Obama's first 2 years in office--\nleading to judicial vacancies that stood at 97 at the start of this \nyear. In stark contrast, at the start of President Bush's third year, \n2003, judicial vacancies stood at only 60 because the Senate had \nconfirmed 72 of his circuit and district court nominations the year \nbefore and 28 in his first year in office, a total of 100 in the 17 \nmonths prior to 2003 with a Democratic majority.\n  The 100 circuit and district court nominations we confirmed in \nPresident Bush's first 2 years leading to a vacancy total of 60 at the \nbeginning of his third year is almost a complete reverse of the 60 we \nconfirmed in President Obama's first 2 years, leading to nearly 100 \nvacancies at the start of 2011. Yet, even following those years of real\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\nprogress, in 2003 we proceeded to confirm more judicial nominations--\n68--than there were vacancies at the start of that year and reduced \nvacancies even further. We worked to reduce vacancies on the circuit \ncourts to single digits and throughout the Federal judiciary to fewer \nthan 30.\n  The two nominees we consider today should have been confirmed 2 \nmonths ago. Sharon Gleason is nominated to fill a vacancy in the \nDistrict Court for the District of Alaska. She is currently the \nPresiding Judge on the Superior Court for Alaska's Third Judicial \nDistrict, where she has served for nearly a decade. Judge Gleason spent \n17 years in private practice and clerked for Chief Justice Edmond Burke \nof the Alaska Supreme Court. The ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary unanimously rated her ``well qualified'' to serve, \nits highest rating. Her home State Senators, Senator Murkowski, a \nRepublican, and Senator Begich, a Democrat, gave Judge Gleason their \nstrong support when they introduced her to the Committee at a hearing \nin July. If confirmed, Judge Gleason will be the first woman to serve \nas a Federal district court judge in Alaska.\n  Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is nominated to serve as a United States \nDistrict Judge for the Northern District of California. Since 2008, she \nhas served as a judge for the Superior Court of California in Alameda \nCounty. Judge Gonzalez Rogers previously worked for 12 years as a \nlitigator in private practice in the San Francisco office of Cooley \nLLP, and served for 2 years as a civil grand juror for Alameda County. \nOriginally appointed to the Superior Court by Republican Governor \nArnold Schwarzenegger in October 2008, Judge Gonzalez Rogers has the \nstrong support of both of her home State Democratic Senators, Senators \nFeinstein and Boxer.\n  I hope that the Senate can build on our progress today by considering \nthe other 23 judicial nominations pending on the Senate calendar. With \nless than 5 weeks left before Senate adjournment for the year, the \nSenate needs to consider at least 5 judges every week in order to begin \nto catch up and erase the backlog that has developed from the delays in \nthe consideration of consensus nominees caused by the Senate Republican \nleadership. We should not end another year with the Senate Republican \nleadership refusing to give final consideration to qualified judicial \nnominees and insisting on their nominations being returned to the \nPresident to begin the process all over again. Such delaying tactics \nare a disservice to the American people. The Senate should fulfill its \nconstitutional duty and ensure the ability of our Federal courts to \nprovide justice to Americans around the country.\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 10, 2011]\n\n                 Criminal Case Glut Impedes Civil Suits\n\n                (By Gary Fields and John R. Emshwiller)\n\n       An explosion of criminal prosecutions in the nation's \n     overextended federal courts has left civil litigants from \n     bereaved spouses to corporate giants waiting years for their \n     day in court.\n       The logjam, prompted particularly by criminal cases related \n     to drugs and immigration, as well as by the proliferation of \n     more-obscure federal criminal laws, threatens the functioning \n     of the nation's judicial system, say some judges and \n     attorneys.\n       ``We need the resources to do both'' civil and criminal \n     law, says W. Royal Furgeson, a senior federal judge in \n     Dallas. If decisions on contracts, mergers and intellectual-\n     property rights ``can't be reached through quick and prompt \n     justice, things unravel for business.''\n       In the Northern District of California, a widely watched \n     intellectual-property fight between Google Inc. and Oracle \n     Corp. has stalled to an indefinite halt. The two-year-old \n     case, in which Oracle alleges that Google's Android \n     smartphone software infringes its copyrights and patents, was \n     scheduled to go to trial last month. Judge William Alsup \n     postponed it ``due to a lengthy criminal trial.'' In a \n     written order, he said the trial would occur ``in due \n     course.''\n       Oracle and Google declined to comment. Judge Alsup's clerk \n     said he was too busy to comment.\n       Over the past three decades, the U.S. has steadily added to \n     the federal rule book through new criminal statutes and \n     regulations that carry criminal penalties. Combined with \n     beefed-up enforcement, that has led to a 70% jump in the \n     number of pending federal criminal cases in the past decade--\n     to over 76,000, according to the Administrative Office of \n     U.S. Courts.\n       Civil litigation, which accounts for over three quarters of \n     federal court cases, is getting squeezed the most. In 2007, \n     fewer than 7% of civil cases were more than three years old. \n     By last year, that percentage more than doubled, with nearly \n     45,000 cases in a holding pattern.\n       While some of the case overload stems from mass litigation, \n     such as damage claims from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, much of \n     it traces back to the crowded criminal docket, say judges and \n     other legal experts. The Constitution and the Speedy Trial \n     Act of 1974 mandate criminal cases take precedence over civil \n     cases.\n       Exacerbating the problem are vacancies on the federal \n     bench. Despite the surge in case loads, the number of \n     authorized federal judgeships has risen just 4% since 1990. \n     Of the 677 district court judgeships currently authorized, \n     about 9.5% are vacant.\n       Instead of waiting, many civil litigants are settling their \n     disputes. That can be appropriate in many cases, but there is \n     ``no shortage of plaintiffs who wind up taking inadequate \n     settlements'' or businesses that make unnecessary payments to \n     end the expense and uncertainty of litigation, says Ian \n     Millhiser, a policy analyst at the Center for American \n     Progress, a liberal think tank.\n       Elizabeth and Nicholas Powers were awaiting jury selection \n     in their employment-discrimination suit against the \n     University of Illinois when the federal judge assigned to the \n     case earlier this year called a sudden halt to instead tackle \n     a mounting series of criminal cases.\n       Their 2008 lawsuit, which named the Board of Trustees of \n     the University of Illinois as defendant, alleged Ms. Powers \n     received lower pay for her work than male employees. It also \n     alleged Mr. Powers, who also worked for the university, was \n     treated differently than the wives of male professors who \n     worked at the school.\n       After the delay, the couple decided to settle for $85,000 \n     rather than wait for a new trial. An attorney for the \n     University of Illinois declined comment on the settlement.\n       The judge in the case, Mike McCuskey, who is also the chief \n     federal jurist for the central district of Illinois, said in \n     an interview he has no choice but to push back civil cases \n     because of his criminal caseload. In 1997, federal court \n     statistics show, Judge McCuskey's district had 55 civil cases \n     that were pending more than three years. Last year, it had \n     1,200.\n       ``Civil litigation has ground to a halt,'' Judge McCuskey \n     said, adding that ``you've got a right to sue but you do not \n     get a right to a speedy jury trial.''\n       The Illinois jurist blames the glut of criminal cases on a \n     shift in jurisdiction. Many cases that once would have been \n     handled by state courts, including those dealing with drugs, \n     weapons and child pornography, are now being filed federally. \n     Congress has passed statutes that duplicate existing state \n     laws but often carry heavier sentences, an added attraction \n     to law-enforcement officials.\n       One of the nation's heaviest loads can be found in the \n     federal courts of the eastern district of California, which \n     covers an inland swath from north of Los Angeles to the \n     Oregon border. Its per-judge caseload is 1,129 and getting \n     worse with the September retirement of Judge Oliver Wanger. \n     Because he won't be replaced, his cases will be divided among \n     those who remain.\n       One of Judge Wanger's cases was a lawsuit involving \n     hundreds of people from a neighborhood in Merced, Calif., \n     stemming from a 2006 flood and subsequent concern about toxic \n     chemical contamination from a nearby industrial site.\n       In 2007, current and former residents filed suit in federal \n     court against municipal entities and the former owners of the \n     industrial site seeking damages.\n       Judge Wanger divided the case into smaller trials, which \n     would allow him to intersperse those hearings with other \n     ongoing cases. But only one of those civil trials has been \n     held so far.\n       Mick Marderosian, the plaintiffs' attorney, said many of \n     his 2,000 clients are waiting for a resolution of the case, \n     now heading towards its fifth year. ``We get calls every day \n     from clients asking what is happening, what is causing the \n     delay,'' he said.\n       Kathy Ramos said she and her husband, a truck driver, spent \n     $35,000 repairing their home after the flood. Her husband \n     dropped plans to buy his own rig and the couple is still \n     paying credit-card debts from the home-repair work. As for \n     the lawsuit, ``we would just like to have it over with,'' she \n     said.\n       To get around the eastern district's problems, the suit has \n     been transferred to a federal judge in Santa Ana, Calif.\n       For two and a half years, Amy Bullock has been waiting for \n     her day in court seeking damages for the death of her husband \n     in a 2006 truck accident. Her suit was filed in Denver \n     federal court two years later against Daimler Trucks North \n     America LLC, formerly Freightliner LLC.\n       It has been postponed twice, once in November 2010, about \n     two weeks before the trial was supposed to start, and again \n     this October to make way for a firearms case.\n       ``It was devastating to hear it was postponed,'' says Ms. \n     Bullock.\n       Daimler disputes the merits of Ms. Bullock's claim, which \n     revolves around the truck's safety design and whether it had \n     adequate safety restraints in its sleeper compartment. Its \n     attorney, Peter Jones, a Denver lawyer, nonetheless agrees \n     that the delays represent ``a huge inconvenience to the \n     clients and the witnesses who are involved on both sides.''\n       The trial is now scheduled for March 2012. Said the 41-\n     year-old Ms. Bullock: ``I'm looking forward to having my day \n     in court but, honestly, I feel like it may never happen.''\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n                          Vermont's Rebuilding\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to talk for a few moments about the \npositive impact next year's Transportation-HUD appropriations bill is \ngoing to have on my home State of Vermont, particularly as we continue \nrebuilding from Hurricane Irene's destructive forces back in August.\n  I want to praise subcommittee chair Patty Murray and ranking member \nSusan Collins. Their hard work and dedication ensures the final bill, \nfiled last night, provides both appropriate funding for disaster relief \naccounts and also moves heavy truck traffic out of historic downtowns \nboth in Vermont and in Maine.\n  As you and the others know, ever since Hurricane Irene, I have spoken \nover and over again on the floor of the Senate but also in meeting \nafter meeting of the Appropriations Committee and probably in hundreds \nof hours in discussions with both Republican and Democratic Senators, \nespecially on the Appropriations Committee, about the needs to Vermont.\n  Irene was devastating to our small State of Vermont. Both my wife and \nI were born in Vermont, and never in our lifetime have we seen anything \nlike what we saw--record rains, and flash floods simply washed away \nhomes, farms, businesses, roads, and bridges all over the State, \nincluding some that had been there for 100 years. Of all the body blows \nwe suffered when Irene raked our State from border to border, repairing \nthe damage to our roads and our bridges and our rail lines is one of \nour most urgent priorities, especially in a State in which we have \nalready had substantial snowfalls.\n  The huge expense of mending our transportation network is well beyond \nthe ability of a small State such as ours. When we tallied up the \ndestruction, it became quickly very clear that Vermont is going to need \nmore Federal help than the money that is now in the pipeline. In fact, \nwe are not alone in that. The same can be said of other States ravaged \nby Irene.\n  With many Federal aid disaster programs underfunded, I am especially \npleased that this bill contains $1,662 million to replenish the Federal \nhighway disaster relief fund. That is going to help Vermont and the \nother States that were so badly damaged rebuild vital roadways and \nbridges. Of course, these connections are crucial to distributing aid, \nrebuilding our economy, and serving as a lifeline to small communities, \nand, working with Governor Shumlin, Senator Sanders, Congressman Welch, \nand community leaders across Vermont, it became clear right away that, \ngiven the mammoth destruction of the storm, certain waivers are going \nto be needed to allow States to have these emergency funds without \nunnecessary burdens or delays. We have made adjustments to these caps \nin the past after major natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina \nand Andrew and tornadoes in the South.\n  I traveled around the State the day after Irene. It was hard to \nbelieve it was such a beautiful day. The Sun was shining. It looked \nlike the nicest summer day you could imagine, except that as the \nGovernor and I and General Dubie, the head of our National Guard, went \nby helicopter, we would go along and we would see a beautiful road, \nhouses, farms, a river running along one side, everything peaceful, and \nwe would go about a mile, and all of a sudden the river was on the \nwrong side of the road and hundreds of yards of road had disappeared, \nthere were gaping holes 50-, 100-, 150-feet deep and businesses, \nhouses, barns in the river, destroyed. These are places that have not \nchanged for 100 years but did in this. I remember saying to the \nGovernor: We will get the aid.\n  I was already getting e-mails from some of my colleagues--both \nRepublicans and Democrats--here in the Senate saying that Vermont had \nalways supported their States when they had disasters, and they would \nsupport us. But the Governor and I and everybody else realized that we \nhad to have waivers in the final bill to do the things we needed. They \nare essential to ensuring that Vermont can promptly begin work on \nemergency and permanent repairs sooner rather than later. It is the \nmiddle of November, and they no longer make asphalt after about the \nmiddle of November. Severe winter weather is right around the corner. \nSo it will make it nearly impossible to rebuild before March or April.\n  When I proposed the waivers in this bill, I can't tell you how much I \nappreciated the fact that Senators Murray and Collins supported that, \nas did Republicans and Democrats alike, on the appropriations bill. It \nmay seem like a small thing, but to our little State, it is the \ndifference between economic disaster and being able to rebuild, and I \ncan't thank Senators enough for supporting me on these waivers.\n  The bill also includes another high priority for Vermont: moving \nheavy trucks off the State's secondary roads and onto our interstate \nhighways. Overweight truck traffic in our villages and downtown poses a \nthreat to the State's infrastructure, but it is also an unnecessary \nsafety risk to both motorists and pedestrians.\n  The Leahy-Collins provision in this bill will end the steady parade \nof overweight trucks in Vermont and Maine from rumbling through our \nhistoric downtowns and small, narrow roads that come within a few feet \nof schools, houses, businesses, and town greens. It will help Vermont \nbusinesses and communities struggling even more right now because of \nthe large number of State and local roads already heavily damaged \nduring the recent flooding.\n  When we first met in the Appropriations Committee and I first raised \nthe needs of Vermont, I have to admit that I got emotional in that \nappropriations meeting, as I did here on the floor. It is because I saw \nmy fellow Vermonters, some, people I have known literally all my life, \nwho drew from their deep reservoirs of resiliency and resolve in the \nwake of Hurricane Irene; people helping people they don't even know but \nsaying, ``That is the way we do it in Vermont''; people moving even \nbefore FEMA or anybody else came to help with the disaster, moving to \nmake sure that people who might need to get to a hospital, even if we \nhad to carve a road through woods for them, it would be done. This is \nthe Vermont way.\n  But I was moved to tears going through the State and seeing things \nthat I remembered as a child that had always been there and I assumed \nwould be there all my life destroyed in a matter of hours.\n  These storms are going to enter the history books alongside the \nhorrific floods of 1927 in our State--something I remember my \ngrandparents and parents talking about. I remember my grandparents and \nparents saying: We hope we never see something like this again. They \ndidn't, but their son did, and I can't tell you how much it hurt.\n  But I cannot tell you how much it means to me that, again, Senators \njoined with me in saying: We will find the money Vermont needs. Back in \n1927, the National Government helped our State recover, as it should, \nbecause, after all, we are the United States of America. The American \npeople come together in times such as these, just as Vermonters have \nalways been among the helping hands extended to other States at their \ntime in need. So the progress this bill makes in helping Vermont and \nother States meet their urgent needs is a testament to the \ndetermination of many in this body. Again, Republicans and Democrats \nhave been willing to set aside ideological differences and partisan \ntensions to accomplish the work the American people expect from their \ngovernment.\n  When I first proposed this increase in disaster aid not only for \nVermont but for every other State, when I first proposed these waivers, \nI hoped they would happen. None of us knew whether they would. I am \npleased now to see a bill where they have. It came about because \nSenators from all over the country of both political parties worked \ntogether. You know, I wish we had more of that in Washington these \ndays. I would like to think that maybe this is a wonderful step forward \nand we are all going to benefit from it.\n  Mr. President, I know we are shortly to vote on the judicial \nnominations.

Mr. President, just to notify other Senators, I am shortly \ngoing to suggest the absence of a quorum. I will then ask us to come \nout of the quorum at noon, and unless I hear that somebody wishes to \nspeak on either of the nominees, I will then move that time be yielded \nback. I will\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\nnot do that until 12:00. But I now suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see nobody on either side who wishes to \nspeak. I ask unanimous consent all time be yielded back on the two \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on the \nnominations?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendment.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to raise concerns about this \namendment that would constitute a significant change to U.S. foreign \nand banking policies that should be carefully considered by the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and the Senate Banking Committee.\n  These provisions have far-reaching foreign policy implications which \nmake their inclusion in this bill unsupportable.\n  According to the State Department, ``Cuba has one of the world's most \nsecretive and non-transparent national banking systems. Cuba has no \nfinancial intelligence unit.''\n  Moreover, according to an October 28 statement by the Financial \nAction Task Force, FATF, ``Cuba has not committed to the anti-money \nlaundering and combating the financing of terrorism international \nstandards. Cuba has also not constructively engaged with the Task \nForce, which has identified Cuba as having strategic deficiencies that \npose a risk to the international financial system.''\n  This amendment would allow Cuba--the Banco Nacional de Cuba--to \nbecome the only country on the State Department's State-Sponsors of \nTerrorism list to have direct access to U.S.-based financial \ninstitutions.\n  We do not have similar exceptions for Iran, Syria, and Sudan.\n  It is important to understand that under Cuban law the Castro regime \nhas a monopoly on all banking, commerce, and trade.\n  Therefore, this amendment would allow Cuba's totalitarian regime to \ndirectly open corresponding accounts in U.S.-based financial \ninstitutions.\n  It would allow a country that does not subscribe to basic principles \nof antimoney laundering and counterterrorism to make direct transfers \nto U.S. financial institutions!\n  Currently, the Castro regime is required to use a third country \nEuropean bank to settle its payment for U.S. agricultural products.\n  If there are clearance problems, the U.S. settlement is entitled to \nprotection under the terms of contract with Euroclear--the European \nclearance and settlement agency.\n  If direct bank transfers are allowed, these transactions would be \nprovided protections from operational risk by the Cuban originator of \npayment.\n  Also consider the timing of these provisions, these concessions, \nthese gifts to the regime.\n  As American commercial interests buy their way into the Cuban market, \nan American--Alan Gross--remains a hostage in Cuban prison.\n  His crime? Working with U.S. democracy programs to enhance the \nability of the island's small Jewish community to communicate with the \nworld.\n  December 3 will mark 2 years of his unjust imprisonment--2 years that \nAlan Gross has been a hostage of the Cuban regime.\n  Recent months have also seen a notable crackdown on peaceful \ndemocracy activists, like Las Damas de Blanca--the ladies in White who \ntake to walking in the streets every Sunday to protest the political \nimprisonment of their husbands, brothers, and sons.\n  Last month, the founder of Las Damas de Blanca, Laura Pollan Toledo \ndied, not ever knowing a free Cuba.\n  In March 2003 the he regime arrested her husband, Hector Maseda, an \nindependent journalist, along with 74 others in a protest known as the \nBlack Spring. After a 1-day trial, Hector Maseda was sentenced to 20 \nyears in prison.\n  Laura Pollan Toledo's life, rallying the wives of Cuban dissidents \njailed under the iron fist of the repressive Castro regime, gave Cuba \nhope and she became one of Cuba's most public and most powerful \ndissidents.\n  She continued her work, as do those who follow in her footsteps, \ndespite intense harassment, beatings and detentions.\n  In one case, in the city of Santiago de Cuba, these ladies were \nstripped to their waist and dragged through the streets.\n  In another instance they were bitten.\n  Just last week, on November 8, over a dozen Cuban prodemocracy \nactivists were violently arrested for participating in a peaceful \npublic sit-in demanding the release of all political prisoners and an \nend to the Castro regime's violence against the opposition.\n  Among those arrested were Jorge Luis Garcia Perez ``Antunez,'' Pastor \nAlexei Gomez, Rene Quiroga, Jose Angel Abreu, Oscar Veranes Martinez, \nMaria del Carmen Martinez, Donaida Perez Paseiro, Xiomara Martin \nJimenez, Jorge Vazquez Chaviano, Orlando Alfonso Martinez, Enrique \nMartinez Marin Mayra Conlledo Garcia and Victor Castillo Ortega.\n  The Cuban people, like those struggling for democratic reforms in the \nMiddle East, yearn for the opportunity to control their destinies and \nprovide a vibrant future for their children.\n  The message we should send to such regimes--whether in Cuba or Syria, \nNorth Korea or Iran, is that they are pariahs--that their blood money \nhas no place in our economy--that the currency of freedom prevails over \nthe currency of repression.\n  The United States will continue in its mission to support the Cuban \npeople and to promote democracy until the Castro brothers relinquish \npower and restore the rights and liberties deserved by the Cuban people \nand by all people.\n  But these provisions don't move us or the Cuban people closer to that \ngoal--and must be rejected.\n  Therefore, along with my colleagues, Senator Nelson and Senator Rubio \nof Florida, I raise a rule XVI point of order against the pending \nsubstitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken and the \namendment falls.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Without losing my right to the floor, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the majority leader. I will not take \nthe 3 minutes but just to say my objection is the same as the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and my colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio.\n  The fact is, the provision in the bill would allow direct payments \nbetween U.S. sellers and Cuban buyers of agricultural goods. Under the \nexisting restrictions, U.S. exports to Cuba have fallen dramatically in \nthe last few years, largely due to the regime's shortage of hard \ncurrency. In other words, the sanctions are working. Now is not the \ntime to relax U.S. economic sanctions, particularly while we see on \nthis planet Earth in 2011 a repressive regime such as the one in Cuba \nand the one that continues to hold Alan Gross.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Without losing the floor, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Florida, Senator Rubio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wish to thank the majority leader for \nthat. I will be brief. I think my colleagues touched upon it and the \npublic policy behind this.\n  Lost in all the things happening around the world that are very \nimportant, I think we need to remind ourselves that a few miles off the \ncoast of\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\nthe United States the most repressive government in the Western \nHemisphere conducts its business and is able to fund it through a lot \nof this interaction going on as we speak between commercial interests \nin the United States and in Cuba.\n  By the way, I know these are folks in business and are not doing \nanything with bad intentions, but the practical intention of this \nagreed interaction with the Castro regime is hard currency--money they \ntake and use to pay for this repressive arm. This is happening at a \ntime when we have seen this year more repression than we have in recent \nyears as the Castro government continues to fear it is losing its grip \non power and on influence over its own society.\n  I would say I am supportive of what Senator Menendez is trying to do, \nand I urge our colleagues to keep a watchful eye on what happens in \nCuba.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me take a moment to explain what has \nhappened.\n  I offered the substitute amendment to include versions of the Energy \nand Water, Financial Services, and State/Foreign Ops appropriations \nbills that the Senate Appropriations Committee, on a bipartisan basis, \nhad reported. Senator Menendez then raised a point of order against \nthat substitute amendment. He had a right to do that. Senator Menendez \nhas explained he objects to provisions of the committee-reported \nFinancial Services bill that were linked to Cuba. That has been \nunderscored by my friend Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, and my friend \nMarco Rubio from Florida.\n  The amendment I just offered is exactly the same as my last \nsubstitute amendment in the last minibus, except that it does not \ninclude the Cuba-related provisions to which Senator Menendez objected. \nIt deletes sections 620 and 624 of the Financial Services bill reported \nto the Senate. I hope this amendment can give us the basis to move \nforward on this bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 957\n\n  Mr. President, I have a substitute amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 957.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 957, which \nconsists of the text of the withdrawn committee-reported amendment as \ndivision A, the text of S. 1573 with the exception of sections 620 and \n624, to which I have just referred, Calendar No. 171, as division B and \nthe text of S. 1601, Calendar No. 179, as division C; provided further \nthat H.R. 2434, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee and \ndivision C of amendment No. 957, be deemed House-passed text in H.R. \n2354 for purposes of rule XVI; finally, that amendment No. 957 for the \npurposes of paragraph 1 of Rule XVI be considered a committee \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, and a member--in fact, the \nranking minority member--of the Financial Services and General \nGovernment Subcommittee. The amendment the majority leader offered, \nthat excluded the provisions related to Cuba, was an amendment that was \nadopted by the full Appropriations Committee in a very bipartisan way. \nIn fact, the vote was two-thirds to one-third--20 votes in favor, 10 \nvotes against.\n  The provisions that have been struck by the procedure that has \noccurred today are the final implementation of legislation that was \npassed by this Congress in 2001 in which we provided for the first time \nthe sale for cash upfront of agricultural commodities, food, and \nmedicine. It has always been my view, when we fail to sell agricultural \ncommodities to Cuba, we only harm ourselves. Again, the amendment that \nhas been eliminated from consideration today, through this process, \nwould implement the ability for money to be transferred to the United \nStates by a Cuban bank for purposes of paying for that sale upfront.\n  We have worked closely with the administration, with the Treasury \nDepartment, to make certain that nothing contained or nothing that \nwould be contained in this provision would be objectionable to the \nsecurity or the financial safety and soundness of our country. So with \nthe process that has occurred, while there could have been many rule \nXVI points of order made today, one was made that defeats the will of \nthe majority of our committee, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a full statement that I want to give \nas to why I am going to move through the next process, but I understand \nmy friend from Louisiana is here. Before going to him, I ask for the \nyeas and nays on the substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, without losing my right to the floor, I \nyield to my friend from Louisiana for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the majority leader, and I also rise to object to \nthe motion for completely different reasons than my colleague from \nKansas. I rise to object, and several join me in this view, because I \nbelieve these additional appropriations bills, which we are trying to \nbring to the floor, simply spend too much money.\n  Our greatest challenge as a nation right now is our economy. A big \npart of that challenge is the fact that we have completely \nunsustainable Federal spending and deficit and debt. Yet in the midst \nof all that, these appropriations bills spend more money than we are \nspending already, not less.\n  Every American with any common sense knows when they are in a deep \nhole, the first step one takes is to stop digging. We as a country are \nin a deep fiscal hole, but these bills have us continuing to dig \nfurther. The three bills the majority leader wants to bring to the \nfloor together spend $6 billion more than we are spending now.\n  We are spending more, not less, even though we are $15 trillion in \ndebt. That is simply continuing to dig when we are in a deep fiscal \nhole.\n  Also, when you look at some of the details of this spending, it makes \nit even more offensive to millions upon millions of Americans--allowing \nfunds for overseas groups that perform abortion, allowing taxpayer-\nfunded abortion in the District of Columbia, allowing elective \nabortions in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, allowing \nfunding of abortion by the Peace Corps, and $40 million for the U.N. \nPopulation Fund, which is deeply involved in China's proabortion \npopulation control program.\n  I think it is a deadly combination in more ways than one. We are \ncontinuing to dig when we are already in a deep hole, and then, when \nyou look at the details of the spending, so many parts of that in and \nof themselves are deeply offensive to tens of millions of Americans. \nBased on that and joined by many conservative colleagues of the Senate, \nI also object.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the bills we brought before the Senate--\nEnergy and Water, Financial Services, Foreign Operations--are all \nwithin the agreement we made in July, the deficit reduction package, \ndebt ceiling package we passed. It passed the Senate, passed the House, \nwas signed by the President. So my friend from Louisiana is trying to \nrenegotiate something that was passed after we did 3 months' work on \nit.\n  I regret that there has been objection to my request, but what I just \nsought was the same understanding we had in the last appropriations \nmeasure, which worked pretty well. We passed those three bills. The \nconference should be completed momentarily. We will have to vote on \nthat this coming week. Included in that is the CR to fund the \ngovernment until sometime in the middle of December. But there has been \nan objection to proceeding along those same lines.\n  Everything that was raised by my friend from Louisiana--is what the \namendment process is all about. But we wanted it to be the way we have\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\ndone it in the past--that on these appropriations matters, the \namendments would have to be germane. But he was unwilling to live by \nthat standard and offered amendments that had nothing to do with the \nunderlying bill. That is what the American people can't stand.\n  The Senate has rules that govern appropriations measures. These \nSenate rules are necessary because appropriations matters are must-pass \nbills, and we need some rules to prevent them from becoming Christmas \ntrees. The Senate rules thus prevent nongermane amendments, and the \nSenate rules prevent legislating on appropriations bills. So those two \nthings have the protection only on appropriations bills. If we didn't \nhave these rules, these appropriations measures would become \nunmanageable.\n  So what I sought with my unanimous consent request was to create an \nenvironment where the regular rules of the Senate for appropriations \nmeasures could be in effect. Regrettably, we didn't get that agreement. \nIf we did those bills individually, that would be automatic.\n  Without such an agreement, though, we have another thing about which \nwe have to worry: Funding for the government runs out at the end of \nthis week. So before we leave this week, the Senate needs to pass the \ncontinuing resolution contained in the conference report on the \nAgriculture appropriations bill, which also included other \nappropriations matters. We can't allow the Senate to get tied up in \nknots in a way that would prevent us from getting that work done.\n  As I said this morning, I have made a commitment to Senators Levin \nand McCain that we are going to move to the authorization bill as soon \nas we finish this appropriations package, and I intend to do that. So \nwe will engage in further discussions about how we can move forward \nwith these important measures. In the meantime, we need to take steps \nto at least temporarily hold matters where they are. So, as I \nindicated, I have the yeas and nays pending on the substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I indicated during the last week that I did \nnot want to have to fill the tree. It is unfortunate that an objection \nwas raised. We were able to move forward, as I indicated, in the last \nso-called minibus with three appropriations bills made into one. So we \nare now in a situation where we have no way to move forward unless we \nhave an agreement on the underlying bill, which is the Energy and Water \nbill.\n  I have some knowledge of that bill. I was on the Appropriations \nCommittee from the day I came to the Senate, and I worked on that \nsubcommittee for many years--several decades--and I was chairman of \nthat subcommittee quite a few times. I worked with Senator Domenici \nwhen we would go back and forth as to who was the Chair, and we worked \nextremely well together. We were able to get the bill done quickly and \nsatisfy the needs of the Members of this body.\n  If I can have the efforts of my friends, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Alexander, to move forward on this in a way that we can have \nsome view of how we can end this legislation fairly quickly, with the \nability to have amendments, I would have no problem because, as I have \nindicated, we have a lot of things to do before we leave here.\n  We cannot come back here in December with a lot of unfinished \nbusiness. I talked to my caucus today about the Defense authorization \nbill. I think we have to finish that bill before we leave here for \nThanksgiving. So we have the minibus conference report, we now have \nthis Energy and Water appropriations bill, which I believe is so \nimportant, and we have, of course, the Defense authorization bill. So I \nsay to everyone here, if we can work something out, good. I hope we \ncan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might respond through the \nChair to the majority leader.\n  I have been consulting with the chairman of our committee, and on the\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\nRepublican side, we understand what the majority leader is saying. What \nI hear him saying is that we have some important work we have to do \nthis week. He wants to move to the Defense authorization bill before \nthe end of the week. We have a conference report that includes a \ncontinuing resolution. He wants that acted on before the end of the \nweek.\n  Our hope is that we can deal with the Energy and Water bill today and \ntomorrow. I am beginning to ask our Republican Senators--and Senator \nFeinstein can speak for herself, but she is doing the same with \nDemocratic members--I am asking them to get their proposed amendments \nto the floor this afternoon, if at all possible, so we can give the \nmajority leader some idea of how many amendments there might be so he \ncan evaluate how to proceed. So we appreciate the opportunity to do \nthat. We believe that doing the appropriations bill is the basic work \nof the Senate. This is important both from a defense and a nondefense \npoint of view. It had broad support in our committee, and so far, I \nhave not found anyone on our side who isn't agreeable to moving quickly \non it. I will know more at the end of the afternoon, and I will report \nto the majority leader about the Republican side.\n  I ask my colleagues who are listening to please bring their \namendments to the floor this afternoon as soon as possible.\n  Mr. REID. I have absolute confidence in the chairman and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee. They are two of our finest. They have a \nreputation here of working to get things done on a bipartisan basis, \nand that is certainly necessary on this most important piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I understand this correctly, it is, \nas Senator Alexander has stated, that the effort is to, under a germane \nrule, have the Energy and Water appropriations bill brought to the \nfloor. If that is achieved, then all Members, including Democratic \nMembers, should get their amendments to the floor as soon as possible.\n  We know what this week is like. We know the Defense authorization \nbill has to come to the floor. We know there are other items that have \nto come to the floor this week. Therefore, I hope that this effort is \nsuccessful and that we will be able to begin to work on our bills.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, that is exactly right. Just so Senators know, Senator \nReid has filled the tree, but what we hope to persuade him is that we \nknow the number of amendments we have and that he doesn't need to do \nthat. He is perfectly able to withdraw that. And I know several of our \nRepublican colleagues are discussing this afternoon how many amendments \nthey want to offer, and it is my hope that we will soon be able to \nstart voting on those amendments, vote on them tomorrow, and finish the \nbill sometime tomorrow.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Evelyn H. Lauder\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to remember the life and to \nhonor the legacy of a remarkable woman--an advocate for breast cancer \nresearch and awareness, a philanthropist, a savvy businesswoman, an \naccomplished photographer and author, a wife, a mother, a grandmother, \nand a dear friend, Evelyn Lauder.\n  Evelyn lost her courageous battle with ovarian cancer on Saturday. \nShe is survived by her husband of 52 years, Leonard Lauder; her sons, \nWilliam and Gary; and five grandchildren.\n  In many ways, her life parallels the familiar immigrant story of \n20th-century America. It is the story of a woman who escaped Nazi \nEurope, voyaged to the United States of America, and proceeded to \nenrich this country in countless ways.\n  Evelyn Hausner was born on August 12, 1936, in Vienna. She was the \nonly child of Ernest and Mimi Hausner. When Hitler annexed Austria in \n1938, the family fled to Belgium with just a few sentimental \nbelongings. Later, the family relocated to England during the Blitz.\n  In England, Evelyn's mother was sent to an internment camp on the \nIsle of Man. Evelyn was sent to live in a nursery. Eventually the \nfamily was reunited, and in 1940 they set sail for New York City.\n  Evelyn often told a story about arriving in New York Harbor at the \ndawn of the Second World War. She said:\n\n       My mother woke me up really early in the morning to see the \n     Statue of Liberty. That's a sight I will remember all my \n     life.\n\n  She fell in love with New York that morning and would give back to \nher adopted city for the next seven decades.\n  She was a proud product of the New York City public school system. As \na freshman at Hunter College, she met her future husband on a blind \ndate. Leonard Lauder was the son of Estee and Joseph Lauder, the owners \nof what then was just a small, family cosmetics business.\n  Evelyn was a public school teacher for several years, and in 1959 she \nformally joined Estee Lauder, pitching in wherever she was needed. As \nthe company grew to become an international conglomerate, so, too, did \nEvelyn's role and influence. She held many different positions at the \ncompany over the years.\n  One of the earliest projects she tackled was to create the company's \ntraining programs. She enhanced the Estee Lauder product lineup by \nadding new colors and products that appealed to a range of complexions \nand skin types. She had great instincts about new trends, about the \nneeds of a consumer, and about the development of skin care and \ncosmetics. In fact, it was Evelyn who helped launch the name ``the \nClinique brand.''\n  In the last 25 years, she focused on fragrance--a lifelong passion \nshe shared with her famous mother-in-law that stemmed from her love of \nflowers and gardening.\n  In 1999 and again in 2007, she was recognized as one of New York's \n100 Most Influential Women in Business by Crain's New York Business.\n  Evelyn was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1989 and soon became a \ntireless advocate for women's health. True to form, she was reluctant \nto publicly discuss her own condition. ``My situation doesn't really \nmatter,'' she told a reporter in 1995. Instead, she chose to channel \nher energy and attention into helping raise money and educate women \nwith less access and information about the disease. In 1989, as a \nmember of the board of overseers at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in \nNew York, she initiated a fundraising drive that raised more than $18 \nmillion to establish the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center, the country's \nfirst ever breast and diagnostic center. The center opened in 1992 and \nis a model for similar facilities around the world.\n\n  In 1992 Evelyn developed the iconic pink ribbon, which we all know \ntoday as the worldwide symbol of breast health. She spearheaded the \ndistribution of millions of pink ribbons and breast self-exam \ninstruction cards at Estee Lauder cosmetic counters all across the \ncountry. Her efforts elevated breast cancer awareness in the public \nconsciousness, and almost two decades later more than 115 million pink \nribbons and millions of educational brochures and bookmarks have been \nhanded out around the world.\n  In 1993 she turned her attention to supporting the world's leading \nmedical and scientific researchers and established the Breast Cancer \nResearch Foundation to address the crucial lack of breast cancer \nresearch funding. Under her leadership, the foundation has grown to \nbecome the largest national organization dedicated exclusively to \nfunding research relating to the causes, treatment, and prevention of \nbreast cancer. To date, this foundation has raised $350 million, and \nsupports 186 researchers around the United States, Canada, Latin \nAmerica, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and China.\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\n  In 2000, Evelyn Lauder launched the Global Landmark Illuminations \nInitiative. We have all enjoyed seeing historic landmarks illuminated \nin pink lights during the month of October. Each year, more than 200 \nprominent landmarks around the world participate. Evelyn has bathed the \nEmpire State Building, Niagara Falls, the Tower of London, the Leaning \nTower of Pisa, and the Tokyo Tower in pink lights.\n  There was another side to Evelyn. She was an accomplished \nphotographer with a keen eye and ability to capture extraordinary \nimages. I have two of her photographs and treasure them. Her \nphotography included rainbows rising from the Pacific Ocean, snow \nscenes in Colorado, patterns created by light reflecting on water, and \nlandscapes in Chile, Tuscany, and the south of France, among others. \nEvelyn's works were featured in exhibitions at art galleries in London, \nParis, Jerusalem, Barcelona, and Beijing, and well-received exhibitions \nin New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, and my hometown of San Francisco. \nShe also published two books of photographs and had her work featured \nin many publications, including American Photo, House & Garden, the \nOprah Magazine, and Town & Country.\n  Evelyn was modest and self-effacing, but she donated all proceeds \nfrom her photographic exhibitions and royalties from her books to the \nBreast Cancer Research Foundation.\n  Evelyn Lauder was one of a kind. She was a beautiful woman. I knew \nher. I remember Evelyn, her husband, my husband, and me sitting around \na small table in a small Italian restaurant in New York City. I looked \nacross that table at this beautiful woman and all that she has done in \nher lifetime. It is truly amazing. Her life may have begun under \nchallenging circumstances but she became one of the country's most \ngenerous philanthropists and accomplished businesswomen. She was fun, \nshe was smart, she was talented. She was a devoted wife, mother, \ngrandmother, and friend. She was a remarkable American woman. She will \nbe missed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Internet Sales Tax\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last week the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nEnzi, and the Senator from Illinois, the Democratic whip, introduced a \npiece of legislation which is called the Marketplace Fairness Act. In \ndoing so, I think they solved a problem that has persisted in almost \nevery State in the Union and that Congress has had a difficult time \ndealing with for the last 10 years. The problem is what do we do about \nState sales taxes which everybody owes every time they make a purchase.\n  If you buy a television set at the local appliance store in Tennessee \nyou owe Tennessee sales tax. If you buy it online you still owe the \nsales tax. The difference has been that the local retailer is required \nto collect the sales tax, and does, and sends it to the State, but the \nonline vendor, let's say Amazon, is not required to collect the sales \ntax and so it does not.\n  So, like most individuals--I bought a television set from Amazon \nearlier this year. At the end of the year, I would need to file a form \nwith our State government and say I bought it, acknowledge that they \ndidn't collect the sales tax, tell the State I owe the sales tax on my \npurchase, and pay it. The truth is most Americans do not do that. That \nis a $23 billion a year tax avoidance, a great big tax loophole.\n  One may ask why has that loophole not been closed. We hear a lot of \ntalk about loopholes around here and we know States want to have \ndollars right now, either to lower taxes or pay for services, and most \nof us think we should not prefer one business over another business or \none taxpayer over another taxpayer. The problem is 20 years ago the \ntechnology did not exist to make it easy for an online or remote vendor \nto collect the sales tax in the same way the local shoestore or local \nvendor collects it, so the Supreme Court said it would be an undue \nburden on interstate commerce.\n  Here is the loophole in practical terms. I called the owner of the \nNashville Boot Company last week after we introduced the bill, Frank \nHarwell. At the beginning he sold cowboy boots online. I think it is \nthe Nashville Cowboy Boot company. But he sold boots online, and he \nsaid he sold as much as $400,000 a year of cowboy boots online. That \nwas his major business. When he began, he was about the only one doing \nthat, and I assume if you wanted cowboy boots, Nashville sounded like a \ngood place to buy them, so he was doing all right. Now he said there \nare about 200 people selling boots online and so he does most of his \nboot selling out of his store. He has a store in Belle Meade Plaza \nright next to where I take my granddaughter to breakfast on Saturday \nmornings.\n  This is what he says happens to him. He says people come into the \nNashville Cowboy Boot company store and they try on the cowboy boots \nand then they go home and buy them online because they don't have to \npay the sales tax. They owe the sales tax, but, as I said, the online \nsellers are not required to collect it and many taxpayers fail to pay \nit even though they owe it.\n  Now we are not talking about Internet tax here. The Senate had a \ngreat big debate on the Internet access tax a few years ago. I was \nright in the middle of that. By the time we got through with it, we had \na compromise and we put a moratorium on new Internet access taxes. So \nwe are not talking about taxing the Internet or a new Internet tax. We \nare talking about the plain old State sales tax that everybody--except \nin five States, one of them being New Hampshire, which doesn't have a \nsales tax--in 45 States owes.\n  I have been very pleased with the reception I have heard to the bill \nintroduced by Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin. It has five Republican \ncosponsors. I am one of them. It has five Democratic cosponsors. We \nhope there will be more. Many of the people who saw problems with \nearlier attempts to fix the bill believe this legislation solves the \nproblem. Some of the early bills were large. This bill is 10 pages. It \nis very simple. If the problem was it was too complicated for remote \nsellers to collect the online tax, they fixed that. They have said if \nTennessee wants to require remote sellers like Amazon to do the same \nthing the local boot company does, it has to provide Amazon with \nsoftware that will make it simple for Amazon to collect the tax.\n  When I want to know the weather in my hometown outside of Maryville, \nTN, I simply put in weather and the ZIP Code 37886, and back comes the \ninformation. That is all a remote vendor will have to do. It will put \nin Lamar Alexander, cowboy boots, whatever they cost, the ZIP Code, and \nthe computer software will figure out the state and local sales tax and \nreport it to the vendor, and the vendor will send the money \nelectronically to whatever State. So the old problems don't exist.\n  I saw an article in the Wall Street Journal today which I thought was \nvery well balanced. It takes a whole page. States require online \nretailers to collect sales tax. Yes, it is fair. No, it protects small \nfirms. I am not going to put this in the Record, but I do want to take \nissue with one argument among those who said: No, it protects small \nfirms. Two arguments, really.\n  One, the Enzi-Durbin legislation has a $500,000 exemption. So my \nfriend in Nashville, who was the only, and I guess for a while, leading \nseller of cowboy boots online never made more than $400,000 in \nrevenues. He said, I could tell that. So if he doesn't have more than \n$400,000 or $500,000 in revenue, he is not even affected by this \nlegislation that gives States the option to decide what to do.\n  Second, this says the legislation would overturn the Supreme Court \nruling of 20 years ago. That is not accurate. It does not overturn \nanything. What the Supreme Court said 20 years ago was that with the \nstate of technology that existed with so many different taxing \njurisdictions, it was an undue burden on interstate commerce for States \nto require online sellers to collect the tax that was owed. This is \nwhat the Court said:\n\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\n\n       This aspect of our decision is made easier by the fact that \n     the underlying issue is not only one that Congress may be \n     better qualified to resolve, but also one that Congress has \n     the ultimate power to resolve. No matter how we evaluate the \n     burdens that use taxes impose on interstate commerce, \n     Congress remains free to disagree with our conclusions.\n\n  Then it said:\n\n       Accordingly, Congress is now free to decide whether, when, \n     and to what extent the States may burden interstate mail-\n     order concerns with a duty to collect use taxes.\n\n  This is not overturning anything. It is simply responding to the \ninvitation by the Supreme Court 20 years ago that said: As we look at \nit, this is too big a burden. That was back when there were thousands \nof taxing districts and no easy way to collect the money. But it did \nsay that Congress had the right to decide what represents a burden. \nWhat this bill says is, there are two ways States may do this. There is \nthe Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement where about half the States \nhave joined together and said, we will create a single way to allow \nonline vendors to operate, or the State of Kentucky may say, we don't \nlike what they are doing, we will create our own way. As long as it is \na simple way, a single return, a single audit, and the State provides \nthe software, then the State has that option. That is why Amazon \ndecided last week that it supported the Enzi-Durbin bill.\n  On the Republican or conservative side, there have been a lot of \npeople who said, wait, this is about taxes. Well, it is about taxes, \nbut it is about taxes in a way that conservatives like to talk about. \nWe like to say we don't like it when the government policy prefers some \ntaxpayers over others, or some businesses over others. We also, on this \nside of the aisle, believe in States' rights, and this bill doesn't \ndecide anything. It simply empowers States to make their own decisions \nabout taxes.\n  In our State, for example, we have one of the lowest tax burdens, but \nwe have the highest State sales tax. If we are able to collect $300 \nmillion, $400 million, $500 million more in Tennessee from this tax \nthat is now avoided because of the loophole, there could be proposals \nto reduce the sales tax rate or reduce some other tax. Certainly the \nmoney will help to avoid the arrival of a State income tax, which is \nabout the most hated word in our tax vocabulary in Tennessee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some of the \nresponses that have come since last week. The Memphis Commercial Appeal \neditorial which urged that Congress close this longstanding loophole in \nthe current tax law. ``It's the right thing to do.''\n  Greg Johnson, a conservative columnist in the Knoxville News Sentinel \nsaid: ``Online sales tax bill would level the playing field.'' His \narticle refers to the fact that 10 years ago William F. Buckley, Jr., \nwhom he calls the father of modern conservatism, opined to the National \nReview about this problem and that it needed a result.\n  The same sort of argument was made by Al Cardenas, head of the \nAmerican Conservative Union, who wrote an article last week and said \nthis needs to be fixed and supports a bill such as the one we \nintroduced.\n  There is also an editorial from the Seattle Times, an editorial from \nthe Paris Post-Intelligencer, an editorial from the Denver Post, and \none from Belleville in Illinois. All of these make the same points.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Commercial Appeal, Nov. 13, 2011]\n\n                      A Level Field for Retailers\n\n\n Requiring online and catalogue retailers to collect sales taxes could \n                 help the state reach worthwhile goals\n\n       When was the last time you sent a check to state government \n     for the sales tax you owed for an online purchase?\n       More to the point, did you know you were supposed to?\n       Join the club.\n       Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander has come up with a way to \n     relieve shoppers of a responsibility many of us don't even \n     know we have.\n       Alexander has predicted passage of the bipartisan \n     Marketplace Fairness Act, whose co-sponsors include five \n     Democrats and five Republicans, including Sen. Bob Corker of \n     Tennessee.\n       The bill would require online and catalogue retailers to \n     begin collecting and remitting state sales taxes.\n       In Tennessee, annual revenue from online sales tax \n     collections has been estimated at between $300 million and \n     $400 million.\n       In a 2009 study, University of Tennessee-Knoxville \n     economics and business professors estimated that $52 billion \n     in potential revenues will have been lost in 46 states and \n     the District of Columbia over a six-year period through 2012 \n     because taxes on online sales are not being collected.\n       The measure's primary appeal is one of fairness--the \n     elimination of an unfair advantage online sellers have over \n     large and small brick-and-mortar stores.\n       Very small businesses would be protected by an exemption \n     that covers annual online sales of less than $500,000 in the \n     Senate version of the bill, or $1 million if the House \n     version is adopted.\n       The benefits to a state such as Tennessee could be \n     significant.\n       The state's public college students were hit by annual \n     tuition and fee increases that ranged from 7.4 percent to \n     13.7 percent for the current school year.\n       Increases for the 2012-13 school year will seem even worse \n     than usual next fall if the General Assembly decides to cut \n     back on the eligibility standards and/or the size of state \n     lottery scholarships.\n       An expansion of the TennCare rolls called for by the \n     federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 \n     will be offset to some extent by a larger federal match, but \n     TennCare officials have predicted that the state will have to \n     cover at least part of the expansion.\n       And with new revenue from online sales, Tennessee could \n     also consider the elimination of its sales tax on food, one \n     of the most regressive aspects of the state revenue system.\n       Passage of the measure also would move up the date on which \n     Tennessee could begin receiving revenue on sales from \n     Amazon's new Tennessee distribution centers.\n       Under an arrangement worked out between Gov. Bill Haslam \n     and the company, those collections currently aren't due to \n     begin, absent federal standardization, until 2014.\n       In fact, Amazon, which has been seeking sales tax relief in \n     several states as part of its decision making process \n     regarding new sites, has turned out to be a supporter of the \n     Alexander bill.\n       There is software available to ease the transition for \n     online retailers--nothing, in fact, to prevent Congress from \n     closing this long-standing loophole in current tax law. It's \n     also the right thing to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Knoxnews.com, Nov. 11, 2011]\n\n            Online Sales Tax Bill Would Level Playing Field\n\n                           (By Greg Johnson)\n\n       Almost exactly 10 years ago, William F. Buckley Jr., the \n     father of modern conservatism, opined in the National Review \n     about the vexing problem of e-commerce and the collection--or \n     lack thereof--of sales taxes by state governments. Buckley \n     stood firmly athwart principled, conservative convictions \n     against any tax on Internet usage.\n       But when it came to the collection of taxes on Internet \n     purchases, Buckley saw how the growth in online commerce was \n     changing the world of retail sales and how local businesses \n     were being harmed by the uneven playing field on which out-\n     of-state vendors did not collect sales taxes.\n       ``The estimated commerce done by the Internet in 1998 was \n     $9 billion,'' Buckley wrote. ``Last year (2000) it was $26 \n     billion. Which means we have to come to earth and face \n     homespun economic truths. If the advantage of tax-free \n     Internet commerce marginally closes out local industry, \n     reforms are required.''\n       U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., proposed such reform \n     this week, co-sponsoring the bipartisan Marketplace Fairness \n     Act. ``The reason I'm a co-sponsor is that it's a states'' \n     rights issue,'' Alexander said in a Wednesday conference \n     call. ``(The bill) gives the state of Tennessee the right to \n     decide how to collect or not to collect its own state sales \n     tax.''\n       Alexander noted how bricks-and-mortar retailers are at a \n     disadvantage. ``Main Street sellers are up at arms because \n     they have to collect a tax when they sell a television set or \n     a computer, and online sellers don't,'' Alexander said. \n     ``(This legislation) ends the subsidy of some businesses over \n     others.''\n       Gov. Bill Haslam backs Alexander. ``The Marketplace \n     Fairness Act will bring much-needed, and long overdue, relief \n     to the state of Tennessee,'' Haslam wrote in a letter to \n     Alexander. ``Tennessee and other states are currently unable \n     to compel out-of-state businesses to collect sales taxes the \n     same way local businesses do.'' The University of Tennessee's \n     Center for Business and Economic Research estimates the state \n     loses more than $300 million per year in uncollected revenue.\n       While Ebay opposes the bill, Paul Misener, Amazon's vice \n     president for global public policy, pledged support, writing \n     to Alexander, ``Your bill will allow states to obtain \n     additional revenue without new taxes or federal spending and \n     will make it easy for consumers and small retailers to comply \n     with state sales tax laws.''\n       Alexander moved to pre-empt fire from the right. \n     ``Conservatives understand (collection from online vendors) \n     is not a new tax. It is a tax that already exists. It is not \n     an Internet tax,'' Alexander said. ``This is an existing tax \n     on all sales, and it is not fair to charge it to some \n     taxpayers and not others. It is not fair to discriminate \n     against stores in Tennessee in favor of stores outside \n     Tennessee.''\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n       A decade ago, Buckley embraced reality when online sales \n     were $26 billion and local industry was being crowded out by \n     uneven and unfair application of existing tax laws. Last \n     year, online retailers sold $142 billion in merchandise. As \n     Buckley wrote and Alexander recognizes, reforms are required.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Seattle Times, Nov. 11, 2011]\n\n         Bill To Tap Into Online Sales-Tax Revenue Makes Sense\n\n       The Seattle Times editorial board supports the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act, which would allow states to collect sales taxes \n     on mail-order and online purchases across state lines.\n       Washington's delegation in Congress, Democrat and \n     Republican, should support the Marketplace Fairness Act, a \n     bipartisan Senate bill that would allow states to collect \n     sales taxes on online and catalog purchases across state \n     lines.\n       For years, Washington residents have escaped sales taxes by \n     buying online. People have enjoyed doing this, brushing aside \n     the irksome thought that they were shortchanging local \n     merchants, wiping out local jobs and undermining local \n     governments. When the Internet was small and times were good, \n     their irresponsibility could be overlooked. No longer.\n       In the two-year period ending June 30, 2013, Washington \n     state government is in a $2 billion hole. Counties and cities \n     also suffer. The Department of Revenue estimates that passing \n     the Marketplace Fairness Act will bring state and local \n     government $483 million in new money in the next biennium. \n     The effect in this biennium would be less but still \n     meaningful.\n       Every hundred million dollars counts.\n       Most states have an income tax. Our state does not, and has \n     voted four times against one. If a sales tax is what the \n     people want, they must update it for the 21st century--and in \n     an Internet world, that means collecting the tax across state \n     lines.\n       This state is also the home of the most successful Internet \n     retailer, Amazon. For several years, Amazon has fought \n     efforts of other states to collect sales taxes. Despite \n     Amazon being a neighbor to The Seattle Times, we have \n     criticized its position.\n       Amazon now changes. It has endorsed the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act. This is strategically smart, and it is welcome.\n       ``Amazon's coming out in support is huge,'' says Russ \n     Brubaker, assistant director of the Department of Revenue in \n     Olympia.\n       Interstate sales-tax bills have been offered before, by \n     Democrats. Brubaker notes that the new bill, sponsored by \n     Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., now has an equal group of \n     Republicans behind it, including Sen. Lamar Alexander of \n     Tennessee.\n       ``Having him on that bill makes a big difference,'' \n     Brubaker says.\n       This is a bill that makes sense. The timing is right. Our \n     delegation should support it, and push hard.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Paris Post-Intelligencer, Nov. 10, 2011]\n\n                   Online Sales Tax Path Is Clearing\n\n\n                 After a Long Fight, States are winning\n\n       Bit by bit, states are winning the battle to collect sales \n     taxes for purchases made by computer.\n       What once seemed a solid wall of opposition that gave \n     online sellers a huge advantage and caused states to lose \n     many millions in lost revenue is being dismantled brick by \n     brick.\n       The latest turn is that Tennessee's senior U.S. Senator, \n     Lamar Alexander, has introduced a bill in Congress, \n     coauthored by Republican and Democratic senators, to let \n     states collect sales taxes. If enacted, the bill would negate \n     a Supreme Court ruling that allows a state to collect taxes \n     only when a seller has a physical location within the state.\n       ``It's a state rights issue,'' Alexander said. ``It gives \n     the State of Tennessee the right to decide how to collect or \n     not to collect its own sales tax.\n       ``It ends the subsidy for some businesses over others, it \n     ends the subsidy for some taxpayers over others, it closes a \n     loophole that's been growing for 20 years, and it permits the \n     state to collect that avoided revenue.''\n       It's no small matter. This year, University of Tennessee \n     economists have estimated, the Volunteer State is losing $365 \n     million in missed sales taxes. The estimate for 2012 is $410 \n     million.\n       Some traditional opponents of the tax move now support it. \n     Chief among them is the on-line giant Amazon, which said \n     Wednesday it will work to get Alexander's bill passed. The \n     firm, under a deal negotiated by Gov. Bill Haslam, had \n     already agreed to begin collecting the tax in 2014; \n     Alexander's bill, if passed, could speed up that process.\n       Support also has come from Wal-Mart and Best Buy, as well \n     as from some congressional conservatives who originally had \n     opposed the move as a new tax. The American Conservative \n     Union has endorsed a similar bill introduced in the House.\n       Some opposition remains--eBay opposes the trend on the \n     basis that it would place a new burden on small businesses. \n     Alexander's bill would ease that burden by exempting on-line \n     sellers who have less than half a million dollars in out-of-\n     state sales; the House bill sets a $1 million cutoff point.\n       The time is right. The path is clearing. Congress should \n     act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Nov. 14, 2011]\n\n                    Online Sales Tax Could Be a Boon\n\n       A new Internet sales tax bill introduced in Congress has \n     the potential to allow cash-strapped states to collect \n     billions in sales taxes from online purchases.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act is a significant step forward \n     that could help Colorado--someday.\n       The problem that Colorado and a handful of other states \n     would face in trying to use the authority described in the \n     bill is lack of uniformity.\n       Colorado's local taxing authorities have many different \n     rates for various items and would have to agree on uniform \n     sales tax rates for online purchases.\n       Yes, it's a heavy lift. However, the folks at the state \n     Department of Revenue say they think it's possible. We hope \n     so. This measure could put an end to the Amazon tax wars, and \n     could help states collect revenues rightfully due.\n       Some online retailers have fought hard against state-level \n     attempts to get them to collect sales taxes. They argued \n     states were imposing improper and burdensome regulations on \n     interstate commerce, and they had the law on their side.\n       The answer was federal legislation to allow states to \n     compel sales tax collection. In Colorado, that could mean an \n     additional $173 million in state and local taxes in 2012. \n     That's not chump change.\n       Geoff Wilson, general counsel for the Colorado Municipal \n     League, said his reading of the legislation is that local \n     taxing authorities would have to agree to the same rates for \n     online sales originating with out-of-state retailers, ones \n     without a physical presence in Colorado. They'd still keep \n     their local rates for local sales.\n       Those online sales taxes would be collected at the state \n     level, and then disbursed to the local entities.\n       It would likely mean that there would still be a \n     difference--one tax rate if you buy something in a store \n     locally and another if you buy online. Optimally, you'd want \n     those to be pretty close, but given the variation in \n     Colorado's sales tax rates from one jurisdiction to another, \n     there would certainly be a difference between the sales taxes \n     you'd pay at a brick and mortar store versus online.\n       ``It's not a perfect remedy, but it's not the injustice \n     that it used to be,'' Wilson told us.\n       What he means by that is now, people who buy goods online \n     from out-of-state retailers frequently do so without paying \n     any sales taxes.\n       That puts a local retailer with the store down the street \n     at a big disadvantage in competing with those selling items \n     online. A uniform tax rate for an online purchase would \n     drastically reduce the ``Main Street inequity'' problem, \n     Wilson said.\n       State revenue officials say passage of the bill, which has \n     bipartisan support, would create a big incentive for \n     Colorado's many disparate taxing authorities to agree on \n     simplification.\n       We hope Colorado policy makers give this serious thought. \n     We appreciate and respect the autonomy of home rule cities \n     and counties.\n       However, forging an agreement on this matter could result \n     in a measure of fairness for local retailers and much-needed \n     revenue for state and local governments.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From bnd.com, Nov. 14, 2011]\n\n                     Internet Tax Is About Fairness\n\n       The tax-free days of shopping on the Internet may soon be a \n     thing of the past. A bipartisan group of senators, including \n     Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, has introduced a bill that may \n     finally have traction.\n       This is good news. While no one likes paying taxes, this \n     bill should help level the playing field for all businesses.\n       Opponents complain that the measure will hurt small \n     Internet businesses, but small brick-and-mortar businesses \n     have to collect sales taxes; why shouldn't small Internet-\n     based businesses also?\n       The only reason they don't already do it is that the system \n     of figuring each jurisdiction's sales tax rate is so \n     complicated. This bill would set up a simplified process; \n     states would choose whether to participate.\n       The bill is called, appropriately, the Marketplace Fairness \n     Act. It's time for Congress to approve this plan.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is a States rights argument. It is \nabout allowing States to close a loophole--a tax loophole. It is about \nstopping the subsidization of some taxpayers over other taxpayers, \nstopping the subsidization of some businesses over others. About the \nonly ones left complaining are the taxpayers and businesses that enjoy \nbeing subsidized by other taxpayers and other businesses, and that, in \nour opinion, is not the correct tax policy.\n  I am very pleased with the work of Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin. I \nwill conclude where I started. I think they have solved the problem. As \nmore Senators look at the fairness of the Marketplace Fairness Act and \nlook at the options it gives each State, I hope we will have more \ncosponsors. If I were running an online retailer in this country, I \nwould begin to make my plans to collect the sales taxes that are \nalready owed and return them to the States because States will have the \nright under this legislation to do it.\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\n  I thank the President and I yield the floor.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n     Department of State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, at some point we may bring up the State \nand Foreign Operations Subcommittee's appropriations bill. I understand \nthat several Senators on the other side have refused to allow the \nSenate to debate and vote on this bill, for one reason or another. That \nis unfortunate, because it provides the funding for many programs that \nhave critical importance to the Nation's security. Let me mention a \nfew:\n\n       It supports our counterterrorism strategy in South Asia, \n     the Horn of Africa, and the Far East. It responds to the \n     turbulent events in the Middle East and North Africa, and \n     threats on the Mexican border. It combats transnational \n     crime, piracy of intellectual property, and the denial of \n     fundamental freedoms. It promotes access for U.S. companies \n     to foreign markets. It provides the funds to operate and \n     secure our embassies and consulates that serve millions of \n     Americans while traveling, working and studying overseas. It \n     preserves U.S. influence in key international organizations \n     and alliances. And it responds to a massive famine in \n     Somalia, floods, and other humanitarian disasters.\n\n  We have to do this and much more with a budget allocation that is $6 \nbillion below the President's request.\n  I worry that ``foreign aid'' today is a term often maligned and \nmisunderstood. It is viewed by many as a form of charity, or a luxury \nwe can do without, or that it is a sizable part of the Federal budget. \nBut it is none of those things, as that list I just mentioned \nillustrates.\n  These have never been Democratic or Republican issues. The funds in \nthis bill determine whether the United States will remain the global \nleader it has been since the Second World War.\n  Six weeks ago, former President George W. Bush said:\n\n       One of the lessons of September 11th is that what happens \n     overseas matters here at home. . . . We face an enemy that \n     can only recruit when they find hopeless people, and there is \n     nothing more hopeless to a child who loses a mom or dad to \n     AIDS [than] to watch the wealthy nations of the world sit \n     back and do nothing.\n\n  Former President Bush is right.\n  In fact, his former Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, was equally \nblunt about the stakes involved. She said:\n\n       We don't have an option to retire, to take a sabbatical \n     from leadership in the international community and the world. \n     If we do, one of 2 things will happen. There will be chaos, \n     because without leadership there will be chaos in the \n     international community, and that is dangerous. But it's \n     quite possible, that if we don't lead, somebody else will. \n     And perhaps it will be someone who does not share our values \n     of compassion, the rights of the individual, of liberty, and \n     freedom.\n\n  I could not agree more, and I hope other Senators appreciate what is \nat stake. Just as past generations rallied to meet the formidable \nchallenges of the Great Depression, the Nazis, and the Cold War, we \nwill bear responsibility if we fail to meet the challenges of today.\n  I wonder if, in my parents' generation, this country had not rallied \nbehind President Truman and Secretary George Marshall, who had the \nMarshall plan, which to many people was very unpopular, whether we \nwould have given aid to countries we had just been at war with. What a \ndifferent world it would be today if we had not helped rebuild Europe \nor Japan.\n  It is no wonder that other countries--our allies and our \ncompetitors--are spending more each year to project their influence \naround the world and to compete in the global marketplace. Great \nBritain's conservative government is on a path to increase its \ninternational development assistance to .7 percent of its national \nbudget. You might say: Only .7 percent of its national budget? In the \nUnited States, it is .2 percent of our national budget.\n  Our leadership is being challenged unlike at any time since the Cold \nWar. In Latin America, which is a larger market for U.S. exports than \nany other region except the European Union, our share is shrinking \nwhile China's is growing. It is the same story everywhere.\n  There is simply no substitute for U.S. global leadership. The world \nis changing profoundly, and we cannot afford to retrench or succumb to \nisolationism.\n  The funding in the State, Foreign Operations bill enables us to \nengage with our allies, defeat our competitors, and deter our \nadversaries. It may be an attractive target for campaign speeches and \nbumper sticker politics, but without it we cannot meet the growing \nthreats to our struggling economy and our national security.\n  The bill that Senator Graham and I will, I hope, be able to bring to \nthe floor of this body, was reported by the Appropriations Committee on \na bipartisan vote of 28 to 2. It is $6 billion below the President's \nbudget request. It scales back many Department of State and U.S. Agency \nfor International Development operations and programs. It is going to \nforce significant reductions in planned expenditures. I wish it did \nnot, but I also agree that we have to control spending.\n  I doubt there is any Member of Congress from either party or either \nbody who does not care if the United States becomes a second or third \nrate power. I think all of us in Congress expect the United States to \nlead, to build alliances, to help American companies compete \nsuccessfully, and to protect the interests and security of our \ncitizens.\n  Yet there are unmistakable signs that our global influence is already \nwaning. It is not preordained that the United States will remain the \nworld's dominant power. As Former Secretary Rice said:\n\n       If we don't lead, somebody else will.\n\n  I think every one of us can imagine which countries that might be, \nand I shudder to think of some of them.\n  You cannot have it both ways. We cannot expect others to follow if we \ndo not lead. And we cannot lead if we do not pay our way.\n  We need to stop acting as though these investments do not matter; \nthat the State Department is not important; that we do not need the \nUnited Nations; that what happens in Brazil, Russia, the Philippines, \nSomalia, or other countries does not matter; and that the global \nthreats to the environment, public health, and safety will somehow be \nsolved by others.\n  Think of this: The most deadly, contagious diseases in the world are \nonly an airplane trip away from our shore.\n  This year's State, Foreign Operations bill, which was drafted in a \nbipartisan manner, balances our priorities. Funding for these programs \nwas requested by Republicans and Democrats. In fact, I the total number \nof requests we received from both parties dwarfed what Senator Graham \nand I had available to spend.\n  There are no earmarks in this bill. Because of the budget cuts, \nMembers on my side did not get close to everything they wanted, and \nneither did Members on Senator Graham's side.\n  But to anyone who thinks the 1 percent of the Federal budget we spend \non international diplomacy and development is too much, this bill will \nfreeze most embassy and consular operations, curtail programs, and in \nsome cases defer payments to international organizations that we are \nobligated by treaty to pay.\n  This country is at a crossroads. We can retreat from the world, as \nsome seem to want, while China and our other competitors continue to \nexpand their influence, or we can remain a leader. This Senator hopes \nwe will have the sense to choose the latter course.\n  I was barely a child at the end of World War II, but I watched as our \nsoldiers came home, and I saw America's influence grow. I saw it as a \nyoung student in college and in law school. I saw students who came to \nthis country to learn what we did--why?--they were inspired by America \nand wanted to learn from our example. I saw members of my family and \nfriends join the Peace Corps. And when I have traveled overseas since \nbecoming a Senator, I hear people say: Thank goodness America helped \nus. I hope my children and my grandchildren do not hear a different \nstory.\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\n  The funding in this bill, which is strongly supported by the \nDepartment of Defense, is, along with the U.S. military, the best form \nof insurance the American people have.\n  I want to thank Chairman Inouye and Senator Cochran for their support \nof the subcommittee's budget. And I want to thank Senator Graham, who \nis a highly informed and passionate advocate for U.S. global \nleadership. I appreciate his input and support, as I do the other \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee from both parties.\n  It is easy for us to stand up and speak about how we want America to \nbe No. 1. It is easy to sit on the sidelines and say you want to win \nthe New York marathon but you do not want to train for it. If we want \nto be No. 1, we have to earn it.\n  One thing that has united some of the great leaders of our country--\nboth Republicans and Democrats--is their desire to expand, in the most \npositive way, America's influence around the world, one, so we could \nhelp others, and two, because it protects us. If we get to this bill, I \nhope we will not find ourselves tangled in knots with sloganeering or \nspecial interest amendments, but, rather, debate it with only one \ninterest in mind: that of the United States of America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Close Up Foundation\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise to speak for just a few moments \non a very special anniversary that we are celebrating, not just here in \nWashington but around the country; that is, the 40th anniversary of the \nClose Up Foundation, familiar to us all.\n  It is a foundation that was started in 1971. Close Up has worked for \nfour decades to promote responsible and informed participation in the \ndemocratic process through Washington-based civic education programs \nand classroom publications. I had the pleasure myself of participating \nin one of the first ever Close Up programs back in 1972. So I \nparticipated in the second year when the program was in its fledgling \nstage.\n  Little did I believe then or know then that I would be a Member of \nthe Senate. But I can remember the tremendous impact that program had \non me at that age. It was the first time I had ever visited Washington, \nDC. I can tell you without the Close Up program, I probably would not \nhave made that trip until many years later. But it made a lasting \nimpression on me and I believe gave me some idea back then of a \npotential career in public service.\n  I am very proud to be an alum of this important program, and I am \ndelighted to help celebrate that later tonight at a reception for the \n40th anniversary, which is today.\n  Close Up's mission is to inform, educate, and inspire young people to \nbe active citizens in our democracy. Close Up seeks to create a \ngeneration of Americans that exercise their rights and accept the \nresponsibilities of citizenship.\n  Each year, Close Up serves thousands of high school and middle school \nstudents and their teachers on Washington-based government and \ncitizenship education programs. These programs demonstrate that an \nactive citizenry is necessary for the perpetuation of our democracy, \nand they provide students with the knowledge and skills to participate \nfirsthand--hands on, seeing is believing, being here in Washington, \nseeing the buildings, experiencing firsthand the ways of the Senate and \nthe House operating, seeing the Supreme Court in action leaves a \nlasting impression, believe me, on these students--since the 1970s.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in the pride that 750,000 students \nand teachers from across the country have participated in Close Up \nprograms. Participating students return to their schools and share with \ntheir classrooms, with their student bodies, what they learned and \nexperienced. So while we have had 750,000 students participate, we have \ndirectly touched millions of students and teachers and family members, \nas these students go back and relay very fine experiences.\n  Students who participate in Close Up Washington travel to our \nNation's Capital, usually for about 1 week, joining with their peers \nfrom all over the United States, to live and learn together during an \nintensive, inspiring, and skill-building program. The program is \ndesigned to enrich students' knowledge of the basic concepts and \ninstitutions of the Federal Government, an important part of our \ndemocracy, and to develop a practical understanding of the process of \nthe democratic political system and the role of citizens in this \nsystem, which is central, as the Chair knows.\n  To engage students, expert institutional staff use best practices and \nmethodologies, including role modeling, small group discussions, \nsimulations, and student-driven interaction with key policy experts. In \nother words, this is not just a tour of Washington, it is not just a \ntour of the building, it is an interactive, hands-on experience for \nyoung middle school and high school students to have a better \nunderstanding of how their government operates.\n  If we think about it, we know they understand by maybe reading the \npaper and talking to friends how their local government operates. They \nget a sense of how their State governments operate. Without a real \nopportunity to visit the Nation's Capital, which many of these students \nmight not have, how will they get a feel for what goes on here, which \nis very important.\n  Each year the Close Up Washington program participants engage in \n1,000 meetings with Members of Congress and their staffs on Capitol \nHill. Our Capital's institutions and historic sites are used as \nclassrooms to help students explore the link between history and \ncontemporary political issues. It brings it alive to them. It makes it \nreal for them. That is why it is so important for us to continue this \nprogram.\n  Students also learn and practice the habits of active, effective \ncitizenship with an intense emphasis on civil discourse. One of the \nmost important and commendable aspects of the Close Up program is its \naccessibility to economically disadvantaged students. I wish to take a \nminute to stress this. There are many programs that are sponsored \ndirectly or indirectly by the Federal Government that allow students to \ncome to Washington. Then, of course, there are many privately funded \nactivities.\n  But this is the only Federal program that I know of that reaches out \nin a special way to students that would be unable to come under any \nother circumstances, they just could not afford it. Their families \ncannot afford it, and so it would be out of reach for many of them. \nThat is what is so important about Close Up.\n  The other important aspect, it is not just for the kids in the class \nwho are 4.0 students. Many students come on academic scholarships or \nthey are chosen because of their academic prowess. This is for the \naverage kid, as well as those who are achieving academically. But it is \nfor the average kid, the kid whom we depend on to be our citizen for \nthe future.\n  So because of that, it is especially important for us to continue \nthis opportunity. Close Up provides a diverse program experience for \nits participants and has provided over $100 million in fellowship \nassistance to students and teachers from underserved communities \nthrough public funding and a committed network of corporate and \nphilanthropic donors. So to the Federal money that serves as its base, \nwe get additional support from individuals and from foundations to \nleverage that resource, to provide an opportunity for kids who would \nnever be able to see with their own eyes the Capitol or the White \nHouse, would never be able to walk into the Supreme Court, to actually \nsee it and touch it and to experience it.\n  If it sparks an interest in one-fourth of the children who come, that \nwould be great. But I think it sparks an interest in almost 100 percent \nof them in some way. When they leave, they are forever changed in a \npositive way and can become active participants in this democracy.\n  So at a time when students throughout the United States show an \nalarming lack of proficiency in civics, as\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\ndemonstrated by the recent results of the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress testing of 4th, 8th, and 12th graders, Close Up \ncontinues to work to engage young people so they understand the \npolitical process, find their own voice, and they embrace the rights \nand responsibilities of citizenship, which is indeed a gift, and they \nlearn to appreciate that gift and to participate more fully in this \ndemocracy.\n  I commend and congratulate Close Up for 40 years of excellent \nservice. I hope it will continue for another 40 years. I am proud to be \na strong supporter of the Close Up program. I urge my colleagues, as we \nhave an opportunity, to support the funding for this program, even in \nthese tough budgetary times.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Iran's Growing Nuclear Threat\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we have been seized with obviously pressing \nissues and emergencies, and I fear we have not been paying enough \nattention to the issue of Iran and the growing nuclear threat posed by \nthat country. The recent release of the report by the International \nAtomic Energy Commission has returned the Iran nuclear issue to the \nfront pages and, hopefully, to the top of our list of priority issues \nthat need to be discussed and need to be evaluated.\n  The IAEA nuclear watchdog, which I visited last March with a group of \nMembers of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, has never been \nan instrument of U.S. policy. In fact, it has often offered \nperspectives contrary to America's views or preferences and has \nrigorously defended its objectivity independent of individual \ngovernments. Therefore, I think this latest report has all the more \nweight that we should give serious consideration to. This objective \norganization of nuclear experts has had unrivaled access to information \nand sources within Iran. It has stripped away the veneer of ambiguity \nand uncertainty about Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons.\n  Iran is after the bomb, and we all know it. We can see the proof in \nthis IAEA report, including compelling detail about Iran amassing \nfissile material, designing explosive trigger devices, and developing \ndelivery systems. The report details the way in which Iran has \nrelentlessly pursued this objective over the years and from whom it has \nobtained assistance.\n  The report also shows our own intelligence community's official \nestimate in 2007 that Iran had suspended these activities in 2003 was \nwrong. The activities to design nuclear weapons soon resumed and are \ncontinuing.\n  Ironically, it seems efforts to slow down or halt nuclear weapons \ndevelopment through sanctions or even through computer viruses have \nonly had minimal or temporary effect. Many have been unwisely comforted \nby such delays and, therefore, have been less focused and less \ndetermined to find real solutions to this mortal security threat.\n  Also, we have been mistakenly reassured by the contention that Iran \nhas not yet made the political decision to actually assemble nuclear \nweapons. This could potentially be one of the most dangerous \nconclusions of all. As I have repeatedly said from this floor and \nduring my tenure at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nuclear weapons-\ncapable Iran is nearly as dangerous as a nuclear-armed Iran. An Iran \nthat has spent years secretly pursuing--and now we know successfully--\nthe technologies, the expertise, and materials required to create \nnuclear weapons is a threat to the United States and to the world.\n  Facing this imminent danger now, with ample verification from the \nIAEA that our anxieties are well-founded, is absolutely essential. It \nis no longer possible to avoid the hard choices or defer to the \nadministration's decisions. In my opinion, there are only three ways we \ncan respond to this threat: We can accept the inevitability of a \nnuclear Iran and learn to live with it--to tolerate and try to contain \nthis new Iranian power; secondly, we can reluctantly take up the \nmilitary option to remove the threat--an option three Presidents have \nconfirmed has always been on the table; or, third, we can dramatically \nescalate the sanctions regimes to force Iranian compliance with our \ncollective international will.\n  The first option--tolerating a nuclear weapons-capable Iran--is not \nacceptable. As I said, three previous U.S. Presidents have \nunequivocally stated this. A nuclear-armed Iran would threaten the \nentire region and its enormous energy resources, motivate broad nuclear \nproliferation throughout the Middle East, further destabilize a region \nalready in turmoil, encourage radicalism and terrorism, and threaten \nthe destruction of the State of Israel.\n  This last danger alone--to which Israel, as a last resort, would most \ncertainly respond to ensure its survival--compels us to be clear-eyed \nand determined to find a viable solution. Toleration, I would suggest, \nis not a solution.\n  The second option--military action, while always posed as a last \nresort following the failure of all other efforts--must, in my opinion, \nremain on the table. Our Nation and the international community as a \nwhole must see with vivid clarity what measures remain should our other \nefforts continue to fail. The Iranian regime must be \nespecially nondelusional about those potential consequences, should it \nnot change its behavior. Indeed, to make all our efforts to find a \nsolution credible, the military option itself must be entirely \nbelievable.\n\n  It is also essential to note that military options are not ours \nalone. There is broad, open discussion now in Israel and elsewhere \nabout whether Israel itself should act to remove this threat to the \nsurvival of their state. This also must be part of our own policy \ncalculation.\n  As former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a television \ninterview this weekend: ``I don't have any doubt that the Israelis will \ndefend themselves if the Iranians look as if they really are about to \ncross that nuclear threshold.''\n  If there is any remaining doubt the United States should not tolerate \na nuclear Iran, I think we can assume Israel may not.\n  It is exactly to avoid this violent option that we must renew all our \nefforts at finding other ways to force the Iranian regime to change its \nbehavior, and that includes compelling persuasion to convince our \nfriends and allies--and China and Russia as well--that united efforts \nare essential.\n  We need a new dramatically tougher sanctions regime, and we need it \nnow. If we don't impose it now, it may very well be too late.\n  I say this with some real reservations about whether any new \nsanctions can persuade the Iranian regime to change its policy. If we \ntruly believe a nuclear weapons-capable Iran is unacceptable, then the \nonly logical response is to at least prepare for a strike and send the \nsignal that the United States is prepared to act on what has been \ndeemed by, as I said, three Presidents as unacceptable.\n  I think it is contrary to U.S. interests to try to outsource this \ntask to the State of Israel, but I also think the long-term danger is \nfar greater than the serious but shorter term negative consequences of \na strike.\n  Having said that, this force option needs to be carefully considered, \nand I think we need to continue whatever efforts we can make to prevent \nus from having to ultimately choose that as our only option.\n  So I am suggesting a new, dramatically tougher sanctions regime. It \nis going to have to be imposed very quickly. Publicly released \ninformation clearly indicates that Iran is much closer to nuclear \nweapons capability than previously acknowledged. We must use the full \nfocused power of our diplomatic instrument not to persuade Iran--that \nhas clearly been a total failure to date--but to persuade other nations \nthat immediate, tough, new international sanctions are the only way to \nprevent us from having to go to an option which none of us wishes to go \nto.\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\n  We must convince other reluctant nations to make different \ncalculations about their own self-interest in this matter. If other \nNations, including China and Russia, come to realize that a nuclear \nIran truly will not be tolerated and that new developments bring us \ncloser to a military solution and its unforeseeable consequences, then \nthey will hopefully come to different conclusions about how their own \ninterests can best be served.\n  Our allies and friends, once they come to accept the reality of our \nfirm determination to neither tolerate a nuclear Iran nor remove the \nmilitary option, will increase their own commitment to the sorts of \nsanctions regime that are now essential. This in turn will show the \nIranian regime at last that they face a truly united, truly formidable, \nand genuinely firm coalition entirely devoted to preventing them from \nhaving nuclear weapons at their disposal. Only then will we have a \nchance to force the regime to change its behavior.\n  So far, as I said, sanctions are simply not achieving the desired \nresult. Those who point to their modest effect actually harm the \nbroader effort, because those effects deflect our determination to \nforce a real change in Iranian behavior. Sanctions may have reduced \nIranian GDP by one or two percentage points and may have forced the \nregime to find creative ways to avoid them. For example, I understand \nthat as official banks have been subject to sanctions, many banks have \nmiraculously privatized.\n  There is absolutely no evidence anywhere that these sanctions have \nactually forced the regime to change its behavior regarding its nuclear \nambitions. And now we learn from the IAEA report that these sanctions \nhave also not been serious obstacles to the technological, commercial, \nand scientific activities focused on acquiring nuclear weapons \ncapability. We simply must do much more, and we must do it now.\n  I am cosponsor of a bill, S. 1048, which is intended to further \ntighten the noose on the Iranian regime. I will continue to support \nthose measures. But in light of this new information from the IAEA, I \nam in favor of even greater sanctions pressure. I have signed a letter \nto the President calling on him to use his prerogatives to impose \nsanctions on the Iranian central bank. Many have opposed that option \nbecause it could constrict global energy supplies, increase oil prices, \nand would be ineffective if not supported by other nations. According \nto media reports, the administration itself decided just days before \nthe release of this IAEA report to take central bank sanctions off the \ntable for these reasons. This was, I believe, a serious mistake and \nthose judgments, I suggest, should be reconsidered.\n  When the reality of this imminent threat to global security is clear, \nwhen all nations reflect on the consequences of military action against \nIran, and when a well-designed comprehensive new sanctions regime with \nreal teeth is presented to them, we will have the determined coalition \nwe need to avert the disastrous consequences of our failure to prevent \nthe unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as I understand the current situation, \nwe do not know whether we are on three bills or one bill. That is up to \nthe leadership. Senator Alexander and I have worked on the Energy and \nWater bill. We are very hopeful we can move this bill. It was unanimous \nin the subcommittee on Appropriations. There was only one dissent in \nthe full committee--which is one of the largest committees in the \nSenate, in the Appropriations Committee. It is a significant bill. We \nbelieve we should move it as quickly as we possibly can. We have been \ntalking. Obviously we are waiting to hear from the leadership. We are \nhopeful that once we hear we can move very quickly to get this bill \npassed by this body.\n  It has been a great pleasure for me to work with Senator Alexander. I \nknow he has some comments he wishes to make at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As she usually does, the Senator from California said \ndirectly what the situation is. We on the Republican side understand \nthat the majority leader has some important business he has to make \nsure the Senate finishes this week. We, as would many Democrats, want \nus to get to the Defense authorization bill before we go home. Senator \nReid wishes to do that. We respect that and we agree with that.\n  Senator Reid wishes to make sure we have a chance to deal with the \nconference report that the House is expected to pass on Thursday, which \ncontains a continuing resolution to fund the government to mid-\nDecember. We understand that as well.\n  That gives us a little time here, a day or two, to consider the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill that Senator Feinstein has \ndescribed. It has broad consensus here in the Senate. It has no \nmandatory spending in it. It has an important defense component--\nnuclear weapons nonproliferation. It has a great many nondefense items \nthat are important to the growth of our country. It seems on the \nRepublican side--I can speak for that--there is broad consensus. At \nSenator Reid's request I checked with many of our Republican Senators, \nasked them how many amendments they have and whether they thought they \ncould bring them to the floor today or tomorrow morning so we could \ndeal with them tomorrow, at the latest Thursday morning. So far the \nnews has been encouraging. There have not been that many amendments and \nall the Senators with whom I have talked have said if they have \namendments they believe there is no reason why, as long as they are \ngiven a short period of time to talk and a chance to vote on them--and \nthey are germane, of course; they will have to be germane to fit with \nthe rules of the Senate--they will be fine with that.\n  We are going to be checking tonight with all Republican offices. We \ndo not want to encourage any more amendments but we want to know about \nthem if there are any so I can go to Senator Feinstein and Senator Reid \nand say here are the amendments the Republican Senators want to offer, \nwe are ready to go, we can deal with it tomorrow and Thursday and \nhopefully we will be able to do our basic work. Our basic work is to do \nappropriations work in this body. That is our constitutional \nresponsibility.\n  So I thank Senator Feinstein for the way she approaches this. I \nunderstand where the majority leader is, and so far, I am encouraged. I \nwill gather information. I will make my report to you and Senator Reid, \nand then we will see where you want to go.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me thank the distinguished ranking member for \nthose comments, and I believe we are in agreement. What is sauce for \nthe goose is sauce for the gander. I would hope any Democratic \namendments could come in just as quickly as possible, and we think we \nhave a good bill. Hopefully there will not be many. I agree with what \nthe Senator said about the Defense bill. We have a CR, and we really \nneed to get cracking. Time is of the essence.\n  We have been sitting here for a couple of hours waiting for \namendments. There have been none thus far, and I think the word is out: \nNow is the time. Please, Members, if you have amendments, please file \nthem. We have had one amendment just filed on the Republican side and \nknow of a couple of others, but that is about it at this stage.\n  Let me thank the ranking member. I guess we just sit here and wait.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Alexander are working very hard to\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\ncome up with an agreement that we can move forward with on the Energy \nand Water bill. I am terribly disappointed we weren't able to do the \nso-called minibus, consisting of three appropriations bills, as we did \na couple weeks ago. It is too bad, unfortunate, that we were not able \nto do so, but an objection was raised that caused us not to be able to \ndo that. They have not been able to reach an agreement tonight, so we \nwill continue working and, hopefully, tomorrow something good will \nhappen.\n  It is my understanding the Republicans have run a hotline with their \nMembers to see if they can reduce the number of amendments on the \nEnergy and Water bill. Remember, we can't legislate on an \nappropriations bill, and it has to be germane, so at least we have \nthose restrictions.\n  I would also say that while my friends on the Republican side are \nworking through amendments--if, in fact, there is an agreement--there \nare Democrats who also want to offer amendments, so it is not going to \nbe just amendments offered by Republicans. If, in fact, we can work \nsomething out, Democrats also wish to offer amendments. So I hope, and \nI am cautiously optimistic, that the two fine Senators can work through \nthis morass we have and move forward. I sure hope we can do that.\n  We are not going to spend a lot of time on this. We wasted most of \nthe day on procedural issues relating to this. But Thanksgiving is fast \napproaching. We have a lot of stuff to do other than this Energy and \nWater appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        American Education Week\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. This week marks the 90th anniversary of American \nEducation Week where we honor our teachers, education support \nprofessionals, parents, and substitute teachers for their dedication \nand service to our children and to our schools.\n  My mother was a high school English teacher. Born in Mansfield, GA, a \ntown of about 500 people, she taught in the era of segregation in \ncentral Florida. Raising my two older brothers and me in Mansfield, OH, \nshe taught in an era of a growing American middle class. As have \nteachers throughout our history, she taught her students and her sons \nthat education is the gateway to opportunity, that it can integrate a \ndivided and segregated Nation and, in the process, create a more \nprosperous nation.\n  When our Nation needs our teachers the most--at a time when our \neconomy needs our schools to succeed--we must remind ourselves of the \nimportance of educators. I would add that the Presiding Officer is \nknown in this body as one of the premier educators in our country, \nbefore he came to the Senate, as superintendent of the Denver schools.\n  Unfortunately, many of our educators are working in substandard \nschool buildings with leaky roofs and poor air quality and \nmalfunctioning HVAC systems. The average U.S. public school building is \n40 years old--obviously, many are much older--impairing teacher \neffectiveness and student achievement. In Ohio, thanks to former \nGovernor Taft, who, in part, was able to renovate a large number of our \nschool buildings about a decade ago, has made a significant difference. \nBut school buildings in my State, as they are across the country, are \nstill too often old, decayed and much less efficient and often \ncompromise teacher and student morale and teacher effectiveness. \nConservative estimates suggest it would cost some $270 billion to make \nmuch needed maintenance and repairs for schools.\n  That is why I introduced the Fix America's Schools Today Act--the \nFAST Act--which would invest some $30 billion to repair and modernize \nour Nation's school facilities. The FAST Act would invest in States and \nlocal school districts to help them make critical repairs to existing \nfacilities or to supplement their current maintenance efforts.\n  Modernizing our schools can save $100,000 a year in maintenance \ncosts--enough for two new teachers or 200 more computers or 5,000 \ntextbooks.\n  The FAST Act would focus on areas of need--school districts with high \npercentages of poor children and schools with the greatest need for \nrepair and renovation.\n  Modernizing schools can improve the academic experience for students. \nIn September, I spoke with principals from across Ohio who discussed \nhow the quality of their school facilities affected their students and \ntheir teachers. This is pretty interesting. I heard from the former \nprincipal at a high school near Zanesville, a city in eastern Ohio, who \ndescribed a student's reaction following the renovation of their \nschool. This was a generally low-income, an Appalachian area of Ohio. \nStudents were used to going to schools that were substandard--not in \nterms of teacher quality but in terms of the facility itself. We preach \nto our young people that education matters more than anything else in \nour society, and then we send students to physically substandard \nschools. But this student's reaction, after the renovation of the \nschool: ``I felt rich,'' he said, because he was going to school now in \na renovated, modern, high-tech environment, something he had never seen \ngrowing up in Appalachia, Ohio, as a kid whose parents didn't make a \nlot of money.\n  Improving school facilities, of course, though, is more than just \nabout student morale. Research has proven the rates of absenteeism \ndecline and test scores improve in a more modern school facility. It is \nalso about teacher effectiveness. According to a study conducted by the \nDepartment of Education, 47 percent of schools indicated the condition \nof their permanent facilities interferes with the delivery of \ninstruction. The condition of the school interferes with the delivery \nof instruction. This is problematic. Some 70 percent of students are \nforced to learn in facilities that have at least one significant--\nsometimes more than that--inadequate building feature, such as an \noutdated heating and air-conditioning system, a leaky roof, a plumbing \nproblem. Some 57 percent of students are learning in a school with at \nleast one unsatisfactory environmental condition, such as poor indoor \nair quality, poor acoustics or heating and lighting challenges.\n  These substandard conditions can also harm the health and well-being \nof teachers and support professionals. Last week, I hosted a national \ncall with advocates to discuss this legislation and discuss the impact \nsubstandard schools have on students and faculties and parents. One of \nthe participants shared with me her personal experience as a special ed \nteacher. It is a story I imagine many of my colleagues have heard \nbefore and can be found anywhere in our country.\n  Joellen spent 9 years of her 23-year teaching career in an elementary \nschool in Fairfield, CT, with severe mold contamination. Poor air \nquality in the school forced her into an early retirement by \ncompromising her health and her well-being. Because of these poor \nworking conditions, Joellen has lost 50 percent of her lung function \nand is currently dependent on an oxygen tank. She is not the only one \naffected by these conditions. Eighty-five of her colleagues are also \nbattling health conditions as a result of an unhealthy school \nenvironment.\n\n  It is unacceptable that our failure to act undermines student \nachievement and teacher effectiveness and the health and the well-being \nof our entire school communities. It is even more disturbing that our \nschools go unrepaired when there are thousands of workers ready and \nwilling to modernize our schools. The FAST Act, by employing people to \nrepair our aging schools, would create good-paying, middle-class jobs.\n  We know we have to fix our schools. We know we have to do this \nrenovation. We know as a nation, when we put real attention into \ninfrastructure, the dividends it paid for generations were significant. \nThe United States, in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, led the world \nin infrastructure. Whether it was school repairs, the building of \ncommunity colleges, water and sewer systems, highways and bridges, \nports and locks or medical research, we were the envy of the world in \nour infrastructure, and it set the foundation for decades of \nprosperity. Unfortunately, as this Congress has been more interested in \ntax cuts for the rich and less interested in\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\ninvestment in medical research, in education, in health care \nfacilities, in transportation, we have declined economically as a \nnation. The middle class is under fire. We are not able to build and \nproduce the way we could have if we had kept this infrastructure up to \ndate.\n  That is the importance of the FAST Act. It is the importance of much \nof the rest of the jobs bills we have pushed in this Congress. We know \nthat every $1 billion in school renovation can create 10,000 jobs.\n  The FAST Act includes strong ``Buy American'' provisions to ensure \nthat Ohio construction workers, for instance--we are the third leading \nmanufacturing State in the country, exceeded only by Texas, twice the \nsize of California--three times the size--building technicians, boiler \nrepairmen, roofers, painters, electricians, and people who manufacture \nthese products are using American-made products.\n  The FAST Act is included in President Obama's American Jobs Act. \nUnder his proposal, Ohio would receive some $985 million in funding for \nK-12 schools and an additional $148 million for Ohio's community \ncolleges. Ohio has one of the best community college networks in the \ncountry.\n  It is obvious our schools need fixing. Our workers need work. \nInterest rates are low. Construction companies want to put people to \nwork and, competing with each other, will bid as low as they likely \nwill in the next decade or two, so now is the time to do this.\n  This bill has been endorsed by some 50 organizations: the American \nAssociation of School Administrators, the American Federation of \nTeachers, the National Education Association, the Building & \nConstruction Trades, First Focus Campaign for Children, and the Parent \nTeacher Association, the PTA. They agree it is about jobs, about \neducation, and our Nation's future. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis commonsense legislation.\n  Lastly, I wish to read a couple letters I received about this \nlegislation. First is Jeannine from Strongsville, OH. She is a teacher:\n\n       I have taught at the same middle school for 24 years. \n     During that time, I have watched our building physically \n     deteriorate before my eyes.\n\n  Strongsville is what we would call, by most measurements, one of \nCleveland's more affluent suburbs. Nonetheless, she has seen it \nphysically deteriorate in 24 years of teaching.\n\n       The leaky roof leaves stains on the ceilings and the \n     floors. Often the heating doesn't work.\n       Two years ago, my classroom had no heat in December. We are \n     a suburb of Cleveland, so do I need to tell you how cold it \n     was in there?\n       After more than two decades with no money for paint, our \n     vice principal asked Home Depot for help--it donated enough \n     paint to spruce up the hallways, offices, and a handful of \n     classrooms.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       Does it sound like I teach in the inner-city or an extreme \n     rural area in Ohio?\n\n  She doesn't. She teaches in what we would call an affluent suburb of \nCleveland.\n\n       I teach in a suburban community where many of the houses \n     sell for around $300,000 or more. But the community has not \n     passed a levy in a while.\n       I pay 20% toward my health insurance . . .\n\n  My colleagues may remember that Governor Kasich had just pushed \nthrough a bill to take away collective bargaining rights for people \nsuch as Jeannine, saying they should be paying more of their health \ncare. They have already made those concessions at the bargaining table. \nThat is why Jeannine says she pays 20 percent toward her health \ninsurance. She says:\n\n       10% toward my retirement, and [I] have not seen a pay \n     increase in years.\n       I really love what I do, but am despondent at times about \n     the lack of community support for education.\n\n  That is a whole other issue. But we do know we can make a difference \nin making not just Jeannine's life better--that is a goal we should \nshare--but, most importantly, making teacher morale, student morale, \nteacher effectiveness, and student learning significantly better.\n  The last letter I will share is from Erin from Columbus, OH. She is a \nspecial ed teacher. She writes:\n\n       Of our 14 schools, 5 are currently undergoing the last of a \n     2 year renovation project.\n       We had schools where walls were literally falling in, we \n     were in urgent need of these repairs.\n       Now, we find ourselves lacking in technology, and are in \n     need of updating these needs, in order to compete with the \n     ever changing needs of the demands of the workplace that our \n     students will be entering.\n       Investments in education such as targeted resources for \n     school and campus repair and modernization will jump start \n     the economy and ensure students the learning environments so \n     essential to their success.\n       Our student day is now shorter, all in an effort to save \n     money.\n\n  Think about this: They are making the schoolday shorter when we are \ntalking, in the paragraph before in her letter, about: How do we \ncompete internationally? We are going to make our schoolday shorter \nwhen already we go to school--I think the former Denver school \nsuperintendent, the Presiding Officer, would confirm this--fewer days \nthan many of our economic competitors. So because of costs, because we \nneed to continue to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry, we cannot fund the kinds of things we want to fund in \neducation to compete internationally.\n  In the end, Erin writes:\n\n       It's the students that lose, and our educators know this, \n     and [we all] strive each and every day to reach every single \n     student, with the ever increasing demands put upon them.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       The FAST Act will make sure that our students have the \n     learning environments they need and deserve.\n\n  My words may have, I hope, convinced some of my colleagues. I hope \nthe words, the two letters from Jeannine and Erin--Jeannine from a \nCleveland suburb; Erin, a central Ohio teacher, both with long \nexperience in the classroom--I hope their words were compelling enough \nso my colleagues will join me in supporting the FAST Act, getting it \nthrough the Senate--not filibustering it. Let's debate it, talk about \nit, vote on it up or down, and send it to the House. I hope we get it \nto the President by the end of the year so we can start putting people \nback to work doing the school renovation, putting our factory workers \nback to work making the windows and cement and brick and all we need in \nschool construction and school renovation and making a difference for \nour students in the decades ahead.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 199\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation for \nthe passage of S. Res. 199 by unanimous consent last night. This \nresolution supports the goals and ideals of Crohn's and Colitis \nAwareness Week.\n  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, known collectively as \ninflammatory bowel disease, are chronic disorders of the \ngastrointestinal tract which afflict approximately 1.4 million \nAmericans, 30 percent of whom are diagnosed in their childhood years. \nIBD can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, and intestinal bleeding. \nComplications related to IBD can include: arthritis, osteoporosis, \nanemia, liver disease, growth and developmental challenges, and \ncolorectal cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease is being diagnosed with \nincreased frequency in children and can be especially devastating for \nthese young patients and their families.\n  Despite the prevalence of IBD, a lack of awareness among both the \ngeneral public and health professionals may contribute to the \nmisdiagnosis and mismanagement of Crohn's disease and ulcerative \ncolitis. S. Res. 199 will support efforts to increase awareness and \neducation about these illnesses. It will also recognize the individuals \nand families who must contend with IBD as part of their daily lives, as \nwell as the health care professionals who care for\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nCrohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients and the biomedical \nresearchers who work to advance research aimed at the development of \nnew treatments and a cure for these illnesses. The passage of this \nresolution will give hope to millions of Americans struggling with \nCrohn's disease and ulcerative colitis--particularly young children--\nthat we will continue to focus our attention on these very difficult \nconditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7445-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7445-S7446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. ELDRED MUSGROVE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute \nto a very fine Kentuckian and World War II veteran, Mr. Eldred Musgrove \nof McCreary County, KY. Eldred, who is now 91, has played an \ninstrumental role in developing many of the basic services that are \ncurrently enjoyed by the citizens of McCreary County, KY.\n  Eldred was raised in Strunk, KY, in a house just behind the old Lum \nStrunk homeplace. As a teenager, he became familiar with responsibility \nand hard work. The oldest of six, by the time he was 14, Eldred \nremembers having to help raise his brothers and sisters after their \nmother passed away. He recalls carrying his 3-year-old baby brother to \nhis grandmother's each morning and returning each afternoon to pick him \nup, before walking a mile himself just to get to school each day.\n  ``When I was 16, I worked my first `real' job,'' Eldred explains. At \nthe time, ex-county sheriff Neil Stephens owned a sawmill that was \nlocated up above the Marsh Creek Schoolhouse. ``He paid me 10 cents an \nhour to roll logs down for him to saw,'' Eldred says. As a result, \nEldred developed a resilient worth ethic, which would eventually help \npave the way to a long and successful career in community service.\n  Eldred met Sophie, who is 90 years old and his wife of 64 years, \nwhile they attended school together at Pine Knot as kids. ``I didn't \npay any attention to her when we were in school!'' he recalls. After he \nreturned home from the military, though, Eldred got a job working at \nthe Ford garage in Stearns and began to see Sophie as he drove home \nfrom work each day. They began dating and have been happily married \never since.\n  Not long after they wed, Eldred began taking a more active role in \nthe community. ``I became a charter member of the Pine Knot Kiwanis \nClub in 1950,'' he remembers. Eldred and the organization were very \nactive for several years, selling stock, helping to establish the \ncounty's first dial-telephone company, and even playing an instrumental \nrole in helping to build the first Pine Knot fire truck. In 1967, \nEldred helped form the McCreary County Fire Commission and served as \nthe board chairman for the South McCreary County Fire Department for \nmany years.\n  Eldred also served as one of three original water commissioners for \nthe McCreary County Water District. Eldred presided over the Pine Knot \nportion of the district he helped create. In his later years, he became \ninvolved with the McCreary County Development Association, and also \nserved as a member of McCreary County's first airport board, where he \nhelped develop a local runway. Additionally, Eldred has also been a \nmember of the McCreary County Industrial Development Association, the \nfirst Stearns Museum Board, and the Kentucky Highlands Investment \nCorporation for 31 years.\n  These days, the Musgrove home is decorated with countless \nphotographs, certificates, and awards including a picture of Eldred \nshaking President Bill Clinton's hand that serve as a reminder of Mr. \nMusgrove's many successes and achievements throughout the years. \nHowever, Eldred admits that he is not yet finished. ``I still have a \njob to do. My job may be taking care of my wife, writing letters to \ncongressmen, or erecting a monument. All I know is that I still have a \njob to do.''\n  Mr. President, Mr. Eldred Musgrove's long life of selflessness and \nservice to McCreary County and his fellow Kentuckians is truly \nadmirable. Mr. Musgrove is a true American patriot and an inspiration \nto the people of our great Commonwealth. A local newspaper, the \nMcCreary County Voice, published an article on October 20, 2011, to \ncelebrate Mr. Musgrove's many accomplishments in life. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the McCreary County Voice, Oct. 20, 2011]\n\n                          Making a Difference\n\n                           (By Eugenia Jones)\n\n       You may or may not be personally acquainted with Eldred \n     Musgrove, but if you are a resident of McCreary County, the \n     energetic 91-year-old probably touches your life on a daily \n     basis. Not only did he serve his country in World War II, but \n     Musgrove, throughout his life, has been instrumental in the \n     development of many of the basic services currently enjoyed \n     by citizens of the county.\n       Growing up in Strunk, Kentucky, in a house just behind the \n     old Lum Strunk homeplace, Eldred probably did not see himself \n     becoming such a civic-minded adult. At the age of 14 and as \n     the oldest of six children, Eldred helped to take care of his \n     brothers and sisters when his mother died. He recalls walking \n     more than a mile to school each day because there were no \n     school buses. On his way to school, Eldred would carry his \n     three-year-old baby brother to his grandmother's house and \n     then return on his way back home from school to carry the \n     toddler home. Eldred grins, ``I've never had a chance to \n     study, but I still managed to make Cs throughout school. When \n     I got home, instead of studying, I had to take care of the \n     stove wood. My dad was rather thrifty, but he managed to take \n     care of us. Dad worked some in coal, and later, he went \n     together with his brother and bought a 1933 model Chevrolet \n     truck to haul stone for building schools through the WPA. Dad \n     was also good at making moonshine stills and made them for \n     everybody around. He had customers from as far away as \n     Lexington and Cincinnati. I wanted to go into the CCC, but \n     dad wouldn't let me.''\n       As a teenager, Eldred was not afraid of hard work. When he \n     was 12 years old, Musgrove sold ``Grit'' newspapers to people \n     all over the southern end of the county. Musgrove shares his \n     memories of one special customer. ``I remember one customer \n     in particular. His name was Andy Galimore. He was a Spanish-\n     American War veteran. He lived up on a ridge across the \n     railroad at Pine Knot. He had a vineyard, and he would let me \n     pick all the grapes that I wanted. Andy Galimore must have \n     been a secretary or something like that for his unit, because \n     he had a roster of names that he let me see. The roster \n     listed the names of men and told different types of \n     information about them. It told when the men were absent, \n     when they were promoted, and all of the different things they \n     did in the service.''\n       ``When I was 16, I worked my first `real' job. I worked for \n     Neil Stephens, who was an ex-county sheriff living on Cal \n     Hill. His sawmill was up above the Marsh Creek Schoolhouse. \n     He paid me 10 cents an hour to roll logs down for him to saw. \n     The mill used a steam boiler, and they had to get up steam in \n     order to saw. I also carried drinking water. I didn't get \n     money for pay. I got a slip to take to Manuel Creedmoor's \n     (O.K.'s) store to buy things. I bought school clothes.''\n       Eldred met the now 90-year-old Sophie, his wife of 64 \n     years, while they attended the Pine Knot School together. He \n     laughs, ``I didn't pay any attention to her when we were in \n     school! When I came back home from the military, I got a job \n     at the Ford garage in Stearns. She walked home from where she \n     worked, and I drove home from my work in an old pickup truck. \n     We started meeting. I'd toot the horn and wave at her. \n     Finally, I asked her to go to the show with me. We went from \n     there by going out to a show together and ended up where we \n     are now by being married for 64 years! I don't remember the \n     name of the show, but I do remember going to pick her up one \n     time. There was a store sitting up on the corner of the road \n     going to her house. There was a big long bench outside. The \n     road to Sophie's house was so bad that I couldn't drive out \n     it so she would meet me at the store. One time I was sitting \n     on the bench waiting on her and another fellow was sitting \n     there talking to me. He said he had a date with a ``Meadows'' \n     girl. I said, `Well, I do too!' It wasn't long before Sophie \n     showed up with her sister as a date for the other fellow!''\n       After Eldred and Sophie married, Eldred began taking an \n     active role in trying to serve his community. He remembers \n     the influence of the Kiwanis Club during the early \n     development of the county. ``I became a charter member of the \n     Pine Knot Kiwanis Club in 1950. The club was very active for \n     a few years. Pine Knot, at that time, had only 12 telephones \n     on two party lines. The Kiwanis Club started selling stock \n     and formed the first dial-telephone company in the county. \n     The company had 128 customers and was doing well. However, we \n     couldn't afford a full-time maintenance man. When the \n     Highland Telephone Company offered 150 percent on our stock, \n     we ended up selling out to them. We made sure that we sold \n     under the condition that we would get free service all across \n     McCreary County and in Scotty County. I remember some of the \n     board members when the phones were with the Kiwanis. I was on \n     the board, as well as Leon Hayes, Gorman Strunk, Harold \n     Hickman, Smith Ross, Autis Ross, and Ralph Chaney.''\n       The Kiwanis were also instrumental in helping to build the \n     first Pine Knot fire\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\n     truck. Musgrove can remember when Clarence Harmon picked up a \n     pump and gave it to the Kiwanis to use. ``We kept it up at \n     the service station, and it froze and burst. I only remember \n     us putting out one fire with it and that was in a cabin down \n     at the Shell Grove. Later, when Bob Anderson was county \n     judge-executive, there was a salesman with two fire trucks \n     for sale. Bob appointed me and Bon L. Bybee to check on the \n     trucks. Tweedy Hatfield helped too. In 1967, with the help of \n     Mr. Wright from the Bank of McCreary County, we ended up \n     forming the McCreary County Fire Commission and bought a \n     truck for Pine Knot and one for Whitley City. I was the board \n     chairman for the South McCreary County Fire Department for \n     many years. During that time, we built the sub-station at \n     Holy Hill.''\n       Musgrove also played a role in the initial development of \n     the McCreary County Water District. Judge-Executive Prince \n     Stephens appointed Musgrove, Bill Gilreath, and Alfred Kidd \n     as water commissioners for the Pine Knot/Revelo area. ``We \n     brought engineers out of Tennessee to help build a water \n     district,'' Musgrove recalls. ``They did a study of the \n     county and recommended that we join together with the Whitley \n     City Water District. Whitley hadn't done much, so we decided \n     to eliminate the two districts and form one new McCreary \n     County Water District. I represented Pine Knot. A.W. Holmes \n     represented Whitley City, and Dr. Winchester represented \n     Stearns. We were the first three water commissioners for \n     McCreary County. The three of us ended up signing a personal \n     note and buying a farm that was for sale. That's where the \n     water reservoir was built. There was a problem, though, when \n     the lake covered five acres of Forest Service land. We had to \n     get a special permit to take care of that!''\n       Years later, Musgrove became involved with the McCreary \n     County Development Association. The Association was formed to \n     help the water department and McCreary County. Musgrove \n     remembers when the water department discovered that they \n     could get grants to run water lines to industrial sites. He \n     smiles as he explains, ``I remember those people saying that \n     they hoped we were smart enough to find a site away from \n     town. I guess we went to the extreme! Industrial sites were \n     bought in Greenwood and near the state line. We managed to \n     get a grant that let us lay water lines to those sites on \n     both ends of the county!''\n       In addition to busying himself with McCreary County \n     telephone, water, and fire department concerns over the \n     years, Musgrove also turned his attention to the development \n     of a local airport by becoming a member of McCreary County's \n     first airport board. Musgrove can recall early attempts to \n     establish an airport. ``We found two pieces of property where \n     an airport could be built. Both tracts belonged to the Forest \n     Service. When we chose the Pine Knot site, we had to get a \n     special use permit from them. They had clear-cut the site and \n     planted it with pine trees. Burris Smith and I surveyed it \n     and finally got a dirt runway built. ``Doc'' Jim Anderson had \n     a small plane, and he became chairman of that board. We had \n     several people on the board, including Jim Burgess, Harold \n     Hickman, and Burris Smith. We got Bob Gable on there too, \n     because he knew people in Frankfort. Later, there was a land \n     exchange with the Forest Service, and McCreary County was \n     finally able to get the airport turned over to them.''\n       After serving on the McCreary County Airport Board for four \n     years, Musgrove went on to serve on the McCreary County \n     Industrial Development Association, the first Stearns Museum \n     Board, and, for 31 years, as a board member of the Kentucky \n     Highlands Investment Corporation Board. The Kentucky \n     Highlands Investment Corporation is an organization formed to \n     help fund businesses so that jobs are created. KHIC began in \n     the old wholesale building (now the Depot) in downtown \n     Stearns and has since moved to London, Kentucky, where it \n     currently serves over 20 counties. Musgrove and Bill \n     Singleton currently represent McCreary County.\n       Along with his active participation in the community \n     throughout the years, Musgrove has supported himself and his \n     family through self-employment. Musgrove operated a car body \n     and fender repair shop and was a plumbing and excavation \n     contractor. He and his wife also operated a mobile-home park. \n     Always eager to learn, Musgrove attended classes about \n     business law and small-business management.\n       Today, the walls of Musgrove's home are adorned with many \n     photographs, certificates, and awards. Photos of U.S. \n     presidents, including former President George W. Bush, are \n     displayed. One photograph, snapped when Musgrove visited a \n     factory as a KHIC board member, shows Eldred shaking the hand \n     of President Bill Clinton. Musgrove comments on that photo, \n     ``I shook his hand. It didn't make much difference to me that \n     he was the president.''\n       Eldred's latest project is an attempt to erect a monument \n     that displays the Ten Commandments and honors veterans. He \n     comments that he still has a job to accomplish in life. ``I \n     still have a job to do. I'm just not sure what it is. My job \n     may be taking care of my wife, writing letters to congressmen \n     or erecting a monument. All I know is that I still have a job \n     to do.''

Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join \nme in paying tribute to the men and women of our Armed Forces and their \nfamilies during Military Family Month 2011.\n  Each November marks Military Family Month. This is an important time \nfor Americans to recognize and honor the commitment and sacrifices of \nour extraordinary military families.\n  And it is a time to express our gratitude. We know that when a \nservicemember puts on a uniform, the entire family sacrifices for our \ncountry. Military families endure frequent moves, long separations, \ninterruptions in careers and education, and the anxiety that comes with \nhaving a loved one in harm's way. They face these unique challenges \nwith grace and courage.\n  We also know that the security of our Nation and the readiness of our \nmilitary are inextricably linked to the strength of our military \nfamilies. Not only do these families support our brave men and women in \nuniform, they come together to support each other and generously \ndedicate their time to make a difference in their communities.\n  As cochair of the Senate Military Family Caucus, I am deeply grateful \nto these incredible men, women and children for their strength and \ntheir sacrifice. Their selfless service to their communities and our \nNation is an example for us all.\n  President Obama eloquently stated in proclaiming Military Family \nMonth 2011 that ``With every step we take on\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\nAmerican soil, we tread on ground made safer for us through the \ninvaluable sacrifices of our servicemembers and their families.''\n  While we can never fully repay the debt of gratitude we owe our \nmilitary families, we can do everything possible to lessen their burden \nand provide for their needs.\n  I encourage all Americans to take time this month and all year round \nto recognize and honor our military families for the countless \ncontributions they make each and every day for our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7448-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING CASEY RIBICOFF\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor \nthe life and legacy of Casey Ribicoff, an inspiration, role model and \nfriend to me and so many others.\n  Casey Ribicoff was a living legend. She and Abe shared a love that \nwas heartfelt and moving, and obvious to all who knew them. She brought \nlaughter and elegance to every friendship, most especially to her \npartnership with Abe. Together they traveled the world and country, \nmaking new friendships and visiting old ones, all the while creating \nenough memories to last a lifetime.\n  Having served on the Abe Ribicoff Senate staff, I can attest to their \nextraordinary partnership in public service, her deep caring for the \npeople of Connecticut, and her commitment to social justice. She \nregarded the Senate as a platform for advocacy and hard work on behalf \nof Connecticut and the public interest. She and Abe were truly a team.\n  Casey had an impressive energy and strength. She was constantly \ninvolved in good causes, leading to her appointment by Jimmy Carter to \nthe board of the Kennedy Center, a position she proudly held for 20 \nyears. A founder of the AIDS Care Center at the New York Presbyterian \nHospital, Casey always found new ways to give back and help the \ncommunity.\n  As a personal friend, which she was to Cynthia and me, she was \nendlessly loyal and generous, and she leaves a legacy of good work that \nwill be remembered for decades to come. Casey was kind, generous and \nloving. She will live on in the friendships and family that she \ncherished. She will be sorely missed but never forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7448-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   GOODWILL INDUSTRIES OF NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n70th anniversary of Goodwill Industries of New Mexico. Working in New \nMexico communities since 1941, the organization has helped find work \nand provided training and development for countless needy New Mexicans.\n  The nonprofit organization provides essential skill development, \ncareer-building services, and work opportunities to residents facing \nserious employment barriers. This is an especially important service \nthey provide considering the continuing difficulties facing many \napplicants in today's job market.\n  Despite high unemployment and a struggling economy, Goodwill \nIndustries of New Mexico placed nearly 850 clients in public and \nprivate sector jobs last year. Many of these clients face challenges \nwith various disabilities, homelessness, drug addiction, and traumatic \nbrain injuries, among other barriers. And the impact of the \norganization's activities has been felt throughout the entire State. In \n2010, Goodwill Industries served nearly 10,000 residents through 8 \nprograms reaching all 33 counties. That is a tenfold increase from a \ndecade ago.\n  Much of its funding is derived through its retail stores, with 87 \ncents of every dollar spent on programs and services. But last year \nalone, in addition to its retail sales, Goodwill Industries of New \nMexico salvaged nearly 1,700 tons of textiles, 188 tons of shoes, \nrecycled 536 tons of cardboard and paper, and kept nearly 35 tons of \nused electronics out of New Mexico landfills. The environmental impact \nof Goodwill's initiatives is making a positive difference as well.\n  The education and training programs provide intensified training to \nthose in need at six training centers across the State. Their programs \nalso help low-income seniors to market themselves and acquire skills to \ncompete in today's job market and place individuals in subsidized jobs \nwith a host agency with the goal of moving that employee into a \npermanent position within the community.\n  Its Pathways programs assist the near homeless and chronically \nhomeless in obtaining access to housing and the opportunity to begin a \nnew life through the power of work. Goodwill Industries' GoodGuides \nMentoring Program pairs adults with at risk teens. Mentors provide \nstructure and a supportive relationship with middle and high school-\naged students. Goodwill volunteers work with teens to establish goals, \nbuild career plans, and work toward high school graduation to prepare \nfor postsecondary training or college.\n  Traumatic brain injuries often leave patients confused and \nbewildered, struggling with simple day-to-day tasks. The caring staff \nin the TBI case management program assisted over 500 clients in crisis \nlast year from imminent risk to their safety and health. I was also \npleased to announce in July that this highly respected organization \nreceived over a $\\1/2\\ million grant from the VA to prevent \nhomelessness among New Mexican veterans and their families.\n  Mr. President, I join Goodwill Industries of New Mexico in \ncelebrating its 70th anniversary, and I congratulate them on being one \nof my State's premier service providers advocating for the disabled, \nhomeless, and unemployed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7448-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO ROBERT AND MARGARET PATRICELLI\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to commend Robert \nand Margaret Patricelli, of Simsbury, CT, for their immense generosity \nand vision in establishing an institute that will promote and support \nimportant public service activities.\n  Public policy and service have played a central role in the \nPatricelli's careers and lives. Graduating from Wesleyan in 1961 and \nHarvard Law in 1965, Bob was selected as one of 15 people for the first \nWhite House Fellows Program. His participation helped shape him as \nsomeone who understands the value of public policy and government \nservice. Both he and Margaret are always looking for ways to give back \nand inspire others.\n  Their passion for giving back and helping others is what moved them \nto start the Robert and Margaret Patricelli Family Foundation to bring \na tangible reality to programs and projects that serve the greater \ngood. What Bob and Margaret have done through their family's foundation \nis inspiring and moving--and will continue to serve the country, and \nthe world, for generations to come. Their philanthropic and service \nactivities have touched countless lives across the State, from the arts \nto science, hospitals to schools, and programs assisting low-income \nneighborhoods.\n  In May of this year, the foundation contributed substantially to \nWesleyan University, establishing the Patricelli Center for Social \nEntrepreneurship. This center will support students seeking to \nestablish programs and organizations, providing workshops, speakers and \nnetworking opportunities for students. It will help encourage and \nembolden students who are focused on becoming social entrepreneurs, as \nwell as award grants to undergraduate students engaged in specific \nprojects. The foundation's most recent contribution to Wesleyan is one \nmore example of great caring and commitment that lead me to recognize \nBob and Margaret for all that they have done for our State and country.\n  A role model and inspiration to all who value public service, I \ncommend and thank Bob and Margaret Patricelli for their legacy of great \nwork for Connecticut and the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7448-4", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7448-S7449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JONATHAN M. TOPODAS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to \nJonathan M. Topodas, who will be retiring this month after a \nspectacular 38-year-career with Aetna, one of Connecticut's leading \ncorporate citizens.\n  Jonathan joined Aetna's law department after graduating from Southern\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nMethodist University Law School in 1974. Throughout his tenure with the \ncompany, he has provided sound legal advice to many of the firm's \nclients. More recently, Jonathan joined Aetna's Federal relations team, \nwhere he currently serves as the vice president and counsel responsible \nfor Federal health legislative and regulatory matters. In this \nposition, Jonathan has been an important voice in debates about \ncritical health care issues, such as Medicare and patient safety.\n  In addition to his work with Aetna, Jonathan also earned a \ncongressional fellowship through the Brookings Institution in 1979. \nThrough this program, he worked as a counsel for the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. He also serves on the board of directors of the American \nBenefits Council, and has worked together with respected business \norganizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers.\n  Jonathan's wife Elaine, an accomplished dancer and teacher, shares \nhis commitment to community service. Elaine is affiliated with several \ncommunity groups and theaters as a choreographer and director. She is \npassionate about her work, so much so that she returns to Connecticut \nduring the summer to work with local dance troupes in a variety of \nsettings. I thank Elaine for her contributions to Connecticut's vibrant \nartistic culture.\n  In his off-work hours, Jonathan enjoys spending time with his three \nchildren and two grandchildren. He also loves to explore his deep Greek \nheritage. Jonathan's ancestors made their living as divers in the \nAegean Sea, and Jonathan is known to regale his friends and colleagues \nwith fascinating anecdotes about Greek history and culture, such as the \nhistory of the Hippocratic Oath.\n  I wish Jonathan Topodas, and his family, nothing but the best as he \ngets ready to begin a well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7449-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BANGOR HIGH SCHOOL'S GIRLS SOCCER TEAM\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I extend my most heartfelt \ncongratulations to the Bangor High School Girls Soccer Team, which on \nNovember 5, 2011, clinched the programs first-ever Maine Class A State \nChampionship, and in doing so achieved the remarkable feat of a perfect \nseason! I applaud Coach Johnson and each and every member of the team \non their milestone accomplishment!\n  Indeed, the story of the Bangor Girls Soccer Team is truly inspiring, \ncharacterized by an extraordinary strength of character and conviction \nthat could not be more emblematic of our great State of Maine. The team \nembarked upon this season imbued with the distinct recollection of its \nheartbreaking loss in last years championship match, but under the \nsteadfast leadership of 12 seniors who have been lifelong friends and \nteammates, the team admirably transformed that defeat into an \nindefatigable drive to seize the gold ball.\n  From that point forward, the team demonstrated an awe-inspiring, \nunmatched fortitude and tenacity that propelled them to victory after \nvictory. As senior Liz Hintz stated in a Bangor Daily News article, We \ntook every game seriously. We knew we couldnt afford to let down for \neven ten minutes because we knew it could cost us. That undeterred, \nlaser beam focus was reflected in their statistics as well. In the \nregular season alone, the team incredibly outscored their opponents 98-\n8, and in the postseason, an even more impressive 18-0.\n  The teams unwavering motivation led them all the way to their second \nconsecutive championship game where, in a rematch of the previous years \ntitle contest, they again confronted the reigning champion. Undaunted, \nthe team played with the unflagging passion and willpower that had \nbecome its hallmark characteristic, working tirelessly on both offense \nand defense and never relenting to a challenge. That irreversible tide \nof momentum as the opposing coach called it carried Bangor to a \nconvincing 4-0 victory and its first Class A Championship.\n  The legendary Mia Hamm once astutely observed, The backbone of \nsuccess is usually found in old-fashioned, basic concepts like hard \nwork, determination, good planning and perseverance. If any team \nepitomizes that belief, its the Bangor Girls Soccer Team, which \novercame the heart-wrenching loss of last year to become the best team \nin Class A soccer this year.\n  Again, I congratulate and commend the Bangor High School Girls Soccer \nTeam on their well-deserved victory as well as their extraordinary \nefforts. What a wonderful success story they are for Bangor and our \ngreat State of Maine!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7449-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARVIN BREWSTER\n\n Mr. TESTER.

For years, Marv has been very active in Toys for \nTots, and the Marine Corps League, and the Great Falls Farmers Market.\n  Marv Brewster is also an artist. He sculpted the 13-foot angel that \ngraces the Montana Veterans' Memorial. Anyone who has visited that \nmemorial has no doubt been uplifted by the power and comfort of Marv's \nstatue.\n  Through all of his work in this community, Marv never asked for \nrecognition. He just did as all Marines do--the very best he could on \nbehalf of his fellow citizens.\n  Forty-six years ago, Marv joined the Navy. He served with M Company, \n3rd Battalion, 7th Marines as a combat corpsman in Vietnam.\n  I would like to read what COL C.H. Bodley, the commander of the 3rd\n  Battalion, said to Marv in 1966. And this is a direct quote:\n\n       You have performed your duties as Platoon Corpsman in an \n     outstanding manner . . . Your potential was more fully \n     exploited as you participated in eight major operations and \n     numerous small unit activities. On Operation Mallard' the \n     company sustained 13 casualties from Viet Cong small arms and \n     mortar fire. Without hesitation, you moved through the area \n     administering aid and comforting those in need of your \n     assistance . . . Your performance on Operation Mallard' is \n     indicative of the consistently fine work you have been doing. \n     Your eagerness to serve, unswerving loyalty and professional \n     ability have earned you the respect and confidence of all who \n     have been associated with you. It is indeed a pleasure to \n     have men of your caliber in my command and I highly commend \n     you for a job well done.\n\n  On April 21, 1966, Marv was wounded in combat during ``Operation Hot \nSprings.'' For his sacrifice, he received a Purple Heart.\n  Marv got the medal. But his Purple Heart was never recorded in his \nofficial records. The Navy said it was the Marines' job. The Marines \nsaid it was the Navy's job.\n  Decades later, Marv Brewster reached out to my office to fix his \nrecord once and for all so he could access the health benefits he \nearned as he faces another tough challenge: cancer, related to Agent \nOrange exposure in Vietnam.\n  Yesterday, it was my honor to present Marv with the Purple Heart \nAward Certificate he should have received nearly 50 years ago, and with \nit a corrected ``DD 215'' discharge form.\n  History shows us that Marv is an honored recipient of the Purple \nHeart, and all the benefits that come with it.\n  In researching Marv's records, we learned that Marv never received \nseveral other decorations he earned years ago. Yesterday, I also had \nthe honor of presenting to Marv, the Navy Good Conduct Medal, and the \nNational Defense Service Medal. It was also my honor to present the \nVietnam Service Medal with three Bronze Stars, and the Presidential \nUnit Citation Ribbon. Yesterday I also presented to Marv the Combat \nAction Ribbon and the Vietnam Campaign Medal with 1960 Device. These \ndecorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of true \nheroism--sacrifice and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation that wishes \nyou and your family, Marv, the very best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7449-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7449-4", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7449-S7450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\nStates submitting sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7450-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1412.

Res. 323\n\n       Whereas in 1936, while the United States was mired in the \n     Great Depression, Heber J. Grant, President of The Church of \n     Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (referred to in this \n     Resolution as ``the LDS Church''), announced the creation of \n     what came to be known as the Welfare Program;\n       Whereas President Grant explained, ``Our primary purpose \n     was to set up . . . a system under which the curse of \n     idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole \n     abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self \n     respect be once more established amongst our people . . . The \n     aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. \n     Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the \n     lives of our Church membership.'';\n       Whereas, the LDS Church's Welfare Program, which is based \n     on the principles of self-reliance and industry, has expanded \n     throughout the world and assists people of all faiths by \n     caring for the needy while simultaneously teaching principles \n     to help them become self-reliant and retain their self \n     respect;\n       Whereas funding for the LDS Church's Welfare Program is \n     provided by the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of \n     Latter-day Saints, who routinely fast for 2 consecutive\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\n     meals every month and make donations to the LDS Church's \n     Welfare Program that is at least equal to the money they \n     would have spent on food;\n       Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program provides \n     opportunities for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of \n     Latter-day Saints to help the less fortunate by working at \n     dozens of farms and canneries located throughout the United \n     States and Canada that produce food for needy people;\n       Whereas needy people in the community are identified by the \n     leader of each local church congregation, in consultation \n     with other local leaders, including the Relief Society \n     President (a woman from the congregation who serves as the \n     local leader of the LDS Church's women's organization);\n       Whereas people in need are provided free food and household \n     items at facilities called Bishop's Storehouses after \n     receiving a written requisition from the leader of their \n     local congregation;\n       Whereas the 129 Bishop's Storehouses, which are located \n     throughout the world, provide needed commodities from the \n     consecrated sacrifices of members of The Church of Jesus \n     Christ of Latter-day Saints;\n       Whereas recipients of these commodities are given service \n     opportunities, to the extent of their ability, which allow \n     them to demonstrate their gratitude for what they have \n     received;\n       Whereas employment resource service centers, which are also \n     part of the LDS Church's Welfare Program, provide a place \n     where people can receive job training, learn to enhance their \n     resumes, and find job opportunities;\n       Whereas there are nearly 300 employment resource service \n     centers throughout the world, at which volunteers help \n     hundreds of thousands of people to find jobs every year, a \n     large percentage of whom are not members of The Church of \n     Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;\n       Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program also includes \n     Deseret Industries, which serves as an employment training \n     facility and operates thrift stores;\n       Whereas these thrift stores provide on-the-job experience \n     for refugees or others who need help qualifying for long-term \n     employment and are stocked by individual donations, which are \n     offered to the public at inexpensive prices;\n       Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program also includes LDS \n     Family Services, a private, nonprofit organization that \n     provides counseling, adoption services, addiction recovery \n     support groups, and resources for social, emotional, and \n     spiritual challenges;\n       Whereas the influence and power for good exerted by the \n     Welfare Program of the LDS Church has greatly expanded over \n     its 75-year history; and\n       Whereas the positive impact of the LDS Church's Welfare \n     Program in the United States has assisted untold numbers of \n     United States citizens:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 75th Anniversary of the Welfare Program \n     of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;\n       (2) congratulates the members of The Church of Jesus Christ \n     of Latter-day Saints for the significant contribution that \n     its Welfare Program has had on United States citizens and \n     many people throughout the world; and\n       (3) commends the many efforts made by The Church of Jesus \n     Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members, through its \n     Welfare Program, to serve others regardless of religious \n     affiliation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7455-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7455-S7456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 950.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 323, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 323) recognizing the 75th anniversary \n     of the Welfare Program of the Church of Jesus Christ of \n     Latter-Day Saints and the significant impact of the Welfare \n     Program in the United States and throughout the world in \n     helping people in need.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support this resolution recognizing the \n75th anniversary of the welfare program of the Church of Jesus Christ \nof Latter-day Saints, LDS. This resolution recognizes and commends the \nLDS Church and its members for 75 years of donating their time, energy, \nand resources to benefit people across the Nation and throughout the \nworld.\n  Since its creation in 1936, the LDS welfare program has matured to a \npoint where its reach can be felt across the globe by people of all \nnations and religious affiliations. Founded to help others achieve \nself-reliance, the program has remained true to its founding values as \nit has grown. To date, a remarkable 63,000 tons of food has been \ndistributed by the welfare program to people in need across the globe. \nIn addition to food distribution, the program has provided much needed \nclothing, medical aid, and services to help people gain long-term \nstability in the workforce and in the home.\n  Over 300 LDS Employment Research Service Centers around the world \nprovide people with jobs skills training, resume-writing workshops, \ninterviewing classes, and assistance in finding employment. In \naddition, Deseret Industries, an LDS Church-run group of thrift stores, \nprovides refugees and the disabled with the employment they need to \ngain on-the-job experience before moving on to long-term employment. \nAnother arm of the welfare program, LDS Family Services, provides \nadoption services, support groups for addiction recovery, and \ncounseling for a variety of emotional, social, and spiritual \nchallenges.\n  There is a common assumption that if the Federal Government does not \naddress a problem, no one else will. The LDS welfare program is \nevidence that private charities play a vital role in providing for the \nsocial, mental, physical, and spiritual welfare of this Nation's \ncitizens. President Ronald Reagan recognized this truth.\n  He believed that government could not provide a solution for every \nproblem. He also understood that there is much that the government can \nlearn from the sound management of the LDS welfare program and other \nprivate charitable organizations. In fact, President Reagan said of the \nLDS welfare program, ``If, during the period of the Great Depression, \nevery church had come forth with a welfare program founded on correct \nprinciples . . . we would not be in the difficulty in which we find \nourselves today.''\n  As I look at the surging national debt driven largely by poorly \nstructured entitlement programs, I can't help but think that President \nReagan's words are as true today as they were in 1982.\n  The LDS welfare program is an inspirational example of what a private \norganization can accomplish as ordinary people give of their money, \ntime, and talents. I wish to congratulate the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints, its leadership, and its world-wide membership on the \nsuccess of this great program.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 323) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 323\n\n       Whereas in 1936, while the United States was mired in the \n     Great Depression, Heber J. Grant, President of The Church of \n     Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (referred to in this \n     Resolution as ``the LDS Church''), announced the creation of \n     what came to be known as the Welfare Program;\n       Whereas President Grant explained, ``Our primary purpose \n     was to set up . . . a system under which the curse of \n     idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole \n     abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self \n     respect be once more established amongst our people . . . The \n     aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. \n     Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the \n     lives of our Church membership.'';\n       Whereas, the LDS Church's Welfare Program, which is based \n     on the principles of self-reliance and industry, has expanded \n     throughout the world and assists people of all faiths by \n     caring for the needy while simultaneously teaching principles \n     to help them become self-reliant and retain their self \n     respect;\n       Whereas funding for the LDS Church's Welfare Program is \n     provided by the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of \n     Latter-day Saints, who routinely fast for 2 consecutive meals \n     every month and make donations to the LDS Church's Welfare \n     Program that is at least equal to the money they would have \n     spent on food;\n       Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program provides \n     opportunities for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of \n     Latter-day Saints to help the less fortunate by working at \n     dozens of farms and canneries located throughout the United \n     States and Canada that produce food for needy people;\n       Whereas needy people in the community are identified by the \n     leader of each local church congregation, in consultation \n     with other local leaders, including the Relief Society \n     President (a woman from the congregation who serves as the \n     local leader of the LDS Church's women's organization);\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\n       Whereas people in need are provided free food and household \n     items at facilities called Bishop's Storehouses after \n     receiving a written requisition from the leader of their \n     local congregation;\n       Whereas the 129 Bishop's Storehouses, which are located \n     throughout the world, provide needed commodities from the \n     consecrated sacrifices of members of The Church of Jesus \n     Christ of Latter-day Saints;\n       Whereas recipients of these commodities are given service \n     opportunities, to the extent of their ability, which allow \n     them to demonstrate their gratitude for what they have \n     received;\n       Whereas employment resource service centers, which are also \n     part of the LDS Church's Welfare Program, provide a place \n     where people can receive job training, learn to enhance their \n     resumes, and find job opportunities;\n       Whereas there are nearly 300 employment resource service \n     centers throughout the world, at which volunteers help \n     hundreds of thousands of people to find jobs every year, a \n     large percentage of whom are not members of The Church of \n     Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;\n       Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program also includes \n     Deseret Industries, which serves as an employment training \n     facility and operates thrift stores;\n       Whereas these thrift stores provide on-the-job experience \n     for refugees or others who need help qualifying for long-term \n     employment and are stocked by individual donations, which are \n     offered to the public at inexpensive prices;\n       Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program also includes LDS \n     Family Services, a private, nonprofit organization that \n     provides counseling, adoption services, addiction recovery \n     support groups, and resources for social, emotional, and \n     spiritual challenges;\n       Whereas the influence and power for good exerted by the \n     Welfare Program of the LDS Church has greatly expanded over \n     its 75-year history; and\n       Whereas the positive impact of the LDS Church's Welfare \n     Program in the United States has assisted untold numbers of \n     United States citizens:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 75th Anniversary of the Welfare Program \n     of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;\n       (2) congratulates the members of The Church of Jesus Christ \n     of Latter-day Saints for the significant contribution that \n     its Welfare Program has had on United States citizens and \n     many people throughout the world; and\n       (3) commends the many efforts made by The Church of Jesus \n     Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members, through its \n     Welfare Program, to serve others regardless of religious \n     affiliation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/15/senate-section/article/S7585-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
