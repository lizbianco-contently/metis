INOUYE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday minutes after \nIrene--Senator Inouye's wife--confirmed the death of her husband, my \nfriend, a friend of all of us here.\n  I was, frankly, very emotional and announced to the Senate and the \ncountry the death of one of the Senate's all-time greats. So today, \nupon contemplation and reflection, I am going to say a little bit more \nabout Senator Inouye.\n  His personal friendship I valued so very, very much. He was a \ncolleague\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\nbut really a friend. He helped me so many times. He helped me to do my \nbest here. My best has been with the help of him.\n  As I mentioned briefly yesterday, he always had so much confidence in \nme. Years ago, when I was a Senator struggling, as all Senators here, \nhe told me two decades ago I would be running the Senate someday. I \nnever even contemplated, thought about, or desired that. Things worked \nout that he was right.\n  Senator Inouye, one of the finest men I have ever known, was a real \nAmerican hero. My friend who is on the Senate floor, the assistant \nleader, has heard me talk about my mentor, Michael Callahan, who taught \nme in high school, helped me with money as I was going to law school, \nand he was on a pension. He was a disabled veteran. He was such a good \nfriend of mine. He and Senator Inouye were friends. They talked about \nwhat it is like to not have a limb. While Callahan's was a leg, \nInouye's was an arm. They talked and they were friends, and Michael \nCallahan worked back here as an aide to Senators Cannon and Bible in \nthe summers and got to know Senator Inouye.\n  My thoughts are, of course, with his family, including his wife \nIrene, his son Ken, their daughter-in-law Jessica. He has a \nstepdaughter Jennifer, and a granddaughter Maggie, named after, of \ncourse, his first wife. Their loss is the Nation's loss.\n  Last night we lost a noble soul. Dan Inouye lived a long productive \nlife. Still, I speak for Dan's Senate family when I say we are \ndevastated by his passing. While we will all miss him, his legacy will \nlive in the Halls of the Senate and the State of Hawaii as long as \nhistory is written. His place in the history books will not fade.\n  As the second longest serving Senator in our history, Senator \nInouye's career in Congress spanned the life of Hawaii's statehood. \nElected to the Senate in 1962, only Robert Byrd served longer. But \nSenator Inouye's tradition of service began long before he came to the \nU.S. Senate.\n  He was working as a medical volunteer when Japanese war planes \nattacked Pearl Harbor. He was just a boy, a teenager. From the time he \nwas just a kid, he wanted to be a medical doctor. But a different fate \nawaited Dan Inouye.\n  After the attack, as we all know too well, Japanese Americans were \ndeemed enemy aliens and were therefore not subject to the draft. More \nthan 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry were imprisoned in American \ninternment camps. We have seen the pictures. We have heard the stories. \nThey were in prison. Yet Dan Inouye and other Japanese Americans, in \nspite of the unfair designation of being an enemy alien, volunteered to \nfight for this Nation's freedom overseas, although many of their own \nfamilies were denied freedom at home while they were overseas.\n  Senator Inouye fought courageously with the famous 442nd Regimental \nCombat Team in World War II and was grievously wounded in battle in \nItaly.\n  A paragraph or two is written about why a Medal of Honor recipient \nwas given this award. The words for his Medal of Honor are as follows:\n\n       On April 21, 1945, Inouye was grievously wounded while \n     leading an assault on a heavily-defended ridge near San \n     Terenzo in Tuscany, Italy, called Colle Musatello. The ridge \n     served as a strong-point along the strip of German \n     fortifications known as the Gothic Line, which represented \n     the last and most dogged line of German defensive works in \n     Italy. As he led his platoon in a flanking maneuver, three \n     German machine guns opened fire from covered positions just \n     40 yards away, pinning his men to the ground. Inouye stood up \n     to attack and was shot in the stomach; ignoring his wound, he \n     proceeded to attack and destroy the first machine gun nest \n     with hand grenade and fire from his Thompson submachine gun. \n     After being informed of the severity of his wound by his \n     platoon sergeant, he refused treatment and rallied his men \n     for an attack on the second machine gun position, which he \n     also successfully destroyed before collapsing from blood \n     loss.\n       As his squad distracted the third machine gunner, Inouye \n     crawled toward the final bunker, eventually drawing within 10 \n     yards. As he raised himself up and cocked his arm to throw \n     his last grenade into the fighting position, a German inside \n     fired a rifle grenade that struck him on the right elbow, \n     severing most of his arm and leaving his own primed grenade \n     reflexively ``clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong \n     to me anymore.'' Inouye's horrified soldiers moved to his \n     aid, but he shouted for them to keep back for out of fear his \n     severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade. \n     As the German inside the bunker reloaded his rifle, Inouye \n     pried the live grenade from his useless right hand and \n     transferred it to his left. As the German aimed his rifle to \n     finish him off, Inouye tossed the grenade off-hand into the \n     bunker and destroyed it. He stumbled to his feet and \n     continued forward, silencing the last German resistance with \n     a one-handed burst from his Thompson before being wounded in \n     the leg tumbling unconscious to the bottom of the ridge. When \n     he awoke to see his concerned men of his platoon hovering \n     over him, his only comment before being carried away was to \n     gruffly order them to return to their positions, since, as he \n     pointed out, ``nobody called off the war!''\n\n  That is the citation on his Medal of Honor.\n  His arm was later amputated in a field hospital, and he was sent back \nto the United States to recover. But it took years for him to recover.\n  I remember in the LBJ Room over here, after Patty Murray and others \ntalked about what a difficult time returning veterans were having from \nIraq, him talking about some of his experiences. They trained him to \ndrive vehicles. He took driver's license tests in more than one State. \nHe became very personal and talked about some of the things they taught \nhim--missing an arm--that he had to do. It was a remarkable \npresentation that he made.\n  Senator Inouye did not talk very much. He was a silent man--did not \ntalk very much at all. He had a dynamic voice. We have not felt that \nvoice in the last few years because he has not been as powerful as he \nwas as he has aged, but what a beautiful voice he had. In that hospital \nthey took him to in Michigan, Senator Inouye made two lifelong friends: \none, Senator Bob Dole who, as we know, became majority leader in the \nSenate and Republican nominee for President of the United States; his \nother lifetime friend the late Senator Phil Hart, who was known as the \nconscience of the Senate. The Hart Building, the massive Senate office \nbuilding, is named after him.\n  Asked by his son why, after being classified as an enemy alien, he \nand the members of the famed 442d fought so heroically, Senator Inouye \nsaid, in his usual calm manner, ``for the children.'' And for the \nchildren there could be no finer role model than Senator Dan Inouye. He \nwas a recipient of the Medal of Honor and the Congressional Gold Medal, \nthe highest honor the Congress can bestow. He received the \nDistinguished Service Cross, a Bronze Star for valor and, of course, a \nPurple Heart. Dan Inouye showed the same dedication in Congress that he \ndisplayed on the battlefield.\n  I want to take a little bit here and talk about a meeting I had--I \nmentioned it very briefly last night, but it was 10 days ago. I knew \nSenator Inouye was not feeling well so I went down to his office. He \nhas a remarkable office. It is a beautiful office. But there is not one \nsingle thing on the walls depicting what a great man he is. There are \nno awards, there are no commemorative statues. All he has in his office \nare pictures of Washington and Hawaii. That is the humility he showed \nhis entire life.\n  There was no staff there, just the two of us. We talked for an hour. \nI would have always remembered it, but his having passed away \nyesterday, it will be embedded in my mind. As we left, we both lamented \nthe fact that we had not been able to sit down and talk like that \nenough. He professed at that time--these were his words--how ``lucky'' \nhe had been his whole life. He said, ``I've got a little emphysema \nnow.''\n  I said: It is not from smoking. I have never seen you smoke.\n  He said: No, I learned to smoke in the war as a boy, a teenager. He \nsmoked from 1944 to 1967, when they told him he had lung cancer. They \nwere wrong, but in the process they took part of his lung out, half of \nhis lung. He talked about how lucky he had been, surviving what he \nthought was lung cancer, but also how lucky he had been his whole life. \nFor example, the war. I am sure that most people would not reflect on \nsuch massive injuries as being lucky, but he considered it lucky that \nhe lived.\n  There were other examples he gave. He had been called upon, with \nthree other soldiers, to cross a river in the dark of night to find out \nwhat was going on on the other side of the river. He and his \ncompanions, in the dark of the night--they didn't have all this fancy \ngear to see in the dark; they did their best--they crossed that cold, \ncold\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\nriver. It took many hours. They came back, did their report, and he \nlaid down on his bunk. He had an ingrown toenail that hurt every step \nhe took. So he is lying on his bed and he said, ``Here is why I am so \nlucky. A medic came by, looked at me, looked at my foot, and he said \nyou have gangrene poisoning; we have to get you out of here.\n  They took him out and he said: How lucky I was I was not in battle \nthat day--when half of his companions were killed.\n  He also talked about preparing for another battle. He is getting \nready to do this. He is a private; he may have been a corporal, I don't \nreally remember. He said a sergeant came to him and he said: ``Inouye, \nreport to the colonel.'' He doesn't know what is wrong. He goes, \nreports to the colonel. The colonel says very curtly: ``You have to \nmeet with the General today.'' He said the only reason he would know of \nto meet with the General was a court martial, because that is what \neverybody thought. So he goes to headquarters. He sees the General. The \nGeneral tells Senator Inouye: ``I am promoting you to be a \nlieutenant.'' It was a battlefield promotion. But he said: ``I was \nlucky. I was lucky I became an officer but,'' he said, ``I was lucky I \nwas not in the fight that day because we also had huge losses.''\n  When he was scheduled to come back to America--another one of his \nlucky experiences--they had a transport plane to take him back. His arm \nis gone by then. He is told we don't have room for another litter, for \nanother patient on the airplane. You can't go. He of course was \ndisappointed. The plane crashed and killed everybody on the plane.\n  So Dan Inouye was a person who considered himself lucky. Those of us \nwho knew Senator Inouye consider ourselves lucky, just being able to \nknow the man.\n  After Hawaii received its statehood in 1959, Dan Inouye served as its \nfirst Congressman. Three years later he was elected to the Senate, and \nhe was a soft but powerful voice for the people of Hawaii ever since.\n  There are many personal courtesies he extended to me that I will \nnever forget. It may not seem like much, but I was scheduled to be in \nFlorida and I promoted this--I was a new Senator--and the great Senator \nInouye was going to be there. I got a call from Henry Giugni. Most of \nus who served here knew him. He used to be Sergeant at Arms. For a long \ntime he was Senator Inouye's chief of staff. He said, ``I checked his \nschedule and it's his wife's birthday and he is not going to be able to \ngo.'' I said I understand that.\n  Within an hour I got a call from Senator Inouye. He said Millie \nunderstands that totally. He said we will celebrate the birthday the \nday after tomorrow, when I come back. He was someone who was so self-\nsacrificing for other Senators.\n  As Senator Inouye's colleague from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, said last \nnight:\n\n       His legacy . . . can be seen in every mile of every road in \n     Hawaii, in every nature preserve and every facility that \n     makes Hawaii a safer place. He fulfilled his dream of \n     creating a better Hawaii.\n\n  He was a strong supporter of the University of Hawaii, a strong \nsupporter of George Washington University Law School. He got his \nbachelor's in Hawaii, his law degree at George Washington. He was a \ndetermined representative of this Nation's fighting men and women, a \nlong-time leader of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  As I mentioned briefly last night, there has been, in my many years \nin the Congress--I have been here as long as my friend the assistant \nleader here who is seated next to me today; we have been here 30 \nyears--there has been no one I have ever known in my 30 years who did \nmore and fought more for the fighting men of this country. He believed \nthat the Nation's commitment to the members of his Armed Forces did not \nend with their service.\n\n  For fear it would be lost, and it should not be lost, I want to \nspread on the Record what this good man did at a prayer breakfast a \ncouple of months ago. I can't remember if the Presiding Officer was at \nthe prayer breakfast, but I know my friend the assistant leader was \nthere. Senator Inouye had never, ever in his 50 years in Congress \nspoken at a prayer breakfast, but he decided to come. He had great \nvigor until just recently. He campaigned in this last cycle. He \ntraveled to Alaska to help Senator Begich a few months ago. He \ncampaigned in Nevada, in Arizona, all over the country. He had great \nvigor. But he came to the breakfast and talked to us about his \nexperiences.\n  When he was a boy, he never, ever had a gun. That was not anything \npeople did in Hawaii. So he was surprised after he got in the Army that \nhe was such a great shot. He was the best--the best. As a result of \nthat he became a sniper in the European theater. With great humility he \nexplained he could remember killing his first person. He could remember \nthey were trying to take a farm house and they shot a bazooka into it \nand he rushed in and there was a man there. The man reached in his \npocket. Of course Senator Inouye thought he was reaching for a weapon, \nand the man was killed. And Inouye saw that he was reaching for a \npicture of his family. He said he came to the realization at that time \nthat he was not killing enemy soldiers, he was killing other human \nbeings.\n  Although he had to continue doing what he did, he ended his \npresentation by saying, ``I know exactly how many people that I \nkilled.'' He said, ``A lot of people go to bed at night counting sheep. \nEven though I am an old man, I go to bed at night many times counting \npeople.''\n  He was somebody who, as a result of his experiences, voted against \nwar from then on. He did not support the Vietnam War, Iraq War 1 and 2, \nAfghanistan--even though he made sure that these people had all the \nsupplies they needed, our military force. They are the greatest \nfighting force in the world. A lot of that is directly attributable to \nSenator Inouye.\n  Talking about bipartisanship, he lived that. He was a fine Democrat. \nHe was a progressive Democrat and was proud of that. But he never \nhesitated to cross over and work with other Senators. The best example \nof that was Senator Stevens, who was killed in an airplane crash fairly \nrecently in Alaska. Hawaii and Alaska--these two fine men representing \nthe two newest States in the Union, became like brothers. That is the \ntruth.\n  It is really a shame that Dan is not with us anymore. He was never \nafraid to speak out against discrimination and was an important \nadvocate for Native Hawaiians and Asian Pacific Islanders. He was the \nChair of the Indian Affairs Committee. Prior to that time, with all due \nrespect to all the other Chairs, it was not a committee people knew \nmuch about. Senator Inouye made that committee a powerful committee. He \ntraveled the country receiving all the accolades from these tribes that \nhad never been recognized, that had never had someone who became their \nadvocate--and he was. He put the Indian Affairs Committee on the map.\n  He served as chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the first Chair of \nthe Committee on Intelligence. He served as a member of the Watergate \nCommittee and was chairman of the Special Committee Investigating the \nIran-Contra Affair. I repeat, this man has been one of the greatest \nSenators in the history of this great country.\n  He had a deserved reputation as a bipartisan bridge builder. He \nalways put his country first and his party second. In 1968 Senator \nInouye gave a memorable keynote speech at the Democratic National \nConvention. He spoke eloquently of the country's struggles with racism \nat a time of deep division. He also spoke from the heart. This is part \nof what he said:\n\n       I wish to share with you the most sacred word of Hawaii. It \n     is aloha. To some of you who visited us it may have meant \n     hello. To others aloha may have meant goodbye. But to those \n     of us who have been privileged to live in Hawaii, aloha means \n     I love you. So to all of you, my fellow Americans, aloha.\n\n  That is what he said those many years ago. So today it is with a \nheavy heart that those of us who loved Senator Inouye say ``aloha'' to \na great man, a legend of the Senate. His final, dying word was \n``aloha.'' He did not mean goodbye. He meant, ``I love you.''\n  Senator Inouye, I love you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8097-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8097-S8098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

INOUYE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see my two colleagues from Connecticut \non the Senate floor. I know they are here to speak about the horrible \ntragedy in Newtown last Friday. I will abbreviate my remarks on the \nfloor, and I commend both of them for extraordinary statements last \nnight at a memorial service. I will never forget some of the things \nthey shared with us about this terrible tragedy.\n  I come to the floor this morning for a few moments to pay tribute to \none of my great friends and one of my great colleagues, Danny Inouye, \nwho passed away yesterday. The majority leader has done such an \nextraordinary job recounting his life, and I think back to what it must \nhave meant to him as he witnessed Pearl Harbor at the age of 20. He \nsaid that he realized at the time that the pilots in those planes that \nwere bombing his family and others in Hawaii were people of the same \nancestry as his father, and it hurt him. It hurt him as well to be \nbranded as suspect because of his Japanese origin and to see literally \ntens of thousands of Japanese Americans interned in camps because their \nloyalty was questioned.\n  He took the opportunity to volunteer and serve our Nation to prove \nhis loyalty and that he was willing to risk his life for America. He \nserved in one of the most highly decorated units in all of World War \nII, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which was comprised of Japanese \nAmericans who fought in the European theater. They recently came to \nWashington to be honored. Senator Inouye was there, and it was a great \nmoment to see these men of the ``greatest generation'' who have proven \nto America their love for this country, and none more so than Danny \nInouye.\n  Senator Reid has recounted in detail the incredible story of his \nbravery that earned him the Congressional Medal of Honor, but he was \nsuch a humble man. When we look back on his life, there were so many \naspects of it that were historic in nature, and one would never know it \nin conversations with him or working with him.\n  Senator Reid had the same experience I did. I visited Senator \nInouye's office, and it was unusual by Senate standards. I looked \nacross the office, and there were no pictures of Danny Inouye on the \nwalls, and there were no awards for this man who served more than half \na century in Congress.\n  I said to him: It is interesting that your office has a lot of \nartwork and photos but nothing about Danny Inouye.\n  He said: No, I didn't want to put those things up. I wanted everyone \nto feel at ease coming in here. I didn't want to talk about my party \naffiliation or what I had done. I want them to feel comfortable and to \nknow this is a welcoming office.\n  That is the kind of person he was. Time and again, he proved it.\n  He started off in the territorial House of Representatives in Hawaii. \nWhen Hawaii became a State, he served in the Congress and later in the \nU.S. Senate. He was there from the beginning, and what a dynamic leader \nhe was for his State of Hawaii. He did so many great things over the \nyears.\n  I was at the same Prayer Breakfast Senator Reid recounted. There was \none other story he told, which I will only refer to in the most \nabbreviated form. He talked about his experience as a sniper and how he \nstill had in his mind the images of those enemy soldiers he shot down. \nAfter 50, 60 years, he could not get those images out of his mind.\n  He talked about befriending one of his fellow veterans in the \nMichigan veterans hospital. He told me this great story he shared at \nthe Prayer Breakfast. He said that when he was an officer, he would \nspend his weekends in the great city of Chicago at the Knickerbocker \nHotel. He said that was the hotel for officers.\n  He said: I would come into Chicago and have a great time on the \nweekends and head back to the veterans hospital.\n  Well, he finally talked one of his fellow Hawaiians--a man whose face \nhad been literally burned off--into joining him on one of his trips to \nChicago. The man was embarrassed by his appearance and didn't think \nanybody would want to be around him or talk to him. Danny Inouye \nprepared all of these different places where they would stop in during \ntheir visit, and every one of them greeted Senator Inouye and his \nfriend in a warm fashion.\n  The story goes on from there, and I won't go into the details, but he \nwas a man who always looked to help someone else. He talked about how \nthis man who had been so brutally injured in the war returned to \nHawaii, raised a family, and was Danny Inouye's friend for life, as so \nmany of us were.\n  I think back as well to Senator Robert C. Byrd's funeral in West \nVirginia. It was one of the hottest days I can remember. We were up \nthere baking in the sun at this memorial service for Robert C. Byrd. I \nintentionally picked a seat next to Danny Inouye. I had to take off my \njacket. I was mopping the perspiration off, and I looked at him in his \ndark suit without a bead of sweat.\n  I said: How do you do that?\n  He said: Well, you know, the Asian religions are very important in my \nlife, and they believe mind over matter can achieve great things. I can \nvisualize myself sitting in a deep freeze now, and I am not hot at all.\n  I thought, this man is amazing in so many different ways. When he is \ndone with his life, those stories--some serious, some lighthearted--\nwill reflect so well on this man and what he meant.\n  One of the most important things I have on my agenda is the passage \nof the DREAM Act. I have worked on it for 11 years, and there was a \ntime on the floor of the Senate--September 21, 2010--when I could not \nbreak the Republican filibuster on the DREAM Act, and I was pretty \ndespondent over it. Senator Reid came to the floor and said a few kind \nwords about my efforts, but then out of nowhere Senator Inouye sought \nrecognition. He knew that I was trying to get for millions of these \nyoung people living in America a chance to serve their Nation, prove \ntheir love, and become legal citizens in America. I will read what he \nsaid because it touched me. He said:\n\n       Madam President, I wish to step back in history, if I may. \n     On December 7, 1941, something terrible happened in Hawaii--\n     Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese. Three weeks later, \n     the Government of the United States declared that all \n     Japanese Americans, citizens born in the United States or of \n     Japanese ancestry, were considered to be enemy aliens. As a \n     result, like these undocumented people, they could not put on \n     the uniform of this land.\n\n  Senator Inouye went on to say:\n\n       Well, I was 17 at the time, and naturally I resented this \n     because I loved my country and I wanted to put on a \n     uniform to show where my heart stood. But we were denied. \n     So we petitioned the government, and a year later they \n     said: OK, if you wish to volunteer, go ahead.\n\n  Senator Inouye said:\n\n       Well, to make a long story short, the regiment I served in, \n     made up of Japanese Americans, had the highest casualties in \n     Europe but the most decorated in the history of the United \n     States.\n\n  He turned and said:\n\n       I think the beneficiaries of the Senator from Illinois--\n\n  And the DREAM Act--\n\n     will do the same.\n\n  It was the type of short statement that in a few words captured his \nlife, his sacrifice, and what he had proven by risking his life for \nthis country. There is a reason we honor him this morning.\n  I close by saying two things. First, Senator Akaka came to the floor \nlast night--his colleague of so many years--and put in a few words. He \nsaid on the floor last night:\n\n       Tomorrow will be the first day since Hawaii became a State \n     in 1959 that Dan Inouye will not be representing us. He \n     really worked to shape Hawaii and this great country.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       You will be missed in Washington as much as you will be \n     missed in Hawaii. Rest in peace [Senator Inouye].\n\n  That was Danny Akaka's farewell tribute, and it summarizes how much \nhe meant to Hawaii and how much he meant to America. His last word:\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\n``Aloha.'' As Senator Reid said, it is so appropriate that this kind \nand gentle American hero would leave the message of love for everyone \nelse. That was his life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \neloquent remarks made by my colleague Senator Durbin, Senator Reid, and \nall those who have come to praise a one-of-a-kind Senator and \nextraordinary human being, my friend Dan's Inouye.\n  I was telling Senator Lieberman that when the Senate put on a little \nretirement dinner for our retiring Senators--including Senator \nLieberman--there was Senator Inouye. When we look back, it was only 2 \nweeks ago. We know he could not have been strong, he was not well, but \nhe came to that dinner and sat at that table because of the love and \nrespect for the individual Senators and for this institution.\n  As for me, I will miss Danny's sonorous voice, his big heart, his \nself-effacing manner, his integrity, and his patriotism.\n  Over the years, so many of us have worked together on so many issues \nwith Dan. I worked on bringing a state-of-the-art, first ever \ncomprehensive casualty care center to my State to take care of the \nwounded vets who were coming home without their limbs, post-traumatic \nstress, and all the problems they had. There was no such place on the \nwest coast, and with Dan's help--and we worked with Senator Stevens--we \ngot it done. Now that facility really stands as a tribute to Dan's \nInouye.\n  In 2010 I had a very difficult campaign, as most of us did at that \ntime, and Dan's said: I am going to come out there and help you. I was \nunder fierce attack, and we had an event for veterans. Dan's was a \nspeaker, and I was a speaker. As I was speaking, we heard these voices \nof screaming demonstrators yelling things that were not complimentary \ntoward me, let's put it that way. It was very loud, and I was so \nhumiliated and embarrassed. Here was this amazing patriot, and they \nwould keep screaming when Danny was speaking about my work and his work \nfor veterans. Sure enough, the demonstrators kept it up, and I was so \nupset.\n  I went up to him and I put my arm around him when he was finished and \nsaid: Dan, I am so embarrassed. I am so sorry.\n  He said: Barbara, they are not going to beat you by screaming. Don't \nworry about it.\n  He went on to go to a couple of other events, and he took his wife to \nthem. He was extraordinary.\n  I loved Danny with all of my heart. Every time I looked at him, I \nsmiled because he was so good. He was such a good person, and I pay \ntribute to him today. I don't think we will ever replace him. We will \nnever replace this remarkable American. He personified the meaning of \nlove and the meaning of country.\n  I send my love to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8099-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8099-S8100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT TRAGEDY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. In my remaining remarks, I want to talk about what \nhappened in Connecticut.\n  First, to the Senators from Connecticut, I send all my strength. I \nhave gone through things like this, although not quite the same. As a \nmom and grandma, I know all of our hearts are broken. So many people \nare touched by gun violence.\n  I want to go back to July of 1993. A gunman with an assault weapon \nwalked into a law office in San Francisco and killed eight people and \nwounded six. Just as we see in Connecticut, the stories of heroism came \nforward. One of the people who was killed was a brave young lawyer who \nthrew his body over his wife's body, sacrificing his own life to save \nhers. That young man was one of my son's best friends. This was so long \nago, but it feels like yesterday because time stops when these things \nhappen.\n  I know without a shadow of a doubt how these horrific and senseless \ntragedies live on with the survivors and all of us forever. The psyche \nof the parents, the spouses, the children, the families, and the \nfriends is pierced forever.\n  Yes, as human beings, after these tragedies we come together. We try \nto find meaning, we try to find justice, and we try to find love in the \nmidst of the mayhem. Some find solace in their faith and their God, \nsome find solace in their communities, and some never find solace.\n  The slaughter of the innocent must stop. I say to my colleagues in \nConnecticut how deeply everyone has been touched by this tragedy. In my \ncommunities at home, people are running up to me and saying: Our hearts \nare breaking. He killed babies. They were barely on this Earth. They \ntrusted us, and we failed them.\n  Some of the people coming up to me are proud gun owners, and they are \nsaying: Why couldn't we stop a sick person like this from getting a \nhigh-capacity clip? The gunman didn't even have to reload his weapon \nuntil he fired off 30 shots.\n  There is the whole issue of protecting our schools, which is \nsomething I have cared about. I have a school safety act. I have \nintroduced it so many times, and I will introduce it again.\n  Instead of having an appointment with a mental health professional, \nthis mentally ill young man had an appointment with death. People say: \nDon't talk about doing anything about this now; it is not the time. To \nthem I say: When is the time?\n  If we go back to 2009--that is the last year we have records--31,347 \npeople died from gun violence in our Nation.\n  That is 87 people every day of the year. Another 73,000-plus were \ninjured. So 87 people a day are killed by gun violence. When is the \ntime to speak out? Because every day there is another tragedy.\n  Without going into specifics, there are certain things we need to do.\n  First, we have to take the weapons of war and high-capacity clips off \nour streets; second, we have to ensure that local law enforcement is \ninvolved in concealing carried permits; third, we have to close the gun \nshow loophole so background checks are conducted; fourth, we have to \nkeep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and get them the help \nthey need; five, we need to keep our schools safe by utilizing all the \nlaw enforcement tools at our disposal.\n  We have failed our children. We have to stop worrying about our \npolitical skins because judgments will be made about us. So let's pull \ntogether. Let's show our children we love them, not just by telling \nthem we love them--we must do that--but by showing them we will protect \nthem.\n  I send my love to everyone in Connecticut trying to pull themselves \ntogether. I send my love and support to my colleagues whom we will hear \nfrom now.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I also wish to thank my dear friend and colleague from California for \nher words of support and comfort and resolve. We appear to be in one of \nthose periods of time where we are walking too often through the valley \nof the shadow of death. Senator Blumenthal and I have come to the floor \nto speak about the tragedy that occurred; the senseless, horrific \nattacks on innocent people in Newtown, CT, last Friday.\n  Mr. President, I note with extraordinary respect and a sense of loss \nthe death of our truly beloved colleague Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii. \nAmerica, as Senator Reid and Senator Durbin made so clear, has lost a \ntrue hero, a patriot. This Senate has lost a great leader--a leader \nwhose accomplishments have been literally historic. I think all of us \nhave lost a friend.\n  Last evening, Senator Akaka spoke about how Dan Inouye's legacy--I am \nparaphrasing--was all around Hawaii and all he had done for the State. \nThe truth is I think most every State in the country is full of \nlegacies of the service of Dan Inouye. I know it is true of \nConnecticut.\n  It was truly my honor to serve for 24 years with Dan Inouye. He was \nexactly the opposite of all the caricature pictures people have of \nCongress today and particularly about the rabid partisanship and \npersonal incivility. Dan was a great gentleman and the most civil of \npeople, the kindest and most decent of people. As Senator Reid said, he \nwas a proud Democrat, a faithful\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\nDemocrat but not at all partisan. The relationship he had with the late \nTed Stevens on the Appropriations Committee was historic and actually \ninspirational. They were so different ostensibly in their background \nand in their temperament, particularly. Ted Stevens, bless his memory, \nwas my neighbor and my dear friend. Let's say he had a--how do I \ndescribe it? He was a very emotional person. Danny Inouye was more \ncalm. But they formed this remarkable friendship based on shared \nhistory, going back to World War II, and probably some sense of shared \ndestiny in the sense they were both from the two last States to join \nthe Union, not part of the continental United States, and came as the \nfirst Senators and were here so long. But truly what united them was an \nenormous dedication to America and patriotism.\n  I said Dan Inouye's legacy is in Connecticut and probably most every \nother State. I could go around the State, and I am thinking of the \nyears and years that Danny was the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. There wasn't \nanything we were able to do for Connecticut in that time that he didn't \nsupport, including protecting Long Island Sound, the Connecticut River, \nimproving our transportation systems, making grants to our schools, \ncolleges, and universities, and support of the defense industries in \nConnecticut which have meant so much to the defense of our country but \nalso to the economy of our State.\n  I salute his memory. All of us should honor it and all of us should \ntry in our own way to emulate this great man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8100-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8100-S8103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMANN. Mr. President, Senator Blumenthal and I come to the \nfloor to thank our colleagues for adopting by unanimous consent S.R. \n621, which is exactly mirrored in the words of H.R. 833, condemning the \nattacks that occurred in Newtown, CT, last Friday and expressing sorrow \nto all those affected by those attacks. We are still in shock in \nConnecticut. All of us who know this little town, as America has come \nto know it, which includes 27,000, 28,000 people, known it is a \nbeautiful town with hard-working people who worked their way to get \nthere. These are tight families, very religious, very much involved in \nthe life of the community, and peaceful. Out of nowhere--and this \ntragically is the point and the warning--comes this one deranged \nindividual with guns and slaughters 26 innocents, breaking our hearts, \nand 20 of those being young children.\n  I am sure everybody now feels as if they are part of the family of \nthose who were killed. We look at the faces of those children, pure and \ninnocent, and I think of the words of one of the clergymen at the \ninterfaith service the other night: These are angels and they are \nreally with the angels in Heaven now.\n  With the work and response of the first responders and the trauma \nthey have gone through to face what they had to face and the carnage \nthey witnessed there, as we talk to some of them they feel guilty they \ndidn't get there earlier and couldn't have stopped it somehow. Of \ncourse, they did more than we could ask of anybody. They ran to the \ndanger. The principal, the teachers--I mean the stories that come out \nabout the heroism.\n  I remember long ago I heard someone speak who said the definition of \ncourage is grace under pressure. ``Pressure'' is not even the right \nword here; it is grace in a moment of terror, the single-mindedness and \nthe grace of the principal, the teachers who acted in a way that put \ntheir own lives on the line to protect the lives of the children. Let \nus speak the truth. There were hundreds more children in that building \nthat could have been targets of this madman.\n  We are wounded, but I will tell my colleagues America is wounded and \nthe world is wounded. A priest said to me the other night at the \nservice he was so touched that he had received a bundle of letters from \nschoolchildren in Russia. It reminded me there was an incident in \nRussia years ago where a gunman went into a schoolhouse and wantonly \nkilled children, and monsignor was so touched by it, but that is the \nway this event has touched the world.\n  I will tell my colleagues this is a strong town and we can feel the \npeople of this community pulling together to support the survivors and \nthinking about how they can rebuild the town and its spirit. One woman \nsaid so poignantly the other night at the interfaith service that we \nwill not allow this event to define Newtown, CT--and they will not--but \nthe families of those who have been lost have been changed forever.\n  It is in that regard I particularly want to thank my colleagues for \nthis resolution of condolence and support. I wish to thank my colleague \nSenator Reid for the moment of silence yesterday in this Chamber. In my \nfaith tradition, when a person visits a house of mourning, one of the \ncustoms is for the visitor to sit silently with the mourners. It is \nvery awkward. It is actually not the natural thing we want to do, but \nthis tradition has come about as an act of respect to the mourners \nbecause they may be in their own mourning internally, and we want to \nallow them to speak first if they want to speak. The other is that in \nthe face of death, and particularly in the senseless, brutal deaths of \nthese 26 in Newtown, sometimes the best response is silence and all \nthat the silence contains. So I thank my colleague Senator Reid for \nthat moment of silence.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I and our Connecticut congressional delegation \nconvened a vigil last night at which we all spoke, and Father Conroy, \nthe Chaplain of the House, offered prayer. Chaplain Black could not be \nthere because he was at Senator Inouye's bedside with his family. We \nthank all our colleagues who came last night. Their presence meant a \nlot to us and it meant a lot to the people back home in Newtown.\n  The question is, Can we do anything to stop this from happening \nagain, even once, but hopefully more often. What can we do? As the \nPresident said--incidentally, the President's visit to Newtown was so \ncomforting to the families and all the town, all the people of \nConnecticut. He brought comfort, and I will say he brought resolve, \nwhich was very moving and inspiring to everyone there. As he said, \nthese situations are always complicated. We can always say, as we look \nat all the possible causes of such a tragedy, that even if we did \nsomething about that, even if we banned all guns, there would still be \nviolence or even if we provided better mental health treatment, there \nwould still be people who would break through and commit acts of \nviolence, and even if we removed all the stimuli to violence in our \nentertainment culture, still people would commit these acts. Of course, \nthat is true, but do we not have the capacity to intervene at the \ndifferent points in the story of this young man to stop this from \nhappening, at least once, again, and probably many more times? Of \ncourse we have that capacity.\n  I keep being taken back, as people say that human nature is violent--\nof course, there is violence that goes back to the beginning of \nrecorded history. We remember the two children of Adam and Eve. Cain \nkilled Abel in a terribly violent act. But I think we also have to be \ninstructed by what happened after that when God speaks to Cain and \nsays: Where is your brother?\n  Cain feigns ignorance and asks the question that echoes through the \nmillennia since then: Am I my brother's keeper?\n  God says to Cain, in Genesis: What have you done? We can hear in our \nminds' ears the voice of God in anger: What have you done? You have \nkilled your brother. You have killed my creation.\n  Then God says: Your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground.\n  I think in that the Bible instructs us--the words of God instruct \nus--that we are our brothers' keepers, we are our sisters' keepers and, \nof course, we are, most of all, our children's keepers. We can never \nsay, oh, people are violent and turn away. We have the capacity--\nparticularly we here, honored and privileged to serve in the Senate, \nserve in the House, serve in the White House--to do something about \nthis.\n  Somebody said to me, as the President said the other night, if we \nsave just one child's life by what we will do, it will have been worth \nit.\n  We can save a lot more than one child if we work together. I have \ntalked to people since Friday who said to me:\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\nWhy will this be any different? Nothing happened after Columbine or \nAurora or Virginia Tech or any of the other acts of mass violence in \nour society. I do not blame people for being skeptical. That is the \ntruth. We should have acted earlier, and we have not.\n  I went back. I proposed, with Senator McCain, Senator Byrd, Senator \nJack Reed, and a bunch of others, the creation of a national commission \non violence 3 weeks after Columbine in 1999. It passed the Senate, but \nit did not make it through the House in conference committee.\n  So I understand why people are skeptical, but that does not mean we \nshould not hear the cries of those children as the guns of that madman \nturned on them and actually see their blood on the ground on the floor \nof that schoolhouse until we get something done. We can prevent this \nfrom happening to people again. We can certainly prevent it from \nhappening to some people.\n  I see signs of hope around us; people, colleagues, who have been \nprotectors of gun rights saying, in the last few days: This has to \nchange. We have to come together and reason together and act together, \nand everything has to be on the table, including our gun laws.\n  There was a poll in the Washington Post today. It was very striking \nto note that for the first time, when people have been asked this \nquestion--and they have been asked it after a series of acts of mass \nviolence: Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, et cetera--do you think \nthis was an isolated act or does it say something about more troubling \nconditions in our society--I am paraphrasing--for the first time--every \nother time people said it was an isolated act of a madman or mad \npeople--this time they said it reflects a deeper problem in our \nsociety.\n  I believe what causes that change is that 20 of the victims in \nNewtown, CT, were young children, and there is not only a heartbreak \nacross our country about this, not only anger, but I think there is \nguilt, and we all ought to feel guilty because, as a society, what the \nattacks in Newtown say to us is that we have failed to fulfill what \nwould seem to be our most natural--natural law, if you will--\nresponsibility, which is to protect the safety and lives of our \nchildren.\n  So I hope we will act. There will be no better tribute, no better \nsource of consolation to the families who have lost loved ones. I have \nproposed a commission, as I did in 1999, because these are complicated \nquestions. In almost every one of these acts of mass violence, we have \na young man who is troubled. Clearly, in hindsight, family, friends, \nschoolmates say something was wrong with him. Very often--I have heard \nrumors about this being the case with Adam Lanza in Newtown; I do not \nknow for sure, so I am not saying it is any more than a rumor--very \noften, these young men have had an almost hypnotic involvement in some \nform of violence in our entertainment culture, particularly violent \nvideo games, and then they obtain guns and they go out and become not \njust troubled young men but mass murderers.\n  We need to try to intervene, particularly at the beginning with the \ntroubled young man and get him--or if it is a woman her--help quickly, \nand to make sure our mental health system is there to protect and offer \nthat help, and perhaps in our health system, insurance is there to \nguarantee payment will be made for that. It is complicated.\n  The impact of the entertainment culture is complicated as well. \nObviously, not every young person who plays a violent video game \nbecomes a killer. I know because I have spent a lot of time looking at \nthe social science--and it goes back decades--that there is a very \nclear pattern where young people who are involved in violence in the \nentertainment culture are more aggressive. Thank God, of course, almost \nnone of them become murderers. But some of them do, and we have to ask \nwhy.\n  Then, of course, we need to strengthen our gun laws. I hope either by \nexecutive action or legislative action we will convene such a \ncommission, but I want to make very clear I am not offering this idea \nas a substitute for any action we can take now, any action that the \nPresident can take now, for instance, with regard to the existing laws \nthat are aimed at preventing people who should not have guns from \nhaving them, keeping guns that really are military and are not part of \nhunting or sports shooting off the market--anything the President could \ndo, anything Congress could do.\n  I would support a restoration of the assault ban today.\n  These are weapons developed by our military originally, not by \nprivate industry for hunting or sports shooting purposes. They should \nnot be sold. We have the background checks in the Brady bill if you \nattempt to buy a gun from a licensed Federal firearms dealer. Why \nshouldn't that exist for people who buy a gun at a gun show, where, \nincidentally, terrorists we know have bought guns?\n  So anything we can do quickly, we ought to do, but I also think a \ncommission will make sure that we will not let the anger, the hurt, the \nguilt that we feel now dissipate with time or as a result of \nlegislative gridlock--yes, legislative gridlock again.\n  Remember Lincoln's words at Gettysburg, that these dead shall not \nhave died in vain. I think that should be our animating emotion and \nsense of purpose here, as reflected and I think led by the President's \nvery powerful words in Newtown on Sunday night.\n  I remember after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 all the work we did in \nWashington to create the Department of Homeland Security, the 9/11 \nCommission, the legislation, passing the legislation, implementing the \n9/11 Commission. A lot of work, bipartisan work, was done in Congress \nand in the executive branch to make those laws and to keep us a lot \nsafer, to prevent another 9/11 from happening. But I will tell you \nthis, Mr. President, my belief--and I was at the center of all of \nthis--those laws would not have been passed and enacted, and we would \nnot be safer today if it were not for the extraordinary commitment of \nthe families of people who were killed on 9/11 to get involved. They \ntalked truth to power, and when Members of Congress and members of the \nexecutive branch were reluctant to act and were falling back in all \npolitical ways, self-defensive ways, those families faced them, face to \nface, and some in power turned their faces away because they could not \ntake it. But, ultimately, those families brought about action.\n  These families in Newtown who have lost people--loved ones, \nchildren--will never be the same. I hope and pray they can come back to \nsome semblance of normalcy. I hope that some of them will have the \ncourage and the strength--which will take an enormous amount--to get \ninvolved in forcing our country to do whatever it can to stop anything \nlike this from happening again. But in the larger sense, we are all \nmembers of the family. This is the American family. Those 26 people--\nthose 20 children--were our children, our family members, and it is \nincumbent upon us now to summon not just the remorse and the guilt but \nthe will to act to stop this from happening again and to save the lives \nof our family members.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor for my \ncolleague and friend from Connecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut \nfor those very moving and important comments on the Senate floor at \nthis profoundly significant time in the history of our State and our \nNation.\n\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  I want to join my colleagues who have expressed their admiration for \nSenator Inouye and our sense of loss at his passing. I admired him \ndeeply as a patriot, a warfighter, a public servant, who was unstinting \nand unwavering in his commitment to our Constitution, the principles of \nequality and justice, and our national defense.\n  His loss is a loss for the country, but, particularly, personally, \nfor all of us who serve in this body. I knew him less well than \ncolleagues who have spoken eloquently, such as Senators Reid and Durbin \nand Boxer and Lieberman, and one of my regrets, as I stand here, is \nthat I did not have the time to know him better because he was such an \nextraordinary human being.\n  Perhaps one of the lessons for me personally is that time is short, \nas we all know, and we should make a greater effort in this body and \namong us in this profession to know our colleagues and to treasure \ntheir friendship.\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\n  I want to also thank my colleague from Connecticut for his very \nperceptive and powerful words on the tragedy in Newtown, CT, which \nbrings me to the floor today with such a heavy heart. I thank my \ncolleagues who have reached out to me, including the Senator from \nVermont, a great friend, Senators Klobuchar and Durbin and Bennet and \nso many others seeking to help Connecticut. The collegiality of this \nbody has been brought home to me in these days when others have sought \nto provide not only consolation but also suggestions for action.\n  One of my reasons for being on the floor today is to talk about \naction we can take. I want the families who are grieving now to know \nthat my standing here to talk about policy and action in no way means \nany disrespect or effort to intrude on their grieving and emotional \nrebuilding. But we know on Friday a tragedy befell the community of \nNewtown, CT, and that tragedy is expressed in S. Res. 621 and H. Res. \n833.\n  I thank my colleagues in both Houses for condemning the attack and \noffering their condolences to the people of Connecticut and, more \nimportantly, the people and families who suffered these losses most \ndirectly. I have spent the last 4 days--or a better part of them--in \nConnecticut. Those 4 days are a time that I do not want to relive, \never.\n  I first learned about this incident on Friday morning in the midst of \na normal day. I had events scheduled. I heard there was something wrong \nin the Danbury area.\n  As the details mounted, I left Hartford to go to Newtown and to the \nfirehouse in Sandy Hook. I arrived there as a public official, but what \nI saw was through the eyes of a parent.\n  The firehouse in Sandy Hook was where parents went to find out if \ntheir children were okay. The way they found out was that their \nchildren appeared, or they did not. After a while, some of the children \ncame. Some were reunited with their parents there or at the school, and \ntheir parents took them home, and others did not.\n  I will live forever with the sights and sounds of those parents as \nthey emerged--the cries and sobbing, the cries of grief and anguish, \nthe look on those faces.\n  The murderer blasted his way into the elementary school in Sandy Hook \narmed with a Bushmaster AR-15, an assault rifle; a 10mm Glock pistol; a \n9mm Sig Sauer; and with multiple magazines filled with hundreds of \nrounds, that he used in an execution-style massacre.\n  Wayne Carver, who is the State medical examiner for Connecticut, has \nbeen in that job for more than 30 years. He has seen it all. But he has \nsaid he has seen nothing like this ever. There were 20 small bodies \nripped apart, executed en masse.\n  There is no question evil came to Newtown, as Governor Malloy said \nthat day. Evil came in its starkest, most inhumane terms. But heroism \nalso came to Newtown.\n  The SWAT teams that went into that building actually saved lives. \nThey saved hundreds of lives of students and staff in the school \nbecause the murderer took his own life when he knew they were entering.\n  There is the heroism, of course, of the principal, teachers, and \nothers who ran toward the sound of gunfire. They ran toward danger to \nprotect their children, children who were 6 and 7, their faces now on \nthe front pages of newspapers with their stories inside.\n  There is the heroism of the State troopers who had to confirm the \nidentities of the victims for their families and stayed with those \nfamilies throughout the weekend.\n  There is the heroism of the community itself. Newtown is, indeed, a \nquintessential New England town. Everybody knows everybody else, which \nis a good thing but in a way also a bad thing because everyone's \nchildren knew the other children.\n  At the vigil Sunday night, two of the children who attend that school \ncame up to me to show me some of the necklaces they had made with blue \nbeads, 20 of them. There were 20 blue beads, each one for a child \nvictim, and 6 stars for the adults. This community is not only \nquintessentially New England, it is quintessentially American in its \nstrength, its resoluteness, its resiliency, its caring and courage.\n  Part of what has also inspired Newtown is the outpouring of support \nthey have received from all across America and all across the world. \nNever doubt the messages you have sent, the thoughts and prayers made a \ndifference to them. They truly have.\n  Newtown is a call for national reflection and for coming together. \nThis tragedy hit Connecticut, but the town of Newtown is supported by \nthe grief shared by all Americans, but it is also a call for action. It \nis the right time to ask what we can do to stop this sort of tragedy.\n  In recent years, there have been horrific shootings at Virginia Tech, \nin Aurora, in Oak Ridge, on university campuses, movie theaters, and in \nplaces of worship. There were many other places where unsuspecting \nAmericans, going about their everyday lives, had those lives cut short \nin a few minutes of slaughter.\n  In Newtown, a lone gunman was able to kill 20 elementary \nschoolchildren ranging from 6 to 7 years old. He killed the school's \nprincipal, the school psychologist, and four teachers.\n  Sadly, there have always been and there always will be mentally ill \npeople, mentally deranged or hateful people who want to lash out \nviolently at the world. We will never be able to stop all of them from \ndoing harm. But even if we cannot prevent all these tragedies, we must \nnot surrender and say we will do nothing to prevent any more of them.\n  In the last few days, everywhere I have gone in Newtown, people have \ncome up to me and said the same words over and over. ``We have to do \nsomething.'' People in law enforcement, families of victims, members of \nthe clergy again and again have said those words, ``We have to do \nsomething.''\n  That is my commitment today, to do something; in fact, to do \neverything I can as a Senator to press and prevent the next tragedy. As \na former law enforcement official, and as a father, I cannot do less.\n  There is no single law, no simple solution that will be a cure-all. \nBut there are sound, sensible steps we can take, some involving new \nlaws, some involving better enforcement of existing laws. Our local and \nState police, for example, and Federal agencies need more resources and \nsupport.\n  We need to do something to effectively ban assault weapons. I am \ntalking about weapons that are not designed for self-defense or hunting \nbut, rather, for killing and maiming human beings, often as many as \npossible, as fast as possible. These are weapons that are civilian \nversions of military weapons. There is no reason any such weapon should \nbe for sale today in America.\n  We need to do something also to ban high-capacity magazines, also \ninvolved in this mass murder. What real hunter uses or needs 30-round \nclips? What self-defense situation is served by them?\n  We need to do something to prevent mentally ill people and criminals \nfrom having firearms. I don't know whether better laws could have \nprevented the shooter in Newtown from getting his hands on the weapons \nhe used, but we must look at what we can do to identify such people \nwith serious mental problems before it is too late and provide \nintervention and treatment to take those weapons out of their hands.\n  Today, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System has \nprevented nearly 1.8 million attempted purchases of firearms by \nmentally ill people or criminals. Clearly, that alone was not enough to \nprevent a number of tragic shootings. But I think we can all agree it \nis good those sales were not completed, and right now only 60 percent \nof gun sales involve a background check. We should ensure that all \nfirearms sales involve a background check, including guns that are not \nsold by licensed dealers, and that those checks, wherever they are \ndone, are thorough and comprehensive.\n  Nothing here means we should trample on the second amendment. The \nSupreme Court has spoken clearly in the Heller case that law-abiding \nAmericans have constitutional rights to own firearms, whether for self-\nprotection, hunting, competitive shooting or any other proper purpose. \nThat is the law.\n  But the Supreme Court has also made clear the government can \nappropriately impose sensible regulations, as it can in many other \nareas of constitutional rights, on how firearms are used and purchased. \nEveryone would agree criminals and deranged people should not be able \nto get their hands on firearms.\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\n  On all these issues, we have to look for sensible common ground, \nrooted in common sense, and I believe there is room for people of good \nwill to work together to find it.\n\n  Even as I say that, I am mindful that issues involving the second \namendment rights and violence in the past fueled deep passions. \nSuspicion and passions have run deep and wide on both sides of this \ndebate, including in this Chamber, and there is a lot of distrust to \novercome.\n  I am here to keep faith with the people of Newtown who have grabbed \nmy arm and said, ``We have to do something.'' That is my commitment. I \nwill work with the President and my colleagues in the Senate regardless \nof party or geography. I will work with any organization that is \nwilling to engage in a thoughtful, constructive discussion about what \nsteps to take to avoid tragedy such as the Newtown shootings in the \nfuture.\n  I will work to find a solution to this crisis, because it is a \ncrisis, and I will not be deterred by any organization or campaign that \nuses scare tactics or intimidation. Because there was nothing more \nfrightening, nothing more horrifying, than looking into the eyes of the \nparents who came out of that firehouse in Sandy Hook who lost their \nbabies last Friday. That is any parent's worst nightmare.\n  I know there are some who say we can never do anything about the \nproblem of gun violence; that we are entrenched as a nation and so \npolarized as a political body that we will continue to wring our hands \nat every massacre and never take action. Yet sometimes events happen \nthat so horrify our country and our fellow citizens that they change \nthe nature of the discussion. They change the political ground under \nus. They are a tectonic shift, and I believe the massacre of the \ninnocent children and their loving teachers in Newtown is exactly such \nan event.\n  Yesterday, some of my Senate colleagues had the courage to join this \ncall for action and say publicly we cannot go on as before. I wish to \nthank, particularly, Senator Manchin and Senator Warner. Their heroic \nstance is an invitation, indeed a challenge, to every other Member of \nthe Senate to join in this common effort to find common ground and at \nlong last do something to stop the killing.\n  I also wish to thank, particularly, Senator Reid, our majority \nleader, for his leadership in calling for a meaningful and thoughtful \ndebate on gun violence.\n  ``We have to do something. We have to do something. We have to do \nsomething.'' That is what people in Newtown have beseeched me over and \nover. I believe the American people agree. This is our moment, and we \nare the people to do it. We can. I ask each of my colleagues to listen \nto those voices and to hear their own hearts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I wish to join my thoughts on those \nof the two Senators from Connecticut and the Senator who just spoke, \nSenator Blumenthal. He and I talked this weekend during these terrible \ntimes, and I told him the Judiciary Committee and the Department of \nJustice, on behalf of all the victims, were standing by to help them in \nany way they can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8103-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is the first day since Hawaii became \na State that it is not represented by Dan Inouye, either as a House \nMember or as Senator.\n  As I look at my dear friend's desk with the traditional white \nflowers, I can't tell you how much it pains me. He was one of the \ngreatest Members of this body ever to have served and a dear friend to \nso many of us. He was perhaps the best role model for public service \nany American could ask for. Senator Inouye's story is one of great \npassion for his people, commitment to his calling of public service, \nand dedication to finding a better way forward for all Americans, a \ntrue patriot.\n  A soldier in World War II, a veteran of the Armed Forces, he fought \nfor the freedom of the Nation he so loved and believed in. The Nation \nfinally recognized that, making him a recipient of our Congressional \nMedal of Honor.\n  As a representative of Hawaii, he dedicated his career to \nestablishing and solidifying a place for his State in Washington so \ngenerations of Hawaiians to come might know the benefits of what he did \nnot have, Federal support for such important causes such as higher \neducation, transportation, health care, and security. His advocacy was \nnever in vain, and the people of Hawaii benefited immensely from his \nservice.\n  But I think his efforts to bring people together is unmatched. The \ngrace with which he conducted his work should inspire all of us, as it \ndoes me. He was the man who could reach out to both sides of the aisle, \nmake friends and make peace. He poured his heart and soul into the \nSenate. He was first and foremost a person of the Senate, and we all \nfelt his passion and concern for the work of this body. There is no \ndoubt he is going to be greatly missed in these halls. He was a mentor. \nHe was a friend. We traveled together. Our wives were friends.\n\n  The reason I didn't speak last night, I opened my desk and looked \nagain--the desk I have now, this seat, I inherited from Dan Inouye--and \nhis name is inscribed in it. As the distinguished Acting President pro \ntempore knows, we inscribe our names in our desks, and Dan Inouye's is \nthere. When I looked at that last night I was overcome with emotion and \nso I did not speak then.\n  I realize I am delaying things a couple of minutes here, but when I \nthink of my friend and I think of his name, I remember he said he \nwanted to be remembered as having represented his people and all \nAmericans honestly and to the best of his ability. He filled that. He \nfilled that. We all know he gave his everything to the Senate, and his \nlegacy is for us to continue the work he has done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8103-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ADMINISTRATION OF OATH TO SENATOR PATRICK J.

INOUYE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my sadness over the \npassing of Senator Dan Inouye.\n  Dan Inouye came to this government, started his government service, \nat least, 60 years ago in the territorial legislature of Hawaii. He \ncame to Congress when Hawaii became a State in 1959, to the Senate in \n1963, and was second only, I guess, in service to Robert Byrd. He was a \nserious man, a solid man, a patriot, and one who always had a good \nspirit about how he conducted his affairs and how he related to other \nMembers of the Senate, to his constituents, and to the American people.\n  Dan had served in the most violent combat and was grievously wounded \nhimself. He was part of the 442d Regimental Combat Team, a 4,000-man \nunit that served in brutal combat. They were replaced 3\\1/2\\ times in \npersonnel to maintain their strength, with 14,000 having served in that \ncombat team during the brutal combat in Italy. There were 9,500 who \nreceived Purple Hearts and 21 Medal of Honors, including Senator \nInouye's Medal of Honor.\n  It was a remarkable time and a remarkable commitment Dan Inouye \ndemonstrated to the country he loved.\n  I know we will talk about his record, and I may do that later myself, \nbut I want to say what I think about Dan Inouye at his core. He shared \nwith us a few weeks ago at the prayer breakfast--and we don't quote \nwhat people say at that meeting--his feelings about war and his \nparticipation in it. It was one of the most moving presentations I \nthink any of us had heard, and it was so well received by the people \nthere. The truth is, Senator Inouye did not like war. He hated war. He \nknew the destructive power of war and how people suffered as a result \nof it, and he voted against a number of resolutions that would commit \nthe United States to military action.\n  But at the same time, there was no doubt, based on his ranking and \nchairmanship of the Subcommittee on Defense of the Appropriations \nCommittee over a period of years--decades--he was the person who \nalways, at bottom, could be counted on to ensure this Nation was well \ndefended; that we did not make mistakes.\n  He and Senator Ted Stevens had a unique relationship. When something \ndeveloped that was important for the Defense Department, and it \ninvolved a danger to our government or could do damage to the \nDepartment or they seriously needed something--and oftentimes in this \ngovernment, we can't respond and we don't respond effectively--Dan \nInouye and Ted Stevens would go in and it would be fixed. They \nunderstood that peace through strength was the best way to avoid war, \nand they felt a sense of great responsibility to ensure the Defense \nDepartment was not damaged on their watch. Their experience and their \njudgment was such they could tell the difference between whines and \ncomplaints and real danger to America's defense capability.\n  I would say that Dan Inouye has established a record that places him \namong the finest Senators ever to serve here, one of the finest human \nbeings to serve here, and I want to say, as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, how much I appreciated his particular commitment to \nensuring that America's defense capability remains second to none and \nhis willingness to take the steps necessary to maintain our defense at \nthe level we would want it to be.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, to begin, I want to take a few minutes to \nexpress my deepest sorrow for the events of last Friday. As a parent, \ngrandparent, and great-grandparent, I was horrified to hear the news of \nthe tragedy in Newtown, CT. My sadness remains for those who have lost \ntheir children and loved ones and for the quiet community that saw its \nsense of peace and well-being shattered through such a terrible act of \nviolence.\n  I, like almost everyone I know, am at a loss when it comes to making \nsense of such a horrible tragedy, and I won't try to do so today. All I \ncan do is offer my prayers and sympathies for those who lost their \nchildren, friends, and family members, and to the people of Newtown.\n  In my faith, we believe families are eternal; that those who have \nlost loved ones will one day be reunited with them. That belief has \nhelped me to cope with losses I have experienced over the years. And \nwhile I know nothing can relieve the pain of losing a child, I hope \nthis notion will bring the parents of those sweet innocent children \nsome measure of comfort.\n  Once again, I offer my heartfelt prayers and deepest sympathy to \nthose in Newtown and throughout the country who have cause to mourn \nthis day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8104-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8104-S8105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to pay tribute to a \nperson I loved, appreciated, and worked with for all these years--all \nof my 36 years in the Senate--and to bid a fond farewell to our dearly \ndeparted friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye.\n  In addition to being a distinguished United States Senator, Senator \nInouye was many things: a Pearl Harbor survivor, a Medal of Honor \nrecipient, a father, a grandfather, and a loving husband to his wife \nIrene.\n  As a volunteer with the Red Cross, young Daniel Inouye tended to the \nwounded in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  During World War II, when the Federal Government was placing \nthousands of his fellow Japanese Americans in internment camps, Senator \nInouye was one of many Asian Americans who petitioned the government \nfor the right to serve their country in the military. His petition was \nsuccessful, and he served heroically. In fact, the story of Senator \nInouye's military service has become the stuff of legend here in the \nSenate and throughout the country.\n  In 2000, Senator Inouye, along with 21 of his fellow Japanese-\nAmerican World War II veterans, was awarded the Medal of Honor, our \nNation's highest honor for valor.\n  In 1959, when Hawaii achieved statehood, he was elected the State's \nfirst full member of the House of Representatives. Three years later, \nin 1962, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he would serve for \nfive decades, the second longest tenure in this Chamber's history. I am \nhonored to have served with Senator Inouye throughout my entire Senate \nservice.\n  While he and I often found ourselves on different sides when it came \nto\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\nissues, I always knew him to be a man of principle and decency, and I \nnever doubted his commitment to the people of his State and to doing \nwhat he believed was right.\n  One of the few times we found ourselves on the same side came when \nour mutual friend, the late Senator Ted Stevens, asked us both for help \nwhen his character was called into question. Politically speaking, \nparticipating in Senator Stevens' trial held no benefit for Senator \nInouye. It would have been easy for Senator Inouye to deny his friend's \nrequest, and few would have blamed him for it. But that wasn't how \nSenator Inouye operated. Rather than letting a friend fend for himself, \nSenator Inouye showed great loyalty and characteristic integrity in his \nwillingness to testify to his friend's good character, and put his own \nreputation on the line in service of a friend. And I had a similar \nprivilege.\n  Both Senator Inouye and I were mystified by what happened in that \ntrial, and we were justified in our mystification when, finally, they \nhad to admit it was a trial that should never have been brought. All I \ncan say is I remember him testifying and I testified after he did, and \nI would mention that Colin Powell also testified as to Ted Stevens' \ncharacter. All three of us felt this was a besmirchment of a truly \nhonorable and decent man.\n  Once again, I am proud to have been Senator Inouye's colleague, but I \nam more proud and more pleased to have been his friend over all these \nyears. He actually showed me a great deal of concern, showed me a great \ndeal of friendship, and spent time with me when I needed particular \nhelp, and was there in many ways for not just me but for others as \nwell, one of the kindest, most decent, and honorable people I have ever \nmet. I express my deepest sympathies to his wife and family and their \nmany, many friends.\n  Daniel Inouye left an indelible mark on the Nation he loved so much \nand he will surely be missed. Aloha, my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8105-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATOR PAT LEAHY\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

INOUYE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I too rise to pay tribute to the great \nSenator Daniel Inouye.\n  First, I want to express my deep and most heartfelt condolences to \nSenator Inouye's family, his wife Irene, his daughter Jennifer, his son \nKen, Ken's wife Jessica, and their lovely little granddaughter Maggie. \nAnd to the people of Hawaii, also our condolences, because he loved \nthem dearly, and they reciprocated by sending him time and time back to \nthe Senate. I also want to express condolences to his very able and \ncapable staff, the other Inouye family, many of whom were among the \nlongest serving staff in the Senate, who were devoted to helping him \nhelp the people of Hawaii and helping the people of America. Hawaii and \nthe Nation have lost a great hero and a true patriot, and I have lost a \nreal good friend.\n  Senator Inouye was one of the great men of the Senate who welcomed me \nand helped me get started when I first came to the Senate. It is well \nknown that I was the first Democratic woman elected in her own right. \nWhen I came to the Senate there was only one other woman, Senator Nancy \nKassebaum of Kansas. But I said this, and I say today, though I was the \nonly Democratic woman, though I was all by myself: I was never alone \nbecause I had great men in the U.S. Senate who helped me get started \nand mentored me and taught me how to be an effective Senator.\n  Senator Inouye was in a group of those men who in the warmest, most \ngenerous, most helpful way welcomed me to the U.S. Senate. He helped me \nget on the powerful Appropriations Committee. He was my teacher. He was \nmy mentor.\n  He also had a wonderful way of communicating with all of us. And as \neach new class of Senators--and each new class of women Senators \narrived--he welcomed each and every one of us with the same warmth and \ngenerosity he showed to me.\n  We have a saying among us, the women of the Senate, which is that men \nof quality always stand up for us women fighting for equality. And Dan \nInouye was there every step of the way. When we wanted equal pay for \nequal work, he was there. When we wanted to be included in the \nprotocols at NIH and establish an Office of Women's Health, he was \nthere, issue after issue.\n  Last year, I had the wonderful honor of traveling to the Middle East \nwith Senator Inouye, and he admired the pin that I have on today. It is \nan eagle that many of the women in the Senate wear. There are those of \nvarious styles, of which we have a little collection. This one is from \nthe Smithsonian. He said, I love it. It is so pretty. I want to get one \nfor my wife.\n  Well, I don't know if Senator Inouye ever got it for his wife Irene, \nbut I say to my colleagues today, at an appropriate time, on behalf of \nthe women of the U.S. Senate, I will present this pin to Mrs. Inouye in \nhonor of her husband, our gift to her, because he gave so many gifts to \nus.\n  He was a lion in the Senate, a real American hero. Although gentle in \nstyle, he was a fierce warrior when it came to fighting for his Nation \nor standing up for Hawaii.\n  When he received his Medal of Honor, he was rising to the call of the \nsirens of Pearl Harbor, volunteering to serve his country, putting \naside his own dreams to be a physician. But he went on to be a healer \nof many wounds. He was decorated in World War II for saving his fellow \nsoldiers.\n  My experience with Senator Inouye as a friend was that he was a \ndevoted, dedicated public servant. He was Hawaii's first representative \nof the Nation's newest State. He was the first person of Japanese \nheritage ever to be elected to the Senate. Imagine, he himself knew \nwhat it was like to break barriers and to break boundaries. When he \ncame to the Senate, he cherished his love for Hawaii and its people. He \nfought tirelessly to improve their lives.\n  His style was one of absolute civility. He was the one who believed \nthat the decorum of the Senate enabled the Senate to do the people's \nbusiness. He was the essence of civility, and he showed that often good \nmanners was good politics, and that led to good politics. He did not \nargue the loudest; instead, he worked diligently. He marshaled his \narguments and with quiet determination won the day.\n  As a fellow appropriator, I saw that he loved his earmarks. He liked \nearmarks. And what did he do with those earmarks? I can tell you. He \nmade sure that we looked out for Indian tribes. He made sure we looked \nout for the poorest of the poor in Hawaii. He cleaned up a superfund \nsite that had been left by an old agricultural legacy. And he made sure \nthat children who needed help were able to get the education they \nneeded in a small community setting who might not have been able to do \nit.\n  Yes, he was the old school. And it was the old school that should \nteach us a lesson or two.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee for 41 years, he led us \nby example. He came in 1971 and became the chairman in 2009. Leading by \nexample, he showed how we can accomplish great things by working \ntogether. He saw we could have a stronger country, a stronger economy, \nand yet have a sense of frugality. He treated the minority party with \ngreat respect.\n  All have spoken about his legendary friendship with Senator Ted \nStevens, another World War II hero. But now, as Senator Cochran, \nserving as the ranking member--he called him his vice chairman, and I \nknow he was ready to reach out to Senator Shelby who assumed the role. \nHe knew we needed the input of all Senators to not only enact our bills \nbut to craft our bills.\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\n  He also served as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, the \nIndian Affairs Committee; he was the very first chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  There will be those who will read his resume. But when the history of \nHawaii and this man is written, I hope they say he didn't come here to \ngain fame, he didn't come here to do press releases or to be on talk \nshows. He came here to govern. He came here to the U.S. Senate, having \nfought for his country in World War II while even members of his own \nfamily had been held in an internment camp because of their Japanese \nheritage. But he was loyal and faithful from the day he took his oath \nto defend the Constitution as a young private all the way to the day \nhere now. He was a fierce defender of our military. For him, it was \nalways about the troops. And he never forgot what it was like to be \nfighting in a foreign land. That is why he was devoted to our veterans \nand to our health care. And we are devoted to the memory of Senator \nInouye.\n  So to an old-school war hero, let us give our final salute and a fond \naloha. But let's take the lessons learned from his great life and \nincorporate them in our very day here today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Inouye told me a story which I \nwish to repeat for our colleagues.\n  In 1973, George Gallup, the pollster, asked to come see him. This was \nat the height of the Watergate hearings. Back then, these \ninvestigations into President Nixon's Watergate break-in were consuming \nthe country. Then there were only three major television networks, plus \nthe Public Broadcasting System, and the Watergate hearings were \ntelevised from the Senate every single day, for several hours a day, on \nall four of those networks. So, almost everyone in the country watched \nthe Watergate hearings for weeks. They got to know Sam Ervin, the \nchairman. They got to know Howard Baker, the ranking Republican. But \nGeorge Gallup came to see Senator Inouye. And Senator Inouye said, I am \nglad to see you, but why do you come to see me?\n  He said, Senator, who would you say is the most recognized person in \nthe United States today? Senator Inouye said, Well, I am sure President \nNixon is. And Gallup said, That is right. But the second most \nrecognized person is Senator Dan Inouye.\n  Inouye said, Well, how could that be? George Gallup said, Well, \nSenator, I suspect so many Americans have never seen a United States \nSenator of Japanese ancestry with one arm and a distinguished voice and \npresence, and you have made an indelible impression on the American \npeople.\n  That was 1973. That was a long time ago. Since then, Dan Inouye made \nan indelible impression on a great many people around the world, and \nespecially on the 100 of us who serve here. He commanded our respect in \na remarkable way, in part because of his service in the war.\n  He and Bob Dole, our former colleague, were wounded at about the same \ntime in Europe and were in the same hospital recovering from \ntremendously serious wounds. Of course, Senator Inouye was later \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for that.\n  Senator Pryor was telling the story that when Senator Inouye was \nfinally elected to Congress, he wrote Senator Dole a note and said, I \nam here, where are you? Because both of them, when they were recovering \nfrom their war wounds, had determined that one day they wanted to serve \nin the United States Congress. Inouye got here first.\n  A few years ago, Senator Inouye and Senator Ted Stevens invited a \nnumber of us to go with them to China. It was quite an experience. \nSenator Stevens--of course, another World War II veteran--had flown the \nfirst cargo plane into what was then Peking, in 1944. Of course, \nSenator Inouye was well regarded in China for his service. So the group \nof Senators--there must have been a dozen of us of both parties--got \nmore time with Mr. Hu and Mr. Wu, the No. 1 and 2 leaders of China, \nthan the President of the United States nearly did. We were accorded \nevery courtesy possible because of the presence of Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens. They were like brothers. They called one another \nbrothers. They acted that way in private. They served that way in the \nSenate, as chairman and vice chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. Over a number of decades, they singlehandedly shaped our \nAmerican defense posture, and they did it with skill and patriotism and \nknowledge of our structure that very few could have.\n  Several Senators mentioned how bipartisan Dan Inouye was. He was of \nthe old school--not a bad school for today, in my point of view. He \ntreated each Senator with courtesy, even the newer Senators. He treated \neach Senator with a sense of equality, even those who were in the \nminority and not on his side of the aisle. He was always fair, he was \nalways courteous, and he always tried to do the right thing. He was a \ntextbook U.S. Senator.\n  He announced for reelection after his last election. I don't know his \nexact age at the time--maybe 85, 86. He will not be able to run for \nthat reelection now that he is gone, but he will be well remembered.\n  Not long ago, he spoke at our Wednesday morning Prayer Breakfast that \nwe have here. Usually we have 20 or 30 Senators. On the day he spoke, \nwe had maybe 60 or 70. We had Senators sitting on the windowsills, \nstanding around the back, just to hear what he had to say. I won't \nrepeat what he had to say because we don't talk about what goes on \nthere in public except to say he talked about his war experiences--and \nin a quiet way. He stood there for 10 or 15 minutes and explained those \nexperiences to us, most of whom had never had that sort of experience. \nIt gave us a new sense of him, and it increased our respect for him, if \nthat could have been possible.\n  I join with my colleagues to say Senator Dan Inouye was a patriot. He \nset the standard, really, for a U.S. Senator. He set the standard for a \nman or woman in our military fighting to defend his or her country. And \nhe set the standard as an individual who showed courtesy to everyone he \nmet. We will miss him. We honor him. And we give his family our \nexpressions of grief, but, more important, our great respect for our \ncolleague who today is gone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak until my comments \nare completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a mentor of \nmine in the Senate, Senator Daniel Inouye. The histories of my State \nand Senator Inouye's are closely connected. We both entered the Union \nat the same time, in 1959. As a matter of fact, I know as a kid growing \nup I was not sure if we had two Senators or three Senators because \nSenator Inouye's name was so well known throughout Alaska.\n  When our States were entered in 1959, there was opposition to both of \nus becoming States, but we have proven our opponents wrong. Thanks to \nDaniel Inouye, Hawaii has become a modern, prosperous State. Many \nAlaskans have a special fondness for the 50th State, especially, I have \nto say, at this time of the year when it is 40 below in Fairbanks.\n  Daniel Inouye began his public career and service at the age of 17 \nwhen he entered the Army after the attacks on Pearl Harbor. He served \nwith incredible distinction, earning the Nation's highest medal for \naction in Italy. As a Member of the Senate, Senator Inouye continued \nhis fierce defense of his State and his partnership with Alaska.\n  My predecessor, Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, knew Senator Inouye as \nhis brother. They worked together and produced much good for both our \nStates that will last for generations.\n  When I was elected to this office, Senator Inouye was one of the \nfirst Members to reach out to me to ask how he could help. The unique \nthing about Senator Inouye was always his quiet approach to all the \nissues. He provided me quiet advice and helped me learn how this place \nworks. Many times I would be down in the well waiting for the vote to \nbe tallied and Members to vote, and Senator Inouye would come in, stand \nat the edge there, and look up and just say: How is it going, Alaska? \nWe would have a brief conversation. Usually his words would have \nincredible insight. They may not even have\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\nbeen relevant to the topic we were voting on, but he would say \nsomething to me about something he knew I was working on and just share \na few words.\n  I know the first people of Alaska will especially remember him for \nhis dedication to their success. He met with Alaskan Native peoples \nduring their visits to Washington as often--and I would say even more \noften--as the Alaskan Members of the House and Senate. They made a \npoint to stop by his office on a regular occasion to talk to him about \nwhat happened in the past and what was going on today and what they \nlooked for in the future.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Inouye was in Alaska at my invitation--his \nlast trip to Alaska. He told a memorable story about his support of the \ntrans-Alaska oil pipeline, which was controversial when he supported it \nand its construction. Senator Inouye has a unique style of how to tell \nstories. You have to just pay attention and listen. They are not wordy, \njust to the point. Senator Inouye told this story, told by opponents of \nthe pipeline, that it would destroy the caribou that lived in Alaska's \nNorth Slope. This is what he was told over and over.\n  On his last trip, he was in front of a group of people. I was anxious \nas he started to talk. He said: I have this story to tell you. He \ntalked about this time of controversy about the Alaska North Slope and \nthe oil pipeline, the caribou and what was happening, the destruction \nthat may occur based on what he was hearing. But he was a strong \nsupporter of the pipeline. In his words, here is how he actually said \nit. In fact, he said, the warm oil going through the pipeline heats the \nground, so grass grows year round. The caribou come around to eat the \ngrass and, in his words, ``make love,'' and the caribou population has \ngrown threefold. Who was I to let facts spoil that wonderful story by \nSenator Inouye and get in the way of its telling?\n  But he has done enormous work for our Alaskan people and Alaska in \ntotal, the work he did that he described to me when he went out to \nrural Alaska many years ago and saw the deplorable conditions of our \nwater and sewer, saw an important effort to preserve not only the \nlanguages of Alaska but also Hawaii. Yes, like Hawaii, Alaskans loved \nour earmarks and we still love them. He was an adamant proponent of \nearmarks, making sure that, as mentioned by Senator Mikulski, they went \nfor the right reasons. As was also mentioned, in his defense of this \ncountry and his personal heroic actions, his ongoing everyday work he \ndid to shape the national defense and really international defense, it \nwas an incredible sight to watch him in action.\n  I will always remember Daniel Inouye for his truly hearty laugh, \nready smile, his partnership with my State of Alaska, and his \ndedication to his State--truly a silent giant.\n  My condolences go to his wife Irene and the entire Inouye family. We \nwill miss him greatly. When we come down to the Chamber every day, we \nget the calendar of business, this one dated today. You look on the \nlist of all the committees, and you see the chairman and the Members. \nBut today his name is not there after 41 years.\n  My heart goes out to him--truly the silent giant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to pay tribute to an \nAmerican hero, a great Senator, an amazing man, and a dear friend, \nSenator Danny Inouye.\n  Senator Inouye dedicated his life to public service, and through his \nhard and faithful work, he has left his Nation and the State that he \nloved so dearly far better in so many ways.\n  We will all hear a lot in the days ahead about the barriers Danny \nbroke down during the course of his life. We will hear about his \nservice in times of war and in peace, about his heroism, about his love \nfor his family and State and country. We will hear about the admiration \nand respect he earned from so many of us here in the Senate, on both \nsides of the aisle, over the course of a long and very historic career.\n  What I want to focus on for a minute today is the Danny Inouye who \nhas been there for me as friend and mentor for the past 20 years, who \nhas been a shining light in this Chamber and has set an example for all \nof us who measure our work not simply in words but in actions.\n  Senator Inouye was certainly not the loudest Member of this Chamber. \nHe was certainly not the most verbose. He was not a Senator who spent \nhis time making long-winded speeches. But through his quiet resolve, \nhis understated strength, and his commitment to do the right thing no \nmatter what, he was able to accomplish so much.\n  Senator Inouye led the Appropriations Committee through difficult \ntimes with grace and incredible effectiveness. The partisan rancor that \ntoo often dominates this city was unacceptable to him, and he made that \nclear to all of us. Danny's focus was on people, on the infrastructure \non which they depended in their communities, on the most vulnerable, on \nour military families, and on the State of Hawaii, for if Danny Inouye \nwas a giant here in the Senate, he was a mountain back home. Hawaii \nwould not be Hawaii without Danny Inouye. He fought for his State. He \nwould not allow it to be ignored, and he made it a better place to live \nand work for generations to come.\n  As the Senator of another State far from Washington, DC, I learned a \nlot from Senator Inouye about how to advocate for the people who elect \nyou and how to make sure they never get lost in the mix. Through his \nquiet and shining example, we all learned a bit more about \nbipartisanship.\n  I so remember Danny huddling here on the floor, working closely with \nhis good friend Senator Stevens from Alaska. We all learned a bit more \nabout effectiveness. He knew how to get things done, more than anyone I \nhave seen before or since. We all learned a bit more about humanity.\n  You would never hear Danny talk about himself. We all learned a bit \nmore about respect, about kindness toward all, not just those who agree \nwith you.\n  Danny helped us all remember every single day why he came here in the \nfirst place. I cannot tell you how many times Danny would stand his \nground on issues that others would have given up on, simply because he \nknew the impact it would have on real people. He knew this was about so \nmuch more than politics or legislative games; it was about helping \npeople and solving their problems and delivering for our communities \nand our Nation.\n  Danny Inouye impressed me every day for 20 years, but nothing \nimpressed me more than his love and commitment to his family. I just \ngot off the phone a few minutes ago with his wife Irene and expressed \nmy condolences. She is such a gracious lady.\n  Danny will be missed terribly, but he has left so much for us to \nremember him by: his legislative achievements, of course, the roads \nthat would not have been built had he not been here, the military bases \nthat wouldn't have existed had he not fought so hard for them, the \nports and bridges and trains that would have been less safe had he not \nbeen there to move legislation that strengthened them--so much more. \nBut Danny will be remembered far beyond his many tangible achievements. \nHe will live on through the values he embodied and spread; through the \nprinciples he stood for and shared; through his family, who loved him \ndearly; through the people who will never forget his advocacy; through \nthe country he sacrificed so much for; and of course through all of us \nwho are forever better simply for having served with the greatest \nSenator of all, Senator Dan Inouye.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on behalf of the people of Georgia, the \nUnited States of America, and the 99 Members of the Senate, I want to \npause to pay tribute to the family of Dan Inouye. When a great football \ncoach passes away and players are interviewed and asked what kind of \ncoach he was, they will say he was a player's coach. When great \ngenerals are lost and the people who go to the funeral ask what kind of \ngeneral he was, they say he was a soldier's general.\n  I am here to pay tribute to a Senator's Senator. He was a great role \nmodel for me. He came here when Hawaii first became a State, and he was \nhere ever since. He influenced the lives of not a few but of many.\n  I got an e-mail from Mike Mattingly, a U.S. Senator who was elected \nin 1980.\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\nHe said: Please remember when you are on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nto express the love and affection my wife Leslie and I have for a great \nAmerican, Dan Inouye.\n  I share that same affection. I know I owe a lot of whatever success I \nhave had in the Senate to learning from his patience, guidance, \ntemperament, and also his determination. Yesterday, I was told his last \nword was aloha, but we have to remember that was always the first word \nwe heard from Dan Inouye as well because he meant it in a welcoming, \nfriendly way.\n  I want to follow up on what Senator Alexander said earlier. I too was \nat the Prayer Breakfast when Dan Inouye was there. It was the largest \ncrowd we ever had, and it was not because invitations went out but \nbecause Dan Inouye was going to be there. Everybody there was \nmesmerized by his candor, by his life, and by his commitment. We don't \ndiscuss what goes on inside those rooms, and I will not here, except to \nsay that when Dan Inouye opened his heart, it was as big and rich a \nheart as the one we have all seen in the Senate.\n  To his loved ones, the State of Hawaii, and the people of America, we \nhave lost a great man. We have all been better off for knowing him, \nloving him, and serving with him. I pay tribute to the life and times \nof a great American hero, Dan Inouye.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nof Senator Isakson. I thank him and all of my colleagues who have come \nto the floor to eulogize Senator Danny Inouye. The Senate and our \nNation has lost an unsung hero. He was heroic in military valor, \nreceiving the Nation's highest honor, the Medal of Honor. He was heroic \nas the one chosen to lead with dignity in inquiries seeking the truth \nduring our most challenging times. He was a tireless guardian of our \nnational security and champion to the men and women who put their lives \nat risk to protect the United States and whose legislative achievements \nhave been simply remarkable. All this from a man who always gave others \ncredit and never sought the spotlight.\n  Yesterday Senator John McCain from Arizona--a hero in his own right--\nreflected on the passing of Senator Inouye: Today, the Senate, America, \nand especially his beloved citizens of Hawaii, lost a unique, brave, \nand wonderful legislator. He was a man who brought the most unique \ncredentials to this institution--I would argue--of probably anyone who \nhas ever served in this very diverse body.\n  Senator McCain certainly hit the nail on the head.\n  He went on to say: In Hawaii there was a group of young Japanese \nAmericans who decided they wanted to serve their country in uniform. \nOne of the most well-known, famous, and highly decorated units of World \nWar II was the battalion in which Dan Inouye served.\n  Dan Inouye was a proud member of his battalion. In fierce combat, he \nwas gravely wounded on the battlefield and was brought home. He, as we \nall know, lost his arm as a result of one of the wounds he sustained.\n  Senator McCain went on to point out that he went to the Veterans \nHospital in Chicago where a person in the same ward was an American \nArmy second lieutenant who had also been wounded seriously in combat in \nItaly, 2LT Bob Dole of Kansas. Bob Dole is a man who still represents \nthe very best we have in Kansas, our country, and he did such a great \njob as leader of this body. Their friendship has lasted to this day.\n  Both men were gravely wounded, both were certainly dedicated to serve \ntheir country, and both served with distinction. The friendship and the \nbonds of friendship that were forged in that hospital between Bob and \nDan were unique and also enduring.\n  Yesterday, Senator Danny Akaka also pointed out that his colleague \nfrom his native State was a true patriot and American hero in every \nsense and at this time in Hawaii, the greatest leader.\n  Then Danny Akaka said that it is an incredible understatement to call \nhim an institution. This Chamber will never be the same without him. He \nalso said Danny Inouye leaves behind a list of accomplishments unlikely \nto ever be paralleled. His lifelong dedication and hard work in the \nname of his beloved country, the United States of America, influenced \nevery part of his life and set him apart--even in the Senate.\n  Today will be the first day since Hawaii became a State in 1959 that \nDanny Inouye will not be representing us in the Congress. Every child \nborn in Hawaii will learn of Danny Inouye, a man who changed the \nislands forever.\n  Senator Akaka then went on to say he was praying for his wife Irene, \nhis son Ken, his daughter-in-law Jessica, his stepdaughter Jennifer, \nand granddaughter Maggie, who was the apple of his eye.\n  Like so many, with Danny's untimely passing, I have lost a very dear \nfriend. In truth, as an institution, every Senator in the Senate lost a \ndear friend. We lost one of the last institutional flames of the \nSenate.\n  Upon reflection, the occasions I have had the privilege to be with \nDanny also represented my personal career highlights. There were codels \nwith Senator Ted Stevens, affectionately called Uncle Ted. Danny always \nhad T-shirts made that said ``I survived Codel Stevens.'' He took us to \nAntarctica, North Korea, the Russian Far and wild East, and any number \nof places of national interest that nobody else would go. As the song \nsays, through the bushes and brambles where a rabbit wouldn't go.\n  Danny was the personification of those who get things done the \neffective way. He stayed in the background until it was time to take \ncharge and then gave others the credit. I will always remember his \nsonorous, basso profundo voice advising the North Koreans at one point \nduring a trip to make P'anmunjom and the 38th parallel a tourist site--\nnot a shooting gallery.\n  In the Russian Far East we traveled to Sakhalin Island, with \nmountains and raw materials that rivaled Alaska and where locals say \nthere are still saber-toothed tigers north of the island. Danny, while \nvisiting with staff, went into detail about his many travels, with a \nlittle fact and fiction mixed in, all with a twinkle in his eye.\n  I also remember while in the city of Khabarovsk in the Russian Far \nEast--we were at a hotel. Of all the hotels in the Russian Far East, \nthis one had to be one of the last on the list.\n  As we went into our rooms, I discovered that my bed was a wooden \nframe with just straps--no mattress, one blanket, and no pillow. I \nthought, being a junior member of this codel, this was something they \nassigned to me. So I went down the hall with my special key in hand and \nmy special ID that was required in that part of the world and knocked \non Danny's door. He said: How can I be of service to you, dear friend?\n  I said that I wanted to look at his accommodations, thinking, of \ncourse, he would have a bed. There was a wooden bed with the same kind \nof accommodations--no mattress, straps, and just one blanket. He said: \nWhy are you interested in that bed?\n  I said: Well, I thought being a junior Member that things might be \nbetter in your quarters.\n  He got a big kick out of that. He always reminded me of that at \nvarious times when I would get a little upset about anything.\n  At any rate, it is not an understatement with regard to his \nleadership, bipartisanship, integrity, and achievement. It would serve \nevery Member of this Senate to ask: What would Danny Inouye want us to \ndo?\n  In today's Washington Post there was a reference to the keynote \nspeech that Senator Inouye gave in Chicago. It was a period of unrest \nafter the assassinations of Senator Robert Kennedy and Rev. Martin \nLuther King--troubling times, indeed. Speaking not as a Democrat but as \na citizen disturbed by unprecedented violence, Senator Inouye described \na ``troubling loss of faith among Americans.''\n  He went on to say: I do not mean a loss of religious faith, I mean a \nloss of faith in our country, its purposes, and its institutions. I \nmean a retreat from the responsibilities of citizenship.\n  Danny called for Americans to rebuild their trust in government--an \nextraordinary statement from a man whose people had suffered grave \ninjustices at the hands of government.\n  The article went on to say that Senator Inouye's remarks were \nimmediately overshadowed by events at that convention, but his speech \nwas truly remarkable. It was a speech that drew\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\nlittle attention then and is even less remembered now.\n  My colleagues, Danny's speech should be required reading today given \nthe recent tragedies. It was just last week that I was asked to speak \non Senator Inouye's behalf at an event concerning the proposed \nEisenhower Memorial. It is a joint bipartisan effort that has taken far \ntoo long to bring to fruition. In the cloakroom the day before we had \none of our many discussions where he grabbed my hand and looked me in \nthe eye and said: You and I probably vote differently 80 percent of the \ntime, but in all of our mutual efforts and all of our travels, I have \nconsidered you a brother.\n  I didn't know what to do. I responded with a tear in my eye, and I \nsaid: I love you, Danny Inouye.\n  And he said: I love you too.\n  What a wonderful thing to hear from a true American hero in every \nrespect. It has been a privilege and an honor to serve with such a \nremarkable and truly humble man.\n  I also want to thank his wonderful staff in working with my staff on \nso many mutual projects.\n  Aloha, my dear friend. I will miss you every day.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, there are few times in the history of \nthis institution when one Senator, a singularly iconic leader, comes \nalong and reminds us of what it means to be a U.S. Senator and what it \nmeans to represent the very best of what this Nation stands for and to \ndo it, as he always did, with the utmost dignity, honor, pride, and \nintegrity.\n  I am deeply saddened to have to speak to the passing of a true \nAmerican hero. He was someone who inspired so many of us in the Senate. \nHis ideals and sense of justice were always on display.\n  The passing of Senator Inouye leaves a painful void in the leadership \nof this body. In so many ways, the life and sacrifice of Senator Inouye \nembodies the essence of the ``greatest generation.''\n  Even when faced with the suffering, indignity, and humiliation of an \ninternment camp, he did not allow his heart to be turned or his love \nand commitment to his country to be diminished. Justice was a constant \ntheme in his life. He represented the challenges faced by his Hawaiian \npeople since statehood, when he became its first representative in the \nU.S. Congress.\n  We had a close bond when it came to our concern for minorities in our \ncountry. Because of the struggles in his life, he understood the \nstruggles in both of our communities. He felt a kinship to the Hispanic \ncommunity and shared the community's hopes and aspirations. In recent \nconversations, I know from his comments that he understood the growing \nimportance of the Hispanic community and the benefit of advancing their \ninterests within American society. He lived it, he understood it, he \nknew.\n  We worked together on the recognition of Filipino veterans--something \nhe was very passionate about--and he thanked me most graciously, as \nalways, for my interest and for my commitment to working with him on an \nissue so dear to his heart.\n  These are just a few stories of a man who led a quintessentially \nAmerican life. I know there are thousands more stories to be told, some \nof which have already been told on the Senate floor, but the real story \nis that this was a man who sacrificed for his country, met the \nchallenges it presented, but ultimately, because of a kind heart and \nloyalty to the ideals we profess as Americans, he became one of the \nmost important, yet most humble, leaders in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Inouye and his life and deeds remind us what it means to be \nan American hero, a war hero who carried the burden of his service with \nhim all of his life. His courage, his patriotism, and his respect for \nthe values he fought for informed his views and his votes in this \nChamber.\n  The Senate is sadly diminished today with the passing of one of our \nmost respected and iconic leaders--a hero, a powerful voice for reason, \nrationality, and common sense when reason, rationality, and common \nsense are too often in short supply. He will be missed not only by all \nof us who had the privilege to serve with him but by a nation that \nneeds more leaders like him.\n  We, all of us, remember his lasting influence, his way of making us \nlook into the heart of the matter without prejudice or preconceived \npolitical impressions. He knew how to get to the crux of an issue, and \nhe led the way so many times for the rest of us. We followed his lead, \nand the Nation is better for it.\n  All of us who worked with him as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee respected his word and his commitment to fairness. He was \nalways willing to listen, always willing to hear your side, always \nwilling to reach out across the aisle for what he believed was right.\n  Most recently, he was the voice of support and wisdom in our efforts \nto secure disaster relief for my home State of New Jersey. He \nempathized with the needs of New Jerseyans, just as he addressed the \nneeds of Hawaiians for decades. There is no more gracious man than Dan \nInouye, no one who was as dignified and respectful than the senior \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and his family and to the \npeople of Hawaii today. We have lost an incredibly great man.\n  Mahalo, my friend, until we meet again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8109-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

INOUYE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise this sad day to comment on the \npassing of a great patriot, Senator Daniel Inouye. He fought for his \ncountry as part of the Greatest Generation and served his State with \ndistinction for more than 50 years.\n  We were all honored to know him and blessed by his sacrifice in \ndefense of American freedom. We served together on the Armed Services \nCommittee and later on the Appropriations Committee as well. Danny's \ninsight was invaluable to our Nation's defense and military policy. He \ndid make America stronger.\n  I had the pleasure of working with him when we traveled together to \nBosnia to visit our troops in the very early stages of that conflict. \nWe later went to the Middle East on a CODEL with Senator Stevens as \nwell. One of the pictures in my office is of Senator Stevens, Senator \nInouye, Senator Snowe, and myself in our helmets and flak jackets the \nfirst time we flew into Sarajevo in the early 1990s, when the Serbs had \nstill been shooting from the hills into the airport.\n  In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, Senator \nInouye and a number of other World War II veterans gathered at the \nSmithsonian to reminisce about their time in battle.\n  Senator Inouye recalled the morning of December 7 at Pearl Harbor, \nwhen he recognized that the men in the Japanese planes looked like him, \nand he said he knew then his life would never be the same.\n  As soon as the Army permitted Japanese Americans to volunteer, he \nsigned up and ventured to the mainland of the United States for the \nfirst time in his life. He and his fellow Hawaiians of Japanese descent \nworried about how they would be treated in the United States but, as he \nrecalled it, they encountered kindness and respect at every stop their \ntrain made.\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n  By the time he finished his training and prepared to depart for \nEurope, he said he had learned this was truly a country worth dying for \nand certainly one worth sacrificing an arm in order to preserve our \nfreedom and our way of life. He did lose his arm, and it was during \nthis time that he also distinguished himself to earn the Congressional \nMedal of Honor, the highest military award in our country for valor.\n  There is often talk of partisan acrimony in Washington, but we know \nstrong friendships can form across party lines. Senator Inouye and \nSenator Ted Stevens had such a friendship. They were both war heroes \nfrom the last two States to join the Union, and they both recognized \nand guarded the congressional prerogatives under our Constitution to \nplay the primary role in determining appropriations to fund the \ngovernment.\n  When they were the two senior Senators on the Appropriations \nCommittee and on the Commerce Committee, they considered themselves as \ncochairs and officially designated each other as that. When control of \nthe Senate changed hands, it was not unusual for one to retain key \nmembers of the other's staff.\n  So today, I add mine to the many voices mourning his passing and say \nto his family: You are in our thoughts and prayers.\n  Danny Inouye was someone in our Senate whom I think we should all \nstrive to be; that is, he was a warrior, but he was a gentleman. He was \na man who was loyal to the core for not only his beliefs but also his \nfriends, and if he gave his word, his word was good. He is someone whom \nevery one of us who knew him cared for and regarded as a giant among \nus. In fact, I would say the Senate has lost a gentle giant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join with Senator Hutchison in paying \ntribute to Senator Daniel K. Inouye.\n  I rise to pay tribute to our dear colleague. Senator Inouye was not \none of the tallest Senators; in fact, he had a slight build and a quiet \ndemeanor. But he was a giant. He will be missed by all in the Senate. \nThe people of his beloved Hawaii will miss him. All Americans will miss \nhim.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Senator \nInouye was declared an enemy alien because of his Japanese ancestry. \nBut in 1943, when the U.S. Army dropped its enlistment ban on Japanese \nAmericans, he enlisted in the Army and volunteered to be part of the \n442nd Regimental Combat Team.\n  The 442nd became the most highly decorated infantry regiment in the \nhistory of the U.S. Army. The 442nd, known by its motto, ``Go for \nBroke,'' was awarded eight Presidential Unit Citations and 21 of its \nmembers, including Senator Inouye, were awarded the Medal of Honor for \ntheir heroism during World War II.\n  Following World War II, Senator Inouye finished his undergraduate \nstudies at the University of Hawaii and then earned a law degree from \nGeorge Washington University. In 1953, he was elected to the Hawaii \nTerritorial House of Representatives and was immediately elected \nmajority leader. He served two terms there and was elected to the \nHawaii Territorial Senate in 1957. Midway through his first term in the \nTerritorial Senate, Hawaii achieved statehood. He won a seat in the \nHouse of Representatives as Hawaii's first full Member and took office \non August 21, 1959, the same date Hawaii became a State, and he was \nreelected in 1960.\n  Then, in 1962, he was elected to the Senate and was reelected eight \ntimes, only once with less than 69 percent of the vote. Senator Inouye \nhad been in the Congress since Hawaii became a State. He was the second \nlongest serving Senator in our Nation's history, and he served with \ndistinction, just as he served with distinction in the U.S. Army.\n  Others on this floor have already detailed his bravery in battle, his \nservice on the Watergate and Iran-Contra Committees and his \naccomplishments as the first chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence and as chairman of the Commerce and Appropriations \nCommittees. I would like to highlight his work on behalf of the victims \nof racial and economic and social inequality and his commitment to \nmaking the Senate operate as the Founding Fathers envisioned.\n  A statement on Senator Inouye's Web site says: ``Dan Inouye was \nalways among the first to speak out against injustice whether interned \nJapanese Americans, Filipino World War II veterans, Native Americans \nand Native Hawaiians.'' How true.\n  A few hundred yards from this Chamber is the Smithsonian's \nmagnificent National Museum of the American Indian. Senator Inouye \nintroduced the legislation to create that museum and fought for Native \nAmerican and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander recognition and \nrights and restitution as chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  In the Senate, Senator Inouye treated all his colleagues with respect \nand courtesy and always reached across the aisle to forge bipartisan \nsolutions to our Nation's biggest challenges. His friendship with \nformer Republican leader Bob Dole, whom he met while the two of them \nwere recuperating from grievous combat injuries--along with, I might \nsay, another wounded veteran who became a giant in the Senate, Senator \nPhilip Hart of Michigan--serves as an example we should strive to \nemulate. He was a member of the so-called Gang of 14, again reaching \nacross the aisle at a time when partisan tempers were particularly \nhigh.\n  There are few--if any--Americans who have been more heroic in battle, \nmore accomplished as a public servant, more dedicated to family and \ncountry and humanity than Daniel K. Inouye. Yet he was also one of the \nmost humble and self-effacing people. What a tremendous example of a \nlife well lived he has left for all of us as we mourn his death, \ncelebrate his life, and give thanks for his service to the people of \nHawaii, the Senate, and the United States of America.\n  To Senator Inouye we say aloha.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate--both as a legislative body and \nas a family--is in mourning today after the passing of its most senior \nand revered Member, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.\n  In his final days, Senator Inouye was asked how he wanted to be \nremembered. He replied, with characteristic modesty:\n\n       I represented the people of Hawaii and this nation honestly \n     and to the best of my ability. I think I did OK.\n\n  With similar understatement, speaking about the extraordinary act of \nheroism in combat for which he was awarded the Congressional Medal of \nHonor, he explained that it was ``a case of temporary insanity.''\n  Modesty and reserve were trademark qualities of our beloved Danny \nInouye. But we can speak more forthrightly about this very \nextraordinary person.\n  Yes, Senator Inouye represented the people of Hawaii and this Nation \nhonestly and to best of his ability. But he did not do just ``OK.'' \nDaniel Inouye was a truly great American, a public servant of \nextraordinary accomplishment. His qualities of character and conscience \nand steadfastness have set the standard in the Senate for over five \ndecades.\n  Think about this. In 1973 and 1974, as a Senate Select Committee \ninvestigated the crimes of Watergate, which Senator did we count on to \ntake charge with tough but fair questioning of those involved?\n  In 1976, after revelations of abuse of power by the CIA and the FBI, \nwhich Senator did we count on to oversee reforms as first chairman of \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence? Of course, we counted on Senator \nInouye.\n  In 1987, as the Iran-Contra scandal rocked the Reagan administration, \nwhich Senator did we count on to lead a tough but fair inquiry as \nchairman of the select committee appointed to investigate the affair? \nOf course, we counted on Senator Inouye.\n  Time and again, over seven decades, the United States of America has \ncounted on Daniel Inouye, and he always delivered. He always responded \nto\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nthe call of duty with courage, selflessness, and excellence.\n  As we all know, during the Second World War, Dan served in the famed, \nall-Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team. After losing his right arm and \nsustaining other grave injuries in combat, he spent 2 years in Army \nhospitals. At one of those hospitals he met two other wounded veterans: \na soldier from Kansas named Bob Dole and a Michigan boy named Philip \nHart. All three would go on to become giants of Senate history.\n  It is difficult to imagine, but after returning from the war, LT \nDaniel Inouye was wearing an empty right sleeve pinned to his Army \nuniform and was denied service at a San Francisco barbershop. The \nbarber dismissed him with the words, ``We don't serve Japs here.'' One \nof Daniel Inouye's great legacies in his successful fight to defeat \nthat brand of racism and discrimination was his successful fight \nagainst any form of discrimination against anyone, especially people \nwith disabilities. Throughout his political career, he fought for civil \nrights and social justice not only for Japanese Americans but for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I have lost not only a friend of nearly four decades \nbut also my chairman on the Committee on Appropriations and its \nSubcommittee on Defense. Senator Inouye was well known as a stalwart \nadvocate for national defense and for veterans. He also fought very \npassionately to advance education, the National Institutes of Health, \nand other programs in the jurisdiction of my Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.\n  I will never forget what Senator Inouye said one time in a meeting in \nwhich my bill on labor, health and human services, education, NIH, the \nCenters for Disease Control--all of the things that are in that bill \ncame forward. Remember, Senator Inouye was at that time the chairman of \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and he said something I will \nnever forget.\n  He said:\n\n       I chair the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. That is \n     the subcommittee that defends America.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Senator Harkin chairs the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and \n     Human Services, and Education. That is the subcommittee that \n     defines America.\n\n  So Senator Inouye was not a one-dimensional person. He was not just \nsomeone who fought for our veterans and fought for the strong defense \nof our country. I also remember him saying one time--repeating the \nfamous words of President Truman--that the strength of America comes \nnot just from the number of tanks, guns, and war planes we have but \nfrom the health, welfare, and education of our people.\n  In tributes on the floor yesterday and today, colleagues are \nremembering Dan Inouye as one of the greatest Senators of our time, and \nindeed he was. But knowing Dan and the values he held dear, he would \nwant no greater tribute than to be remembered as a loyal friend, a man \nof honor, decency, and humility. Senator Inouye was that and much more.\n  Senator Inouye was the finest of men. For half a century, the Senate \nhas been graced by his dignified and noble presence. It will not be the \nsame without him. We will miss our friend Daniel Inouye very, very \nmuch.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor now to bid farewell to \none of the Senate's most respected Members, Senator Olympia Snowe from \nthe great State of Maine. She chose to retire this year after a \ndistinguished career in public service spanning nearly four decades, \nfirst in the Maine Legislature, 6 years in the U.S. House, and the last \n18 years here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Throughout this remarkable career, she has been respected for her \nindependence, always putting her values and country ahead of party and \npartisanship. She can, of course, be a very persuasive advocate for the \nconservative causes she holds dear, but, as we all know and appreciate, \nshe is willing to buck party loyalty when she believes it is in error \nor when she believes in what is better for our country. And our future \ndepends on bipartisanship. I cite, for example, when she voted in favor \nof the Recovery Act and the Dodd-Frank reform of Wall Street.\n  I especially admire Senator Snowe's talent for reaching across the \naisle and building bridges in order to get things done. On that score, \nshe has represented the United States and her State of Maine at her \nvery best, and that is just one of the many reasons why we are sad that \nshe has chosen, voluntarily, to retire.\n  Olympia Snowe has been a wonderful colleague and friend, always \ncongenial, always willing to listen, always willing to examine \ndifferent sides of an issue. What more could we ask of any U.S. \nSenator? We have been fortunate to have had a Senator of her high \ncaliber, intelligence, and character in this body for the last 18 \nyears. I join with the entire Senate family in wishing her and John the \nvery best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  Mr. President, in these closing days of the 112th Congress, the \nSenate is saying farewell to one of our most popular and respected \nMembers, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico.\n  When Jeff came to this body 30 years ago, he had already led a life \nof accomplishment. Raised in smalltown New Mexico, Silver City, he was \nan Eagle Scout. He graduated from Harvard College and Stanford Law \nSchool, where he met his future wife Anne. While at Stanford, he worked \non Senator Robert F. Kennedy's campaign for President. At the age of \n35, he was elected New Mexico attorney general in 1978. Four years \nlater, at the age of 39, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  During his three decades in this body, Jeff Bingaman has been a \nclassic workhorse Senator as opposed to being a show horse Senator. He \nis truly remarkable and distinctive among Senators for his willingness \nto shun the limelight and share the credit in order to get important \nwork done for his State and for his country.\n  Senator Bingaman has been a much-valued colleague of mine on the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, but he has really made \nhis mark in the Senate--a lasting mark--in his role as chair of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. As chair and also at times \nranking member of that committee, he has played a leading role in \nshaping energy policy for our Nation, authoring bipartisan legislation \npromoting a balanced energy portfolio encompassing all energy sources.\n  Senator Bingaman worked closely with his New Mexico colleague, \nSenator Pete Domenici, to pass the landmark 2005 Energy Policy Act, \nsigned into law by President George W. Bush. This was signed, I might \nadd, appropriately at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. \nThat comprehensive law established groundbreaking policies on many \nfronts, including a renewable fuels standard for biofuels, support for \nalternative vehicles, loan guarantees for new energy technologies that \nreduce greenhouse gases, establishing policies to upgrade the \nelectrical grid, plus a whole range of measures to promote energy \nefficiency.\n  In 2007 he again collaborated with Senator Domenici in securing \npassage of the Energy Independence and Security Act. This act included \nan ambitious increase in vehicle fuel efficiency standards--from 25 \nmiles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020--as well as \nsignificantly greater commitments to the use of biofuels. These two \nprovisions are largely responsible for the significant decrease in oil \nimports that we have seen over the past several years.\n  More broadly, Senator Bingaman has played a critical role in ensuring \nthe vitality of America's energy research and development community, \nchampioning energy programs at all levels, including universities, \nnational laboratories, and in private industry.\n  I can't close without mentioning a great living legacy of the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\nNew Mexico: his 2009 public lands management bill that set aside more \nthan 2 million acres in nine States as protected wilderness, including \na 5,300-acre national monument to protect Paleozoic fossils located \nnorth of Los Cruces, NM. I can say that Senator Bingaman stands in line \nwith those great heroes of America who set aside public lands for all \nfuture generations, people such as Theodore Roosevelt and others. \nSenator Bingaman takes his rightful place there.\n  For the last three decades in this body, Senator Bingaman has been a \ntireless advocate for the people of New Mexico and a determined \nchampion of the future of clean and renewable energy for the United \nStates. He has been an outstanding Senator and a wonderful friend. I \njoin with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in wishing Jeff and \nAnne the very best in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to support our efforts to come to the relief of \nmillions of Americans who are suffering in the wake of Superstorm \nSandy.\n  I thank my fellow Senators from the Northeast, especially Senators \nLautenberg and Menendez, as well as my colleague, Senator Schumer, for \nall their leadership. Senator Schumer and I have been working in unison \nwith many of our colleagues. We have been testifying at hearings and \ntalking to our other colleagues since the storm hit.\n  I also give special thanks to Senator Landrieu, who, because her \nState has suffered so much, has had not only deep experience in \nadvocating for families who are suffering but she has demonstrated \nextraordinary leadership in bringing together a bill that can begin to \nmeet some of those needs.\n  I also thank Senator Boxer for holding a hearing in the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. That hearing allowed all of the Senators to \nspeak on behalf of their States, the members of our delegations, to \nbear witness to what actually took place.\n  Superstorm Sandy was a storm unlike anything we had ever seen in the \nNortheast before. The sheer magnitude and force struck the most densely \npopulated parts of the region. As you can see here on this chart, the \npurple is where the storm hit hardest, then the red and on to the \nyellow. In Sandy's wake, more than 40 New Yorkers lost their lives and \nhundreds of thousands more have lost their homes or seen significant \ndamage to their neighborhoods and their businesses, and their families \nare currently still suffering.\n  I wish to share just one story that indicates the depth of the \nchallenge these families are facing.\n  This one man, whose name is Pedro Correa, is from Staten Island. \nPedro is a lifelong New Yorker. When he saw the Twin Towers fall on 9/\n11, he answered the call of duty. He has been to Iraq and served our \ncountry. Since returning home to his family, he has continued to serve \nin public service. He and his wife are raising two kids, ages 2 and 6, \nin their Oakwood Beach home. As Sandy approached, Pedro was very smart. \nHe got his family and children out to higher ground and a safer place. \nUnfortunately, he stayed. The brutal winds hit his home and his \ncommunity so hard--winds of unbelievable force--that it blew his roof \noff and collapsed the structure of his house, allowing floodwaters in. \nWith the rising water, he literally felt his life was at risk. He \ncalled his wife and kids to say goodbye, but he was a strong man and he \nendured. He actually was able to fight the storm waters and swam to \nsafety to a neighbor's house.\n  One might think that was going to be the worst for Pedro and his \nfamily, but it is not. It is actually not. His house was completely \ndestroyed. And as he has begun his effort to rebuild, he has found \nroadblock after roadblock, challenge after challenge, and a great deal \nof difficulty in that small effort of beginning to rebuild. He called \nhis insurance company and discovered his insurance is capped at half \nthe value of his home. He called FEMA, and FEMA offered him $2,800.\n  This is a man any of us would be proud to call our own son. He lived \nthrough 9/11, he went to fight for our country, and he continues public \nservice. Now he is literally in the fight for his own life and for his \nown family's well-being and safety. His only choice currently is \nbankruptcy.\n  Americans watching us might ask: Are we going to come together to \nhelp these families? Will we stand as one body and do the right thing \nby these families, these communities, these businesses that are just \ntrying to get back on their feet? One thing is clear: There are too \nmany of these stories for any of us to bear.\n  After spending time in the communities that were hardest hit--from \nNew York City to the Hudson Valley to Long Island--I can tell you the \nimages of the devastation are worse than any I have personally ever \nwitnessed. I spent day after day meeting with families whose lives have \nbeen shattered, homes destroyed, such as this one. Many of them are \nworried because, obviously, as winter sets in, they do not think they \ncan return to their homes. How will they get their kids back in school? \nHow will they rebuild their lives?\n  But amid all this destruction, one story continues to emerge: \nneighbors helping neighbors, and unbelievable acts of generosity and \nkindness. I have met volunteers from every State in this country who \ncame to help Sandy's victims--young kids who want to do their part. I \nmet a bunch of kids--veterans--who had already served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who were there just to help people clean out their \nbasements. They put on some gloves and work boots and they shoveled out \nbasements for days and days.\n  I met one gentleman who, as with this house, had a boat in the middle \nof his restaurant. He said to me: Kirsten, we will rebuild and we will \nrebuild better. And we agreed we would have dinner at that restaurant a \nyear from now. So that resolve, that determination to rebuild, is \nsomething that is never in short supply in New York. We New Yorkers are \nvery tough. We can get knocked down, but every single time we will get \nup. We may be forced to bend, but we will not break. But we can't do it \nalone. We need the rest of this body, the rest of Congress, to come to \nour support.\n  I know there has been a lot of discussion, and I have been involved \nin some with my colleagues, over the past few days about the bill, that \nwe are moving too quickly, that it costs too much. But please, for a \nmoment, think of devastation in your own States, think of talking to a \nfamily with children with no place to go. Imagine what it would be like \nto be without a home, particularly during these holidays. Families need \njust a small amount of support to begin to rebuild.\n  In New York, because of where the storm hit, a lot of our \ninfrastructure was damaged, and a lot of these projects are extremely \nexpensive. But these projects are emergency spending. This is major \ntransportation infrastructure, such as the Brooklyn Battery tunnel. \nThis is the subway, but the Brooklyn Battery tunnel alone would take \n$700 million to rebuild. So when we are talking about a bill and that \nwe could fund a little today and fund the rest tomorrow, that is not \nhow business works. It is not how a contract works. You either contract \nto rebuild the tunnel or you don't. You either make the changes to \nrebuild it or you don't. You voluntarily, to retire. can't say: We will \nput down a little now. No State or city can operate that way. If you \ndon't know the funds are there in advance, you can't start to rebuild.\n  The same is true for our houses. We have estimates that there is $10 \nbillion worth of damage to these homes. If you say, we will give a \nlittle now, how is that homeowner going to know if they are even going \nto be able to rebuild if no one is there to help them?\n  We have always funded disaster projects when they are needed. We have \nnot asked for offsets, we have not asked for them to be paid for in \nadvance. That is what a disaster is. That is what disaster funding is \nabout. So I think it is important we look to New York and say: We will \nbe there for you. We will stand with you. New York has\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\nstood by every other State, every other region in the country when they \nhave had disasters come to their doorsteps.\n  Another concern my colleagues have brought up is this issue of what \nportion of the bill is for future prevention. We call it mitigation. \nThe reality is, if you are going to rebuild a subway such as this, and \nyou don't do it in a way that protects against flooding the next time, \nthen you are wasting your money. Mitigation is attached to each and \nevery project it is going to be used for, so when we fix the tunnel, \nwhen we fix the subway, when we fix any part of our city, it will be \ndone in a way that is smart and not blind to future risks.\n  Some have also asked the question about Army Corps of Engineers \nprojects. For those who are not familiar with Washington speak, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers funds a lot of projects related to our coastal \nshorelines or to any kind of waterway. They do the engineering required \nand then the work that has to be done to make sure a beach isn't \nvulnerable after a massive storm, such as the ones we have seen. \nBecause of Sandy, much of the Army Corps's infrastructure that provided \nthis critical protection was washed away or significantly damaged, \nleaving a lot of our shoreline exposed. So even if a minor storm hits, \nlives will be at risk.\n  When we look at the history of Hurricane Katrina, Congress and the \nBush administration immediately provided the Army Corps with $3.3 \nbillion for repair and mitigation with no offsets. Even funds \nappropriated in 2008 for the gulf coast hurricanes, 3 years after the \nstorms hit, were designated as disaster and emergency funding. In fact, \nsince 1989, Congress has passed 36 emergency appropriations for \ndisasters without any specifically dedicated outside offsets.\n  It has been 50 days since Superstorm Sandy hit our shores. We need to \nact swiftly. When Hurricane Katrina battered the gulf coast, the \nMembers of this body and the House united. We passed two emergency \nspending relief bills worth $60 billion within 10 days. Congress did \nthe same for Hurricane Andrew, and within weeks of the Twin Towers \nfalling on 9/11. I know the Members of this body can come together. \nWhen disaster strikes, we always find a way to do the right thing. It \nis time to do the same today.\n  It is the fundamental role of government to protect people, to help \nrebuild communities when disaster strikes. When so many lives have been \ndestroyed and so many communities lie in rubble, when businesses don't \nknow how to begin to rebuild, that is when we have to stand strong and \nwe have to come together.\n  No doubt we have serious challenges ahead of us, but none of us was \nsent here to Congress to do what is easy. We serve to do what is right, \nespecially when it is hard, especially when families are counting on \nus. So I ask my colleagues to find good will, to open their hearts and \nstand by those families who have suffered so much in the Northeast.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

INOUYE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise, as so many of my colleagues have, to \nmourn and pay tribute to Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.\n  He was a giant of the Senate. He was an individual whose courage, \nwhose compassion, and whose commitment to this country has never been \nexceeded by anyone who served here--indeed, by any American I can think \nof.\n  A few years ago, I was asked to introduce the Senator at an event. I \nwrote down some points on a card that I kept on my desk, and will \nforever keep on my desk:\n\n       Second Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye, E Company, 442nd \n     Regimental Combat Team, San Terenzo, Italy, April 21, 1945.\n\n  That was the day he was wounded leading his platoon against an enemy \npillbox, the day for which he would be ultimately awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for his actions.\n  Then I have another date: May 8, 1945. That was VE Day, the end of \nthe war. Seventeen days before the end of the war, when Berlin was \nencircled and collapsing, when American forces were rushing and the end \nwas clear, and indeed every soldier recognized that the war was coming \nto an end, Senator Inouye didn't stop serving, didn't stop sacrificing, \ndidn't stop giving his all to protect his soldiers and accomplish his \nmission. Indeed, that spirit of never giving up, of never failing to do \nhis duty, animated his service in the Senate, animated his service to \nthis country, and to the State of Hawaii.\n  At the time I gave these remarks, he was 1 of 90 living holders of \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor. Today we mourn his passing, his \ncontributions to Hawaii, his contributions to this Senate which he held \nin the highest esteem and which he personified so grandly.\n  I think one of the factors that led him to a career in public service \nand led him to such distinguished service was the recognition--not \ntheoretically but practically--that despite his great suffering and \nsacrifice, he was lucky because there were many other young men and \nwomen who perished in that war and in subsequent wars; that he had \nsacrificed much but had not given his life, although he very nearly \ngave his life.\n  At the outset of the war, the Librarian of Congress Archibald \nMacLeish, wrote:\n\n       They say, We were young. We have died. Remember us.\n       They say, We have done what we could but until it is \n     finished it is not done.\n       They say, We have given our lives but until it is finished \n     no one can know what our lives gave.\n       They say, Our deaths are not ours: they are yours: they \n     will mean what you make them.\n       They say, Whether our lives and our deaths were for peace \n     and a new hope or for nothing we cannot say: it is you who \n     must say this.\n\n  In everything Dan Inouye did, he spoke for those soldiers. He gave \ntheir lives meaning by his selfless service and sacrifice to this \nNation. He gave it every day by making this place--this country--live \nup to its highest ideals, a place of opportunity for all, a place of \nfairness and decency. He did it as few did.\n  So those voices that were stilled in 1945, and in the Korean War and \nin the war in Vietnam and subsequent wars, always had a voice here; and \nit wasn't just words, it was actions. His life gave meaning, and that \nmight be one of the highest achievements anyone can reach in this life.\n  We all know his extraordinary service in so many different ways. We \nknow also, in one of the great coincidences, three young men were in an \nArmy hospital in Michigan: Dan Inouye, Phil Hart, and Bob Dole, \nAmerican heroes; and that later they would come to this Senate and \nserve with distinction. I think it was particularly meaningful that \njust a few days ago Senator Robert Dole--another great American--was on \nthe floor of this Senate, still serving, still emblematic of the \n``greatest generation.''\n  We will miss Senator Inouye. There are few words and not enough \neloquence to describe the loss. I, too, particularly want to thank and \nextend my condolences to his wife Irene, to his son Ken, to his \ndaughter-in-law Jessica, to his granddaughter Maggie, and to his \nstepdaughter Jennifer Hirano. They have lost more than any of us \nbecause they have lost a husband, a father, and a grandfather.\n  Let me just conclude with the words uttered centuries ago by \nThucydides:\n\n       The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision \n     of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet \n     notwithstanding, go out to meet it.\n\n  Dan Inouye knew the dangers. Dan Inouye knew that the glory was \nfleeting, and in fact combat wasn't particularly glorious at all. But \nhe knew it was honorable to serve. He knew it was honorable to \nsacrifice for his soldiers and for his comrades. He knew it was \nhonorable and decent to serve his State and his Nation, and he never \nfailed to go forth to meet the challenges of his time.\n  Now it is our time. Now we must give words and meaning to the voices \nthat have been stilled in the service to this Nation. One of those \ngiants and one of those powerful voices was Senator Daniel Inouye. The \ntest will be whether we can measure up to what he did, and I hope for \nthe sake of this country we can.\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8114-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank my Senate \ncolleagues.\n  Yesterday, we passed a reauthorization of the Lake Pontchartrain \nBasin Restoration Act. That is very significant for my State of \nLouisiana, particularly southeast Louisiana. Today I expect that \npackage will be similarly approved by the U.S. House and passed into \nlaw to fully reauthorize this important restoration program.\n  In a minute I will get into why it is important and positive and \nnoteworthy. Let me mention in passing its significance to me. It \nhappened to be the first bill I ever passed in Congress. I came to the \nU.S. House in a special election in 1999, and very soon after that we \npassed into law in my freshman term this legislation in 2001. More \nimportant, it has been a very positive, productive program cleaning up \na big part of Louisiana and parts of Mississippi.\n  The Lake Pontchartrain Basin is about 16 parishes in Louisiana, four \ncounties in Mississippi and southeast Louisiana. Lake Pontchartrain and \nthe areas surrounding Lake Pontchartrain are the most populated part of \nour State--at least 1.5 million residents.\n  When I was a kid, unfortunately Lake Pontchartrain had come into a \nsad state and was visibly dirty. Nobody would have thought of swimming \nthere at the time. Soon after that, however, a positive grassroots \neffort started to clean up the lake. It wasn't some big government \nprogram, it wasn't some edict from the EPA or anyone else. It was a \ngrassroots citizens effort. It was embodied by a great organization \nthat was founded and still exists: the Lake Pontchartrain Basin \nFoundation. That nonprofit, private foundation, that group of active \ncitizens and stakeholders got together around the need to clean up the \nlake and make it a suitable lake once again and clean up all the \nsurrounding parishes in that watershed.\n  That effort had great success from when I was in high school for the \nnext several decades. Then, as I was coming to the Congress, we wanted \nto take the next step and amplify those efforts. So with an enormous \namount of input from that citizens group and other local stakeholders, \nwe came up with a model, a completely voluntary, proactive cleanup \neffort housed in the EPA focused exclusively on the Lake Pontchartrain \nBasin. That is when we acted, 1999 and 2000, and passed that \nlegislation in 2001.\n  It has had an enormously positive impact. It created a real \npartnership--again, built from the ground up, from local stakeholders, \nfrom that local group of civic activists--and it generated restoration \nefforts, similar statuses, and other important restoration efforts \naround the country, and over the last many years it has had real \nimpact.\n  As Carlton Dufrechou, then head of the Pontchartrain Basin \nRestoration Executive Committee, said:\n\n       It's been the catalyst for over 100 projects that have \n     reduced pollution from sewage plants, dairy operations, and \n     helped preserve Louisiana's fragile coast. And the results \n     are quantifiable. Lake Pontchartrain is again fishable and \n     swimmable.\n\n  That is really the ultimate test. That is the ultimate measure, when \ncitizens can go out and swim in the lake as they can now; when they can \ngo out and actively fish in the lake in a way they never did to that \nextent a decade and two decades ago. That is the ultimate validation. \nThat is the ultimate measure.\n  We did reauthorize the program in 2006. Now, in 2012, we are \nreauthorizing it, basing it on the same continuing model, a from-the-\nground-up enterprise, a proactive voluntary effort; not some Washington \nbureaucrat throwing a huge cumbersome rule book at local stakeholders \nbut building from the ground up through voluntary proactive restoration \nefforts, getting those stakeholders together, the people who know the \nlay of the land the best, and acting based on their priorities and \ntheir recommendations.\n  That was the model from the beginning. That was the model before this \nlegislation, with the grassroots effort that preceded it and that \ncontinues. That is the model we will continue to use. I hope, in some \nsmall way, that can be the model we use more and more actively in \nenvironmental cleanup around the country. Certainly, that is the \npositive perspective I will bring as the new ranking Republican on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  So I again thank my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--for \npassing this reauthorization. It is important and productive and \npositive and will continue to be on the ground in southeast Louisiana.\n  I very much look forward to that reauthorization passing the U.S. \nHouse and being signed into law so that those activists and \nstakeholders and citizens on the ground in southeast Louisiana can help \nlead that important continuing work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8114-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8114-S8115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DANIEL K.

It was a shock to me here on the floor yesterday \nwhen his passing was announced and it is still a shock today to see \nthat it is indeed real--the beautiful bowl of white roses on his desk.\n  I want to share a remembrance or two. When I was 19 I was struggling \nwith what direction to take in life and thought public policy might be \nsomething worth pursuing. I asked my father. My father read the \nnewspaper every day and watched the evening news and would run a \ncommentary on the world. I asked him, if I were to try to get a summer \ninternship in Washington, DC, to see how government really works, who \nshould I apply to. Of course he noted I should apply to my home State \nSenators, Senator Packwood and Senator Hatfield. I asked him if there \nwere any national Senators who stood out. He said there are four I \nthink you should try to talk to: Senator Kennedy, Senator Humphrey, \nSenator Church, and Senator Inouye.\n  I proceeded to write letters to see if I could get an internship with \nany of my home State Senators or any of those four. I did not succeed \noutside my State. I did get an internship with Senator Hatfield, which \nchanged the course of my life. But when I was elected to the Senate, \nSenator Hatfield asked me to bring greetings to his old colleagues, \nthose who served with him, particularly Senator Inouye, because Senator \nHatfield had chaired Appropriations and Senator Inouye was chairing \nAppropriations. That was a tremendous introduction because it led to \none of my first conversations with Senator Dan Inouye when I came to \nthe Senate. He showed me his spectacular view down The Mall, looking \ntoward the Washington Monument, and said anytime you want to come and \nuse the balcony you should come and use it. It is one of the best \nplaces in Washington.\n  We shared the joy he took in just the beauty of that space. We shared \nstories about the old days, the days when Senator Hatfield and Senator \nInouye worked together on appropriations. We also had a chance to talk \nabout some of the challenges that have occurred in the committee. In \nrecent times, we discussed how much harder it is to get appropriations \nbills to the floor and have them considered in a bipartisan nature.\n  I indicated to Senator Inouye at that time how interested I was in \nserving on the Appropriations Committee and how\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\nimportant it would be to Oregon. This began a series of dialog over the \nlast 4 years. It was a tremendous honor to have a chance to share these \nlast 4 years with Senator Dan Inouye. I think all who have spoken about \nhim have recognized he did an extraordinary job of commanding folks.\n  He took on the difficult tasks in World War II and received the \nhighest recognition for doing so. He did so in a context that was \nextraordinary. Japanese Americans had been relegated to a second-tier \nstatus during the war, and he chose a path that led to first-tier \nrecognition for the leadership and bravery he exemplified.\n  He did no less of a spectacular job in the U.S. Senate, just days \naway from completing 50 years of being on the floor of the Senate, \nadvocating for working people, advocating for his home State, and \nworking for a vision of America where all families can prosper. His \nlife was extraordinarily well lived.\n  It has been an honor to know him, and we will miss him. This Senate \nwill not be the same without Senator Dan Inouye.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to speak about our \nfriend Danny Inouye. It has been a week of emotion. When we look at \nthat black-draped desk with the white flowers, it is hard to believe \nthat such a big part of this institution is gone, not just a living, \nbreathing part of the institution is gone but a part of its history, \nits memory, its institutions, and its values. Dan epitomized all that.\n  He was a gentleman first. Actually, we would have to say he was a \npatriot first. All we need do to see how much of a patriot he was is \nconsider the fact that he had one arm missing because, as an Army \nlieutenant, he singlehandedly charged a German machine gun nest. He \ntook them out, lost his arm, and ended up in the hospital for 20 \nmonths. Of course, we all know he was deservedly recognized with the \nMedal of Honor years later.\n  He was a patriot, not only because he served as a young lieutenant \nbut also by being a public servant for well over a half century. He was \nelected as the first territorial legislator of Hawaii in 1954 and then \nelected as its first Congressmen when it became a State in 1959. Since \n1962, he has been a public servant serving his State.\n  He was the first Japanese-American Senator. His name is synonymous \nwith Hawaii, and so it is fitting, as told by his staff, that his last \nword was ``aloha.'' Patriot first but second he was a gentleman. That \nis a value which all of us in the Congress ought to remember.\n  This all emanates from some of the greatest moral teachings on planet \nEarth. It is what those of us refer to in the New Testament as the \nGolden Rule: Treat others as you want to be treated. To say it in Old \nEnglish, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. That is a \nmoral principle which runs throughout every major faith on the face of \nthe planet.\n  Danny Inouye exemplified that uniquely American value, and somewhere \nalong the way we seem to have gone astray. We go astray from what we \nhave learned in Newtown, CT, and we go astray when we see how some of \nus treat each other in this Chamber. The old adage is not just to go \nalong but to get along. We would get along a lot better if we get along \nor to say it in the context of old country boy wisdom: We can attract a \nlot more flies with honey than we can with vinegar. That is the life \nour colleague led.\n  Some people call it a throwback to the gentlemanly days of the \nSenate, when there was courtliness and deference. I hope it is not a \nthrowback. I hope we are not throwing back anything.\n  I hope we will remember the life of Danny Inouye. He felt so strongly \nabout this that when he was the chairman of a committee, he didn't \nrefer to the ranking Republican as the ranking member, he called the \nranking member the vice chairman. Of course, that was uniquely Senator \nInouye, but it was also practical because he could get more done if he \nwas sitting there as chairman and his vice chairman was sitting right \nnext to him.\n  We have a lot to learn from these emotional times of losing a valued \nfriend and colleague, but his life exemplified the best part of the \nSenate. We can sure get a lot more done if we start coming together \njust like Danny Inouye taught us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8115-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

INOUYE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has been conducting its \nbusiness here in Washington for just over 200 years, and for more than \na fifth of that time, Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii stood in its ranks. \nIt was just one of the many astonishing feats for a man who so rarely \ncalled attention to himself but who had every reason in the world to do \nso. In a life of honors he was never drawn to fanfare, and that always \nmade him a different kind of Senator. So today we mourn not only a \nfriend and a colleague but also everything he represented to a nation \nthat will always need courageous and principled men such as Dan Inouye \nif it is to flourish and succeed.\n  The people who worked with Dan Inouye might have known he served in \nWorld War II, but they could have gone years without knowing he was one \nof the most decorated soldiers of his time. To Dan, his achievements \nwere simply part of the job--and they were many. They start with his \nmilitary heroism, of course, and they continue throughout his long \ncareer of public service. He was the iconic political figure of the \nfiftieth State.\n  Until his death, he was the only original member of a congressional \ndelegation still serving in Congress, and there is scarcely an acre of \nHawaii or a person in the State that Dan hasn't affected or influenced.\n  Over many years of diligent committee work, he helped ensure an \nentire generation of uniformed military went into battle well prepared \nand that they were well cared for when they returned. Yet despite all \nthis, Dan's quiet demeanor and strict adherence to an older code of \nhonor and professionalism made him a stranger to controversy throughout \nhis many decades in public office. He was the kind of man and the kind \nof public servant, in other words, that America has always been \ngrateful to have, especially in her darkest hours--men who lead by \nexample and expect nothing in return.\n  One of my favorite Dan Inouye stories took place right here in the \nCapitol back in 1959. The memory of a hard-fought war against the \nJapanese was fresh in many minds as the Speaker of the House, Sam \nRayburn, prepared to administer the oath to a young war hero who was \nnot only the first Member from Hawaii but the first American of \nJapanese descent ever elected to Congress.\n  ''Raise your right hand and repeat after me . . . '' Rayburn said.\n  And here is how another Congressman would later record what followed:\n\n       The hush deepened as the young Congressman raised not his \n     right hand but his left and repeated the oath of office. \n     There was no right hand. It had been lost in combat by that \n     young American soldier in World War II. And who can deny that \n     at that moment, a ton of prejudice slipped quietly to the \n     floor of the House of Representatives.\n\n  It is a perfect image of how Dan led by example throughout his long \ncareer--with quiet dignity and unquestioned integrity.\n  It started early for Dan. As a young boy growing up in Hawaii, he and \nhis\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nfriends always thought of themselves as Americans. Yet after Pearl \nHarbor they suddenly found themselves lumped in with the enemy. It was \none of the reasons so many of them felt such an intense desire to \nserve. Their loyalty and patriotism had been questioned, and they were \ndetermined to prove their allegiance beyond any doubt.\n  When the Army lifted its ban on Japanese Americans, Dan and his \nfriends jumped at the chance to serve. An astonishing 80 percent of \nmilitary-age men of Japanese descent who lived in Hawaii volunteered--\n80 percent. Mr. President, 2,686 of them were accepted, including Dan, \nwho was an 18-year-old student at the University of Hawaii.\n  Together, they formed what would become the most decorated military \nunit in American history, the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team. As \nplatoon leader, Dan spent 3 bloody months in the Rome Arno campaign and \n2 brutal weeks rescuing a Texas battalion that was surrounded by German \nforces, an operation military historians often describe as one of the \nmost significant battles of the 20th century.\n  After the rescue, Dan was sent back to Italy, where on April 21, \n1945, in a ridge near San Terenzo, he displayed the extraordinary \nbravery for which he would later receive the Medal of Honor. Dan then \nspent nearly 2 years in a Michigan Army hospital where he also met Bob \nDole and Philip Hart.\n  Dan had always wanted to be a surgeon, but that dream faded away on \nthat ridge in Italy. Instead, he became a very fine Senator and one of \nthe most impressive and effective public servants of our time.\n  Dan never let narrow party interests stand in the way of friendship \nor cooperation on matters of real national importance. His friendship \nwith former Republican Senator Ted Stevens was one of the most storied \nin all of Senate history. I know I never hesitated to call on Dan when \nI thought something truly important was at stake. As Dan always said: \n``To have friends, you've got to be a friend.''\n  It is a good principle. It is one he always lived up to. And it is \none that is needed now more than ever.\n  Elaine and I extend to Irene and the entire Inouye family our deepest \nsympathy on their loss, which is also the Nation's loss. It was a \nprivilege to have worked alongside this good man and to call him a \nfriend. We will miss him. Yet we are consoled by the thought that he \nhas now finally heard those words he longed to hear: ``Well done, good \nand faithful servant . . . enter into your master's joy.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to speak, as many of my \ncolleagues have, about Senator Inouye.\n  When I was a new Senator, the first encounter I had with Senator \nInouye was when he invited me to go with him to the University of \nHawaii to debate some issue--and I don't remember exactly what the \nissue was. Obviously, I didn't know what I was getting into because he \nhad been in the Senate by then a quarter of a century, I believe, and I \nwas new. But I was glad to be invited and felt honored to be invited. \nSo I suppose every Senator here is going to be able to have a lot of \nmemories of Senator Inouye.\n  I come to the floor to pay tribute, as we ought to, to our friend. I \nhave heard the tributes paid to Senator Inouye by his fellow Senators, \nand that has gone on over the past several hours since his passing. It \nis a strong testament to the character of Senator Inouye that his loss \nas a friend and colleague is so deeply felt. Senator Inouye impressed \nmany of us with his quiet determination, his dedication to right and \nwrong, and his sheer decency.\n  He was a gentle force in the Senate, with emphasis upon ``force,'' \nbut that adjective ``gentle'' is very legitimate. He had a strong work \nethic and was very productive on behalf of the entire United States. \nAlso, of course, as all of us do, we have to look out for the people in \nour States, so he looked out for his beloved State of Hawaii as well.\n  Because he was restrained in his demeanor, when he spoke he commanded \nreal attention. He was well respected in the Senate for his life-long \nstatesmanship and for his early displays of courage and sacrifice for \nour country.\n  Barely out of his teens, Senator Inouye confronted more tests of his \nbravery than the vast majority of us will face in a lifetime. He passed \nthose tests with flying colors, and his representation of American \ninterests in the heavy combat theaters of World War II was something he \nhad to pursue. For him, it was not a perfunctory act. Even though he \nwas an eyewitness to the Japanese warplanes flying overhead in their \nassault on Hawaii, he could not enlist in the U.S. military at the time \nbecause he was Japanese American. He and others petitioned our \ngovernment, and when they were allowed to enlist, he certainly did.\n  He and his fellow Americans of Japanese descent went on to serve with \ntremendous skill and heroism. I encourage everyone to read about \nSenator Inouye's wartime experience, the medals he won and the bravery \nhe established to win the Medal of Honor.\n  He teaches all of us about answering the call to duty with \ndetermination and without hesitation, just as he did. His example of \nselflessness and his elevation of common cause over individual interest \nare especially relevant in these trying times.\n  In Congress, if we all sacrifice more and worry about self-\npreservation less, we can accomplish a lot for the country Senator \nInouye fought to save and to serve his people afterwards in the Senate. \nI am glad to have served with and learned from Senator Inouye.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. I assume that \nwe are going back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I would be happy to accommodate other \nSenators, but I came to the floor to speak for about 10 minutes on the \nsupplemental. I see Senator McCain. I don't know if he came to speak on \nSenator Inouye or on the supplemental.\n  Senator Merkley and Senator Stabenow now want to introduce an \namendment. Is that appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. That is appropriate.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would request we do as usual in \nmorning business, back and forth, if that is all right, and I could \nfollow the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator would yield, the Senators here, the \nSenators from Oregon and Michigan, just wanted 1 minute to get in their \namendment, and then I would speak for a few minutes and then Senator \nMcCain. Would that be all right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8116-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8116-S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I want to be very brief in respect for \nmy colleagues who wish to speak.\n  This amendment addresses an important disaster that occurred in many \nplaces across our country this year; that is, extensive drought and \nextensive fires.\n  I have come to this floor a number of times to describe those \nextensive fires and the damage they did to farmers and ranchers in my \nhome State of Oregon, and I know many others have come to the floor to \nshare their stories.\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\n  As we address this extraordinarily important bill to respond to the \ndevastation of Hurricane Sandy, it is only right and well that we also \naddress the disasters that occurred elsewhere in the country earlier in \nthe year. There are five provisions of this program that I am going to \nleave in the hands of our distinguished chair of Agriculture to \naddress, but I will come back at a further point and speak to them at \ngreater length.\n  Just suffice it to say, our farmers and ranchers have waited \npatiently while we have attempted to complete the farm bill. The Senate \ndid extraordinary bipartisan work on the farm bill, but the House has \nnot taken it up. We have not gotten these emergency provisions \nreauthorized. Now, in the context of the bill before us, it is \nappropriate that we take action.\n  I yield for my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let me just take a moment and thank Senator Merkley, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Wyden, and Senator McCaskill for joining, and I \nknow others will join us as well. We are still working very hard to \ncomplete the farm bill and have the House take action. But in the \nmeantime we have disasters that have occurred, and these provisions are \nlifted directly from what we have already passed in the farm bill that \naddressed what has happened in terms of livestock, drought, fires, and \nassistance for fruit tree growers. We will be speaking at a later time \nabout this, but these are essential to be included for thousands and \nthousands of farmers and ranchers across the country.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing us to step in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am going to truncate my remarks to 5 \nminutes. I came to speak on the supplemental and the great needs in the \nNortheast.\n  Generally, because I know there are other Senators who have other \nitems to discuss, I will come back at a later time for extended \nremarks. I wanted to come to the floor just to say to all of my \ncolleagues that I hope we can be patient with one another, supportive \nof the tragedy that is unfolding in the Northeast related to Superstorm \nSandy, which I think has caused greater destruction than maybe many \npeople in this Chamber and this Capitol realize.\n  While Katrina--something that I am very familiar with, a storm that \nhit us over 7 years ago, in August of 2005--received headline after \nheadline after headline, week after week after week, television station \nafter television station, Superstorm Sandy, because it hit a more dense \narea that is potentially not as--I don't know--as camera friendly, and \nmaybe because of some of the other things that have subsequently \nhappened, the terrible shooting and other issues in the country, I am \nnot sure the public quite understands how devastating this storm has \nbeen for a very important part of our country. I will try to frame it \nwith just a few statistics that might grab people.\n  In my State, when Katrina hit, in one weekend we lost 18,000 small \nbusinesses. To us, it was a nightmare. We have about 1.2 million people \nin our metropolitan area and 18,000 small businesses represented a \ntremendous loss. But the businesses that have been lost in New York and \nNew Jersey exceed 300,000. As to homes, we have lost 275,000 homes \nalong the gulf coast. In New York alone we have lost over 350,000 \nhomes, and those numbers are still coming in for New Jersey.\n  While it is not on the television every night, and CNN is not filming \nfrom New York or from New Jersey or any of these communities on a \nnightly basis like they did from New Orleans and the gulf coast for \nweeks and weeks, it would be wrong for us in this Congress to \nunderestimate the damage that has been caused to this area.\n  One thing I wanted to say today is--and I will come back for extended \nremarks--it is not only the resources that we need to get to this \nregion, $60 billion is not all that the region requested. They \nrequested $90 billion and had good justification for asking for that. \nThe President trimmed back those responses to get to the real core of \nwhat was needed for family, for flood insurance, for the Corps of \nEngineers, for mitigation, for transportation, so that the recovery \ncould get underway in a very balanced and robust way.\n  It is not all that the region wanted, but it is a large enough \npackage, Madam President, to give hope to people in New Jersey and New \nYork, and, yes, Connecticut, Maryland, and a few other places that were \nhard hit as well. Then they could begin making plans for recovery.\n  There are whole towns, portions of towns, communities. I was able to \nactually get on the ground with Senator Menendez and visit one of the \nLong Beach communities in New Jersey--I think it was the Long Beach \ncommunity there--and saw just miles and miles and miles of shuttered \nbusinesses, one after another, along that Jersey shore. I just saw a \nsmall portion of it that day. It goes on for miles and miles and miles.\n  Now, just for the next minute or two, yes; insurance is going to \ncover some of these losses, but insurance is not going to cover it all. \nIn the bill that we are about to talk about, and are talking about now, \nthere is an authorization for $9 billion more for flood insurance. If \nwe don't authorize this $9 billion, which is part of the 60, there will \nnot be flood insurance claims paid to people who have paid into the \nflood insurance program. They will not be able to get out their \nlegitimate claims. So that is one of the important reasons we should \npass the supplemental.\n  In the final 30 seconds I have--and I will come back and speak \nlonger--there is the mitigation part of this. After Katrina, one of the \nsmartest things we did was to send to the communities on the gulf \ncoast, to mitigate against future storm damage--it was about $14 \nbillion total for several of our large Corps projects. It was a lot of \nmoney. People grumbled and complained, but, you know what. They sent \nit.\n  The Corps built the project on time and underbudget, and in this last \nstorm that we had, Isaac, which just hit, which people don't even \nremember--we had a storm in August, the same date as Katrina--there \nwasn't a drop of water in Orleans Parish or Jefferson Parish except for \nlower parts of Jefferson, not even in Saint Bernard. Why? Because the \nmitigation worked.\n  So the two points I want to make and then, in turn, yield to Senator \nMcCain and others who are on the floor, are this bill is not everything \nthat was requested, but it is robust enough to do the job. No. 2, it \nhas tools in it to help the recovery move faster, more streamlined, \nmore efficiently. And, No. 3, mitigation works.\n  So as this debate goes on, I know some people are getting hardened \nhearts about this bill already, but I am asking you to understand that \nin a catastrophic disaster such as this, regular process won't work, \nregular appropriations won't work. Supplemental disaster funding is \nessential, and not just for FEMA but for transportation, for the Corps, \net cetera.\n  I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership at a very difficult time. I \nwill come back and speak more about this later, but I wanted to get \nsome of these statements in the Record as we begin this debate, and I \nwill come back and talk more about the Homeland Security portion of \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                     Tributes To Departing Senators\n\n                                Jon Kyl\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is customary in the days before \nCongress adjourns--and I am still hopeful this Congress will \neventually, mercifully adjourn--for Members to offer farewells and \ntestimonials to departing colleagues. I rise today to say a few words \nabout a Senator who is leaving us and whose example I esteem and \nfriendship I have relied on for many years.\n  Senator Jon Kyl and I have served the State of Arizona together for a \nquarter of a century since Jon was first elected to the other body and \nI to the Senate in 1986. We have worked together in this body for the \nlast 18 years. That is a long time to get to know someone with whom you \nshare responsibilities to the State we are honored to represent, and I \nhave gotten to know Jon very well over these many years. I can also say \nin all honesty that my admiration for him has grown\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\nevery single day I have been privileged to serve with him.\n  I share that admiration for Jon with the people of Arizona, who \nelected him to the Senate three times, and would have, I am sure, \ncomfortably elected him to a fourth term had he sought reelection. \nArizonans hold him in very high regard for a very obvious reason: He \nhas been a very diligent, very effective advocate for their interests.\n  I have observed him closely as we tended to issues that might seem \narcane and unglamorous to Senators from other States but are among the \nmost important and often the most contentious issues to Arizonans--\nissues such as land exchanges and water rights settlements. I have \nnever failed to be impressed by the qualities Jon brings to these \nmatters--his unflappable patience, his tireless work ethic, his careful \nattention to detail, his determination to be fair to all parties \ninvolved, and to achieve results that are in the best interests of our \nState of Arizona.\n  I have tried to learn from his example, and I wish I could say I have \nemulated him, but, regrettably, as Arizonans and my Senate colleagues \ncan attest, I still possess a short supply of some of Jon's most \nconspicuous leadership qualities. His patience, for example, his \nmeticulous preparation and thoroughness are, I am sorry to say, not \nqualities I will be remembered for, but they have been indispensable to \nthe people of our State. It is fortunate for them and for me that \nStates are represented by two Senators and that Arizonans have had Jon \nKyl here to compensate for my shortcomings.\n  Jon works harder than almost any Member of Congress I know. We all \njoke about how we are often required to vote on legislation before we \nhave had time to read it. But it is a poorly kept secret that we \nrarely, if ever, read from preamble to conclusion any of the bills we \nconsider, even if we have had months to do so. Jon does, though. He \nreads them. When you debate with him over legislation, you better know \nwhat you are talking about, because he does and he is almost always \nbetter prepared than you are not only to explain his argument but to \nexplain yours as well. He often writes the bills he sponsors, work that \nmost of us almost happily rely on staff to perform. He takes his \nresponsibilities as the author of legislation literally, rather than \nfiguratively, as most of us do.\n  It is hard to imagine where he finds the time to hold himself to such \nexacting standards of responsibility, but he does, often working late \ninto the night after the rest of us have gone home, when he reads bills \nand writes them and tends personally to the concerns of his \nconstituents. He is a Senator's Senator. He is principled, purposeful, \ninformed, collaborative, and able to get things done by cooperation and \ncompromise without ever sacrificing the principles that motivate his \npublic service. He would rather reason with opponents than insult them. \nHe prefers accomplishments to acclaim.\n  It is little wonder then why our caucus elected and reelected him to \nour leadership. He has the complete confidence of every one of us. He \nis an easy man to trust with leadership responsibilities. He is \nscrupulous in his attention to his responsibilities and fair-minded in \nuse of authority. He has strong views on issues and advocates for them \neffectively. But if he can't persuade some members of our caucus to \nagree with him, he will do all he can to defend our rights to be heard \nand have our position considered fully by the Senate.\n  I think Members on both sides of the aisle would testify to Jon's \nfairness, collegiality, and effectiveness. I think we would all testify \ntoo to the credit his service has reflected on the Senate, a place we \nall love but which we must admit doesn't always function as well or as \ncongenially as we would like, a failing that has not escaped the notice \nof the American people. Were Jon the kind of politician who worried \nmore about his press than his responsibilities to his constituents, his \ncolleagues, and his country, I think many Americans would recognize him \nas the kind of Senator they wished there were more of here.\n  It has been my privilege to work with Jon not only on issues of \nunique importance to the State of Arizona but on many of national \nimportance. We worked together on comprehensive immigration reform in \n2007. None of the sponsors of the legislation, including myself and my \nfriend, the late Senator Kennedy, was more instrumental in forging the \ncompromises necessary to put that bipartisan bill together or more \ndiligent and effective in defending it in debate.\n  I was running for President that year and often away from the Senate. \nIn addition to all the work Jon did to write the bill with Senator \nKennedy and others, and seek support for it in both Houses, he had to \nassume many of my responsibilities as well. He did a better job with \nthem than I did, and though we fell short of success, Jon deserves none \nof the blame for failure and much of the credit for making the bill as \nbroadly bipartisan as it was and for providing the framework for what \nwill be the kind of compromise I hope and believe we will get to the \nPresident's desk in the next Congress.\n  Longevity in public office isn't always that important a distinction. \nI have served one term more than Jon and for that minor accomplishment \nI am referred to as the senior Senator from Arizona. But honestly, I \nhave always looked up to Jon as my senior. He has been my leader, my \nsenior partner in much of the work we have done in Arizona, my friend, \nand one of the people I most look up to in this place, an example of \nselfless, capable, honorable public service.\n  He is leaving the Senate, and he will have time now to spend with his \nlovely wife Caryll, his son and daughter and his grandchildren. He will \nhave more time too to hike his beloved White Mountains. I envy him \nthat. But I think we would all concede the Senate will miss him, and I \nwill miss him particularly.\n  Thank you, my friend, for your service, your example, and your \nfriendship. It has been a privilege.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if my colleagues would indulge me for just \na moment so I may respond.\n  I am deeply moved and very appreciative of the remarks of my \ncolleague John McCain. The people of Arizona have been so fortunate to \nbe represented by a very few remarkable people in the State's history--\nonly 10 United States Senators. John McCain is the ninth of those \nSenators and is as distinguished, if not more distinguished, than any \nwho have served and represented the State of Arizona.\n  He has set a standard for modern representation after being elected \nto the House of Representatives. None of the representatives from \nArizona were ever the same in their representation. He came home every \nweek, maintained very close contact with his constituents, and set a \npace that no one has since matched, let alone exceeded. So in many \nrespects, John McCain has set a new standard for representation.\n  But he didn't leave it at the State of Arizona. He is a national \nfigure of the first magnitude--one of our great national leaders of the \nday--and it has been an incredible honor for me to serve with him both \nin representing the people of our State but also working on the \nsignificant issues of the day.\n  I will confess that some of the more mirthful moments have also \noccurred on some of the sojourns that Senator McCain has led abroad \nwith our colleague Lindsey Graham, sometimes Senator Joseph Lieberman, \nand others, and these occasions also will bring great joy to me in my \nreminiscences, because, obviously, at the end of the day it is \nfriendships probably more than almost anything else we think of when we \nget toward the end of both career and the end of our life.\n  Senator McCain was far too generous in his description of my \ncapabilities. I want to thank him for, among other things, the \nresponsibilities he did enable me to undertake, things which, as the \nsenior--and yes, he is senior both in age and seniority--he could have \ntaken unto himself but which he allowed me to do on behalf of the \npeople of Arizona. He was interested in dividing responsibilities in a \nway the two of us could represent our State and our constituents to the \nmaximum advantage, and I have always not only admired his approach--and \nthe people of Arizona, I would say, should be grateful for that--but it \nenabled me to be involved in things and to have some extra \nresponsibilities in areas I otherwise would not have. Not all of these\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\nwere things Senator McCain wanted to deeply get into, such as the water \nrights settlements he mentioned. But nonetheless, he has been \nenormously cooperative on behalf of the people of Arizona in all of \nthose endeavors.\n  So as I near the end of my time here in the U.S. Senate, I have a lot \nof different emotions and a lot of things I would like to express. I \nregret one thing I won't be able to do is to speak on the Senate floor \nextolling the virtues of my colleague John McCain when he is about to \nleave, but I assure you and assure him that I will do that from some \nother place, and that my deep respect for him, my appreciation and my \ngratitude for what he has said here today, I will try to reciprocate at \nthe time he finally completes his service not only to the people of the \nState of Arizona but to this Nation of ours, and frankly also to so \nmany people around the world.\n  For me to have served with him in this body for 18 years is truly an \nhonor, and I thank him for his comments today.\n\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, over his time in this body, Jeff Bingaman \nhas worn many hats: champion of education, expert on energy policy, \nsteward of our nation's nuclear arsenal, thoughtful voice on national \nsecurity.\n  He has approached each of these varied responsibilities with an \nattitude aimed not at attention-grabbing or point scoring, but at \npractical, fact-driven problem solving. In the accurate description of \nthe Washington Post, ``Bingaman isn't one to grab the spotlight, but \nthis six-term senator's logical, cerebral approach tends to get things \none.''\n  He has indeed gotten things done, for the people of New Mexico first \nand foremost, but his practical approach has benefitted Americans from \nevery State. I know first-hand that the people of Michigan have \nbenefitted from his leadership.\n  I have worked closely over the years with Senator Bingaman to \npreserve programs that are vital to America's manufacturing sector, the \nheart of my State's economy. His support for the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership Program and the Technology Innovation Program has \nmade a major difference in the ability of American manufacturers to \nresearch and develop new technologies, to increase efficiency, to \nimprove supply chains and to out-innovate our overseas competitors.\n  The people of Michigan also have benefitted from Senator Bingaman's \nleadership of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He worked \nwith me to enact legislation that has brought significant improvements \nto Michigan parks and recreational lands. With Senator Bingaman's \nassistance, we have established the River Raisin National Battlefield \nPark, preserving the site of one of the most important battles of the \nWar of 1812; made major progress toward completion of the North Country \nNational Scenic Trail; enhanced wilderness protection at Pictured Rocks \nNational Lakeshore; and made many improvements at Keweenaw National \nHistorical Park. So, he has played a major role in helping preserve and \nprotect numerous jewels of our State's rich history, culture and \nnatural beauty.\n  From his post on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Bingaman has \nbeen one of our Nation's most influential voices on energy, an issue \nthat affects nearly every aspect of economic and environmental policy. \nHe has worked with skill, intelligence and determination to find \npractical, bipartisan solutions in an issue area too often dominated by \npolitics and powerful interests. As we seek to strengthen our Nation's \ncompetitiveness, his advocacy on renewable energy, energy efficiency \nand other important topics will yield important advantages.\n  While we have not had the benefit of his service in this Congress, \nSenator Bingaman served in the past with distinction on the Armed \nServices Committee. In his committee tenure he chaired the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities and Strategic Forces subcommittees. His deep \nknowledge of science and technology issues was of great value in \ncommittee deliberations, in particular during the difficult debate over \nthe Bush administration's determination to invade Iraq. His expertise \non energy and nuclear issues gave heft to his skepticism over claims \nthat Iraq had sought to acquire uranium from Niger, claims that turned \nout to be false.\n  As the son of two educators, it only makes sense that Senator \nBingaman would be careful, detail-oriented, and reliant on facts rather \nthan assumptions. And it's no wonder that in addition to his work on \nenergy, defense and natural resources, he has been one of the Senate's \nmost consistent and effective advocates for quality education.\n  On all of these issues, and so many others, Jeff Bingaman has sought \nsolutions and consensus rather than attention and division. His \ncareful, deliberate style, his focus on facts, and his determination to \nfind practical answers to difficult challenges have been of enormous \nvalue to the Senate, to the people of New Mexico, and to the Nation. \nThey will be missed in the Senate, and so will he. I wish Jeff and Anne \nall the best as the move on from the Senate.\n\n\n                             Richard Lugar\n\n  Madam President, the Senate has traditionally been seen as a \nmoderating force in American politics, as a place where partisan \ninterests give way to practical problem-solving, and where men and \nwomen of good will could, while they might often disagree and debate, \nfind agreement on the challenges our nation must face.\n  Richard Lugar has, for more than 30 years, upheld that Senate \ntradition. All of us, regardless of party, have great respect for his \nintelligence, his integrity, and his concern for the good of our \ncountry.\n  We have worked together on many matters. Manufacturing is a vital \nsector in the economies of both our states, and Senator Lugar has been \na strong supporter of federal programs that benefit manufacturing, \nincluding the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which helps U.S. \nmanufacturers research and develop new technologies, increase \nefficiency, improve supply chains and out-innovate our overseas \ncompetitors. We have worked together on other issues of mutual interest \nto Indiana and Michigan, including preservation of the Great Lakes and \nstrengthening America's agricultural sector.\n  These are important contributions. Senator Lugar's most lasting \nlegacy, however, is likely to be his work protecting Americans, and \npeople all over the world, from the threat of proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction. As a Midwestern Senator, he has followed in the \nfinest tradition of Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican Senator from \nMichigan who famously coined the concept that ``politics stops at the \nwater's edge.''\n  In 1992, Senator Lugar joined with Senator Sam Nunn in a bipartisan \neffort to deal with a pressing national security challenge arising from \na major national security success: the collapse of the Soviet Union. \nWhile the end of the Cold War made the world a safer place, the \nsplintering of a superpower meant the fearsome Soviet arsenal of \nnuclear and chemical weapons was now in the possession of 15 separate \nnations. Many worried, with good reason, that these newly independent \nnations, struggling in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse, might be \nunable or unwilling to prevent the misuse or diversion of these \nweapons.\n  The answer was the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, more \ncommonly known as Nunn-Lugar, and widely hailed as one of the smartest \ninvestments America has ever made in our security. Nunn-Lugar has \neliminated more than 7,000 former Soviet nuclear warheads, and nearly \n2,500 nuclear-capable missiles. It has secured two dozen nuclear weapon \nstorage sites, and significantly strengthened controls over remaining \nweapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their deadly materials. As the \nWMD proliferation challenge has evolved, Senator Lugar has worked hard \nto ensure that the Nunn-Lugar program has adapted to meet that \nchallenge, in new regions such as Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It \nhas, in short, been an integral part of our national security strategy \never since the end of the Cold War, making our nation more secure, \nkeeping us safe.\n  This is a legacy of which any Senator would be justifiably proud, and \nit is one on which Senator Lugar has continued to build. We saw the \nvalue of his leadership as the Senate debated and\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\npassed the New START Treaty, and we've seen it in the countless \ninstances when Senator Lugar has advocated for and helped the Senate \napprove international agreements that have made our nation, our allies \nand our planet a safer place.\n  The Senate will miss Richard Lugar's leadership. I hope that each of \nus who will return to the Senate in the New Year can keep in mind his \nlegacy of bipartisan leadership and practical problem solving as we \nconfront our nation's challenges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I appreciate the words of the Senator \nfrom Arizona about the Senator from Arizona, and let me say I look \nforward to sharing some words on the floor at some point in the next \nfew days about my friend Senator Kyl. We have disagreed on things in \nsome ways, but, boy, have we gotten to know each other. I respect his \nservice enormously, and I look forward to having a chance to share some \nthoughts about that.\n\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  Madam President, I think all of us are aware that too often in public \nlife words like ``good friend'' or ``remarkable colleague'' are used so \noften they lose a little bit of their impact. But I think we all share \npowerfully--ever since the majority leader announced the sad news last \nevening, and we have seen so many come to the floor to talk about \nSenator Inouye--in the knowledge that Senator Danny Inouye really was \nall those things and so much more.\n  He was a quiet man, a humble man, a soft-spoken public servant, but \nthose of us who were privileged to serve for so long with Dan Inouye \nknow we truly got to know him. I had the privilege of sitting beside \nhim and listening to some of the stories talking about things that were \nhappening in the Senate, and we truly did get to love him and revere \nhim.\n  It was more than his uniquely American journey--from the trenches of \nWorld War II to the Halls of Congress--more than his leadership and \nmoral authority on everything from civil rights to the Watergate and \nIran-Contra hearings. It was more than the Dan Inouye we could read \nabout on paper. It was the man himself, in the flesh, who was bigger \nthan the legend. That is why the Senate is going to feel his loss for a \nlong time.\n  We often hear the words ``greatest generation.'' Before Tom Brokaw \ncoined the phrase, we knew what it referred to, particularly in the \nSenate where some of us were privileged to serve with people such as \nBob Dole, John Glenn, Fritz Hollings, and so many others.\n  Danny was a bridge to that generation--a generation that I revered \ngrowing up in the shadows of World War II. I remember talking with my \ndad and hearing how he had volunteered for the Army Air Corps as war \nloomed over Europe. He was a pilot flying DC-3s, paratroopers, \npreparing to go over for the invasion, and he shared with me his regret \nthat he came down with tuberculosis and he was released from Active \nDuty and, in his perception, never got his chance to defend his \ncountry.\n  I think about just how much more complicated the prospect of going to \nwar must have been for a young Danny Inouye--just 21 years old with \ndreams of becoming a surgeon, dreams interrupted by Pearl Harbor. Here \nhe was, the son of immigrants who came to work in Hawaii's pineapple \nfields, his entire life he had thought of himself as a patriotic \nAmerican. Then, suddenly, at a time when across the country young men \nwere heeding the call to duty, Dan Inouye's own Nation declared him and \nhis family alien enemies. But Dan Inouye's response was not to pull \ninward or to leave or forsake his country. His response was to sign up \nand fight for the country he loved so deeply, even at a time when his \ngovernment's vision was clouded by the horror of Pearl Harbor.\n  Fight for his country he did. He put on the uniform and showed us \nwhat both he and our country are all about. We know Dan was a hero. We \nknow he lost his arm on the battlefield in Italy. But I never once \nheard Dan talk about the details of that action that would ultimately \nresult in him being awarded the Medal of Honor. He was a quiet man who \nnever bragged and rarely spoke of himself. But the citation speaks \nvolumes about him and who he became on that bleak April day when Second \nLieutenant Inouye and his platoon mounted a defense of a ridge guarding \na critical road junction in San Terenzo, Italy. The citation says, very \nsimply:\n\n       With complete disregard for his personal safety, Second \n     Lieutenant Inouye crawled up the treacherous slope to within \n     five yards of the nearest machine gun and hurled two \n     grenades, destroying the emplacement. Before the enemy could \n     retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a second machine gun \n     nest. Although wounded by a sniper's bullet, he continued to \n     engage other hostile positions at close range until an \n     exploding grenade shattered his right arm. Despite the \n     intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to direct \n     his platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men \n     were again deployed in defensive positions.\n\n  That was Dan Inouye. He was a hero whose entire life's lesson was a \nvictory over discrimination and anger. Despite the sting of bigotry at \nhome--he lost his arm for his country and almost his life--rather than \nbeing consumed by rancor, he became a voice for reconciliation.\n  Because of what he had experienced growing up as a Japanese American \nin what was still a heavily segregated country, Dan always fought to \nmake sure that no Americans ever felt unsafe or unwelcomed. ``This is \nour country,'' he famously said in his keynote address at the \nDemocratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968.\n  I still remember that speech. I was riveted watching it on \ntelevision. I was in the Navy, serving then. I was training before \ndeparting for Vietnam. It was strange, the juxtaposition of Dan \nInouye's words and the hope and what he represented to the carnage in \nthe streets, watching what seemed to be a country coming apart at the \nseams. But there was this young Senator, this decorated World War II \nveteran who spoke words that were as chilling as they were prescient. \nHe said:\n\n       The true dimension of the challenge facing us is a loss of \n     faith. I do not mean simply a loss of religious faith . . . I \n     mean a loss of faith in our country, in its purposes and its \n     institutions. I mean a retreat from the responsibilities of \n     citizenship.\n\n  He went on to say famously:\n\n       This is our country. Its future is what we, its citizens, \n     will make it. . . . Putting aside hatred on the one hand and \n     timidity on the other, let us grow fresh faith in our purpose \n     and new vigor in our citizenship.\n\n  Those words would serve us well as we think about the challenges we \nface right now in the Senate. That is the kind of citizenship and \npatriotism that Dan Inouye stood for, not just in 1968 but every day we \nwere tested.\n  After 9/11, Danny was as determined as anyone to bring to justice the \nterrorists who attacked us on that fateful day. The media said it was \nour Pearl Harbor. Dan Inouye remembered better than anybody the first \nPearl Harbor. He was there. He lived through it. But he also had deep \nconvictions about the historic lessons learned the hard way after the \nfirst Pearl Harbor--mistakes he refused to see repeated 60 years later. \nIn the aftermath of September 11, Dan Inouye sounded a warning. He \nsaid:\n\n       I hope that the mistakes and suffering imposed upon \n     Japanese Americans nearly 60 years ago will not be repeated \n     again against Arab Americans whose loyalties are now being \n     called into question.\n\n  It was a forceful defense. I think it was heard across the Nation. \nDan understood our values aren't just talk. They are about the choices \nwe make, the causes we champion, and the people we fight for. As Dan \nreminded us in Chicago in 1968, this is our country, and its future is \nwhat we, its citizens, make of it.\n  He was an incredible person. During his long painful recovery at \nPercy Army Hospital in Michigan, Dan was down to 93 pounds and \nexhausted. He knew he would never be a surgeon as he once dreamed. He \nstruggled then even to light a cigarette and he wanted to curse at his \nnurse. Unbowed, she taught him how to light a cigarette with one hand \nand said simply: ``From now on, you're going to be learning.'' Dan \nInouye did learn. Happily, we can say he also taught. He taught all of \nus with the power of his example.\n  During his convalescence at Percy Jones Army Hospital, he met another \nyoung lieutenant, a man by the name of Bob Dole. They became fast \nfriends and nursed themselves back to health.\n  About 2 short weeks ago, two ``greatest generation'' brothers, ailing \nand approaching their 90th birthdays, Dan\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\nInouye and Bob Dole were still here teaching us, teaching us what is \nworth fighting for. I will never forget seeing Danny with his oxygen \ntube walking up to Bob Dole before casting his vote in the hopes of \nhelping disabled veterans when they travel overseas. Here were these \ntwo older citizens telling the Senate, through actions and not words, \nthat we have to be better than this place has sometimes been in recent \ndays.\n  Bob Dole said something about Danny that has deeper meaning now that \nhe has left us. Bob said, over there in that corner near the door, \nlooking at Danny:\n\n       He was wounded a week from the day I was and a mile from \n     the place I was wounded, and we ended up in the same \n     hospital. He's a Democrat and I'm a Republican, but parties \n     didn't make any difference.\n\n  Those are bonds we ought to learn something from. Those are bonds we \nought to do a better job of honoring today in this institution Dan \nInouye loved so deeply.\n  Dan Inouye was a special kind of public servant. He walked his own \npath. He got out of that hospital bed, returned to college under the GI \nbill, and went on to George Washington University for his law degree. \nHe got himself elected to the Hawaii Territorial Legislature at the \nripe old age of 30 and then on to the House of Representatives as \nHawaii's first full member after it won statehood in 1959. Just 3 years \nlater, Danny Inouye was a Senator, and eventually he would rise to \nbecome the highest ranking public official of Asian descent in U.S. \nhistory.\n  I will never forget the critical role he played on the special \ncommittees that investigated Watergate in the 1970s and Iran-Contra in \nthe 1980s. I was here during Iran-Contra, a freshman who approached \nthose investigations with a certain zeal. I was in a hurry to find out \nthe truth. But I learned from Dan Inouye that a good Senator can \nnavigate the path to truth while taking extraordinary care to protect \nand nurture the national interests. So when Dan famously warned at the \nIran-Contra hearings that there exists a ``shadowy government'' that \ncan ``pursue its own ideas of the national interests, free from all \nchecks and balances and free from the law itself,'' we all understood \nthe gravity and truth behind those words because we respected the \nintegrity of the statesman who spoke them.\n  Dan had a special sense of his own responsibilities as the first \nMember of Congress from Hawaii. He believed in the Federal Government's \nability to make a difference in people's lives. He was chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, as we all know. For all the talk in \nthe media about earmarks and pork-barrel spending, we saw in Dan how \none Senator could actually advance the interests of their State and \narticulate a vision for that State which didn't violate anybody's \nsensibilities about how we ought to be spending a Federal tax dollar. \nHe used his position unapologetically to bring home investments in \nHawaii to build roads and bridges and classrooms, all of which changed \npeople's lives on an island that most of us only thought of in the \ncontext of a vacation destination. To Dan, it wasn't a resort. It was \nhome. It was people. As the son of a Japanese immigrant who came to \nwork in those pineapple fields, Dan needed to make no apologies about \nusing the Federal Government to make life for the people he represented \nbetter.\n  It was a perspective that endeared him to his colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle--and no one more so than Republican Senator Ted \nStevens. They became like brothers. Theirs was a friendship that stood \nthe test of time. I often heard the stories from Dan or from Ted--whom \nI got to know well--about how they would travel to various parts of the \nworld to see how America was investing its funds and how their \nfriendship simply grew during the course of those journeys together. \nTheirs was a friendship that stood the test of time. This place would \nbe a lot better off if we could forge bonds the way Dan and Ted did \nsince the 1960s. They didn't capitulate. They didn't lose their values. \nThey compromised, and they always put what was best--in the case of \nDan, Hawaii, and in the case of Ted, Alaska, and in both their cases, \nthe country--ahead of any kind of partisan squabbling.\n  Danny Inouye lived a full and remarkable life, and we will miss him \ndearly. He was proud of his Japanese heritage, proud of his roots, and \nproud of his service as a champion of veterans and veterans' rights. He \nloved our troops. It is fitting that a building at the Walter Reed Army \nInstitute of Research now bears his name.\n  I often marveled at how hard he fought to regain his health in the \nface of mounting odds.\n  He died with no regrets. ``Aloha'' was his last word.\n  Hawaii misses Daniel Inouye, America misses him, and our thoughts are \nwith his wife Irene and his son Daniel Ken, Jr., who is a great friend \nof my stepson Johnny Heinz, and also the rest of his family at this \ndifficult time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ngreat Senator Daniel Inouye. Senator Inouye was a fine colleague and a \ngood personal friend of mine.\n  While Congress occasionally drifts without direction, Senator Inouye \nwas a steady rudder in the Senate. He was the consistent source of \nquiet, but purposeful and effective leadership.\n  In an age where the loud crowd often demands center stage, Senator \nInouye was a reminder that the truth is generally seen, rarely heard. \nHe was a man who communicated concisely and precisely just exactly what \nhe intended. Through his actions, Senator Inouye demonstrated time and \ntime again that he would lead legislative efforts, pool necessary \nsupport, and do what needed to be done to best represent Hawaii and \nadvance all Americans.\n  While he chaired the Select Committee on Intelligence and the \nCommerce Committee, I worked with Senator Inouye most during his time \nas Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I can attest that \nduring most of our hearings, his very presence drove much of our \nactivity. Through thick and thin, he reliably led many an effort.\n  Senator Inouye's addition to the bipartisan group that later became \nknown as the Gang of 14 helped others start to view us as a body with \nlegitimacy and true purpose. Daniel Inouye carried the Senate's respect \nand attention toward us, for which I remain incredibly grateful.\n  Years back, I was fortunate to travel with Senator Inouye to Italy as \npart of a Congressional delegation trip. It was during our time \ntogether there that I had one of the strongest emotional responses of \nmy life. In Tuscany near the location where Senator Inouye was wounded, \nhe visited the gravesites of many of those who served alongside him. \nSeeing Senator Inouye mourn and pay tribute to those who had fallen \nbeside him in battle taught me something I could never learn from a \nbook or a classroom. Without saying a word, Senator Inouye gave me a \nheightened respect for the shared purpose and camaraderie among those \nwho serve in America's Armed Forces.\n  Yet while Senator Inouye had the utmost appreciation for what \nhappened in the past, he did not allow it to stop him from thoroughly \nenjoying the present. It was on that same trip that the Senator also \ntaught me an appreciation for a solidly-built, handsome pair of shoes. \nHe advised me on the purchase of a pair of oxfords that are as \ncomfortable today as the day I bought them.\n  Senator Inouye was a source of personal, policy, and even fashion \nadvice for me, and I cherish the time I spent with him.\n  America is stronger today because of Daniel Inouye. He will be sorely \nmissed by all.\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n                          Kay Bailey Hutchison\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison, who will be retiring at the end of the year. \nSenator Hutchison has been a dear friend and colleague for a long time. \nShe has always been ready to offer wise counsel, and I have usually \nlistened.\n  It is truly bittersweet saying goodbye to Kay. On the one hand, I \nunderstand her desire to spend more time with Bailey and Houston; we \nare all glad she will now be able to cheer from the sidelines at their \nsoccer games. On the other hand, we will miss seeing them practice \ntheir corner kicks on the second floor of the Russell building.\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\n  By the way, if you have ever been with Kay on one of her early \nmorning power walks, you know where her kids get their energy. I am \ntold Kay has worn out multiple Members of Congress, several staffers, \nand quite a few others on those walks. And it is a fitting metaphor for \nher career. There are so many talents in the Senate, it is easy to \nforget what remarkable stories many of them have. And Senator \nHutchison's is without question one of the most impressive.\n  Raised in an era when women were a rarity in politics, Kay forged her \nown path, kicking open the door of opportunity wherever she went. In \nthe process, she has come to personify Texan independence; which is \nentirely fitting, since one of Kay's great-great-great grandfathers \nsigned the Texas Declaration of Independence.\n  Kay's many successes in life are a testament to her personal \ntoughness and determination in the face of what would have seemed like \ninsurmountable obstacles to many lesser talents. Though she was \n``brought up,'' as she once put it, ``to be a lady, to have good \nmanners--and to be ready to get married,'' she always excelled in \nschool. And she was one of just a handful of women, out of a class of \nhundreds, to graduate from her University of Texas law school class in \n1967.\n  Kay hit what she called her ``first brick wall'' after graduation. \nLaw firms in Texas just were not hiring women back then, so she turned \nto an industry that would give her a chance, becoming Houston's first \nfemale news reporter. Indeed, thanks to Kay's success, two competing \nHouston networks hired female reporters within 6 months of her arrival \nat KPRC-TV, the NBC affiliate, in 1967. Appropriately, Kay was assigned \nto cover the Texas Legislature, and she gave it her all.\n  Having inherited her dad's work ethic, she was soon being encouraged \nto run for office herself. At the time, few women served in the Texas \nlegislature, and not a single female Republican had ever been elected \nto the State House. But Kay had an idea: if those law firms were not \ngoing to let her interpret the law, she might as well ask her neighbors \nif they would elect her to make the law. So, at the age of 28, Kay ran \nfor the Texas House. She dispatched her male opponents with ease, \nbecoming one of just 13 Republicans elected that year to the 150-member \nTexas House. It was a tough transition. Kay says that as a cheerleader \nat UT, she was not really prepared for the combat of politics. As a \ncheerleader, she said, she wanted everybody to like her. But she \novercame that too. Kay has engaged in a lot of tough battles over the \nyears, and she has won most of them.\n  One story along those lines relates to Kay's office over in Russell. \nAnybody who has ever been there knows that it is at the end of on a \ndead-end hallway, and that at the very end stands a very large flag of \nTexas. Apparently, when Kay put the flag out, the staff director of the \nRules Committee did not like it. He thought it violated a rule, so he \nmentioned it to his boss, Senator John Warner. Legend has it that \nSenator Warner nodded gravely--gravely--at the young man and told him \nhe was free to approach Senator Hutchison, but that he had no intention \nof taking on the mission himself. She is tough.\n  Following her service in the State legislature, Kay worked as a \nbusinesswoman before winning election as State treasurer in 1990. Three \nyears later, when Senator Lloyd Bentsen accepted an offer to become \nPresident Clinton's treasury secretary, Kay jumped into the race to \nreplace him. Once again, she bested another all-male field to advance \nto a runoff against Bentsen's appointed successor, trouncing the \nincumbent Democrat with nearly 70 percent of the vote, and becoming the \nfirst woman to represent the Nation's second-largest State in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Kay came to Washington ready to work. She established herself early \non as a leader on transportation and NASA, and as a fighter for lower \ntaxes, and smaller, smarter government. Kay won acclaim as an advocate \nfor science and competitiveness, helped secure bipartisan support for \nthe landmark America COMPETES Act, and she became known throughout the \nState for the close attention she paid to constituents.\n  Shortly after her election to the Senate, Kay began a tradition--\nimitated by many others since--of holding weekly constituent meetings \nover coffee whenever the Senate is in session. The groups usually range \nin size from about 100 to 150, and at any given coffee you might come \nacross families in Bermuda shorts, bankers in pinstripes, or college \nfootball players. Over the years, Kay has hosted about 50,000 people in \nher office through these coffees, but her attention to constituent \nservice goes well beyond that. Back home, she is one of few politicians \nin Texas who have actually visited all 254 counties, some of which are \nhome to more cattle than people. And during Kay's tenure, her office \nhas helped broker the rescue of a Texan from atop Mt. Everest, evacuate \nan oil worker and students during a revolution in Albania, evacuate \ntourists from Machu Pichu after a flood, and help evacuate workers and \nmissionaries from Haiti after the devastating hurricanes of 2008.\n  All of us are grateful to Senator Hutchison for her work in finally \nrecognizing the hundreds of female Army Air Force pilots--or WASPs--who \nflew non-combat missions in World War II, so male pilots would be free \nfor combat missions. Thirty-eight of these women lost their lives \nperforming their duties. We thank Senator Hutchison for raising \nawareness of their service and their sacrifice and honoring their \nmemory. Senator Hutchison's thoughts are never far from our men and \nwomen in uniform. Her office walls are filled with photos of her visits \nwith our troops in Bosnia, Iraq, and elsewhere. In the run-up to the \nBudget Control Act, she authored a bill to assure servicemen and women \nwould be paid in the event of a government shutdown, recruiting more \nthan 80 cosponsors. She served as chair and ranking member of the \nMilitary Construction subcommittee on Appropriations. She was a \ntenacious advocate for Texas during a series of BRACs, and the results \nspeak for themselves: Today, one out of five Army and Air Force \npersonnel are stationed at military installations in Texas, many of \nwhich were once considered likely candidates for closing.\n  Throughout her Senate career, Kay has worked hard to develop and \nmaintain close relationships with fellow female senators from both \nparties. As a result of those friendships, Kay helped co-author the \nbook ``Nine and Counting: The Women of the Senate'' in 2000, teamed up \nwith Senator Feinstein to create the Amber Alert system, and co-\nauthored legislation with Senator Mikulski to provide stay-at-home moms \nwith the same tax-credit opportunities as working women. One of her \nproudest achievements was to lead the successful flight to lessen the \nmarriage penalties in our tax code.\n  As the ranking member on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Kay \nhas wielded outsize influence, partly due to her strong working \nrelationship with Chairman Rockefeller, who sometimes refers to her as \nhis co-chairperson. And I can say for myself that having Kay at the \nleadership table has been a tremendous asset as I have navigated \nchallenges over the years.\n  A truly gifted politician, Kay secured reelection by wide margins in \n1994, 2000, and 2006, and still holds the record for most votes in \nTexas history. One reason is she will work with anyone--even those with \nwhom she might not typically agree--if it helps Texas.\n  While I know many are sorry to see this giant of Texas politics leave \nthe arena in Washington, I am sure every one of them admires the spirit \nin which she returns to Ray and the kids and their busy Dallas home. \nKay, on behalf of the entire Senate, thank you for your extraordinary \nservice and for your friendship.\n  I know you won't miss having to answer to that buzzer anymore, but we \nwill miss you. It has been a privilege to serve with you. On behalf of \nthe entire Senate family, I wish you all the very best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Topeka Police Officers\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, we all know it has been a difficult and \ntragic couple of days for America. We were so deeply saddened to hear \nthe news from Newtown, CT, on Friday. As a parent,\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\nnothing in life is more important than the protection of our children. \nThe death of a child--there is no recovery from. My heart goes out to \nall the families who lost loved ones in this unspeakable tragedy.\n  Last night we learned of the death of our colleague Senator Inouye.\n  I want to mention today that just this past Sunday, over the weekend, \ngrief struck the capital city of Kansas, my home State. Corporal David \nGogian and Officer Jeff Atherly were fatally shot Sunday in Topeka \nwhile on duty. These public servants were investigating drug activities \nthat were allegedly occurring inside a vehicle outside a neighborhood \ngrocery store. As they approached the vehicle and ordered the occupants \nto get out, a gunman took the lives of both officers. When we lose \nsomeone in a community in Kansas, it is not just a name to us, it is \nsomebody we see at our kids' activities at school, somebody we go to \nchurch with, somebody we know and care about. These two individuals are \nthat to their friends and family in Topeka and across our State.\n  David had been part of the Topeka Police Department for 21 years. He \nspent 13 years as a reserve officer and 8 years as a full-time officer. \nHis service did not begin as a police officer; he had previously served \nhis country in the Kansas National Guard and just recently retired. \nPolice Chief Ronald Miller described David as someone who spent his \nlife in service to his country and to the city of Topeka. David's \nservice to his community was clearly a model to others, including his \nson Brandon, who followed in his dad's footsteps and serves the Topeka \ncommunity as a police officer.\n  The second officer, Jeff, was just 29 years old and had joined the \npolice department last year. Chief Miller said that Jeff was just \ngetting started in his career, and he had his entire life ahead of him.\n  Jeff grew up in the small community of Carbondale, which is just \nsouth of Topeka, and graduated from Washington University in 2009 with \na degree in law enforcement. After graduation, Jeff--like his parents \nSteve and Susan, who are both educators--decided to dedicate his life \nto public service.\n  Jeff was known by his friends for his smile, his great sense of \nhumor, and his kind heart. He leaves behind his 3-year-old son Logan.\n  These two men honorably served their community by faithfully carrying \nout the duties of a law enforcement officer. Rather than shirk from \ndanger, police officers pledge to face danger with courage, and that is \nexactly what these two men did.\n  Inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in \nWashington, DC, are these words:\n\n       It is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it \n     is how they lived.\n\n  Today we remember the lives of David and Jeff and their service to \nthe Topeka community. We express our gratitude for their dedication to \ntheir community and their country. We remember their families and their \nloved ones.\n  I ask that all Kansans--in fact, all Americans--join in remembering \nDavid's and Jeff's families in their thoughts and prayers this week. \nMay God comfort them in their time of grief and be a source of strength \nfor them. May He also protect all those who continue to serve us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate and our Nation have lost one \nof our finest leaders, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. He was an outstanding \nSenator, a true statesman, a patriot, and a gentleman.\n  It has been an honor and pleasure to be able to work closely in the \nSenate with Dan Inouye as a member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. His service as chairman of the committee--and especially the \nSubcommittee on Defense--has been marked with consistently strong and \nthoughtful leadership. He was appreciated for his courtesies to other \nMembers and his seriousness of purpose as he carried out his important \nresponsibilities.\n  He has also earned the high praise he received from the men and women \nof the Armed Forces, who are the best equipped and trained military \nforce in the world thanks to his diligent efforts on their behalf.\n  Senator Inouye was friendly and kind to all, but he was also a man of \nresolute courage and strength. He was very successful as an advocate \nfor his State of Hawaii and our Nation. All Americans should be \ngrateful for his service in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Senator Leahy has been handling this \nbill for the last 24 hours or so, and I came to the floor earlier to \nspeak about the supplemental. I gave truncated remarks because Senator \nMcCain had personal remarks to make on behalf of his colleague Senator \nKyl. At this time I would like to reengage in the debate regarding the \nsupplemental for just a few minutes.\n  I know this day has been back and forth with personal tributes on the \nfloor as well as the debate on the supplemental for Superstorm Sandy. I \nhave come to the floor specifically as chair of the Appropriations \nHomeland Security Subcommittee, which does have jurisdiction over FEMA, \nand to say a couple of words about this piece of the supplemental.\n  I understand that other chairs of the Appropriations Committee have \ncome down to talk. I know there have been discussions with regard to \nthe Corps of Engineers mitigation issues and fishery issues in this \nbill, which is the subject of Senator Mikulski's committee. Senators \nhave talked about housing and urban development, community block \ngrants--that is in HUD--and transportation, which is under the \njurisdiction of Senator Murray's committee.\n  I have been pleased and honored to be the chair of the Appropriations \nHomeland Security Subcommittee for several years now. I am proud we are \nactually seeing the benefits today of the reforms that were put in \nplace as our first responders respond to literally the worst disaster \nto hit the Northeast in 50 years.\n  I wish to address a few things and clarify some numbers for the \nrecord. The fact that Hurricane Sandy is not on the news every night \nand CNN is not broadcasting from the shores of New York and New Jersey \ndoes not mean it is over. The news coverage happened for a few days, \nand then they went to other pressing issues of the day. As new \nchallenges arise, it is natural that the attention of the press will be \ndiverted. The problem is that it may be natural, but it is not \nnecessarily good for people who have lost their homes and their \nbusinesses. Without quick action from Congress and robust, definitive, \ncomprehensive support from the Federal Government, these individuals \nand communities will not be able to recover.\n  As the Senator from one of the States hardest hit in recent memory \nfrom a natural disaster, I am able to testify as an eyewitness to what \nhappened in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and what is \npossible in the recovery for Hurricane Sandy.\n  It has been over 7 weeks since Hurricane Sandy claimed the lives of \nmore than 130 Americans and destroyed--and I want to correct the \nrecord--340,000 homes and 200,000 businesses. Just to make a \ncomparison, as a result of Hurricane Katrina, which primarily hit south \nLouisiana and Mississippi, we lost 275,000 homes. This is 340,000 homes \nthat have been destroyed. That is more than Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. And 200,000 businesses is substantially more businesses that were \nlost compared to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which was about 18,000 \nbusinesses. Part of it is due to this area being more densely \npopulated.\n  The storm was broader in its width and more intense in certain areas. \nIt was broader geographically, and the area is so densely populated. I \nthink it is hard for people from less populated areas of the country to \nunderstand how much destruction can be leveled in a certain area. More \nthan 8.5 million families were left without power, heat, or running \nwater. Many of those families have power, heat, and running water now, \nalthough not all.\n  Just this week, I picked up the phone to call my friend Marc Moriel, \npresident of the Urban League. The Presiding Officer knows him very \nwell. He\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\nwas a former mayor of New Orleans. The cell phone wasn't answered. \nFinally, through a couple of connections, I got through to him. Their \noffices are in New York.\n  He said: Mary, I am sorry I couldn't get back to you sooner. Our \nphones are still out from Sandy.\n  They have not lost their home, but they were out of their home for \nsome time.\n  As I said before, just because it is not on the news does not mean it \nis over. There are thousands of small businesses, nonprofits, \nindividuals who, without this package of hope and support, are not \ngoing to get back to business to help get their communities back and \nhelp get our economy running again. The Urban League is just one \nexample. There are still individuals without phone service, power, et \ncetera.\n  It is important for us to understand that insurance proceeds are not \ngoing to be enough. Even with a well-insured population, it is not \ngoing to be enough to handle the catastrophe that befell this \nparticular area of our country just a few weeks ago.\n  Over 500,000 people registered for temporary housing and individual \nassistance. FEMA provided over 14 million meals, over 16 million liters \nof water, 1.6 million blankets, and 100,000 tarps. DOD delivered 9.3 \nmillion gallons of gasoline to 300 gas stations, and over 270 million \ngallons of saltwater was pumped out of transit tunnels. At the peak of \nthe response, 17,000 Federal personnel and over 11,000 National \nGuardsmen were involved. The response was robust, quick, efficient, and \nI think the taxpayers of our country and I know the people of the \nregion are grateful for the new FEMA that showed up. Not everything is \nperfect. We still have more work to do, but the response was much \nbetter than it was during Katrina.\n  However, that initial response is now over and the recovery must \nbegin. The recovery cannot begin in earnest and no great plans can be \nmade. Neither can Governor Christie nor Governor Cuomo, nor Mayor \nBloomberg, nor Mayor Cory Booker or any other mayors, including the \nmayor of Hoboken in New Jersey, who testified before our committee this \nweek--none of the mayors can get about framing the possibility of \nrecovery without knowing certain things. They need to know that, A, \nFEMA is going to have enough money to stick with this, which they do \nnot now because they are going to run out of money in the spring; they \nhave to know that FEMA has enough money to go the distance. They don't \nknow that now and, without the supplemental, they won't.\n  They have to know they have some mitigation money in this bill to \nrepair and fix some of the dunes that were well engineered that \nprotected communities and to rebuild dunes that failed because they \nwere not engineered properly. No one is going to reinvest--or very few \npeople will reinvest--behind a dune that is going to fail again.\n  There are fisheries communities along the coast and tourism along the \ncoast, much like the gulf coast. So all of these pieces of recovery are \nvery important. We can't send FEMA money without the Corps of Engineers \nmoney or without community development block grant money, because the \nrecovery is a holistic recovery. Most people are very smart and many \npeople like to hold on to what money they have left. They can't take \nthe last little bit of their savings to rebuild their house and invest \nin their business if they don't know the Federal Government has sent \nmoney for the dune repair or the Federal Government has sent enough \nmoney for their fire station to get up and running. What good is having \na business with no fire protection? What good is having a business if \nthere is no grocery store within 30 miles? All of these things work \ntogether, and that is what we saw with Katrina. The question is not \nwhether FEMA has enough money; the question is whether HUD has enough \nmoney--well, it is important that FEMA have enough money but it is not \nthe only question. FEMA has to have money, but so does HUD, so does \nTransportation, and so does the Corps of Engineers.\n  In addition to what is happening along the east coast, nine States \nand the District of Columbia have been declared major disasters--well, \nnine States and the District of Columbia, from Hurricane Sandy. It is \nnot just Hurricane Sandy. We had a record number of disasters last year \naround the country. So, yes, there is some money in this bill for other \ndisasters and if we have to increase or decrease that sum to \naccommodate some of the interests of the Members, we are going to have \nto do so to get help not only to the Northeast but to other areas of \nthe country as well.\n  North Dakota experienced terrible flooding. We were a little bit \nshort on sending money to them and perhaps we should fix that in this \nbill. There have been some agricultural areas that have been very hard \nhit. We should fix that in this bill. Americans who pay taxes expect \nwhen they have catastrophic disasters for us to step up, and I think \nthat is a good expectation, and I think it is a very fair expectation. \nWhen this country went to war over a decade ago, we didn't pay for the \n$1.4 trillion that it took to secure this Nation from an outside \nthreat. Sometimes threats come right to our front door and we have to \nbe willing to step up and give a small amount compared to the $1.4 \ntrillion we spent in Iraq and in Afghanistan that was not offset. We \nshould be willing to spend a very small portion--$60 billion in this \ncase, over $100 billion for Katrina and Rita, and a few billion here \nand there. That is not an insignificant amount of money. A billion \ndollars is a lot of money. It sounds like a lot to anyone listening, \nbut relative to the cost of the war, it is a very small investment in \nour own country to help Americans who have played by the rules, done \neverything they were asked to do--they even have insurance--yet, \nwithout this bill, there is not enough money in the insurance program \nto cover their claim when they file it.\n  If we don't pass this bill, there is not enough money for FEMA to do \nits job. There is not any money in the Corps of Engineers. There is not \nenough money for transportation. Taxpayers in the Northeast and around \nthe country deserve our best efforts.\n  If there is a Member who believes there is something in this bill, \nwhether it is in my section of the bill which is Homeland Security, or \nwhether it is in another--if a Member doesn't feel as though a request \nin here is justified, please offer an amendment, let us debate it, and \nmaybe we can make some changes or a modification. Unfortunately, I can \nsay from personal experience, from watching the mayors I represent--all \n300-plus mayors in the State, dozens of them, their communities were \ndestroyed by Katrina, watching them struggle month after month, year \nafter year, not knowing what money was coming from Washington; whether \nthe levees would get repaired or not; whether there was going to be a \ncommunity development block grant--I can tell my colleagues it is \nbetter to fund this on the front end like this. Give them the money, \nlet them make their plans, and then in a year or two if it is not \nenough they can come back and we can make some adjustments as opposed \nto not acting or giving them too little to start. If we do that, the \nrecovery will not get off in a very balanced way and it will cost the \ntaxpayers so much more in the long run.\n  I am kind of responsible for the FEMA portion, for the flood \ninsurance portion, and for some of the reforms that are represented in \nthis bill. I wish to speak for a minute about those reforms because \nsometimes it is not just about investing money and giving money from \nWashington; sometimes it is giving money in a way that saves taxpayers \nmoney in the long run or for investing in a way that includes reform. \nThis is not your grandfather's FEMA. This is a new FEMA. We have some \nnew reforms that are authorized in this bill that are going to help the \nrecovery go more quickly, and I wish to talk about that for a minute.\n  This is a reform-minded supplemental. It is drafted to be a more \nefficient, more effective, and smarter recovery, saving taxpayers money \nover time. It reauthorizes two expired pilot programs from the Post-\nKatrina Emergency Management Reform Act, allows the use of money to \nrepair rental housing units, and to expedite debris removal procedures. \nIf my colleagues have not been a witness to a catastrophic disaster, \nthey cannot imagine the amount of debris generated from either a \nmassive fire or a massive flood. The old rules FEMA operated under were \na waste of money, a waste of time, and lost opportunities. So we\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\nhave expedited debris removal. We cannot start rebuilding a community \nuntil we can get rid of the debris. It sounds like common sense and it \nis, but there are some bureaucratic hurdles and we are trying to fix \nthose in this bill.\n  It allows the State to draw on a portion of the hazard mitigation \nfunding from FEMA in order to leverage mitigation opportunities in the \nreconstruction process. Under the current program, it takes 18 to 36 \nmonths for funding to become available. By then, most reconstruction is \nalready completed or underway. This would expedite--sort of forward \nfund--some of those projects, which is another smart move to save \ntaxpayers money.\n  It codifies grants on the basis of flexible and fixed estimates for \nexpedited removal of debris. It codifies temporary legislative measures \nthat were connected to facilitate smarter recovery after Katrina and \nRita, including third-party arbitration. It removes the penalty on \nalternative projects, and it allows FEMA to consolidate facilities.\n  Specifically, if 10 fire stations were lost in an area, instead of \nFEMA reimbursing each fire station one at a time, they can make a \ngeneral estimate and receive a global settlement. We did this for our \nschools in New Orleans. One hundred out of 146 were destroyed. It was \none of the smartest things we ever did, because before we passed this \nreform legislation, FEMA was asking us to count every piece of chalk \nthat was missing, every eraser that was missing, every broken pane of \nglass, and would only refund the building of that exact building on \nthat exact spot. We were able to have a global settlement where we \ncould reconstruct our schools not to build a school system that had \nbeen built for the past century but to build a school system for the \nnext century. That is what makes sense. That is what is in this reform \nsupplemental.\n  There are better tools, more carefully designed to save taxpayers \nmoney and to help expedite a recovery of one of the most important \nfinancial centers in the world--not just in the United States but in \nthe world. Every part of this country is important, but this particular \npart of the country, a lot of the rest of us depend on it operating at \nfull speed, particularly as this recovery moves to our rearview mirror.\n  Let me say two or three more things. It reduces bureaucratic waste by \neliminating the current practice of duplicative agency reviews for the \nsame project. It will allow the rebuilding to, of course, consider \nenvironmental needs, but it does not require an environmental review by \nevery agency for the same project. It helps to streamline that, which I \nthink makes sense and honors the environment at the same time.\n  It includes tribal governments for the first time, which I think is \nan important addition, and, again, it requires an assessment of \nHurricane Sandy's impact on local government budgets in the event they \nmight need to borrow some additional money to continue to operate.\n  So, again, the $60 billion number is a large number. It is billions \nof dollars. It is not by any means pocket change, but compared to the \nmoney that was outlaid for the wars--$1.4 trillion--when disaster comes \nknocking at the door in our hometowns, whether it is Hoboken, NJ, or \nNew Orleans, LA, taxpayers who live by the rules and pay their taxes \nevery year expect not a handout, not an easy recovery, but they do \nexpect the Federal Government to step up and at least be a partner in \ntheir recovery.\n  There are local taxes that are going to have to be raised. There are \nhundreds and thousands of hours of volunteer efforts that go into \nrebuilding communities. Churches and faith-based organizations show up \nand do more than their share, but the Federal Government most certainly \nshould step up and help the Northeast and a few other disasters that \nare still open.\n  All of this money will come back to us one-hundredfold as these \nbusinesses get back up on their feet, start paying taxes again to the \ncommunity, and hire people who have been laid off. In fact, it creates \na little bit of a stimulus boon in those communities, which benefits \nthe tax base as well, as taxes are collected from every business that \nis reopened. So it is a smart investment for us.\n  I would recommend to my colleagues if they have specific objections \nto a specific part of the bill to file an amendment. We can discuss it, \nwe can debate it, and perhaps we can shave a little here or a little \nthere; perhaps there are some things that can be done differently. But \nthis has gone under careful review by the administration and by the \ndifferent members of the Appropriations Committee on both sides of the \naisle, and, of course, vetted and screened by Governor Christie, a \nstrong Republican leader in our country, Governor Cuomo, a strong \nDemocratic leader in our country, and numerous mayors and elected \nofficials have looked at this.\n  This is not something that was written in the dark of night somewhere \nby somebody who doesn't understand about disasters. It was carefully \ncrafted for a very strong recovery for the Northeast.\n  I thank the Members for their suggestions and I look forward to the \ndebate, and hopefully we can get this supplemental done before this \nCongress adjourns. I think the people of the Northeast and the rest of \nour country are depending on us to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is the parliamentary situation in order so \nI could send an amendment to the desk?\n  I have an amendment at the desk and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This is McCain-Coburn amendment No. 3355. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Coburn be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. \n3355.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Coburn, proposes an amendment numbered 3355.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike funding for the emergency forest restoration \n                                program)\n\n       Beginning on page 2, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through page 3, line 2.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is a very simple one. It \ncalls for striking the funding of some $58 million for the USDA, U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, Forest Restoration Program for planting \ntrees on private property. It is actually a farm bill subsidy program \nthat is run by a relatively unknown agency that is called the Farm \nService Administration, which is primarily responsible for managing \ncrop insurance.\n  Under this program, private landowners with about 50 acres of land \ncan apply for up to $500,000 in free grants for tree planting \nactivities. Obviously, this has nothing to do with an emergency, and \nthere is nothing in the supplemental that limits the funding to \nHurricane Sandy areas. Under this bill, this $58 million can be used \njust about anywhere.\n  I would like to make a few remarks about the bill itself so we have \nthis in the right context.\n  First of all, I want our colleagues--everyone--to understand there \nare none of us who do not support--there is no one who does not \nsupport--giving the much needed funding as quickly as possible to help \nrelieve the tragedy of Hurricane Sandy, and we believe there are \nimportant parts of this appropriations bill that we should pass \nimmediately. But we also believe there are many provisions in this bill \nthat both have nothing to do with Hurricane Sandy and many of the \nprograms in this bill will not even take effect before the year 2015. \nWe are about to reach the year 2013. We cannot consider this much \nneeded appropriation outside the context that we now have nearly a $17 \ntrillion debt, and, obviously, this $60 billion is now going to be \nadded to the debt because none of it is paid for.\n  Let's be clear about this. Every one of my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle wants to act quickly to provide much needed relief for the \npeople who have been impacted by the horrible effects of Hurricane \nSandy. But we cannot consider this legislation in a vacuum. We are \nlooking at a $17 trillion debt--somewhere between $16 and $17 trillion. \nWe have committed generational theft. We have mortgaged our\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\nchildren's and our grandchildren's future. So we must be very careful \nas to how much more of the taxpayers' dollars are spent. For what? When \nis this money necessary? Those are the questions this body should be \nasking itself.\n  I would argue there are a whole lot of billions of dollars in this \nbill that fit into the categories of, one, not necessary as a result of \nthe impact of Hurricane Sandy and certainly not an emergency situation.\n  I would like to go over some of the projects that are in this bill, \nand some of them hold merit. Some of the projects in this bill are very \nmeritorious. It goes way beyond emergency aid and funds projects, as I \nsaid. At a time when we face these deficits, we cannot justify this \nspending. Again, I wish to emphasize some of the projects are \nmeritorious, but they should go through the normal budget and \nappropriations process, where Congress has time to vet the need for \nsuch spending requests.\n  The CBO examined both the Senate bill and the administration's \nrequest and found--and this is from the Congressional Budget Office--64 \npercent of the funds appropriated under the Sandy supplemental will not \nbe spent until fiscal years 2015 to 2022 and after, therefore, raising \nconcerns about the rush to spend $60.4 billion without any attempt to \npay for it.\n  Two weeks ago, FEMA Director Fugate told the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee that the Disaster Relief Fund currently has \nenough money and will not need additional funding until the spring of \n2013. CBO's assessment, combined with the statement of Director Fugate, \nclearly shows we need to pass a Sandy supplemental bill that only \nincludes prioritized disaster aid funding.\n  I and my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, have been examining \nthis bill over the last few days, and I will tell my colleagues, we \nhave not gotten all the way through it. We have not identified a lot of \nthese spending bills--what they are for and where they came from. The \nappropriators and their staff I always admire. They have turned it into \nan art form, and our ability to ferret out some of these appropriations \nhas required a great deal of hard work and effort.\n  We have billions to replace ``Federal assets'' damaged by the storm, \nincluding automobiles owned by the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment currently owns or leases over 660,000 vehicles. Do you think \nwe could find replacements within our own inventory, the current \ninventory? Shouldn't we focus on providing relief directly to those \nstill trying to rebuild their lives before replacing a bureaucrats' \ncar?\n  There is $2 million to repair damage to the roofs of museums in \nWashington, DC, while many in Hurricane Sandy's path still have no \npermanent roof over their own heads.\n  There is $150 million for fisheries as far away from the storm's path \nas Mississippi and Alaska.\n  There is $125 million for the Department of Agriculture's Emergency \nWatershed Protection Program, which helps restore watersheds damaged by \nwildfires and droughts for areas, including Colorado, and, by the way, \nincluding my own State of Arizona. That money is needed. It is needed. \nWe are having wildfires across the Southwest and the West in an \nunprecedented fashion because we are in severe drought, and I want that \nmoney for the Department of Agriculture's Emergency Watershed \nProtection Program. But it has nothing to do with Hurricane Sandy. That \nis what is wrong with this bill. I will fight for the $125 million that \nwould help my State of Arizona, and I will fight to find ways to pay \nfor it. I will do both. But we are including $125 million for the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Emergency Watershed Protection Program, \nwhich is several hundred miles away from the path of Hurricane Sandy.\n  There is $20 million for a nationwide Water Resources Priorities \nStudy. While studies are important, they are not emergencies and should \nbe submitted during the upcoming budget debate.\n  We badly need a water resources priorities study. There was just a \nrecent study about the Colorado River basin and how we are going to run \nout of water. But, again, the water resources priorities study is not \nassociated with Hurricane Sandy.\n  There is $15 million for NASA facilities, though NASA itself has \ncalled its damage from the hurricane minimal. One day after the storm \nhit, NASA's Wallops Island put out a statement stating that ``an \ninitial assessment team surveyed roads and facilities at NASA's Wallops \nFlight Facility today reporting a number of downed trees but otherwise \nminimal impact in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.'' Does this mean we need \n$15 million for NASA's facilities?\n  There is $336 million for taxpayer-supported Amtrak without a \ndetailed plan for how the money will be spent. Some of the funding will \ngo for repairs. Money will also go to increasing capacity and future \nmitigation efforts. Amtrak is up and running. We can go right over \nhere--not very far from here--to Union Station and get on Amtrak. It is \nnot apparent why this funding is deemed ``emergency'' spending and \nincluded in this spending package. Further mitigation should be debated \nnext year.\n  The dirty little secret is that Amtrak loses billions of dollars \nevery year. That is because we subsidize unneeded and unnecessary \nroutes. The route on the east coast from here to New York, for example, \nmakes money. But we cling to those routes that neither make money nor \ndoes anybody care to patronize.\n  There is $5.3 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers--more than the \nArmy Corps of Engineers' annual budget. With no clarity as to how the \nmoney will be spent. Included in the Senate bill is $50 million in \nfunding for more studies, which will most definitely lead to additional \nArmy Corps projects and a new task force established by executive \norder.\n  More projects are not something the Army Corps can handle. They are \ncurrently experiencing a backlog of construction and maintenance \nprojects of approximately $70 billion. Furthermore, a 2010 report \nreleased by the Government Accountability Office noted that carryover \nfunds have increased ``due to the large amount of supplemental funding \nthe Corps has received in recent years.'' Clearly, supplemental \nspending on the Army Corps has not paid off.\n  The bill includes $12 to $13 billion for future disaster mitigation \nactivities and studies, without identifying a single way to pay for it. \nI think we need future disaster mitigation activities. We need studies. \nWe are experiencing climate situations which we never anticipated. \nCertainly Hurricane Sandy was never anticipated by any of us. We need \nthe studies. But that is not an emergency to handle the effects of \nHurricane Sandy and should come out of normal funding and be paid for. \nI support these studies. But should they come out of the taxpayers' \npocket without a way to pay for it?\n  There is no justification to include these projects in this emergency \nspending bill. Waiting to fund these projects until next year during \nthe normal budget and appropriations process, we will have a better \nunderstanding of the path forward and reduce the possibility of waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  There is $10 million to improve weather forecasting capabilities and \ninfrastructure. Mr. President, $10 million to improve weather \nforecasting capabilities and infrastructure--do we truly need to \ninclude that in an emergency funding bill for Hurricane Sandy? As I \nmentioned at the beginning, at some point we are going to have to start \npaying for things. At some point we are going to run out of Chinese \nmoney. At some point we are going to be like Greece. At some point the \nAmerican people are going to say ``enough.'' Every American family has \nto balance their budget. Every American family has to make tough \ndecisions. Why don't we make some tough decisions if we want to have \nthings paid for such as weather capabilities, such as Amtrak, such as \nreplacing Federal assets, buying vehicles when we have 660,000 vehicles \nin the inventory? Why don't we start making tough decisions?\n  I often mention that the approval rating we have from the American \npeople is rather interestingly low. The last one I saw was an 11-\npercent approval rating. No wonder--no wonder--we are about, in a \nmatter of literally hours, to spend about $60 billion of the American \ntaxpayers' money--estimates by some are it should be around $24 \nbillion--without hearings, without the kinds of\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\nscrutiny it deserves in the normal appropriations process.\n  I understand why we need some of this money in an emergency fashion. \nBut it is akin to the train leaving the station. It is loaded with pork \nand it is moving and so everybody wants to get on board. It is not the \nway the Congress should do business.\n  So, Mr. President, I will ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment, \nwhich is to strike funding for $58 million for the tree planting \nsubsidy known as the Forest Restoration Program for planting trees on \nprivate property.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Is the Senator asking for the yeas \nand nays?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There does not appear to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. McCAIN. OK. Then I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nwith the call of the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There does not appear to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today, as so many colleagues have \ndone throughout the day, to pay tribute to a tremendous colleague whom \nwe lost yesterday, a friend to all of us, someone from whom we have all \nlearned a tremendous amount, on both sides of the aisle, about how to \nwork together, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. He was an outstanding Senator, \na cherished colleague, and a dear friend.\n  We all know he dedicated his life to serving our country, first as a \nsoldier in World War II where he put his life on the line for our \nfreedoms, for our country, and then as a Member of Congress for 53 \nyears. Senator Inouye was Hawaii's first Congressman. Think about that, \nthe first Congressman. Today marks the first day in the history of our \ncountry that the State of Hawaii has not been represented in Congress \nby Danny Inouye.\n  He also had a special connection to my home State of Michigan, and \nSenator Levin and I have both been very proud of that fact. He was a \npatient at a hospital in Battle Creek during World War II where he met \nPhilip Hart and Bob Dole. Can you imagine those three great men coming \ntogether serving our country, wounded, doing rehabilitation at a \nhospital together in Michigan and all going on to be involved in public \nservice as Senators?\n  That building is still standing. It is no longer a hospital; it is \nanother Federal building. It is our great honor in Michigan to have \nthat building named the Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center, honoring all \nthree of these outstanding leaders.\n  Senator Inouye was a great mentor for me as well as so many of us in \nthe Senate. Coming to the Senate, he always encouraged me during the \nelections. He always told me to hang in there, that things would go \nwell and it would be great. He was always a person with a smile on his \nface, encouraging each and every one of us. He was there encouraging me \nwhen we were fighting for our economic lives in Michigan with the \nautomobile industry, saying it was going to be OK, that we would be \nable to get through it, and that things would be better on the other \nside. He was right, with the help of so many people here and the \nPresident.\n  He also has consistently said to me: I want to help your city of \nDetroit. I want to make sure I do everything I can to support that \ngreat city. He has been a wonderful friend and supporter on that front \nas well.\n  He also received a distinguished honor given by the Arab-American \ncommunity in Michigan after he helped us establish the first National \nArab American Museum. After 9/11 when there were stories of young Arab-\nAmerican children and girls who were being harassed or attacked while \nwearing their traditional garb in school, he called up leaders in \nMichigan to tell them they had his support as a Japanese American, \nknowing what he had gone through in a very difficult time in our \ncountry's history. He showed incredible support to a great part of our \nMichigan community.\n  He is beloved by so many around Michigan, but no more than those who \nare in the Arab-American community who are business leaders, community \nleaders, who found themselves, just because of their heritage, in very \ndifficult circumstances. He has shown great support to them and was a \ngreat role model to them. I was proud to be a part of honoring him a \nfew years ago in Michigan with the highest award coming from that \ncommunity.\n  He touched lives everywhere he went. He served with quiet dignity. He \nhad a strong, firm conscience. He has set an example for each one of \nus. He was a true patriot and a true American hero in every sense of \nthe word. The Senate and the American people will miss him greatly. My \nthoughts and prayers are with his family this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3350 to Amendment No. 3338\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 3350.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Tester], for himself, Mr. \n     Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Wyden, and \n     Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 3350 to amendment \n     No. 3338.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funds for wildland fire management)\n\n       On page 72, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n                        wildland fire management\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Wildland Fire Management'', \n     $653,000,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, \n     That such amount is designated by Congress as being for an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of \n     the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)(i)); Provided further, That, not later \n     than December 31, 2013, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of \n     the House of Representatives and the Senate a report on new \n     models or alterations in the model that may be used to better \n     project future wildfire suppression costs.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Tim \nJohnson of South Dakota be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 3350.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks on \namendment No. 3350. This past summer was the third worst fire year in \nthe history of this great country, with over 9.2 million acres burned. \nOver 1 million of those acres were in the State of Montana. The drought \nthat drove this year's fire season persists and is projected to worsen \nin 2013, creating conditions for an equally or potentially greater fire \nseason this upcoming year.\n  This trend is not stopping. Conditions are changing on the ground. I \nthink we are all seeing impacts. I am certainly seeing impacts on my \nfamily farms. We are seeing impacts across the forests of this country, \nand western Montana is no exception.\n\n[[Page S8129]]\n\n  My amendment with Senator Udall does two things: First, it provides \nfunding for the difference between the current funding request to \nprepare for and suppress wildfire and the amount the 2013 fire season \nis expected to cost; second, it requires GAO to make recommendations on \na better model to project the cost of wildfires in the future.\n  Wildfires are continuing to burn, and burn hotter and faster, larger \nand earlier, and doing more damage than in past years. We need to \nassure the resources to address these catastrophic events are there \nthis next year and with a study into the future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  unanimous consent agreement--S. 3276\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate has been considering the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for 2 days now. The Republicans, I am \ntold, are in the process of trying to picture out what they want to do. \nWe have other concerns, as you know. We had the tragedy in Connecticut, \nand we had the untimely death of our friend Senator Inouye. But time \ndoesn't stop for anything. It keeps marching on, Christmas is coming. \nWe have a fiscal cliff that is on the horizon. So I hope we can make \nprogress on this bill in the morning. If not, I will be forced to file \ncloture to try to figure out a path forward on this bill. It has been \nopen for amendment. That is what my friends said they wanted, and that \nis what they have.\n  We have the DOD authorization. We need to complete action on that \nconference report, which has been completed now. We expect they will \nfile tonight or tomorrow, so we need to complete that before the end of \nthe week.\n  Christman is 7 days from today. We have judicial nominations. We have \nbeen making some progress with the district court nominations. We have \nto do three more before the end of the week. We have executive \nnominations we need to consider before the end of the week.\n  FISA is an important piece of legislation. Imperfect as it is, it is \nwhat is necessary to help us be protected from the evil that is in the \nworld. We have to complete this before we leave here this week.\n  Today is Tuesday. Everyone else can do the math just as well as I can \nabout how many days are left.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader after consultation with the Republican leader, the \nSenate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 463, S. 3276; that the \nonly first-degree amendments in order to the bill be the following: \nJudiciary Committee-reported substitute; Leahy, sunset; Leahy, \noversight; Wyden, public reporting; Wyden, backdoor searches; Tester, \nreverse targeting; and Merkley, declassification of FISA Court opinion; \nthat there be 1 hour of debate equally divided between the proponents \nand opponents; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to votes in relation to the amendments in the order listed; \nthat there be no amendments in order to any of the amendments prior to \nthe votes; that upon disposition of the amendments, the bill be read a \nthird time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as \namended, if amended.\n  Mr. President, before the Chair rules, it is pretty easy to figure \nout how much time this includes. This is the better part of a day--the \nbetter part of a day if we got this consent done. So I ask that the \nChair approve the consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nintend to object, first of all, I say to the leader, thanks for moving \ntoward the FISA bill because--the Senator is exactly right--this is a \nbill that must get done before the end of the year so we can make sure \nour intelligence community is able to gather, in a lawful and legal \nway, the kind of intelligence that helps keep America safe and secure.\n  There are two documents; first, a Statement of Administration Policy \nfrom the White House where they have agreed to the bill that has \nalready passed the House, and second, a letter from the leadership of \nthe intelligence community--namely, the Director of National \nIntelligence as well as the Attorney General--directed as the \nleadership, both of which letters and statements support the House \nbill.\n  It is because of that and because of the fact that if the House bill \ncomes through here--and I understand we may have to have debate, may \nhave to have amendments debated, whatever the leader says--but the \nimportant thing is that we can hopefully get that bill passed and send \nit directly to the President's desk.\n  So I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nletter from the DNI and the Attorney General dated February 8 as well \nas the Statement of Administration Policy dated September 10.\n  Mr. President, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 2012.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n       H.R. 5949--FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012\n\n                  (Rep. Smith, R-TX, and 5 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports H.R. 5949. The bill \n     would reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act (FISA), which expires at the end of this \n     year. Title VII of FISA allows the Intelligence Community to \n     collect vital foreign intelligence information about \n     international terrorists and other important targets \n     overseas, while providing protection for the civil liberties \n     and privacy of Americans. Intelligence collection under Title \n     VII has produced and continues to produce significant \n     information that is vital to defend the Nation against \n     international terrorism and other threats. The Administration \n     looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure the \n     continued availability of this critical intelligence \n     capability.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leaders Reid, Pelosi, and \n     McConnell: We are writing to urge that the Congress \n     reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act (FISA) enacted by the FISA Amendments Act of \n     2008 (FAA), which is set to expire at the end of this year. \n     Title VII of FISA allows the Intelligence Community to \n     collect vital information about international terrorists and \n     other important targets overseas. Reauthorizing this \n     authority is the top legislative priority of the Intelligence \n     Community.\n       One provision, section 702, authorizes surveillance \n     directed at non-U.S. persons located overseas who are of \n     foreign intelligence importance. At the same time, it \n     provides a comprehensive regime of oversight by all three \n     branches of Government to protect the privacy and civil \n     liberties of U.S. persons. Under section 702, the Attorney \n     General and the Director of National Intelligence may \n     authorize annually, with the approval of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), intelligence \n     collection targeting categories of non-U.S. persons abroad, \n     without the need for a court order for each individual \n     target. Within this framework, no acquisition may \n     intentionally target a U.S. person, here or abroad, or any \n     other person known to be in the United States. The law \n     requires special procedures designed to ensure that all such \n     acquisitions target only non-U.S. persons outside the United \n     States, and to protect the privacy of U.S. persons whose \n     nonpublic information may be incidentally acquired. The \n     Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of \n     National Intelligence conduct extensive oversight reviews of \n     section 702 activities at least once every sixty days, and \n     Title VII requires us to report to the Congress on \n     implementation and compliance twice a year.\n       A separate provision of Title VII requires that \n     surveillance directed at U.S. persons overseas be approved by \n     the FISC in each individual case, based on a finding that \n     there is probable cause to believe that the target is a \n     foreign power or an agent, officer, or employee of a foreign \n     power. Before the enactment of the FAA, the Attorney General \n     could authorize such collection without court approval. This \n     provision thus increases the protection given to U.S. \n     persons.\n       The attached background paper provides additional \n     unclassified information on the structure, operation and \n     oversight of Title VII of FISA.\n\n[[Page S8130]]\n\n       Intelligence collection under Title VII has produced and \n     continues to produce significant intelligence that is vital \n     to protect the nation against international terrorism and \n     other threats. We welcome the opportunity to provide \n     additional information to members concerning these \n     authorities in a classified setting. We are always \n     considering whether there are changes that could be made to \n     improve the law in a manner consistent with the privacy and \n     civil liberties interests of Americans. Our first priority, \n     however, is reauthorization of these authorities in their \n     current form. We look forward to working with you to ensure \n     the speedy enactment of legislation reauthorizing Title VII, \n     without amendment, to avoid any interruption in our use of \n     these authorities to protect the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n     James R. Clapper,\n       Director of National Intelligence.\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will continue to work on a path forward. \nIf anyone has any ideas how to help me do that, I would be happy to \nlisten to them, but this is something we must do before we leave here. \nChristmas is not more important than this legislation. I am sorry, I \nhope I am not offending anyone, but that is the way it is. We have to \nget something done on this before the end of the year, and I think we \nwill be walking on very, very thin ice to try to wait until after \nChristmas to try to move this legislation. It is hard for me to \ncomprehend the potential damage to our country if we do not extend this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3368\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3368.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I object. I feel somewhat ill at ease here with not having \nanyone managing the bill at all, but I would hope that my friend will--\nI will talk to Senator Leahy, but I am not in a position here to agree \nwith it.\n  One thing I am not going to do, regardless of what the managers say, \nis have a big stack of amendments here that we are going to be worrying \nabout. So I don't know where everybody is, but the managers aren't \nhere.\n  Mr. COBURN. Through the Chair, I would ask the majority leader, he \ndoes not want amendments to be made pending for us to debate?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, do we have amendments pending now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are amendments pending.\n  Mr. REID. How many amendments are pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a substitute amendment and four \nfirst-degree amendments.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is filing a first-degree amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am.\n  Mr. REID. One more shouldn't do much damage.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, I have five I was going to place pending, and I \nwill be happy to work with the managers.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend again, through you, Mr. President, I am \nhappy to do one, but the managers--I haven't talked to them in the last \ncouple of hours. I am not going to agree to five amendments. I have no \nidea what is in them. If the Senator wants to lay down one of the \namendments tonight, that is fine, but until we have managers on the \nfloor, I am not going to agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3371 to Amendment No. 3338\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and that amendment No. 3371 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, propose an amendment numbered 3371 to amendment No. \n     3338.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that Federal disaster assistance is available for \n           the most severe disasters, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec. 52007.  (a) Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (in this section referred to as \n     the ``Administrator'') shall review the public assistance per \n     capita damage indicator and shall initiate rulemaking to \n     update such damage indicator. Such review and rulemaking \n     process shall ensure that the per capita indicator is fully \n     adjusted for annual inflation for all years since 1986, by \n     not later than January 1, 2016.\n        (b) Not later than 365 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) submit a report to the committees of jurisdiction in \n     Congress on the initiative to modernize the per capita damage \n     indicator; and\n       (2) present recommendations for new measures to assess the \n     capacities of States to respond and recover to disasters, \n     including threat and hazard identification and risk \n     assessments by States and total taxable resources available \n     within States for disaster recovery and response.\n       (c) As used in this section, the term ``State'' means--\n       (1) a State;\n       (2) the District of Columbia;\n       (3) the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;\n       (4) any other territory or possession of the United States; \n     and\n       (5) any land under the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe, as \n     defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say to my friend the Senator from Oklahoma \nthat the manager will be here bright and early in the morning. I will \ncall him now.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is fine. I have no choice but to accede to the \nSenator's wishes, so I will.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Would the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have a section of this bill, and I wonder if that \namendment is relevant to my bill, and I would extend some courtesy.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is updating per capita damage indicators and the \nprocess for determining declarations. Oklahoma has had more \ndeclarations declared, but we haven't updated the per capita indicator \nfor a long time, so we have had no increase in that. So what is \nhappening is that it is too easy to get a declaration declared. I am \ntrying to have them update that to where it is more reflective of the \ntrue cost.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the Senator's advocacy for Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. This would actually hurt Oklahoma.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. But what I am wanting to say to the Senator from \nOklahoma is that my subcommittee deals with coastal impact, so the \nissue the Senator wishes to raise is with the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity.\n  If it dealt with my part of the bill, I would say--because I know \nwhat the Senator is trying to do, and I appreciate it, which is trying \nto move the Senate forward in an expeditious way.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. We have a bill before us that is $64 billion, and I have \nspent the last week trying to get the OMB and Department of Commerce \nthe background on all of these requests, and what I can tell you is \nthere is an immediate need for about $24 billion that we ought to be \npassing through this Chamber to take care of immediate needs over the \nnext 2 years in relationship to this tragedy in terms of Sandy.\n  Almost every amendment I am going to offer or hope to offer is about \ntransparency, is about limiting who can have access, such as people who \nare in arrears on their taxes for years and years.\n  What we learned on the Homeland Security Committee, which has the \nauthorization of most of these programs, which I will become ranking \nmember of, is that out of the $100 billion-plus we spent on Katrina, \n$11 billion of it got wasted. One of the reasons it got wasted is \nbecause we didn't have transparency, we didn't have good-government \namendments on it. And we are getting ready to make that mistake again.\n  So I was asked to come down, by our side of the aisle, to have \namendments pending, and now that I can't have amendments pending, I \nthink I will\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\njust talk in general about this bill for a moment, if I might.\n  There is no one in the Senate who does not want to meet the needs of \nthe people who have suffered from this horrific storm. How we do that \nis important. Meeting immediate needs in terms of the insurance fund \nfor flooding--that is something on which everybody would agree. Nobody \nis going to object to that. We are going to be short on that. But also \nwhat is important in that is that we should have a provision that if \nyou were in a floodplain and didn't buy the insurance, we certainly \nshould not be ponying up our grandkids' money to pay for you when you \nchose not to insure it.\n  The reason that is important--there are two moral principles on why \nthat is important. No. 1 is that we are going to endorse \nirresponsibility. No. 2 is that if we don't put that provision in this \nbill, the NFIP is never going to work because in the future everybody \nis going to say: Don't worry, you don't have to buy the flood \ninsurance. Congress is going to take care of it.\n  So it is those kinds of good-government things that I am trying to \nput into this bill, and now I am unable to bring amendments to the \nfloor. There is no reason not to bring amendments to the floor right \nnow.\n  We are going to pick and choose what amendments we are going to bring \nto the floor when we have good-government amendments? I am at a loss to \nknow why we would object to good-government amendments.\n  I understand the majority leader's reasoning. We now have five \namendments pending on this bill of $60 billion. You take five or six of \nthe agencies, this bill is going to be more than what all five of those \nagencies spend in a year, and 64 percent of this bill would not even \nget obligated until 2015 at the earliest.\n  I also would remind my colleagues that on this $64 billion bill, we \ndon't have to offset any spending anywhere under the rules. So here we \nhave this $64 billion, when we know we are wasting hundreds of billions \nevery year in agencies throughout this government, and we are going to \nborrow $64 billion and not do the good-government cleanup, \ntransparency.\n  One of our amendments is about creating a Web site so everybody can \nsee. One of our amendments is about not having no-bid contracts or \nsole-source contracts. We have all this experience from Katrina where \nwe know the money was wasted. Yet now we are precluded from putting \namendments on the Senate floor that would keep us from wasting that \nvery money in this emergency supplemental bill. It shows the \ndysfunction of the Senate.\n  In 2005 and 2006, we would not have had this happen. Amendments would \nbe offered, they would get voted down or embarrassed into not asking \nfor a vote, or withdrawn. Now we are going to pick and choose good-\ngovernment amendments. In other words, we are saying we don't want good \ngovernment. We don't want to do the hard work of making things \nefficient and effective when we go to spend $64 billion.\n  I don't get it. I don't understand it. Generations will not \nunderstand it that follow us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                      Newtown, Connecticut Tragedy\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer condolences to the \nfamilies and the communities of Newtown, CT, and to offer my \ncondolences to the family of Daniel K. Inouye, the Senator from Hawaii.\n  For nearly a week now, my thoughts and prayers have been with \neveryone in Connecticut and all those families whose lives have been \nchanged by the murders in Newtown. Like so many Americans, Sharla and I \ncontinue to struggle with the news. We prayed for lives that were lost \nand grieved for their families and their loved ones.\n  As a former teacher, but more importantly as a father and \ngrandfather, I can't begin to make sense of the violence, especially \nagainst children--children, our future, the same age as my grandkids, \nexposed to the unthinkable actions of an assassin. No one can make \nsense out of it. I don't think we ever will. But we can offer hope.\n  We can offer our solidarity as Americans who unify in tragedy to look \nahead--shaken with grief but strengthened with courage. In the days and \nweeks ahead, we will work together to address the unspeakable violence \nthat has hurt our Nation. As a Senator, it is my responsibility to \naddress the growing issue of violence in America, particularly as it \napplies to schools and public places, and to stand to ensure the safety \nof our children.\n  While we mourn the deaths of innocent children and their educators, \nwe must bring ourselves together for an honest, real, national \nconversation about every aspect of this terrible attack. It will be a \ndifficult conversation, but it is the responsible and necessary next \nstep for the children of this country, for the children of Montana, and \nI look forward to rising to the challenge.\n\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  Earlier today, I had the opportunity to sit in the Presiding \nOfficer's chair, and I heard many Members of this body speak of Senator \nInouye. Some spoke of him as a distinguished voice, a Senator's \nSenator, a great hero, a true patriot, a singularly iconic leader, an \nincredibly great man, a giant of the Senate, a mountain of Hawaii, and \nthe list goes on and on and on.\n  You know, they say the hardest thing to get in life is a friend, and \nthe easiest thing to lose in life is a friend. Danny Inouye was a \nfriend.\n  I will never forget when one of my neighbors came out to visit me. \nDan's office is right next door to mine in the Hart Building. Now, make \nno mistake about it, before I came to this body I knew of Dan Inouye's \npast as a war hero, as a part of the Watergate investigative committee. \nHe truly was somebody I knew before I got here through the media.\n  Well, so did my neighbor. After I had been here for a while I started \nto take Dan for granted. He was just one of us. So my neighbor was \nhere, and we were standing in the anteroom of my office and Dan Inouye \ncame walking out of his office. My neighbor's eyes almost rolled out of \nhis head and fell on the floor. He wanted to meet Dan. Why? Because he \nwas a great American and he knew it. He knew this was an opportunity he \nshouldn't pass up.\n  I stopped into Dan Inouye's office today and passed along my \ncondolences to the staff and had the opportunity to walk back into \nDan's office. One of the things that was pointed out to me was a sugar \ncontract that set right above his chair, right in front of him. It was \nwhat he looked at every day when he sat at that desk--a sugar contract \nhis parents had. Why? So he didn't forget where he came from. And all \nthe time Dan Inouye served in this body he was probably as grounded as \nanybody ever could be because he never forgot where he came from.\n  When I first got here, I was trying to get on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I went to visit Senator Inouye, and he said he would help, \nand he did.\n  Dan Inouye was going to Cody, WY, and he flew into Billings, MT, and \ndrove down to Cody for a veterans event. In doing so, he drove through \nforests that were brown and dead, and he came back and asked me: What \nis going on with the forests in Montana?\n  I said: Dan, I have a bill called a forest jobs and recreation act \nthat will help remedy that problem. Dan's response was: Sign me up as a \ncosponsor. He was always there to help.\n  I remember one time in the cloakroom he was telling a war story about \nafter he had gotten his arm blown off. They were laying on stretchers--\nthis was in the 1940s, and medicine has come a long way since then, \nremember. But they were laying on stretchers, and there were many folks \nthere, many with limbs missing, and he said there was a man of the \ncloth giving last rights. They came to Dan and Dan said: No, I am not \ngoing anywhere. And he stayed with us, thank goodness, and came to the \nCongress and then to the Senate. What a man. What an incredible man he \nwas.\n  He always sat at our table at the caucus lunch, and when he came in \nhe referred to me as ``Big One,'' and then proceeded to lecture me as \nto why I needed to lose weight if I was going to stick around here for \na while. I always appreciated that.\n  Another time we were in his office visiting about some legislation, \nand out of the blue he asked me how many men I had on staff. I was \ngoing down the list counting them when he said: You know how many I \ngot?\n  I said: No.\n  He said: I got two because women are better.\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\n  That was Dan Inouye. He also had a connection to probably every State \nin the Union, and Montana was no exception. He always spoke of Mike \nMansfield with great passion.\n  When I was in his office earlier today I noticed on the wall he had a \npicture of Ted Stevens, LBJ, Warren Rudman, and, of course, Mike \nMansfield. On that picture, Mike Mansfield, then-majority leader, had \nwritten to my friend Senator Dan Inouye: ``With admiration, respect, \nand affection.''\n  I can't say it any better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                        Remembering Jamie Ellis\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise tonight to pay tribute to Jamie \nEllis, a beloved member of my staff who passed away on Tuesday, \nNovember 27, at the age of 65.\n  Jamie Ellis served his State and country proudly as a constituent \nliaison in my office in Tupelo. He handled veterans issues, a role he \nfilled with compassion, ability, and integrity. It was a natural fit. \nJamie brought to the position his own background of military service \nand experience as a volunteer Veterans Service Officer for the local \nchapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America. He had a deep understanding \nof the unique circumstances our veterans face, and he worked tirelessly \nto make their lives better. His help and kindness will not be \nforgotten.\n  This ability to work well with others was evident throughout Jamie's \ncareer, from his years in public service to his success in business. He \nknew how to lead--a talent that served him well as president of Ellis \nBrothers Timber and Wonder Wood Products in Mississippi. Before joining \nmy office, he was a valued independent sales agent for Lawson Products \nin Illinois.\n  Jamie deserved the respect that veterans and others bestowed upon \nhim. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1966 to 1970, spending nearly \n3 years in southeast Asia, including 1 year in Vietnam. He then served \nin the National Guard. In his home community of Saltillo, Jamie was a \n32nd-degree Mason and Shriner and member of the Saltillo First United \nMethodist Church.\n\n  Helen Keller once said:\n\n       The world is moved along not only by the mighty shoves of \n     its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of \n     each honest worker.\n\n  Jamie was the true and honest worker Ms. Keller describes, and he was \na hero to those he helped. There is no doubt his contributions have \nmade the world a better place than he found it.\n  I am thankful to have known Jamie Ellis and to have had him on my \nstaff. My wife Gayle and I extend our deepest sympathy to his loved \nones. To many, Jamie was a fellow veteran and a good friend. To his \nfamily, he was a devoted son, husband, father, brother, and \ngrandfather.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, especially his wife \nJudy of 42 years, and their three children and nine grandchildren.

INOUYE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I understand we are in a period of morning \nbusiness. I wish to offer a few reflections and reminiscence about our \ndearly departed Senator Dan Inouye.\n  Yesterday afternoon I came into the Chamber expecting to vote on a \nmatter or two. I was stunned and devastated to hear the news, as were \nthe rest of my colleagues, that we had lost Senator Inouye. When I \nthink of what a Senator is and should be, I think of Dan Inouye.\n  When I came to the Senate, 10 years ago now, I would say that there \nwere three undisputed giants in this hall. There may have been more, \nbut there were three undisputed giants I think everybody recognized as \ngiants in the Senate. One would be Ted Stevens, one would be Ted \nKennedy, and the other would be Dan Inouye. There is something about \nthose three men, those three Senators, that put them in a class by \nthemselves.\n  Some of it is the force of their personalities, some of it is their \nlegislative accomplishments, some of it is just their ability to get it \ndone; when the chips are down to have the integrity, to understand the \nvital role that the Senate plays in our Federal system. I think Dan \nInouye had all of those traits and he also had character. Character is \nsomething that is hard to describe, it is hard to quantify, hard to \ndefine sometimes, but there is no doubt Senator Inouye had character.\n  Yesterday morning I got off the plane. Like many of us I raced into \nthe office. I noticed I had a big bundle of papers waiting for me to \nlook at. I did not have a chance to look at those, I just grabbed those \nand plopped them on my desk and I thought I would go deal with those \nlater, and later turned out to be the next morning, which is this \nmorning.\n  I have been thinking about losing our friend Dan Inouye over the last \n12 or 14 hours or so, and I was sitting in my office starting to go \nthrough this stack of papers and there at the bottom of the stack I saw \na Christmas card that had come from Senator Inouye and his wife. I \nthought this Christmas card summed up one of the traits that made \nSenator Inouye so special. It is from Dan and Irene--certainly we offer \nour prayers and our support for Irene right now--but the photo was \ntaken at the Maui Arts and Cultural Center, ``a performing arts \nfacility, providing music, dance and theatrical performances as well as \nart exhibitions.'' It is about Hawaiian culture and education and there \nhe is on their Christmas card, promoting Hawaii and never stopping in \nthat quest to make us aware of the special nature of that State and the \nimportance of that State and so many of the qualities of that State.\n  I look at Senator Inouye's picture on the Christmas card and what I \nsee is that very kind and very generous but also, as our fellow \nSenators will testify and have testified repeatedly today, that very \nencouraging face and way of Dan Inouye.\n  Actually a year or so ago, on my own initiative, I wanted to know a \nlittle bit more about him. It is rare to have a Congressional Medal of \nHonor recipient in your midst, much more rare to work with that person \nevery day. I had the great fortune and extreme pleasure of being on two \nof Senator Inouye's committees, committees he chaired. He chaired the \nCommerce Committee for a while and he chaired the Appropriations \nCommittee. I served on both of those with him as chair. In both of \nthose, by the way, I saw the great bipartisan working relationship he \nhad. I want to talk about that again in a moment.\n  About a year or two ago I thought: I want to know more about Senator \nInouye, so I started reading. Of course, you can go to Wikipedia and \nwhatnot, but there are several books available, several resources \navailable where they talk about his life story. Of course, with Senator \nAkaka and Senator Inouye, they were both born in the Territory of \nHawaii, not the State of Hawaii but the Territory of Hawaii. When you \nstart to read about Dan Inouye's young life, you start to think this is \nan ordinary, average guy. He is going to grow up and be pretty \nnondescript. Who knows what he is going to do with the rest of his \nlife? But\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\nwhen he is a youngster he does things such as he parks cars at ball \ngames; he cuts his classmates' hair for money--you know, these little \nthings we all do. He saved his money and bought and trained a flock of \nhoming pigeons. He had a postage stamp collection--all this ordinary \nAmerican stuff that boys do as they are growing up.\n  But his life took a dramatic turn on December 7, 1941. He was an \neyewitness, like Senator Akaka--and Senator Akaka often tells the story \nbut Dan Inouye was an eyewitness to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. He was \ntoo young to join the military at that point, but he was not too young \nto serve. The way he served was he worked as a medic in the aftermath \nof that. I read a story about him one time and the only comment he said \nwas he saw ``a lot of blood'' in those days when he worked around the \nclock to help people.\n  When he finally came of age to be able to serve, which was a few \nyears later, he joined the Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team. For a \nlot of people, a lot of Americans, we may not appreciate exactly what \nor who the 442nd is, but it turns out it would become the most highly \ndecorated unit in the history of the U.S. Army. Of course, Senator \nInouye received the Medal of Honor for his service in that unit.\n  There is one other distinction it has. Almost all the Members were of \nJapanese descent. So here is this 17-, 18-year-old young man who had \neyewitness accounts of very harsh treatments by Americans of Japanese \nAmericans.\n  One of the things Senator Inouye did not talk a lot about is that he \ndid some sort of goodwill tour back in the 1940s to Japanese internment \ncamps. He came to the two in Arkansas. My understanding is maybe the \nmembers of the 442nd--I am not quite sure how it worked, but they were \ndoing some training or whatever, maybe down in Louisiana. I am not \nquite sure. But nonetheless they came and they went to the two Japanese \ninternment camps in Arkansas.\n  He goes on to serve in World War II with tremendous distinction. In \nfact, there are a few video interviews I would recommend to people that \nC-SPAN2 ran last night, just unbelievable, some of the stories he told \nabout serving in the war and how it changed his life.\n  One of the things that I loved about him is how he carried a burden. \nHe carried a burden of those heroic war years with him for the rest of \nhis life. The fact that he had been so effective in war haunted him. It \nstayed with him, I am sure, until the day he died. I heard him talk \nabout it a few months ago.\n  He also struggled and suffered with his own type of discrimination \nbecause he was a Japanese American. My generation--and certainly people \nyounger than me--take that for granted. We don't discriminate against \nJapanese Americans. However, during the time of World War II, when a \nlot of people had never had much experience with Asians and Asian \nAmericans, all they knew was that they had bombed Pearl Harbor, we were \nat war with them, so they must all be bad.\n  I remember Senator Inouye told a story--in fact, it was on PBS for \nthe series called ``The War,'' a Ken Burns movie, where he talked about \nhow he lost his arm and had done his rehab and was headed out to the \nwest coast. It is my understanding he was supposed to catch a ship and \ngo back to Hawaii after his long rehabilitation. Well, he decided to \nstop in and get a haircut at a local barber shop on the west coast. I \nbelieve the barber shop was in Oakland, CA. Here was a highly decorated \nWorld War II veteran who had literally almost given his life to this \ncountry and would live the rest of his life without his right arm. When \nhe walked in the barber shop, the barber told him bluntly: ``We don't \ncut Jap hair.'' ``We don't cut Jap hair'' is the kind of thing that \nstays with you. That is the kind of thing that made Senator Inouye so \nspecial.\n  I saw him meet with a young man just a few months ago who had also \nlost his arm. This young man lost his arm to cancer. He introduced \nhimself to Senator Inouye and said: I have always admired you and \nrespected you because of your disability and what you have done for \nother people with disabilities. Dan Inouye looked him square in the eye \nand said: ``I don't consider it a disability.''\n  There again, we see his character and get a glimpse of what he was \nall about.\n  He was also the first Japanese American to be elected to Congress, \nthe first Japanese American to be sworn in, and the first Japanese \nAmerican to serve in the Senate. In fact, he was sworn into the House \nthe very same day that Hawaii became a State.\n  There is a story that has circulated in the House for a decade about \nhis swearing in. He came in at kind of a special time because he won a \nspecial election. He was in a class of one to be sworn in over there \nand Sam Rayburn did the normal swear-in thing. He said, without \nthinking: ``Raise your right hand and repeat after me.'' Of course, \nCongressman Inouye didn't have a right hand at that point; he left it \nin Italy while fighting for his country.\n  He broke several barriers, large and small, throughout his life. One \nof the things I loved about him was his relationship with Ted Stevens. \nI still remember that their desks were right across the aisle from one \nanother. I remember them working together on all kinds of legislation. \nThey were brothers. Their love and friendship transcended partisan \ndivide. They were totally for the national interest. I think they set a \ngreat example for all of us and how we can work together.\n  They didn't always agree. If we look at their voting record, they \nvoted opposite each other a lot of times, but they worked together and \nhad an exemplary relationship I think we should all follow.\n  We had Senator Inouye come to the Senate Prayer Breakfast a few \nmonths ago. For those who are watching at home or don't know a whole \nlot about the Senate, every Wednesday morning we are in session we have \na Senate Prayer Breakfast. It is for Senators and former Senators only. \nWhen we come together, it is a very special time to share each other's \nlives and tell stories.\n  It was a treat to have Dan Inouye. I believe he lived in Rockville, \nso it was hard for him to get here so he didn't make it that often, but \nhe came when he could. I have been here 10 years, and I have been going \nto the prayer breakfast almost that long. He is the only speaker I have \nseen in the Senate Prayer Breakfast who got a standing ovation before \nhe spoke and a standing ovation after he spoke. That is the kind of \nSenator and man he was. He had this spirit that oozed from him. No \nmatter what situation he was in, other people respected him so much.\n  This last story I will tell is one of my favorite stories about him. \nWhen he won his reelection back in 2010--I didn't see it, but I heard \nthis--at the podium that night while accepting his election for his \nninth term, he announces that he is going to run for his tenth term in \n2016. That is part of that indomitable spirit that we will all miss so \nmuch about Senator Inouye.\n  With that, I want to thank my colleagues for all the wonderful things \nthey have said about Senator Inouye. I want to lift up his family in \nprayer. He has a fantastic, wonderful staff, and I know everyone in \nHawaii is mourning the loss of this great man.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8133-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8133-S8135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to respond to some of the \ncomments I heard from my colleagues with reference to the Hurricane \nSandy emergency supplemental. Hopefully I can give all of our \ncolleagues--who will be casting a vote here at some point--an \nunderstanding as to why we hold a different view than some of the \ncomments that have been made.\n  One of those comments I will generally put under the rubric we can \nwait and do something small. Various comments have been referenced in \nthat respect. Some seem to be questioning whether this emergency is \nworthy of a robust Federal response. They say the cost to help families \nrebuild and recover is too much and should be reduced. I have heard \nthat in this emergency it is not necessary, and unlike many other \nsimilar emergencies in the past, we should do something smaller and \nwait to do the rest later.\n  I think those who suggest or make that argument don't seem to \nunderstand that a piecemeal recovery is a\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\nfailed recovery. We cannot rebuild half of a bridge unless we know the \nentirety of the money that is necessary is committed, like the \nMantoloking Bridge in New Jersey, which I have shown many pictures of. \nWe cannot hire a contractor to ultimately replace an entire sewage \ntreatment system that had enormous amounts of sewage dispersing \ndirectly into the Hudson River because it was overcome if we only have \nhalf of the funding. We cannot hire a contractor to rebuild half a home \nor restore half of a community unless we know the money is there and \nthat they can depend upon it in order to finish the project. We need \nthe money in place to rebuild entire projects and entire areas to \nensure that families and businesses devastated by the storm can \nrecover.\n  Right now there are literally tens of thousands of small business \nowners trying to decide whether to reopen or pack it in. They are in a \nlimbo. They are waiting to see what we, their Federal Government, do to \nrespond to their tragedy. They are making decisions in their lives, \ntheir businesses, and everyone who is hired by those businesses. They \nare frozen and waiting to make those decisions based on whether the \ngovernment is going to offer them a small business loan at low rates \nthat are competitive with the marketplace and have longer term \npayments. Will they give them a grant toward rebuilding? What type of \nother benefits will they be able to derive in order to make a \ndetermination of whether they can open their business again? Having \njust a sense that there is only some emergent money and not the moneys \nto be able to do that doesn't allow them to open their business. It \ndoesn't allow them to make that decision, and it freezes them in time.\n  The same thing is true for the person who, as winter is biting in the \nNortheast, faces the challenges of deciding what they might get from \nthe government as it relates to rebuilding their home. Should they go \nforth or not? It is as if some of our colleagues don't believe when we \ndescribe this tragedy--and I welcome any one of our colleagues who \nwants to visit us in New Jersey to come with me to see the breadth, \ndepth, and scope of our devastation. I have already taken a number of \nMembers who were willing to go.\n  I ask my colleagues: Do you think Governor Christie is making this \nup? Do you think this fiscal hawk of the Republican Party is looking \nfor Federal aid that is not desperately needed? Do you think we made up \nthese photos of the damage? I can assure everyone we did not.\n  This is a picture taken just at one small part of the Jersey shore. \nIf I could have a continuum that would bring us around this Chamber, it \nwould look exactly like this. This is Ortley Beach. It shows blocks and \nblocks of homes that have been totally destroyed. It is an image that \ncan be seen up and down the New Jersey coast.\n  Here is another example in Union Beach. It is half a home, but that \nwhole community was significantly devastated. If we were to see this \ncommunity, there would be rows and rows of houses reduced to rubble. I \nthink that is the reality of what we have as a continuation of those \nneighborhoods in Union Beach.\n  I was talking to the mayor today--as part of a group of mayors--about \ntheir challenges, and this is an example of what he is facing \nthroughout his community.\n  The storm damage is real and the Governor's request for funding is \nactually $20 billion higher than the supplemental we are debating. It \nis significant that it is $20 billion higher than the amount we are \ndebating. These requests were scrubbed by OMB from the Governor's \noriginal request and gone over with a fine-tooth comb by the \nAppropriations Committee. Everything in this bill, whether it is about \nSandy or something else, is about declared disasters. Now is the time \nto come to our neighbors' help.\n  Secondly, there are those who come to the floor and say they are \nupset about the Army Corps element of this disaster bill and that the \nbudget in this bill is too rigorous. They say that planning and \nrebuilding for the future is a waste, and that we can have another \nlegislative opportunity to deal with the future. I would submit to \nthose Members who very much care about fiscal responsibility that it is \nneither efficient, effective, nor fiscally responsible. What should we \ndo, have the Army Corps go back to exactly what existed before? In many \ncases, what existed before did not sustain those communities, did not \nwithhold the consequence of the surge, and created enormous losses.\n  We lost over 40 lives. The storm affected over 300,000 homes--30,000 \npermanently gone.\n  It seems to me, if we want to be smart fiscally, planning for the \nfuture means rebuilding well and rebuilding smart. It means rebuilding \nin a way that protects us from future storms.\n  We learned a lot from this superstorm. We know Army Corps coastal \ndefenses work. Where we had them in place, the damage was minimal; \nwhere we didn't, there was more devastation, there was more damage, \nthere was more destruction, and more recovery costs.\n  Stockton College did a study of the Army Corps beach engineering \nprojects before and after the storm, and what it found was unambiguous. \nWhere the Army Corps was able to complete a beach engineering project \nrecently, the dunes helped and damage to communities behind the project \nwas manageable.\n  Here is a picture taken at Surf City, NJ, right after the storm. This \nbeach received beach engineering in 2007 as part of the Army Corps Long \nBeach Island Shore Protection Project, and my colleagues can see that \ndespite damage being done to the dune, the dune held and saved lives, \nsaved property, and saved money.\n  Alternatively, the pictures of Union Beach, which I previously \nreferred to--it is a working-class town that couldn't afford the local \nmatch for the Army Corps project, and as my colleagues can see, we have \nan entirely devastated neighborhood. So we see the fundamental \ndifference: Engineered beaches by the Army Corps, minimal destruction: \nThose that weren't engineered, maximum destruction; costs, and \nconsequences. Rebuilding the defenses only to the standard that existed \nbefore the storm will just give us more of the same in the next storm. \nIf we don't do things differently, we shouldn't expect a different \noutcome.\n  In this photo, we also see the homes destroyed by the storm surge. \nYes, we can help these homeowners rebuild, but if we don't rebuild \nsmarter, better, and with stronger coastal protections, we will be \npaying again after the next storm, both in terms of human suffering and \nFederal funds. The storm crews with the Army Corps of Engineers, \nacademic studies, and local community officials have been telling us \nfor years that beach engineering works. It protects lives. It protects \nproperties. It saves us money in the long run.\n  Time is of the essence. The severe storm damage caused by Sandy has \nleft New Jersey defenseless. As we enter what is our most vulnerable \nstorm season--the winter Nor'easters--we don't need a Superstorm Sandy \nto have major consequences all the way up and down the communities \nthroughout New Jersey.\n  Right now, the Jersey shore is similar to a person with a weak immune \nsystem. The storm has destroyed our defenses, and that is why we need \nto rebuild them quickly. If we don't, a relatively mild storm can cause \ncatastrophic damage.\n  This is a challenge to us right now--right now. Suggesting the Army \nCorps budget is not one we need right now and it can wait--these \ncommunities can't wait. These communities can't wait. In fact, it will \nbe far more costly to us.\n  I think we have close to anywhere between $750 million and $1 billion \nin Army Corps of Engineers projects that have been approved--passed and \nbeen approved--but they have not had the funding. So when we add those \nthat would ensure we don't end up like Ortley Beach and that we can \nrecover those like Ortley Beach that have been battered and shattered, \nthen I think it makes critical sense.\n  Finally, I know there are some who suggest mitigation is not worthy \nof this disaster. I think I have made the case, in the case of the Army \nCorps, although the Army Corps is not the only form of mitigation. \nMitigation means rebuilding smarter and stronger. Whether it is through \na flexible CDBG account that will allow the hardening\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\nof our electrical grid or elevating homes or via traditional Army Corps \nor FEMA programs, mitigation has long been a part of supplemental \nappropriations.\n  In the gulf coast, we spent $16 billion building a world-class storm \nprotection system in Louisiana--$16 billion. In Alabama and Texas, we \nused CDBG funding to raise homes and improve infrastructure. So much of \nthe public infrastructure in our region that was damaged as a result of \nthe superstorm is eligible for reimbursement from FEMA. There is no \ndisputing that.\n  The Stafford Act has now been the law of the land for many years, and \nit says the Federal Government will assume the cost of repairs to \ncritical infrastructure after an event such as Sandy. These \ncommunities, when we talk to mayors in Little Ferry and Moonachie--not \nthe Jersey Shore but northern New Jersey and other places that were \ndramatically hit--when I was visiting them soon after the storm, one \nmayor said to me, Mayor Vaccaro, I lost my police department, my fire \ndepartment, and city hall is underwater.\n  They need to be protecting their citizens. They need to be able to \nfully depend upon the resources to get back their public safety \nefforts. It does not make good fiscal sense for Congress to pay to fix \nour broken infrastructure, which we are legally required to do, without \nlooking to protect our investment and prevent similar costly damage in \nthe future. To me, that makes a lot more fiscal sense at the end of the \nday. So we will look forward to coming back to the floor again and \nagain as we deal with these issues, but I hope our colleagues \nunderstand the urgency of now.\n  Final point. After Katrina, in 10 days the Congress passed two \nemergency supplementals that totaled a little over $62 billion for \nLouisiana, Alabama, Mississippi. It has been 6 weeks--6 weeks, not 10 \ndays, 6 weeks--since the storm hit New Jersey, New York, and the \nNortheast, and there hasn't been any action. The urgency of now is \nincredibly important and the urgency of doing this robustly is \nincredibly important to the recovery of a region that is so important \nto the economic engine of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8135-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES RAMSEY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my good friend \nand an extraordinary leader of my hometown of Louisville, KY: Dr. James \nRamsey, the president of the University of Louisville. President Ramsey \ncelebrated a milestone for the University of Louisville recently when \nit was announced that UofL was unanimously welcomed into the Atlantic \nCoast Conference.\n  The ACC has a great history, a proud athletic tradition, and is home \nto some truly astonishing academic schools. Thanks to Jim's work as \npresident over the last decade, the University of Louisville is able to \nstand toe to toe with any of them, in any of those categories.\n  Dr. Ramsey is the 17th president of the university, and has held that \npost since 2002. In his 10 years at the helm, he has worked every day \nto make UofL one of the very best metropolitan research universities in \nthe country. It is safe to say, he is succeeding.\n  Since 2002, the quality of UofL's freshman class has improved every \nyear, with the average incoming freshman ACT score rising from 23.2 in \n2002 to 24.7 in 2011. The graduation rate has increased nearly 60 \npercent, and the number of doctoral degrees awarded by the school has \nmore than doubled since 2002.\n  UofL students are also winning national acclaim and prestigious \nacademic honors. In 2009, UofL produced its fourth Rhodes Scholar, who \nwas also the first woman from UofL to win the award.\n  In 2010 and 2011, 14 UofL students won coveted Fulbright \nscholarships, placing UofL among the nation's top 20 Fulbright-\nproducing institutions each year. Since 2003, 68 UofL students have \nreceived Fulbright scholarships, which is more than all other Kentucky \nschools combined.\n  President Ramsey has created a university culture that is focused on \nresearch and innovation. This approach has already led to major \nmilestones in health care, business, and the environment. The Chronicle \nof Higher Education lists the University of Louisville as the fourth \nfastest growing research university in the country.\n  UofL's research funding has doubled from a decade ago, and UofL is \none of the country's fastest growing research universities in National \nInstitutes of Health funding.\n  UofL has also strengthened its ties with the city of Louisville in \nsuch a way that this school is an invaluable asset, not just to its \nstudents, faculty, and alumni, but to all members of the community. \nUofL has been a major player in the award-winning Partnership for a \nGreen City with Jefferson County Public Schools and Louisville Metro \ngovernment.\n  It has also launched a Signature Partnership Initiative to improve \neducation, health care, social services, and economic opportunity in \nthe city. The school is also reaching out to men and women in the Armed \nForces, signing education, training, and research agreements with Fort \nKnox and the Kentucky National Guard.\n  All of these accomplishments in the last decade have transformed the \nUniversity of Louisville from a fine local institution to a superb \nglobal one--one able to compete with any school in the quality of its \nstudents and the caliber of its research. Exciting things are happening \nat the university, and we have Jim Ramsey to thank.\n  I want to salute Dr. Ramsey and congratulate him on his superb \nleadership of the school I am proud to call my alma mater. He and his \nwife Jane are fixtures of the community, and Elaine and I are honored \nto call them friends.\n  I certainly hope Jim will be at the helm of UofL for a long time to \ncome. I will always look forward to working with him on ways to better \nthe school and the city that we both love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8135-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8135-S8136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I previously filed committee allocations \nand budgetary aggregates pursuant to section 106 of the Budget Control \nAct of 2011 and, on June 29, I revised some of those levels pursuant to \nthe Budget Control Act. Today, I am further adjusting those levels, \nspecifically the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for \nfiscal year 2013 and the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2013.\n  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments \nto the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) \nallows the chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to \nallocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. \nThe Committee on Appropriations reported two bills that are eligible \nfor an adjustment under the Budget Control Act:\n\n       One, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for 2013 \n     includes $93.297 billion in budget authority that is \n     designated as funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/the \n     Global War on Terrorism. That funding is estimated to result \n     in $50.697 billion in outlays in 2013.\n       Two, the fiscal year 2013 disaster assistance supplemental \n     includes $55.957 billion in budget authority that is \n     designated as funding either for a disaster, $5.379 billion, \n     or an emergency ($50.578 billion). In total, that funding is \n     estimated to result in $8.974 billion in outlays in 2013.\n\n  In addition, I am making corrections to the June 29, 2012, adjustment \nby removing the off-budget portion of the program integrity funding \npreviously provided for continuing disability reviews and \nredeterminations.\n  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2013 by a \ntotal of $148.840 billion in budget authority and $59.302 billion in \noutlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlay allocations \nto the Appropriations Committee by $93.409 billion in security budget \nauthority, $55.845 billion in nonsecurity budget authority, and $59.671 \nin total outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed

Mr. President, I wish to recognize today an \nextraordinary public servant and a dedicated leader of the U.S. \nintelligence community, Ms. Caryn Anne Wagner, the Under Secretary for \nIntelligence and Analysis--I the Department of Homeland Security. \nAfter 30 years of devoted Federal service, Caryn came out of retirement \nin 2010 when the President nominated her to the Under Secretary \nposition. She was confirmed for this position and has proven herself a \nmanager and leader of what had been a troubled agency. After nearly 3 \nyears in the job, Ms. Wagner will retire again on Friday, December 21. \nI am sorry to see her leave but wish her the very best as she prepares \nfor her next chapter.\n  I came to know Caryn when she was nominated to be the Under Secretary \nfor Intelligence and Analysis. Since then, she has drawn on the depth \nand breadth of her experience in the intelligence community and the \nCongress to build the foundations of a Homeland Security intelligence \noffice that will long outlast her tenure. The mission of I is to \nprovide the Department of Homeland Security with the intelligence and \ninformation it needs to keep the homeland safe, secure, and resilient \nand to bring to the intelligence community the information and analysis \nfrom the Department's thousands of officers posted at our Nation's \nairports, borders, and numerous other places around the world. It also \ninforms and empowers State, local, and tribal governments and law \nenforcement on the frontlines of our homeland defense against \nterrorism.\n  Caryn's many years of experience in the intelligence community, \ncombined with an indepth knowledge of the National Intelligence \nProgram, collaborative instincts, and insightful thinking on \nintelligence matters have been key components of her success. She \npreviously held senior positions involving oversight of the collection \nand analysis of intelligence to include: the Director of Analysis and \nProduction and Director of the Military intelligence staff for the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, where she was responsible for development \nand management of the General Defense Intelligence Program; the Defense \nIntelligence Agency's senior representative to the U.S. European \nCommand and North Atlantic Treaty Organization--NATO--Assistant Deputy \nDirector of National Intelligence for Management and the first chief \nfinancial officer for the National Intelligence Program; as well as the \nExecutive Director for Intelligence Community Affairs. In that role, \nshe was responsible for the Community Management staff, which provided \nstrategic planning, policy formulation, resource planning, program \nassessment and budget oversight for the intelligence community. Adding \nto her experience in the executive branch, she also served for a brief \ntime in the private sector, where she provided support to military \noperations, intelligence planning, and intelligence systems \narchitecture development. She also served our Nation in uniform for 8 \nyears as a signals intelligence and electronic warfare officer in the \nU.S. Army, and in the Congress as budget director for the House \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  But I want to note in particular her role as Under Secretary in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Caryn stepped into a relatively new \norganization that had some notable problems,\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\nto include an unclear mission, a shocking overreliance on a workforce \nin which government contractors outnumbered employees, and major \nshortfalls in office budgeting and spending. Drawing upon her \nconsiderable experience, Caryn was able to shape I's personnel \nstructure to match as closely as possible that of the larger \nintelligence community; thereby greatly decreasing the number of \ncontractors, flattening the Federal grade structure, and moving junior \nand midgrade personnel into career ladder positions. She also addressed \nand conquered basic management challenges that had previously gone \nunnoticed and unaddressed. As a result, I now has a functioning \nprocess to develop a budget request and execution plan; procedures in \nplace for hiring and training qualified personnel; and procedures for \nidentifying the need for policies, then writing, publishing and \nenforcing them.\n  While overseeing the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence \nfunctions, Under Secretary Wagner has promoted information sharing and \nengagement with State, local, and tribal partners and has championed \nthe consolidation of the Department's counterintelligence mission. In \nthe critical area of cyber security, Caryn has overseen I's close \ncollaboration and analytic support to the Department's National \nProtection and Programs Directorate.\n  Under Secretary Wagner has approached every issue with a pragmatic \nand professional approach that should be a model for all who follow \nher.\n  I would also like to note that over the past year or so, I have had a \nseries of dinners and informal gatherings with senior women in the \nintelligence community. In that context, I have gotten to know Caryn on \na more personal level, and I hope that we will continue our friendship \nafter her retirement.\n  Our Nation owes this public servant a tremendous debt of gratitude. I \nwish to thank her on behalf of the committee for her decades of \nexceptional service to our country and to wish her and her husband Chad \nthe very best in the days and years ahead. Caryn can at long last \ndedicate more time to her love of gardening, travel, theater going and \nfine dining, and I wish her all the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8137-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF CALIFORNIA RICE PRODUCTION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I would like to commemorate \nthe centennial of commercial rice production in California. What began \nas an experimental crop in the Sacramento Valley has become a more than \nbillion-dollar industry for our State and an exceptional agricultural \nproduct enjoyed by consumers worldwide.\n  Rice was introduced in California during the Gold Rush, when \nimmigrants traveled to the State in search of fortune and a better \nlife. As early as 1870, European and Asian settlers began to experiment \nwith different varieties of rice that they had grown back in their \nhomelands. After attempts to grow long grain rice were unsuccessful, \nthe USDA concluded that California's climate would be more amenable to \na Japanese medium-grain variety known as Kiushu. When Kiushu failed to \nthrive in southern and coastal areas of California, it was discovered \nthat the Sacramento Valley had the most ideal soil and climate \nconditions for the high-quality Japanese varieties of rice. By 1908, \nKiushu rice was successfully being grown in the community of Biggs in \nButte County. The California Rice Experiment Station, established in \nBiggs in 1912, has helped farmers perfect the short- and medium-grain \nrice crop for the last century. More than 95 percent of the State's \nrice is grown in the Sacramento Valley region of California.\n  Rice has become one of the State's top agricultural exports. \nAccording to the California Rice Commission, California rice is used in \nnearly every roll of sushi made in the United States and represents \nmore than 30 percent of the Nation's rice exports to countries such as \nJapan, Taiwan, and Korea. This year's crop is expected to yield 5 \nbillion pounds and represents $1.8 billion in economic value.\n  In addition to supplying consumers with this fine agricultural \nproduct, California rice fields serve as an important habitat for \nmigratory birds along the Pacific Flyway. After the fields are \nharvested in the fall, growers flood them to create feeding grounds \nthat yield nearly 60 percent of the food needed by 10 million waterfowl \neach winter.\n  I congratulate California's 2,500 family rice farmers on this \ncentennial of successful rice production, and organizations such as the \nCalifornia Rice Commission and Farmers' Rice Cooperative that have \nworked to promote and export this fine product all over the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8137-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8137-S8138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HARRY E. LeGRAND\n\n Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Harry E. \nLeGrand, a native North Carolinian, for his contributions to his State, \nhis Nation, and the scientific community, particularly in the area of \ngroundwater research and how the disposal of contaminated waste can \naffect our water supplies.\n  Born in 1917 in Mebane, NC, Harry graduated from the University of \nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in geology. He was working as \na geologic aide when he answered his nation's call to duty and served \nas an officer of the First Army in the European Theatre of World War II \nwhich included service stretching from the Normandy invasion to the \nBattle of the Bulge.\n  Harry returned home after his valiant service to our country and \nmarried Undine Nye. Throughout his life both personally and \nprofessionally, Undine provided Harry with love and support and \ntraveled with him on many geology trips, providing a sense of home even \nin far away places.\n  When Harry went to work for the Ground Water Branch of the United \nStates Geological Survey, USGS, he quickly noticed something that would \nfollow him throughout his career--the lack of comprehensive records and \ndata related to his field of study. Despite the fact that incomplete \nand imprecise data was a constant in his professional career, Harry saw \nthis as an opportunity rather than an impediment and stated in an \nautobiographical article that ``working with imprecise data can be a \nblessing because it prompts clear reasoning that can lead to useful \ndeductions.'' Where many people would see nothing more than a roadblock \nHarry saw opportunity, and the work he accomplished to fill in the many \nholes in available information and build on the data that did exist led \nto practices still heralded and in use today.\n  Harry's work in those years focused primarily on groundwater in the \nfractured igneous and metamorphic rock in the Piedmont of North \nCarolina, and he discovered a useful system for locating high-yielding \nwells based on topography and soil thickness. During the 1950's, Harry \nworked with the USGS's Office of Radiohydrology to identify potential \ndeep-well disposal sites for low-level radioactive material and was \nnamed head of the Radiohydrology Section in 1960. It was in this \ncapacity that he became more interested in groundwater contamination \nand laid the foundation for future research of the role and impact of \nnatural attenuation. Ever curious and eager to further knowledge on \nsubjects that were under-researched, Harry soon turned his attention to \nkarst hydrology. After much travel, research, and field work, Harry and \nhis fellow Americans serving on the Karst Commission of the \nInternational Association of Hydrogeology laid the basis for useful \ngeneralizations that would have worldwide application. Harry's \nretirement did not slow him down and in 2004, 3 decades after leaving \nthe USGS, Harry wrote a report that serves as a master groundwater \nconceptual model for sites in the igneous and metamorphic terrain of \nNorth Carolina.\n  Harry spent his life pursuing fields of study that were largely \nunder-researched at the time and, in many cases, offered little in the \nway of solid data upon which to build. Despite, or perhaps in spite of \nthat, Harry pushed forward with research that furthered development in \nthese fields and provided a solid foundation for research to come. \nWhile the worlds of geology and groundwater research might feel foreign \nto many of us, Harry identified many shared qualities between aquifers \nand human beings, and he expressed these commonalities in poetry. As if\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\nhis work on the subject wasn't enough, his real legacy might be \nintroducing others to the underground waterscape that exists beneath \nour feet and inspiring future generations to continue to explore the \nnatural world in which we live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8138-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JUDGE PAT SHAW\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the job of a county judge in an \nOregon county is a tough one. In addition to serving as the chief \nelected officer and manager of the county, the county judge serves as \njudge of the probate court and the juvenile court.\n  There is no other elected official in Oregon that demands so much of \none person.\n  Pat Shaw, of Gilliam County, has served in this role for 6 years and \nduring this time she has been a superb example of what a county judge \nought to be.\n  Pat has administered the county, managing the budget with aplomb. She \nhas gone toe to toe with State and Federal agencies and made tough \ndecisions in juvenile and probate court. No one can claim that her \nplate has not been overflowing and yet she has always taken time to go \nthe extra mile for her community.\n  Pat has served Gilliam County for 30 years, including 16 years as \ncounty assessor. Her colleagues thought so much of her that she was \nchair of the Oregon Assessors Association for 7 years. She also served \na stint as secretary to the Gilliam County Fair Board. Anyone who \nserves on a fair board knows how tough a job that can be.\n  Pat has also been part of a three-county group, the county judges of \nGilliam, Wheeler, and Sherman Counties, which have tackled problems on \na regional basis. Together, these counties have been among the best in \nthe State. Gilliam County houses a regional communications system that \nis the envy of the rest of Oregon. It provides 9-1-1 services and \ncommunications to law enforcement throughout eastern and central \nOregon. The system, called Frontier TelNet, also provides education and \nbroadband services for their residents.\n  The three counties, along with their education service district, \ncreated the communications system because no one else wanted to provide \nservices to these very rural counties. When no one else would help, \nthey stepped up and figured out how to get it up and running. And while \nPat wasn't county judge when the system was started, she has been key \nto keeping it running at such a high level.\n  She has also been in the forefront of bringing wind energy to Gilliam \nCounty, and working to improve her county's economy, education and \npublic safety.\n  Pat is not retiring because she is tired of serving Gilliam County. \nOregon requires judges to retire at age 70. As a county commissioner, \nshe could serve as long as the voters wished her to serve, but because \nshe has judicial duties, Oregon law requires her to step down.\n  In this case, that is a shame. In Pat Shaw, we have the very \ndefinition of what a public servant should be. Gilliam County and I \nwill miss her as a county judge, but I am sure Pat will find some other \nway to continue in public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8138-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:07 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4606.

A bill to establish a grant program to encourage the use of \nassistance dogs by certain members of the Armed Forces and veterans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Senior Airman \nMichael Malarsie Act to increase the number of assistance dogs \navailable to disabled servicemembers and veterans.\n  I met Senior Airman Malarsie earlier this year, and his story and \nperseverance have inspired this legislation. In 2008, during a \ndeployment to Afghanistan, Senior Airman Malarsie was seriously injured \nand blinded by an improvised explosive device. Blinded in both eyes, \nSenior Airman Malarsie was placed on a waiting list for several months \nbefore he was paired with his guide dog, Xxon. Only through generous \ndonations totaling $45,000, Senior Airman Malarsie was able to receive \na guide dog. Unfortunately, too often our wounded warriors must wait \nseveral months before receiving assistance dogs. According to \nAssistance Dogs International, last year there was a backlog of 188 \nveterans waiting for placement. I strongly believe we must do more so \nthat they do not wait months for a trained assistance dog.\n  The bill will create a joint grant program between the Department of \nDefense and Department of Veterans Affairs to assist qualified \nassistance dog agencies provide trained dogs to covered servicemembers \nand veterans. The competitive grant program would be used for dogs that \nassist with specific disabilities such as hearing loss, mobility loss, \nvisual impairment, and post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic \nbrain injury. A portion of each grant would be used for evaluation to \nensure that grant funds are being used properly and that each member or \nveteran is provided with best trained dog possible. This bill \nauthorizes $15 million for the competitive grant program.\n  The number of veterans who require the assistance of assistance dogs \nis expected to increase as military members returning from combat are \ndiagnosed with disabilities. The non-profit organizations that train \nand provide the service dogs free of charge to veterans cannot keep up \nwith the surge of returning wounded warriors. Each service dog can cost \nup to $45,000 to train, and assistance dog organizations must rely on \ngrants and the generosity of individuals, foundations, and corporations \nfor funding. Through a competitive grant program, this bill will \nincrease the number of assistance dogs available for veterans and \nactive-duty members and decrease the waiting time for disabled warriors \nwaiting for assistance. We must do more than watch as our servicemen \nreturn home from war and are forced to wait several months for an \nassistance dog simply due to a lack of funds.\n  A number of organizations are supportive of this bill, including the \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Disabled Veterans \nNational Foundation, The Retired Enlisted Association, and Military \nExits.\n  I look forward to continued progress in assisting our wounded \nwarriors and ask all of my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8139-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 622--NOTIFYING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE \n                  ELECTION OF A PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

(a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) extreme weather events threaten lives, property, the \n     economy, national security, and sense of place;\n       (2) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the \n     leading international body for the assessment of climate \n     change, concludes that a changing climate leads to changes in \n     the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and \n     timing of extreme weather and climate events;\n       (3) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change further \n     concludes that it is at least 90 percent likely that--\n       (A) the length, frequency, and intensity of warm spells or \n     heat waves will increase over most land areas;\n       (B) mean sea level rise will contribute to upward trends in \n     extreme coastal high water levels; and\n       (C) locations currently experiencing adverse impacts, such \n     as coastal erosion and inundation, will continue to be \n     adversely impacted due to increased sea levels;\n       (4) Congress has been asked to approve an emergency aid \n     package at a cost of $60,400,000,000 to assist recovery \n     efforts from Hurricane Sandy, the second costliest Atlantic \n     hurricane on record;\n       (5) in addition to Federal disaster assistance, private \n     insurance companies are expected to pay billions of dollars \n     in claims related to Hurricane Sandy;\n       (6) global insurance and reinsurance businesses acknowledge \n     that climate change is real;\n       (7) Munich Re, the largest global reinsurer in the world, \n     has reported that ``there is evidence that, as a result of \n     warming, events associated with severe windstorms, such as \n     thunderstorms, hail and cloudbursts, have become more \n     frequent in parts of the USA, southwest Germany, and other \n     regions'';\n       (8) the Munich Re natural catastrophe database shows ``a \n     marked increase in the number of weather-related events'', \n     including, globally, ``a more than threefold increase in \n     loss-related floods since 1980 and more than double the \n     number of windstorm\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\n     natural catastrophes, with particularly heavy losses as a \n     result of Atlantic hurricanes'';\n       (9) Swiss Re, the second largest global reinsurer in the \n     world, has reported ``that climate change will exacerbate the \n     weather impacts we have seen in recent years'';\n       (10) RenaissanceRe, a global provider of insurance \n     coverage, has stated that it has ``taken a proactive course \n     to begin modeling the risk and uncertainty associated with \n     climate change''; and\n       (11) adaptation measures can mitigate future disasters and \n     increase resilience to extreme weather events.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) current trends for air and ocean temperature, sea \n     level, and ocean chemistry are associated with an increasing \n     frequency and severity of extreme weather events and are \n     related to the release of man-made carbon dioxide, affecting \n     the atmosphere and oceans;\n       (2) the response to extreme weather events presents \n     significant costs to the Federal, State, and local \n     governments, businesses, insurers, and individuals; and\n       (3) actions to mitigate the effects of extreme weather \n     events, including actions taken to reduce human contributions \n     to climate change, are economically prudent and in the fiscal \n     best interests of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3350.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Citrus Disease Research \n     and Development Trust Fund Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 1202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) duties collected on imports of citrus and citrus \n     products have ranged from $50,000,000 to $87,000,000 annually \n     since 2004, and are projected to increase, as United States \n     production declines due to the effects of huanglongbing (also \n     known as ``HLB'' or ``citrus greening disease'') and imports \n     increase in response to the shortfall in the United States;\n       (2) in cases involving other similarly situated \n     agricultural commodities, notably wool, the Federal \n     Government has chosen to divert a portion of the tariff \n     revenue collected on imported products to support efforts of \n     the domestic industry to address challenges facing the \n     industry;\n       (3) citrus and citrus products are a highly nutritious and \n     healthy part of a balanced diet;\n       (4) citrus production is an important part of the \n     agricultural economy in Florida, California, Arizona, and \n     Texas;\n       (5) in the most recent years preceding the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, citrus fruits have been produced on \n     900,000 acres, yielding 11,000,000 tons of citrus products \n     with a value at the farm of more than $3,200,000,000;\n       (6) the commercial citrus sector employs approximately \n     110,000 people and contributes approximately $13,500,000,000 \n     to the United States economy;\n       (7) the United States citrus industry has suffered billions \n     of dollars in damage from disease and pests, both domestic \n     and invasive, over the decade preceding the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, particularly from huanglongbing;\n       (8) huanglongbing threatens the entire United States citrus \n     industry because the disease kills citrus trees;\n       (9) as of the date of the enactment of this Act, there are \n     no cost effective or environmentally sound treatments \n     available to suppress or eradicate huanglongbing;\n       (10) United States citrus producers working with Federal \n     and State governments have devoted tens of millions of \n     dollars toward research and efforts to combat huanglongbing \n     and other diseases and pests, but more funding is needed to \n     develop and commercialize disease and pest solutions;\n       (11) although imports constitute an increasing share of the \n     United States market, importers of citrus products into the \n     United States do not directly fund production research in the \n     United States;\n       (12) disease and pest suppression technologies require \n     determinations of safety and solutions must be commercialized \n     before use by citrus producers;\n       (13) the complex processes involved in discovery and \n     commercialization of safe and effective pest and disease \n     suppression technologies are expensive and lengthy and the \n     need for the technologies is urgent; and\n       (14) research to develop solutions to suppress \n     huanglongbing, or other domestic and invasive pests and \n     diseases will benefit all citrus producers and consumers \n     around the world.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to authorize the establishment of a trust funded by \n     certain tariff revenues to support scientific research, \n     technical assistance, and development activities to combat \n     citrus diseases and pests, both domestic and invasive, \n     harming the United States; and\n       (2) to require the President to notify the chairperson and \n     ranking member of the Committee on Finance of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives before entering into any trade agreement that \n     would decrease the amount of duties collected on imports of \n     citrus products to less than the amount necessary to provide \n     the grants authorized by section 1001(d) of the Trade Act of \n     1974, as added by section 1203(a) of this Act.\n       (c) Effect on Other Activities.--Nothing in this title \n     restricts the use of any funds for scientific research and \n     technical activities in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1203.

INOUYE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is only fitting that I be allowed to \nspeak for a few minutes recognizing that on this floor we have just \nadvanced these resolutions in honor of our friend, our colleague, and \ntruly an incredible gentleman and statesman, Senator Daniel K. Inouye.\n  In Alaska, we regarded former Senator Ted Stevens as ``Uncle Ted.'' \nWhat follows, then, is that the people of Alaska would regard his \nbrother, our beloved Daniel Inouye, as our uncle as well.\n  Today, the people of Alaska are mourning the loss of Senator Inouye \nin the same way we would mourn the loss of one of our own; that is, \nbecause Senator Inouye is one of our own. Regardless of whether he \nwanted that burden--I know that perhaps at times he did not want that--\nwe would think of him as Alaska's third Senator. A great many Alaskans \ncame to know, to love, and to rely on Senator Inouye to watch Alaska's \nback, and he never let us down.\n  Senator Inouye delivered a very touching, a very tender eulogy at Ted \nStevens' funeral in August of 2010. In that address, he mentioned that \nmillions and millions of words had been written of Ted's \naccomplishments. Yet as I was thinking about how I might frame my \nremarks about Senator Inouye's life, it dawned on me that millions and \nmillions of words had also been written already about Senator Inouye. \nThat is because I think so many of Ted's accomplishments came with Dan \nInouye at his side and, not coincidentally, many of Dan's \naccomplishments occurred in the presence of Ted. So where do we begin? \nThere is so much that must be said and that should be said.\n  I was present at the Anchorage Baptist Temple when Senator Inouye \ndelivered his eulogy, and I had the opportunity last evening, after we \nlearned word of Senator Inouye's passing, to view that video clip \nagain. As I listened to that eulogy, it came to me that everything \nSenator Inouye said about Ted told us as much about Dan as it did about \nTed. There was so much that these two men shared.\n  Senator Inouye related that he knew from the very beginning of the \nrelationship that the two would have a great deal in common. Both \nrepresented former territories at the very edge of our great Nation--\nterritories that at times were treated as appendages to our Nation. He \ncharacterized Alaska and Hawaii as the forgotten people. In those early \nyears, he reminded us it cost more to make a telephone call from \nHonolulu to here in Washington, DC, than it did Honolulu to Tokyo. It \nwas cheaper to call Beijing from Washington than Anchorage. Dan and Ted \nset out to do something about that, and they did.\n  They traveled to each other's States. They came to understand the \nunique challenges each faced.\n  Senator Inouye related on one trip to an Alaska Native village that \nhe met a nurse. It actually was not a nurse. It was our community \nhealth aide, an individual from the village who had been trained to \nprovide basic medical care. It occurred to both of them at that time \nthat the new technology could enable a doctor at a major hospital, \nhundreds or perhaps even thousands of miles away, to observe and \ndiagnose a patient via a video link.\n  So was born the Alaska telemedicine network, one of the first of its \nkind in the world and truly a remarkable advancement and achievement in \nAlaska. It was born from their very conversations on that CODEL. This \nis just one small example of the many collaborations that improved life \nfor the Native peoples of Alaska and Hawaii. These collaborations \ncreated models by which Senator Inouye improved conditions for the \nNative peoples of the 48 States as well.\n\n  Another thing that Ted and Dan shared in common was, of course, that \nthey were both veterans. One of our colleagues described them as World \nWar II soulmates--men who loved the military, absolutely loved the \nmilitary, with every ounce of their being. They traveled together \nacross the globe to zones of conflict to visit Americans in uniform.\n  The tragedy of Vietnam veterans returning home unappreciated was not \nlost on either of these veterans, and they devoted their lives to \nensuring that our veterans would never again be disrespected.\n  Following Ted's death, Senator Inouye came to this floor, and he said \nthe following of his fallen brother:\n\n       When it came to policy, we disagreed more often than we \n     agreed, but we were never disagreeable with one another. We \n     were always positive and forthright.\n\n  This remark came as perhaps a little bit of a surprise to me because \non the important issues that faced this country, they would most often \narrive at significant agreements that would allow the issues to advance \nin the Senate. Not one of them viewed bipartisanship in a negative \ncontext. It was not a dirty word. Senator Inouye said of Ted: ``We made \nthe word bipartisan become real--real.''\n  It is no coincidence that each would be described in these terms:\n\n       His word is his bond . . . . Good as gold.\n\n  Daniel Inouye brought depth to every debate and dignity to every room \nin which he entered. He was a model Senator and in these times of \nturbulence within the Senate I think a role model for so many of us. \nThere was an elegance in this man that I think we should all strive to \nemulate. I wonder often if those of us who did not come of age in that \n``greatest generation'' are up to this challenge. But we should \ncertainly strive to be.\n  On behalf of the people of Alaska, I express our deepest appreciation \nand condolences to his wife Irene and to Ken for sharing this \nextraordinary statesman with us and with the Nation. For that, we owe \nthem a very sincere and genuine thank you--mahalo. Irene, of course, is \ndoing important work with the United States-Japan Council. I look \nforward to working closely with her in that important role.\n  When a significant figure in Alaska passes, we often say: ``A big \ntree has fallen.'' In the islands, Daniel Inouye was the biggest of the \nbig trees. There is no way to minimize the loss the people of Hawaii \nare feeling. We could see it in the face of Governor Abercrombie \nyesterday. He could barely control his tears as he conducted a lengthy \nnews conference following Senator Inouye's passing. We saw our friend \nand colleague, Senator Akaka, as he delivered very sad remarks as well. \nIn Hawaii, as in Alaska, these things are personal. Losing a longtime \nSenator feels like losing a member of your own family. The Senate ohana \nis less today because Senator Inouye is no longer with us. Let me \nsimply say the people of Alaska and the people of this great Nation \nstand with the people of Hawaii. I offer my personal commitment to the \npeople of Hawaii as the now senior-most Senator representing the \ndecades' old alliance of our former territories: Your needs will not be \nforgotten.\n  With that, I thank you for the few extra minutes this evening to pay \ntribute to a good man, a good friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/18/senate-section/article/S8154-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
