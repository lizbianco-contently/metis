Mr. President, the Economic Development Revitalization Act \nis an important bill. Is it the most important bill we have ever done? \nThe answer is, of course not. But it is an important piece of \nlegislation. It is a very important bill.\n  What are the central points of this legislation? For almost 50 years, \nthe Economic Development Administration has helped create jobs and \ngrowth in economically hard-hit communities across the Nation. \nReauthorization of this important legislation will help ensure that the \nagency is able to help continue creating jobs and investing in \ndistressed communities.\n  Since 2005, EDA has invested about $1.2 billion, and these grants \nhave created more than 300,000 jobs--precisely, 314,000 jobs. For every \ndollar that is invested in EDA, we get $7 worth of private investment. \nThat is why the jobs are created. This legislation makes it better.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. Senators Boxer and Inhofe and their \ncommittee have worked to get this to the Senate floor. It increases \nflexibility for grantees, lowers the threshold requirements for \ngrantees to receive an increased Federal share, and makes more \ninvestments available for planning assistance.\n  We are trying to move through this legislation. Senator Snowe offered \nan amendment. She has not uttered a single word about that amendment, \nwhich was offered yesterday. This is the same piece of legislation that \nheld up our Small Business Innovation Act. We have had other Senators \nwho have come and offered amendments. I don't particularly like the \namendment offered by the junior Senator from South Carolina, but he \ncame and said, ``I want to offer this amendment, and I will agree to a \ntime limit on it.'' Senator Paul, the junior Senator from Kentucky, had \nan amendment he wanted to offer. He said he would agree to a short time \nlimit. I didn't ask for time agreements on this legislation. I should \nnot act as the person who determines what amendments are offered and \naren't offered. But when someone offers an amendment, we should be able \nto work it to a conclusion.\n  This bill, as I have indicated, is an important piece of legislation. \nWe need to move through it. We are going to do that to the best of our \nability. We will have a number of votes today and do our best to move \nthrough this piece of legislation so we can move to other bills. There \nare a lot of things we can do. We can work on bipartisan pieces of \nlegislation. That is my hope today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was discussing with the majority \nleader privately the comments he made publicly about getting votes. I \nhave talked to my Members, and I understand he indicated that most of \nour Members who have amendments are willing to take short time \nagreements. We ought to be able to move forward and have votes, and the \nSenate can function the way it should.\n  Mr. President, with each passing day, the American people grow more \nconcerned about our Nation's future. The Washington Post-ABC news poll \nthis week said that by a ratio of 2 to 1, Americans believe we are on \nthe wrong track, and 9 out of 10 rate the economy negatively. \nYesterday's CNN poll found that many Americans expect another Great \nDepression.\n  It is in this context that President Obama has started talking about \nhow concerned he is about jobs. This week, the President said he wakes \nup every morning and asks himself what he can do to spur job creation. \nEvery morning this week, I have come to the floor with some suggestions \nfor him.\n  The fact is that many Americans have a hard time believing the \nPresident is focused on jobs when so many of his policies seem to be \ndesigned to destroy them. In some key areas, such as trade, energy, and \ndebt, the President himself has acknowledged that a reversal of his \npolicies would create jobs and spur recovery.\n  Let's start with trade. Hoping to sound as though he had a plan for \njob creation, the President used the giant platform provided by his \nannual State of the Union Message in January to declare that he had \nfinalized a trade agreement with South Korea that would support at \nleast 70,000 American jobs. Yet, nearly 5 months later, he sent his \naides out to say that he won't sign them into law unless Congress \napproves billions more in government spending first.\n  On energy, the President has acknowledged the pressure that \nregulations put on job creators. That is why he ordered a review of \nthem in January. Yet, by one estimate, the national energy tax his \nadministration tried to pass through the EPA could cost, by some \nestimates, millions of jobs--millions. While the President has \nacknowledged that in order to sustain economic growth and create jobs, \nas he put it last year, we would need to harness traditional sources of \nenergy, his continued refusal to issue drilling permits in the gulf has \nhad a devastating economic effect.\n  On the debt, the President himself has said, ``If we don't have a \nserious plan to tackle the debt and the deficit, that could actually \nend up being a bigger drag on the economy than anything else.'' Yet, \nunder his leadership, the Nation's national debt has skyrocketed 35 \npercent, from $10.6 trillion to $14.2 trillion, our deficit is three \ntimes bigger than the biggest annual deficit during the Bush \nadministration, and the President refuses to put forward a serious plan \nto do anything to bring the debt or the deficit down.\n  So there is a pattern here. The President likes to say he is \nconcerned about the economy and jobs, but his policies tell an entirely \ndifferent story. He can talk all he wants, but he cannot walk away from \nwhat he has done, and the things he is failing to do right now to \ncreate private sector jobs and to get our economy moving again. Chief \namong them is his refusal to do anything to lower the debt and deficits \nhe has done so much to create.\n  Right now, U.S. businesses are sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash. \nMost of them would love to invest this cash in new products, ventures, \nand employees. Yet they are holding back. Why? It is not just the \nregulations and the mixed signals they are getting about taxes or the \nexpectation that all the spending today will necessarily lead to higher \ntaxes tomorrow; it is also the uncertainty surrounding our future. How \ncan businesses be confident about the future and hire new workers to \nbuild that future if the Democrats who run the White House aren't \nwilling to do anything--anything at all--about our deficits and our \ndebt?\n  Investment follows certainty. That is one thing this White House \nrefuses to provide. This ongoing uncertainty is paralyzing our economic \nrecovery and seriously hindering job creation.\n  One recent study suggests that any nation which carries a public debt \nload at or above 90 percent of its economy loses one point of economic \ngrowth, which the administration's own economists have said is \nequivalent to 1 million jobs. So why won't they propose a serious plan \nto lower it? When will the administration follow through on what it \nknows it has to do to spur job growth? The solutions are right in front \nof us.\n  The administration acknowledges that free trade agreements, expanding \ndomestic energy exploration, cutting regulations, providing tax \ncertainty, and reducing the debt will lead to a dramatic increase in \njobs. So why won't it follow through?\n  Too often, unfortunately, the answer is political. They don't want to \ncross some special interest group--whether it is those who don't like \ntrade agreements or those who don't like the way private companies such \nas Boeing run their businesses or those who don't want to give up a \nsingle solitary penny of Federal spending.\n  But the good of the country is more important than the goals of some \npolitical interest group. We have to rein in our debt, cut spending, \nreduce taxes, reform entitlements, and grow this economy. This \nadministration knows this as well as I do. It is time to act.\n  So, looking ahead, the key to success, in my view--and in the \njudgment of others, including Moody's--is for everyone involved to view \nthe upcoming debt limit vote as an opportunity--an opportunity--to \nreduce Washington spending now and to save the taxpayers trillions of \ndollars over the long term. It is an opportunity to put our fiscal \nhouse in order and to prevent the fiscal crisis we all know is coming. \nWe know what we need to do. The time to do it is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3632-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week I had the opportunity to travel \nmy State of South Dakota, as I think most Senators did who were home \nover the break. During the week, I was able to be part of a couple of \nevents in my State with former Comptroller General David Walker. I \nthink most people here are acquainted with Mr. Walker. He had a 10-year \nrun as the Comptroller General of this country. He has since started an \norganization called the Comeback America Initiative and has been \ntraveling the country trying to explain to the public the issues \nsurrounding our national debt--high Federal spending levels and their \neffect on our Nation's future.\n  I would add he is someone who takes both parties to task. He is an \nequal opportunity critic. He is very bipartisan in his criticism of the \nout-of-control\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\nspending that exists in Washington, DC, but he did point out the \ntremendous growth in government which has occurred in the course of our \nNation's history. In fact, when our country was founded, if we go back \nto the formative years of our country--and he uses the year 1800 as an \nexample--government spending made up just 2 percent of our entire \neconomy. Just 2 percent of our GDP represented government spending. \nToday, it makes up almost 25 percent, and we are on a trend line, a \ntrajectory, where that will rise to 39 percent by the year 2040.\n  So we have seen this upward spike in the spending, the amount of \nFederal spending as a percentage of our entire economic output. The \nreason Mr. Walker gives for the continuing increase in spending is \nprimarily entitlement programs. In other words, we have Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security which now represent about 43 percent in \n2010. Those three programs represented 43 percent of our total Federal \nspending and, again, that number is set to spike as we head into the \nfuture.\n  Mr. Walker pointed out we are set to spend more on mandatory programs \nthan we will take in in revenue in 2011. So this current year we will \nspend more on mandatory programs, which include those I just \nmentioned--Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid--than all the \nrevenue the Federal Government will take in. So that would mean we \ncan't even afford to pay out for the mandatory spending programs we \nhave in our budget, not to mention those discretionary programs which \nare the other part of our Federal budget.\n  If we look at it in terms of how much we spend today and how much we \nborrow, we are borrowing about 42 cents out of every dollar we spend. \nThat is the reality we are faced with. So it is clear we need to make \nsome reforms, Mr. President, particularly in the entitlement programs, \nto put them on a more sustainable footing.\n  Further, Mr. Walker shared the results of his fiscal fitness index, \nwhich puts the United States at 28 out of 34 developed countries--just \nbehind Italy and just two places in front of Ireland. We are No. 28 out \nof 34 developed countries around the world in terms of our fiscal \nfitness.\n  Mr. Walker's message, obviously, is not a fun one. It is not a \nmessage you would expect people to like to hear. It is not a message \nthat promises more spending on people's preferred programs. Yet my \nconstituents were eager to hear this message. Why is that? No. 1, he \nwas honest. He was honest about the size of our problem, about the \nscope of our unfunded liabilities, about the causes of this deficit--\nthat it is primarily a spending-driven crisis, about the effect of the \nhealth care law on health care spending in this country, and about the \nmeasures that are needed to cut spending and to bring the budget back \ninto balance.\n\n  My constituents appreciate that kind of honesty. They appreciate \nsomeone telling them the truth, not simply continuing to make promises \nthat cannot be kept. And, No. 2, they were eager to hear his message \nbecause his message offered hope. He pointed out that if the country \nadopted a fiscal plan that would bring down our deficits on a level \nthat was similar to the plan of the President's fiscal commission, our \nNation's rating on the fiscal fitness index would jump from 28th clear \nup to 8th place. He showed the attendees that there is a series of \nsteps we can take to fix Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--to \npreserve these important programs without bankrupting our country--and \nhe showed us that if we start now we have time to make these changes \nwithout being forced to make Draconian cuts or to hike tax rates.\n  This hope that we can fix these problems is real and it gives the \ngeneral public something they can understand. That was certainly the \ncase with my constituents last week.\n  Unfortunately, there was another event that occurred last week and \nthat was the release of the unemployment numbers. Those numbers did not \nreflect hope but, instead, indicated we have a long way to go toward \nfixing our economy. These numbers showed that unemployment had risen to \n9.1 percent. Further, the long-term unemployed increased to 6.2 million \npeople, as those who are out of work are taking longer to find jobs. \nThis long-term unemployment is particularly important for a number of \nreasons. No. 1, these individuals who suffer from long-term \nunemployment often exhaust government and personal resources that are \navailable to them. As a result, they are at greater risk of falling \ninto poverty. Further, it indicates our economy is not sufficiently \ndynamic. These individuals could have skill mismatches or there may \nsimply not be any jobs in their local economy.\n  Finally, the long-term unemployed may see their skills diminished and \nbecome less and less attached to the workforce. What this all means is \nit becomes harder and harder for these people to find a job as they no \nlonger know the latest technologies or no longer have the skills they \ndeveloped by years of practice. This creates longer term challenges for \nour economy to be able to find these individuals jobs.\n  The question is how do we create an environment where businesses and \nindividuals can be creating jobs. We know we need to cut spending, to \ncut our deficit, and to cut unnecessary and harmful regulations. In a \nrecent presentation to the University of Washington, Nobel laureate \nRobert Lucas pointed out that the possibility of higher taxes, the \nuncertainty of regulations, and the increasing role of the Federal \nGovernment in health care because of the health care law, are all \ncontributors to our slow economic recovery.\n  Likewise, Dr. Lucas speculated that our economy may continue to grow \nat a slower rate because of the increased regulation, taxation, and \nspending that is moving us closer to a European welfare state. In fact, \nDr. Lucas notes that these European economies have incomes that are 20 \nto 30 percent less per capita because of these differences in the size \nof government.\n  It is clear it would even further increase unemployment if we \ncontinued to move along this path. We cannot continue with the status \nquo. We already know the size of our debt is costing us 1 percentage \npoint in growth every year which, according to the White House's own \neconomists, is the equivalent of 1 million jobs. In other words, when \nwe sustain the kind of debt load we have today--our gross debt as a \npercentage of our GDP, our entire economic output, is over 90 percent--\nthat means we are losing economic growth and that means we are shedding \njobs as a consequence of this high level of debt and high level of \nspending.\n  We need to grow the private economy, shrink government spending, and \ncut our debts and deficits. This is the path that will help us on a \nrecovery, help our economy to recover, and create the jobs that are \nnecessary to lower that unemployment rate.\n  We know we can do this. There are a number of reforms and spending \ncuts we are pushing to attach to the deadline that is under discussion \nright now so we can make it easier and cheaper for individuals to \ncreate the jobs that are so necessary to get our economy back on track \nand get people back to work. There are a number of things that can be \ndone and should be done.\n  Obviously, as I noted, as we continue the debate about spending and \ndebt and doing something about this year-over-year $1.4 trillion, $1.5 \ntrillion, now $14.3 trillion debt that is hanging like a cloud over our \neconomy, we have to deal with that. We have an opportunity, as has been \nnoted by the leader earlier this morning, to do that in the context of \nthis debt limit debate we are going to have. We should view this--both \nsides--as an opportunity to do something meaningful about spending and \ndebt and to put our country on a more sustainable fiscal path for our \nfuture.\n  But there are a number of other things that impact the economy today \nthat should be done. One is we have three pending trade agreements that \nwere negotiated 3 to 4 years ago. They have been languishing here \nbecause the White House will not send those trade agreements up here \nfor Congress to act.\n  To give an example of what that means to an agricultural State such \nas South Dakota, Colombia is one of those three trade agreements--\nColombia, Panama, and South Korea, all of which present markets for \nSouth Dakota agricultural markets. But agricultural exports are a big \npart of our trade relationship with Colombia. In 2008 we had an 81-\npercent market share in Colombia. Today that is a 27-percent market\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\nshare. We need those trade agreements approved to create jobs and to \ngrow this economy. I hope the White House will send those, follow \nthrough on their rhetoric and actually send those trade agreements up \nhere so we can act on them.\n  It has been 771 days since we passed a budget in this country. We and \nthe administration talk about doing something about spending and debt, \nand yet here we are having gone 771 days without even having passed a \nbudget, the most fundamental responsibility we have to the taxpayers of \nthis country. If we are serious about spending and debt, we need a \nbudget that sets a blueprint for a more fiscally sustainable future for \nthis country. We need energy policies that allow us to develop American \nenergy to get fuel costs under control, which also impacts in a very \ndirect way our economy and our ability to create jobs.\n  The solutions are out there, they are very straightforward and \nsimple. We need to have the will to move forward and address these \nissues and I hope we will because the American people expect and \ndeserve that we will. As Dr. Walker pointed out last week, in my State \nof South Dakota, if we do not, we are headed for a fiscal train wreck.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Solesbee\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to TSgt \nKristoffer M. Solesbee of Hill Air Force Base's 75th Civil Engineer \nSquadron. Technical Sergeant Solesbee was killed in action near the \ncity of Shorabak, Afghanistan.\n  Technical Sergeant Solesbee was a brave and courageous man. Not only \ndid he volunteer to serve his country, returning to the field of battle \nthree times, twice in Iraq and this final tour in Afghanistan, but he \nvolunteered for one of the most dangerous assignments in the war on \nterrorism; he was an explosive ordnance disposal technician.\n  This is not the first time a member of Hill's EOD flight had been \nkilled while protecting his fellow servicemembers from improvised \nexplosive devices. In early 2007, three other members of the 75th Civil \nEngineering Squadron were also killed. Yet, despite this tragedy, \nTechnical Sergeant Solesbee always returned to duty. I believe one of \nUtah's largest newspapers, The Standard Examiner, paid him the highest \ntribute when it stated ``Kristoffer M. Solesbee died doing what he \nloved: saving lives.'' I cannot think of a better definition of a true \nhero.\n  From those who knew him best, his family, friends and fellow \nservicemembers, described him as smart and highly energetic. Growing up \nhe loved model rockets and radio controlled cars and airplanes. During \nhis 11-year career in the service, his fellow airmen came to rely upon \nhim and his professionalism. Indeed, there is broad consensus among \nHill's EOD technicians that he was the benchmark by which others were \njudged.\n  His distinguished service also did not go unrecognized. Technical \nSergeant Solesbee was the recipient of the Bronze Star Medal with Valor \ndevice and second oak leaf cluster, the Air Force Meritorious Service \nMedal, Purple Heart Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal with one \noak leaf cluster, Air Force Achievement Medal with one oak leaf \ncluster, and the Air Force Combat Action Medal.\n  I know God will be watching over the family of this admirable man. He \ngave his life so that others may live. TSgt Kristoffer M. Solesbee will \nnever be forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

ANSARI\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, once again, I come to the floor to \ncelebrate and recognize the contribution of our Federal employees. I do \nthis on a regular basis because while we debate the issues of the day \nand grapple with issues around the debt and deficit and the \ncircumstances that will require us to cut back on government spending, \nI think it is important to remember the literally millions of Americans \nwho work in one form or another for our Federal Government day-in and \nday-out. From our armed services, to folks who work within this Capitol \nComplex, to folks who work within Health and Human Services, to those \nwho work in research, to those who make enormous contributions to our \nNation, we should not lose sight of them as we grapple with the debt \nand deficit and a host of other issues we deal with in this body.\n  So today I rise to honor another great Federal employee, Rafat \nAnsari. Mr. Ansari is a senior scientist and leading innovator at \nNASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. He has been recognized for \ndeveloping a safe, noninvasive laser device that could drastically \nimprove the early detection of cataracts and improve people's lives in \nthe process.\n  Cataracts are the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in the \nUnited States and in the world. They affect over 22 million Americans \nover the age of 40, and over $6.8 billion is spent annually in the \nUnited States on cataract treatment.\n  Mr. Ansari was motivated to help cataract patients after his father \nwas diagnosed with the disease. He began researching the disease and \nrealized that cataracts are caused by proteins in the lens that cluster \nabnormally, a process similar to what he was studying in his space \nexperiments.\n  Lacking the necessary financial resources, he began conducting \nresearch in his home kitchen using a light-scattering device which was \nable to identify clustered proteins in the eye lens. These kitchen \nexperiments ultimately led to Mr. Ansari's invention of an innovative \neye-scanning device and procedure that is at least two or three times \nstronger than any device on the market.\n  His invention also has the potential to significantly improve the \nability to detect early signs of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, \nand many other diseases. The procedure is currently used by NASA to \nstudy the long-term consequences of space travel on the vision of \nastronauts.\n  Mr. Ansari's personal story is a testament to all that continues to \nmake our Nation great. Born in Pakistan, Mr. Ansari always dreamed of \nworking for NASA. Not only was he able to realize his dream of working \nfor our government, working for NASA, but in the process he has made \ndiscoveries that could have a big impact on the lives of millions of \npeople not only here in the United States but around the world.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Mr. Ansari and those \nother great scientists and engineers at NASA for their excellence and \nservice to our Nation.\n  So, again, I wish to acknowledge not only Mr. Ansari but all of our \nFederal workers. I think it is important. As somebody who has been very \ninvolved--and hopeful to do more--on this issue of debt and deficit, I \nknow we will have to make substantial cutbacks in how government spends \nand operates. But I think we need to remember, as we talk about some of \nthese cuts, that we are affecting the lives of literally millions of \ngood Americans who try to keep the functions of this government working \non an efficient, honest, and ethical basis day-in and day-out.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. REID. OK. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the \ncooperation of Senator Snowe, Senator Coburn, and others. It is \nimportant we move along with this legislation. So for the next 3 hours \nwe will be able to debate the Snowe amendment. The time will be equally \ndivided during that period of time.\n  We have a number of amendments others want to offer. We already have \nfour in addition to hers that have been offered.

I was close.\n  I wish to let Senator Snowe know what my plan is at this time. First, \nI am going to yield some time on another subject--but it will be used \non our time--to Senator Whitehouse, who has something very important \npertaining to his State, and then I am going to come back and take as \nmuch time as I might consume and it will not be that long. I wish to \nlay out where we are in this debate, why this bill is so important, and \nI am going to make some remarks about Senator Snowe's amendment. So I \ndo not know exactly how long it will take, but I will do it as quickly \nas I can and retain the remainder of my time.\n  But at this time, I yield 10 minutes of my time to Senator \nWhitehouse.\n  Senator Whitehouse is coming back into the Chamber with his charts, \nand I reiterate, I will yield the first 10 minutes of my time to \nSenator Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer.\n\n\n                       Commemorating Gaspee Days\n\n  Mr. President, my time in this Chamber often gives me cause to \nreflect on our history and on the brave patriots who went before us, \nmany of whom risked or even gave their lives to create this great \nRepublic. Today, I would like to talk about a group of men who, 239 \nyears ago tonight, engaged in a daring act of defiance against the \nBritish Crown.\n  For many, the Boston Tea Party is one of the first events on the road \nto our revolution. Growing up, we were taught the story of painted-up \nBostonians dumping shipments of tea into Boston Harbor, to defend the \nprinciple: ``no taxation without representation.''\n  Conspicuously missing from history books is the story of the brave \nRhode Islanders who challenged the British Crown far more aggressively \nmore than a year before Bostonians dumped those teabags into Boston \nharbor. Today, on its anniversary, I would like to take us back to an \nearlier milestone in America's fight for independence, to share with \nyou the story of a British vessel, the HMS Gaspee, and to introduce you \nto some little-known heroes now lost in the footnotes of history.\n  In 1772, amidst growing tensions with American colonies, King George \nIII stationed his revenue cutter, the HMS Gaspee, in Rhode Island. The \nGaspee's task was to prevent smuggling and enforce the payment of \ntaxes. But to Rhode Islanders, the vessel was a symbol of oppression.\n  The offensive presence of the Gaspee was matched by the offensive \nmanner of its captain, LT William Dudingston. Lieutenant Dudingston was \nknown for destroying fishing vessels and confiscating their contents, \nand flagging down ships only to harass, humiliate, and interrogate \nsailors. But on June 9, 1772, an audacious Rhode Islander, Captain \nBenjamin Lindsey, took a stand.\n  Aboard his ship, the Hannah, Captain Lindsey set sail from Newport to \nProvidence. On his way, he was hailed by the Gaspee to stop for a \nsearch. The defiant captain ignored the command and continued on his \ncourse. Recently, Dr. Kathy Abbas, director of the Rhode Island Marine \nArchaeology Project, has suggested a motivating factor for Dudingston \nto have sought to seize the Hannah: she may have been carrying 250 \npounds sterling onboard. As Dr. Abbas told the Providence Journal, that \nwas ``an enormous sum'' in those days.\n  In any event, Captain Lindsey and his Hannah sought to evade the \nGaspee. Gunshots were fired, and the Hannah sped north up Narragansett \nBay with the Gaspee chasing behind in pursuit.\n  Outsized and outgunned, Captain Lindsey drew courage and confidence \nfrom his keen familiarity with Rhode Island waters. He led the Gaspee \ninto the shallow waters off Namquid Point, where the smaller Hannah \ncruised over the sand banks. The heavier Gaspee ran aground, and stuck. \nThe Gaspee was stranded in a falling tide, and it would be many hours \nbefore high tide would lift her free.\n  Arriving triumphantly in Providence, Captain Lindsey visited John \nBrown, whose family helped found Brown University. The two men rallied \na group of patriots at Sabin's Tavern, in what is now the East Side of \nProvidence. The Gaspee was despised by Rhode Islanders who had been too \noften bullied in their own waters by this ship, and the stranding of \nthis once-powerful vessel presented an irresistible chance.\n  On that dark night, 60 men in longboats led by Captain Lindsey and \nAbraham Whipple moved quietly down Narragansett Bay. They encircled the \nGaspee, and demanded that Lieutenant Dudingston surrender the ship.\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\nDudingston refused, and instead ordered his men to fire upon anyone who \ntried to board.\n  The determined Rhode Islanders took this as a cue to force their way \nonto the Gaspee, and they boarded her in a raging uproar of shouted \noaths, gunshots, powder smoke, and clashing swords. Amidst this violent \nstruggle Lieutenant Dudingston was shot by a musket ball. Right there \nin the waters of Warwick, RI, the very first blood of what was to \nbecome the American Revolution was drawn. Victory was soon in the hands \nof the Rhode Islanders.\n  Brown and Whipple took the captive Englishmen back to shore. You can \ngo today down behind O'Rourke's Tavern in Pawtuxet Village, down Peck \nLane toward the water, and see the bronze plaque commemorating the spot \nwhere the captured crew was brought ashore.\n  The Rhode Island patriots then returned to set the abandoned ship on \nfire and rid Narragansett Bay of this nuisance once and for all. As the \nGaspee burned, the fire reached her powder magazine and she exploded \nlike fireworks. The boom echoed across the bay, as the remains of the \nship splashed down into the water. The Gaspee was gone: captured, \nburned, and blown to bits. The site of this historic victory is now \nnamed Gaspee Point.\n  The wounding of Lieutenant Dudingston and the capture and destruction \nof the Gaspee occurred 16 months before the so-called Boston Tea Party. \nPerhaps this bold undertaking will one day show up in our history \nbooks, alongside pictures of the blazing Gaspee lighting up \nNarragansett Bay. Perhaps American children will memorize the dates of \nJune 9 and 10, 1772, and the names of Benjamin Lindsey, Abraham \nWhipple, and John Brown.\n  I do know that these events will never be forgotten in my home State. \nOver the years, I have often marched in the annual Gaspee Days Parade \nin Warwick, RI, as every year we recall the courage and zeal of these \nmen who risked it all for the freedoms we enjoy today, and drew the \nfirst blood in what became the revolutionary conflict.\n  I would add, in the context of fires and disasters, we have lost one \nof the signature buildings of Woonsocket, RI, last night. It was called \nthe Woonsocket Rubber Company. The building was known as the Alice \nMills, named after the mother of the president of the company who built \nit, and it existed for--I do not know--100 years or more. It burned in \na fire so great that 12 municipal fire departments had to answer it \nlast night; fire departments all the way from Wrentham, MA, down to \nWarren, RI.\n  I want to express my sympathies of Woonsocket on this loss and my \npride in the firefighters who responded from so far and wide to tend to \nthis fire. Unfortunately, the mill could not be saved. These mills are \nvery hard to prevent fires in once they get burning. We have lost \nsomething very precious in Rhode Island. I just wanted to note that in \naddition to my remarks about the Gaspee.\n  Let me thank very much my chairman on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. I know she has important business on the Senate floor. \nIt was very kind of her to give me those few minutes to talk about this \nhistoric day in Rhode Island and American history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just want to thank my colleague for his \nremarks. I offer my deepest sympathies to these impacted by that \nterrible fire. Unfortunately, in this country we are witnessing so many \ndisasters. It is so difficult for the people to deal with this, but we \nhave to always respond. I am glad he paid tribute to the firefighters, \nthe first responders, because they are the ones who put everything on \nthe line to help us.\n  We have before us a bill called the Economic Development \nRevitalization Act of 2011. It is S. 782. It is a good bill. It is a \nbill that is needed for our economy because it is a bill that is \nfocused on one thing, jobs. When people are asked what our focus should \nbe--and we all know we need to reduce the deficit and the debt--they \nall say No. 1 is jobs because without jobs, deficits only get worse, \ndebts only get worse, as people have to turn to the safety net that is \nprovided in this great Nation for their very survival. So when we have \nan opportunity to come together across party lines with a jobs bill, \none would think we would be delighted to do it.\n  This EDA, the Economic Development Administration, was reauthorized \nback in 2004 when George W. Bush was President. Let me tell a story \nbecause everybody came together, and that EDA reauthorization passed by \nvoice vote and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. So it \nis a bit perplexing for me to note that we have dozens and dozens of \namendments that are absolutely nongermane to this reauthorization. We \nhave one amendment that is pending that my colleague, Senator Snowe, is \noffering, which has never had a hearing. It has never had a markup, and \nit is absolutely going to change the way we can protect our people from \npollution, from danger.\n  I think it is unfortunate that rather than work on this together, we \nare seeing this offered as an amendment. It is Senator Snowe's complete \nright to do this. I respect it. I honor it. I understand how strongly \nshe feels. But I feel just as strongly that something that would ignore \npublic health and safety and not even put that in the benefits column \nis something that is a danger to the people we serve.\n  So we are going to have a debate about it, and the votes will come at \n2:15. I am pleased we will get to vote. I do hope at some point we will \nbe able to look at regulatory flexibility, we will be able to work to \nmake sure that as we assist our businesses--and we all want to do that. \nThat is what this bill, the EDA bill, does. It is assisting businesses. \nIt is jump-starting business development. We have example after example \nof that--we also can work to ease their burden a bit while not \nendangering the life and the health of the people. That is pretty \nstraightforward, and I would be very happy to work with my colleague. \nBut this bill has never even had a hearing. This bill she is offering \nhas never been marked up. I have had no opportunity, other than this \none, to basically say how I feel.\n  I know it is in contrast to the way Senator Snowe feels, and Senator \nCoburn. I have lots of respect for them. I hope they have respect for \nme as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee because my \nview is, my obligation is, to protect the health and the safety of our \nkids.\n  How many kids have asthma? If I asked a group here, I bet one-third \nof the hands would go up. If I asked how many people know someone with \nasthma, I bet more than half would raise their hands. So I think we \ncannot willy-nilly just support an approach that would take away the \nability to put the benefits of protecting health into any formulas \nbefore we say regulation should be thrown overboard. I think there are \nways to definitely work together. Unfortunately, today we are going to \nhave an up-or-down vote on the Snowe amendment without that \nopportunity.\n  I want to go through the fact that the bill that is before us, the \nunderlying bill, S. 782, has strong bipartisan support. It was reported \nout of our EPW Committee by voice vote, only one objection, and that is \nbecause this EDA has operated for 50 years. It has a very good \ntradition of creating jobs and spurring growth in economically hard-hit \ncommunities nationwide.\n  This bill is going to ensure that EDA can continue to create jobs, \nthousands of jobs, protect existing jobs, and drive local economic \ngrowth. It is distressing to me to see, for example, an amendment by \nSenator DeMint. He is very proud of his amendment. What would it do? It \nwould do away with the EDA. So on a bill to reauthorize the EDA, he has \nan amendment to eliminate the Economic Development Administration.\n  Now, again, I respect his view, but I do not understand it. Why do I \nnot understand it? Because in 2005, Senator DeMint sent out a press \nrelease congratulating local leaders for securing an EDA grant for the \nCity of Dillon, SC. So we have Senator DeMint proposing to eliminate an \nagency which he lauded not once but more than once.\n  Senator DeMint was quoted in the press release as saying:\n\n       This investment in Dillon County will save and create \n     hundreds of South Carolina jobs. And I am pleased that the \n     EDA has awarded these funds.\n\n  So what planet are we on? We have a Senator who sends out a press \nrelease lauding an agency he now wants to\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\neliminate. So you would say, well, maybe that was 2005 and he has \nsuddenly changed his mind. No. One year ago, Senator DeMint's staff \nheld a workshop in Myrtle Beach to highlight competitive funding \nopportunities available to local communities and businesses through EDA \nand other Federal agencies.\n  June 16, 2010. Here it is:\n\n       Workshop to Highlight Competitive Funding Opportunities.\n       The office of U.S. Senator Jim DeMint and the Myrtle Beach \n     Chamber of Commerce will provide a workshop--\n\n  It goes on to say that the staff of Senator DeMint will be there.\n  I don't get what is going on. How do you send out a press release \nlauding an agency and then say: Let's do away with it. I don't get it. \nIf jobs are our No. 1 priority--and I certainly know the occupant of \nthe chair is fighting 24/7 for jobs, for outsourcing jobs, and for job \ncreation.\n  For every dollar spent in EDA, $7 of private investment is attracted. \nHistorically, $1 of EDA investment attracts nearly $7 in private sector \ninvestment. Now, you say: Well, for our investment with Federal \ndollars, how much does it cost for us to create one good job? The \nanswer comes back: EDA creates one job for every $2,000 to $4,600 \ninvested. That is a good investment. EDA is a job creator. That is why \nit is perplexing to me to have a host of amendments that are \ndistracting us from jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  Between 2005 and 2010, with an investment of $2.4 billion, total jobs \ngenerated were 450,000 and total jobs saved were 85,000. At the $500 \nmillion funding level authorized, if that was spent, EDA would create \n87,000 to 200,000 jobs every year and 400,000 to 1 million jobs over \nthe life of the bill. We don't know that that $500 million will stay, \nbut historically that is what we have authorized through EDA.\n  Here are the people who are supporting an authorization of the EDA: \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, American Public Works Association, National \nAssociation of Counties, AFL-CIO, American Planning Association, \nAssociation of University Research Parks, Educational Association of \nUniversity Centers, International Economic Development Council, \nAssociation of Development Organizations, National Business Incubation \nAssociation, State Science and Technology Institute, University \nEconomic Development Association, and National Association of Regional \nCouncils.\n  We have a letter from an arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce lauding \nthis program, citing how well they work with the EDA. They say:\n\n       We are the citizenship arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \n     and in this capacity we work with thousands of businesses and \n     local chambers of commerce on community development and \n     disaster recovery. These local chambers and businesses are \n     constantly looking for national best practices, lessons \n     learned, technical assistance, strategy support, and other \n     insights and tools and techniques to make communities as \n     competitive as possible.\n\n  This is the chamber of commerce arm:\n\n       As you consider EDA's future roles and responsibilities, we \n     would be happy to share with you our experiences and lessons \n     learned in working with the agency and provide you with \n     additional information.\n\n  They talk about the unique capability the EDA can and does support. \nThey say EDA staff members displayed a high degree of professionalism \nand technical expertise. They say they have engaged with them on \nmultiple levels, from consultation to sharing valuable field experience \nat the State and local level.\n  We have tremendous support. The AFL-CIO, dealing with the loss of \nconstruction jobs, says:\n\n       EDA has established an admirable track record in assisting \n     economically troubled low-income communities with limited job \n     opportunities by putting their investments to good use in \n     promoting needed job creation and industrial and commercial \n     development.\n\n  The last chart is the American Public Works Association, which builds \npublic works and the water and sewer systems we need. This is from \nPeter King, executive director of American Public Works Association, \ndated this month:\n\n       I write on behalf of the 29,000 members of APWA in support \n     of the Economic Development Revitalization Act, S. 782. We \n     urge the Senate to pass this legislation, which will create \n     jobs, stimulate economic growth in distressed areas, and \n     improve the economic growth of local communities.\n\n  After Senator Snowe speaks and others speak, I will reserve my time \nto go into specifically what programs we have seen flourish because of \nthat little spark that gets lit when EDA gets in there. The private \nsector loves this program, and local governments and State governments \nlove it. It has worked since 1965.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you have amendments, let's get time \nagreements and dispose of those amendments. Let's get to a final vote \non this very important program, which has flourished under Democratic \nPresidents, Republican Presidents, Democratic Congresses, and \nRepublican Congresses. For goodness' sakes, does everything have to be \na battle royale around here? We ought to be able to reach across the \naisle when there is a bill brought up that deals with jobs. If we don't \ndo that, we honestly fail the people.\n  My very last point is that Senator Inhofe has worked very hard on \nthis bill. Republicans have added a lot of reforms to the EDA. I think \nthose reforms are important. One would eliminate a duplication of \neffort, and others would give the private sector the ability to buy out \nthe EDA interests. So I think, clearly, at this time, we should get \nthese amendments done.\n  I am pleased Senator Snowe is here, and she is anxious to speak. I \nwill conclude at this time and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 76 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, before I begin to address the pending \namendment I have offered along with a number of Senators in response to \nregulatory reform, I am going to yield to the Senator from North \nDakota, who is a cosponsor of this legislation. I am delighted that he \nis a cosponsor, and that he recognizes and acknowledges the importance \nof changing the regulatory environment in America if we are going to \nhave job creation and economic growth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here with Senator Snowe \nand to rise in support of her legislation, the Freedom Act of 2011. I \nwill be brief in my comments. I know she has comments to make. I also \nappreciate Senator Boxer's comments in regard to Republican and \nDemocrats coming together on this legislation. I think that is exactly \nwhat needs to happen with the Snowe-Coburn amendment, the Freedom Act \nof 2011.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I draw on 10 \nyears of experience as a Governor in our State in expressing how very \nimportant it is that we create the kind of legal tax and regulatory \nstructure at the Federal level that will help us to stimulate private \ninvestment and get this economy going and growing and get people back \nto work. I know that is exactly what Senator Snowe hopes to achieve \nwith this amendment, and will. That is why we need to pass it.\n  Just this morning, jobless claims came out. New jobless claims were \nhigher than anticipated, at 427,000. Last week, we got the employment \nnumbers, and we gained only 54,000 jobs. Unemployment is 9.1 percent. \nAt the same time, we face a more than $14 trillion debt, and our \ndeficit is more than $1.5 trillion. We are spending $3.7 trillion a \nyear and only taking in $2.2 trillion in revenue. Clearly we need to \nget a grip on spending, but to get out of this deficit and debt and to \nget people back to work, we need to get this economy growing. That \ndoesn't mean the Federal Government spending more; it means the Federal \nGovernment spending less and creating the kind of progrowth, jobs-\noriented economy and legal tax and regulatory structure that will help \nus grow.\n  If you look back at the 1990s, when we had a deficit, and even \nbefore, when we had stagflation, it was a combination of a growing \neconomy and better fiscal management that got people back to work and \ngot us out of the deficit and to a surplus. We need to do that again. \nWe need this kind of legislation that will help us create a regulatory \nenvironment that stimulates business investment, creates jobs, gets\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\npeople back to work, and gets the economy growing, and then, with good \nfiscal restraint, will help us get on top of this huge deficit and our \ndebt. It is vitally important for us now, and it is vitally important \nfor future generations.\n  This is an important step in the right direction. I am pleased to \ncosponsor this legislation with the Senator from Maine. I look forward \nto hearing her remarks.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nHoeven, for his excellent remarks. As a former Governor for 10 years, \nhe knows the impact of regulations on small businesses and how \ndetrimental they can be to job creation, particularly at this time \nwhere we have a very difficult economy. We have persistent high \nunemployment and subpar economic growth. We are at a consequential \nmoment in our economic history, frankly, that deserves the attention of \nthe Senate. So, again, I thank the Senator for his comments in \nrecognizing the effect regulatory reform will have on the performance \nof small business and, ultimately, job creation in this economy.\n  I am very pleased to have many colleagues cosponsoring this \namendment. I am pleased to have worked with Senator Coburn from \nOklahoma, and this amendment is also cosponsored by Senators McConnell, \nAyotte, Barrasso, Brown of Massachusetts, Coats, Enzi, Isakson, Kirk, \nHoeven, Johnson, Moran, Thune, and Vitter. It is clear to me that many \nof the Senators understand the value and imperative of reforming our \nregulatory system. It is absolutely vital that the Federal Government \nconsider the small business economic impact of the rules and \nregulations that agencies promulgate.\n  The question might be asked, Why do we need regulatory reform? We had \na bill on the floor last month, in early May, wherein I was denied a \nvote, which was regrettable because it is clear that many people don't \nunderstand how important this is and how central it is to small \nbusiness job creation, how vital it is to the survival of small \nbusinesses and the cost of doing business across America. But I keep \nhearing from certain colleagues, ``Yes, we understand it is important; \nhowever'' or ``but'' or ``at some point.'' Let's define ``at some \npoint.'' When?\n  When I was denied a vote on regulatory reform, on May 4 in the \nSenate, I heard that we are going to have hearings on the issue. Well, \nthat obviously has not occurred. So it becomes the politics of \nobfuscation, not the reality. As I heard from a small business owner \nyesterday, ``When I come into Washington, it is a walled city--walled \noff from reality, detached from the real world on Main Street.''\n  I have been told that a concern with this amendment is that we have \nnot had hearings. We had a hearing in the Small Business Committee on \nregulatory reform, but that is not enough for the Senator from \nCalifornia, who is saying we have not had hearings. She has offered \nplenty of amendments that haven't had hearings in the Senate. We had a \nmajor issue yesterday that was very important to small business--the \ninterchange fee--which didn't have hearings. It didn't have hearings \nthe first time it was offered to the Dodd-Frank legislation last year, \nand yesterday's amendment didn't have a hearing. So is there a new \nstandard, in the Senate, when it comes to regulatory reform? Do you \nthink there have been any overtures by anybody who opposes my \nlegislation to work with us on this right away?\n\n  What is happening on Main Street America is that we are not creating \njobs. Why? Because of what is failing to happen in Washington, DC, in \nthe Senate. There is a clear detachment from the real world. Small \nbusinesses keep asking me what is going on. I say I can't explain it, \nother than it is clear that people don't understand what is going on \nbecause if they did, we would be working on it.\n  I heard the Senator from California say, ``at some point.'' But tell \nthat to the person who is running a small business and trying to keep \ntheir neck above water and keep their business afloat during these very \ndifficult times. What do these small business owners talk about? They \ntalk about the regulations that are suffocating their ability to \nsurvive in a very tough economic climate.\n  We are dithering. That is what this is all about. It is all a \nmasquerade, a facade, just bringing up bogus arguments. I have been in \nthe legislative process for the better part of four decades, and I know \nwhen there is a serious purpose about working together and solving a \nproblem. It appears to me that there is no interest in solving this \nproblem here in Washington. Everybody has their own agenda, but people \nare wondering why there is this unemployment rate of 9.1 percent.\n  When I raised these concerns to the Secretary of the Treasury back in \nearly February in the Finance Committee, when he was testifying--I \ndescribed the concerns about what was happening on Main Street because \nI take Main Street tours, and I invite people to do that and to \nactually listen to what people are saying--he said: ``I think your view \nof the economy is dark and pessimistic.''\n  I said: Well, maybe I wasn't hearing it right. Maybe I wasn't hearing \nit right on Main Street. So when I meet with small business owners, I \nmention the Secretary's comments to them, and they cannot believe it. \nThey cannot comprehend that the Secretary of the Treasury doesn't \nunderstand what is going on on Main Street; that the administration \ndoesn't, the Senate doesn't, and the Congress doesn't. If they did, we \nwould be working here day and night.\n  I was told I had to have a vote on this amendment right now. Why? \nBecause it is Thursday, and certain members of this body are smelling \nthe jet fumes while people are suffering on Main Street. Our fellow \nAmericans are losing their jobs. Have my colleagues heard the stories \nabout what people are facing? Time and time again I hear the same old \nrefrains: ``We don't have time. We have to rush it. It hasn't had \nhearings. We will do it sometime.'' Well, tell that to the average \nAmerican who is struggling to keep a job, to find a job or to keep the \ndoors open to their business. That is what this amendment is all about. \nThat is the reality.\n  We can pretend it is something else, but the macroeconomic numbers \nare demonstrating time and again there is a desperation out there. Yet, \nwe take 2-week recesses, then we come back and have morning business \nand chat along, but it does nothing to resolve the consequential issues \nfacing this Nation. There was a time when the Senate used to work, \nwhere we could sit down and solve a problem. Now it is all a facade, a \nfew talking points and we move on. In the meantime, people are \nsuffering and they are handicapped by our inability to work together. \nRegulatory reform is central to that agenda, make no mistake about it.\n  Let's look at what we are talking about and why we need regulatory \nreform. The analysts have lowered their forecast for the second quarter \ngrowth this year. The first quarter growth was already abysmal at 1.8 \npercent of GDP. Manufacturing recovery has slowed. Housing remains in \nshambles. New claims for jobless benefits, as the Senator from North \nDakota indicated, exceeds 400,000--again. Growth of consumer spending \nis sluggish.\n  The President talks about job creation and stimulating the economy, \nbut the results speak louder than words. Since the President took \noffice, unemployment has dipped below 9 percent for only 5 months. Even \nthat data is skewed because it doesn't account for the millions of \nworkers who have exited the workforce altogether. Just last week, the \nunemployment rate for May increased to 9.1 percent. We are experiencing \nthe longest unemployment period in American history since data \ncollection started in 1948, surpassing even the 1982 double-dip \nrecession for the length of unemployment.\n  Despite the President's promise, and an $800 billion stimulus \npackage, a $700 billion TARP program, up to $600 billion in \nquantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, and over $2 trillion in \noverall government spending, we are years away from where we need to be \nin terms of job or economic growth. Mr. President, 40 months after the \nstart of the four deepest postwar recessions our economic output \naveraged 7.6 percent higher than pre-recession levels. Yet since \nDecember 2007, when the most recent recession commenced, our GDP has \nonly increased 0.1 percent. That is why we need regulatory reform. We \nneed to bolster job creation, and the only place we can do that is \nthrough small businesses.\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\n  The Senator from California says we need hearings on this amendment. \nThen we should change the rules of the Senate and require that every \namendment offered on this floor has a hearing, and every bill. That \nmust be a new standard, Mr. President. We have had hearings on this \nquestion in the Small Business Committee, and the focus is that we \ndesperately need reform.\n  In a small business regulatory reform hearing in November 2010 we \nheard a witness note if there was a 30 percent cut in regulatory costs, \nan average 10-person firm would save nearly $32,000--enough to hire one \nadditional person.\n  When President Reagan entered office in 1981, he faced actually much \nworse economic problems than President Obama faced in 2009. I know \nbecause I served in the House of Representatives at that moment in \ntime. With unemployment soaring into double digits, at a peak of 10.8 \npercent, huge chunks of industrial America shut down in the recession \nof 1981-1982 and never reopened. Yet once the recovery began in earnest \nin the first quarter of 1983, the economy boomed. It exceeded 7.1 \npercent for five consecutive quarters and kept growing at a 4-percent \npace for another 2 years.\n  The contrast in results between the current recovery and the Reagan \nyears is instructive because the government's response was so \ndifferent. As a recent Wall Street Journal article reiterated, in the \n1980s the policy goals were to cut tax rates, reduce regulatory costs \nand uncertainty--which is what these regulations are producing day in \nand day out--let the private economy allocate capital free of political \ndirection, and focus monetary policy on price stability rather than on \nreducing unemployment. That is the type of policy mix we need to \nrediscover if we are going to climb out of this economic downturn.\n  Let's look at the first chart--small business job creators in my \nState and across America because they are the ones that create 70 \npercent of all the net new jobs in America. That is why regulation \nreform becomes so essential and imperative. The total cost of \nregulation is at $1.7 trillion--that is with a ``t''--and small firms \nwith fewer than 20 employees bear a disproportionate burden in terms of \nthose costs. It is $10,585 per employee, which is 36 percent higher \nthan the regulatory costs confronting larger firms.\n  I know some people like to dispute numbers and say: Oh, no, that is \nnot really a true number. Oh, really? Just add them up. There was a \nstudy that was done by Crain and Crain. They added the estimated cost \nof four categories or types of regulations--economic regulations at \n$1.2 trillion; environmental regulations at $281 billion; task \ncompliance, $160 billion; and regulations involving occupational \nsafety, health, and homeland security, $75 billion.\n  Some studies omit independent agencies. Some even omit the Internal \nRevenue Service from the calculation cost of regulations. Well, ask a \nsmall business or any business in America about whether IRS regulations \nhave a cost for them. Of course they do. We have to include all \nagencies of government that have an impact directly on small business \nor any business in America.\n  Even a separate White House finding acknowledges that the estimated \nannual cost of major Federal regulations reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget this past decade cost between $44 billion and $62 \nbillion.\n  The point is, the principal impediment to job creation in this \ncountry is a broken regulatory system. We have repeatedly talked about \nit. It is a top priority for the small business community across \nAmerica. Every major organization that is a key voice for small \nbusiness echoes this repeatedly: Federal regulations have placed a \ntremendous burden on them.\n  I know many of my colleagues and I understand the critical nature of \nall of this. We have heard the message loud and clearly. Even the \nPresident, interestingly enough, issued an Executive order in January \nto begin the process of reviewing Federal regulations, citing the need \nfor ``absurd and unnecessary paperwork requirements that waste time and \nmoney.'' So in 4 months the administration's preliminarily findings \nuncovered over $1 billion in savings in 30 agencies. They ran the \ngamut. They included even environmental regulations.\n  So, obviously, there is some recognition and acknowledgment that \nregulations are a barrier and an impediment. The President is making \neliminations at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. And yet, I don't think anybody \nwould suggest he is trying to eradicate all environmental protections \nin America by identifying some that just aren't worthy of support \nbecause they are onerous. He would eliminate the requirement that \nStates install a system to protect against fuel polluting the air at \ngas stations since modern vehicles already have these systems. That \nwould save up to $67 million a year. But no one in this Chamber is \ngoing to accuse the President of saying, well, we are undermining all \nenvironmental regulations in the country.\n  It is as if we can't be discerning and discriminating in evaluating \nwhat is worthy and what isn't, what is too costly and complex and what \nisn't, what makes sense and what doesn't in this current context of \nthis economic environment. Can we spend time doing that, since I was \ndenied the time on May 4 and an ability to vote on this amendment? \nCould we have worked that out? Absolutely not. So why can't we become \ninvolved in this effort?\n  It seems we are turning a blind eye to it. There is no recognition \nbecause I don't think there is a full understanding or an appreciation \nof what is going awry in the economic landscape in every community \nacross this country and why there is that despair, that anxiety.\n  By the way, about 80 percent of the American people believe we are \nmoving in the wrong direction when it comes to our economy. That should \nbe a Paul Revere wake-up call. It should be a message on which we might \nwant to realign our focus in the Senate.\n  Maybe we should spend some time in the Senate working out the issues \nto solve the problems so we can create jobs for Americans who are \nunemployed, because we know that 9.1 percent doesn't capture all \nunemployed Americans. There are many who have dropped out of the \nworkforce entirely. You could have, underemployed or unemployed, as \nmany as up to 25 million Americans. That is staggering. That is \nbreathtaking.\n\n  Since the time I was denied a vote, we could have been moving ahead \non this legislation, or in the interim from when I was denied that vote \non May 4, working out a solution, working through these issues. And \nduring that time, the chairman of President Obama's own Council on Jobs \nand Competitiveness, General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, announced the \ntop four priorities. This just happened on May 10. Understand, on May 4 \nI was prevented from having a vote on regulatory reform. That is \npreposterous. We have not had hearings. Hearings sometimes are a path \nto nowhere; leading to nothing. But since then, have there been \nhearings called for? No, of course not.\n  But 6 days later, who is speaking on regulatory reform? The \nPresident's own Council on Jobs and Competitiveness chairman, that is \nwho, and he is noting a number of priorities. Guess what. One of them \nhappens to be regulations to support a pro-growth environment and \nstrengthen U.S. competitiveness. He listed improving and innovating \neducation and bolstering exports to the world's fastest growing markets \nas three of those priorities. Then he called for ``collaboration \nbetween government and business with regard to regulation'' as a top \npriority, noting that ``Decades of overlapping, uncoordinated \nregulations create unnecessary hurdles and increased burdens for \nentrepreneurs and businesses, large and small, across the country.''\n  Let me repeat, this is from the President's hand-selected chairman of \na council dedicated to create American jobs and boosting our \ncompetitiveness. He made this pronouncement less than a week after the \nSenate failed to consider my regulatory reform amendment to the SBIR \nReauthorization legislation that we were considering for nearly two \nmonths, with a mere three days of votes over that time.\n  You might think that if there were some reasonable concerns about my \namendment, the other side would try to work with me since then. \nNothing. Nothing. We might have had a recess or two. We had days \nwithout votes, days without debating key issues--actually not just \ndays, weeks. Nothing. Nothing is connecting.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n  What is connecting, though, unfortunately for small businesses and \npeople who depend on them for jobs, is that there is a cause and effect \nand that is why you are seeing the deleterious effects of our inability \nto work on the issues that matter, that we have basically relegated all \nof this to the backseat, we have substituted other things without \npurpose. It is truly regrettable because of what it is doing to the \naverage American and for those who are struggling. People, rightfully, \nknow it. The American people understand what is happening here--or what \nis not happening here, I should say.\n  The breadth of regulations is truly punitive on businesses in \nAmerica. The Heritage Foundation reported last year that ``[t]he burden \nof regulation on Americans increased at an alarming rate in fiscal year \n2010,'' with a record 43 major new regulations costing $26.5 billion \nalone, ``far more than any other year for which records are \navailable.''\n  That is just in 1 year, $26.5 billion. That is on top of the $1.75 \ntrillion in already existing total regulatory costs. That is just 1 \nyear, $26.5 billion.\n  It is clear the administration and the agencies have gone on a \nregulatory rampage. Again, it is that detachment from the real world. \nWhat does this mean? What are the real, practical implications for the \nperson running a small business and trying to calculate the costs or \nanticipate future costs? Why are they going to hire a new employee and \ntake on new costs? Why should they make investments? They don't dare. \nThey can't take the risk. They say: We don't know.\n  I meet with small businesses regularly and talk to them and they say \nit is the uncertainty with regulations that continues to limit their \ndecisions. This demonstrates it.\n  The Heritage Foundation reports that ``[r]egulatory costs will rise \nuntil policymakers appreciate the burdens that regulations are imposing \non Americans and the economy, and exercise the political will necessary \nto limit--and reduce--those burdens.''\n  That is exactly what our amendment will do. This is a clarion call \nfor regulatory reform. There should be no political or philosophical \nboundaries. There should not be philosophical differences. You might \nhave some arguments about what approach you take, but those things \ncould be worked out. In fact, that is exactly what I did with the \namendment I offered on which I was denied a vote back on May 4.\n  From the other side there were some issues. We made five major \nmodifications to my proposal because it is important to build \nbipartisan support. I have certainly reached across the aisle on so \nmany occasions. I would have thought we could have had a corresponding \nresponse to work out these issues. That is what I do not understand. I \ncannot understand. There should not be any debate. If they talk to \ntheir small business community, they will get the same response.\n  What can we do to make it better? That is the key. The key is making \nsome changes. One, I called for a small business review panel to be \nrequired for every agency so they can review the regulations before \nthey are promulgated, before they are implemented, so we find out \nbeforehand what might be of concern to small business, what might have \npotential costs or risks, or will not work out, and know it beforehand. \nI hear from some: Oh, no, we will work it out later, afterward. You ask \nthe small business person how you are going to work it out afterward, \nafter they paid astronomical costs to comply with that regulation.\n  Let's set up the small business review panels. This is not a new \nmodel. There are such panels for OSHA and EPA. And due to an amendment \nthat I offered to the financial regulatory reform bill, one also now \nexists at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it is part of \nthat mechanism now. There was a model that we adopted from OSHA and \nEPA, from 1996, when we had a Democratic administration, and it worked \nexceptionally well. So I thought, Why not apply it to every agency?\n  But we heard, absolutely not.\n  So I said OK, what can we do to work it out? I talked to those on the \nother side of the aisle and we changed it and said for the 3 years that \nthis bill will be authorized we will do it for nine agencies, three a \nyear, to see how it works for the nine agencies who's rules have the \nmost effect on small businesses. I did that. I made that change to \naddress the concerns that were expressed on the other side of the \naisle.\n  Then we said we should start requiring the agencies to do what they \nare supposed to do by law. You think it is a little redundant to ask \nthem to do what they are required to do already, which is to review the \nrules? They are supposed to review the rules every 10 years but, guess \nwhat, they do not. So I said: If they are not reviewing a rule every 10 \nyears, then that rule cannot be that important. So let's take it off \nthe books. That is what I proposed. If an agency cannot be bothered to \nreview the regulations as they are required to do under the law every \n10 years, if they are not doing it, then it must not be that important \nso let's take them off.\n  There was some resistance on the other side so I made the change in \nresponse to the concerns. What I incorporated is that they would lose 1 \npercent of their operating budget. That is fair. We have to give them \nincentives to do what they should be doing by law but we will now give \nthem some greater impetus to comply with the law. It is amazing that we \nare in that position, but that is where it stands. So I made that \nchange because I thought it was important.\n  We have tasked inspector generals with assuring that these reviews \nare taking place and they can do so in consultation with the chief \nadvocacy counsel at the Small Business Administration. It is not \nunusual for an IG to determine that the agency they are overseeing \ncomplies with existing laws. After all, isn't that what they precisely \ndo? Would anybody argue that outdated and ineffective regulations hurt \nthe environment or harm small businesses? The administration's own \npreliminary review of regulations at 30 agencies in 4 months identified \n$1 billion worth of savings. Why would we not want to start having \nthose reviews become the norm rather than the exception? I do not \nunderstand it. Are we that busy here that we cannot do it? Maybe we \ncould forfeit a few recesses and do some work for America to connect \nwhat is going on in Main Street--getting back to Main Street because \nthat is where the jobs are created.\n  Maybe we could spend more time here doing that instead of deferring \nto sometime down the road.\n  I made some other key changes in hopes that we could build that \nbridge in response to the concerns that were given by the other side. I \nmade five major modifications because I thought it is important to \nbuild bipartisan support. Again I was denied that opportunity.\n  Now we are being told that the main concern is that it has not had a \nhearing. Does that mean that we ought to change the rules of the \nSenate, as I said earlier, to require a hearing for every amendment? \nPerhaps that would slow the train down even more here. Maybe we could \nget back to achieving some results.\n  Another provision I have in my Regulatory Reform Act that I have \nintroduced with Senator Coburn and so many others here, is a basic \ncommonsense approach: incorporating the indirect economic effects of \nregulations on small businesses so we make sure they anticipate the \nforeseeable indirect economic effects in addition to the direct \neffects, because we know there are a multiplicity of effects that \nresonate and reverberate with other industries. That needs to be \ncalculated and incorporated and factored into the equation in terms of \ncost. And let's be clear. This is not a radical or partisan \nproposition. In fact, the language was taken directly, word for word, \nfrom the President's Chief small business regulatory watchdog, the head \nof the SBA Office of Advocacy.\n  I also recommend that we expand the judicial review requirement so we \nmake sure that when an agency proposes a rule, it has complied with its \nexisting legal requirements to consider the economic impact of the rule \non small businesses, that it has contemplated less costly alternative \nways to make the rule less burdensome.\n  That is important because they ought to listen to diverse options, in \nterms of the rule they are proposing, to make sure that they have \nincorporated the views of small businesses in understanding the \nimplications, being more exact and precise in the process--not waiting \nuntil months and years down\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\nthe road, after you go through a very extensive, complicated rulemaking \nprocess, to try to make your case. Small businesses do not have the \nresources to do that to begin with, let alone the time or employees to \ndo it. That is not a good use of their capital, by the way, to be \nspending their time arguing with a government agency time and again.\n  For 30 years, small businesses have had the ability to seek judicial \nreview of an agency's small business impact statement after the rule \nhas been made. In this entire time period, for over 30 years, even with \nthe ability to obtain judicial review, we know of only two rules that \nwere remanded by the courts. One was a mining regulation that did not \naccount for the number of small businesses that had gone bankrupt under \nbonding requirements. The other was fishing restrictions issued without \nrealizing the impact on fishermen. This means that waiting until the \nrule is final is simply too late; the damage is done.\n\n  To correct this injustice, our amendment would provide small \nbusinesses the ability to bring legal action earlier in the process so \nwe can avert mistakes at the outset so we do not force small businesses \nto go through this onerous, complicated, costly process, and then find \nout we made a mistake, the agencies made a mistake, and they say: You \nknow what. You are going to have to fight it and go through another \nrulemaking process which takes months if not years. It is not going to \nhappen. That is why we are not stimulating economic growth; we have \nthousands of regulations.\n  As a result, we have provided small businesses the ability to bring \nlegal action, to seek judicial review prior to the rule becoming \nfinalized, whether an agency failed to comply with its existing small \nbusiness review requirement. This is a commonsense approach, to ensure \nagencies abide by the law prior to a rule being made final. It is not a \npartisan measure. It is just practical sense. If somebody has not run a \nsmall business, they probably do not understand it, do not appreciate \nwhat it takes to start or run a small business, the ingenuity and the \ncost involved.\n  If you take a small operation with 5 employees, 10 employees, 20 \nemployees, they are the majority of small businesses in America. And \nsmall businesses account for up to 70 percent of the net new jobs in \nAmerica. Remember, in the last 2\\1/2\\ years other than 4 months, we \nhave had 9 percent or higher unemployment rates. I mean, that is a dire \ncommentary of where we stand today after we have spent $2 trillion, and \nthe deficit is growing, the debt is growing. We are facing the \npotential of a debt crisis if we do not deal with this massive \naccumulation of debt. That is why job growth becomes such an \nimperative. This is why regulatory reform is urgent and why we must do \nsomething about it.\n  We could work across the aisle instead of making broad accusations \nthat this is going to decimate the environment, and workplace safety, \nthat this is going to decimate health care. If that is the case, the \nPresident must be doing the same thing because he has just proposed \nrevoking more than $1 billion worth of regulations from agencies in 4 \nmonths. We cannot even have a hearing in 4 months on the issue if \nhearings are so important to the outcome. I would be more than happy to \nhave hearings to get it done, but we cannot even get hearings, cannot \nwork it out. It is just talk, talk, talk.\n  Many of my proposals have bipartisan support. In fact, interestingly \nenough, this proposal regarding judicial review was a provision that \nactually the Small Business Committee chair, the Senator from \nLouisiana, proposed and Senator Cardin from Maryland, in a nearly \nidentical fashion as section 605 of the Small Business Investment and \nInnovation Act of 2010 in the 111th Congress. They obviously agreed \nwith the approach. There is nothing partisan about this. We ought to be \nable to work this out. There is nothing complicated about it. There is \nnothing complicated about addressing a fundamental issue facing small \nbusiness.\n  I just want to set things straight so it is clear and we are not \nmisunderstood. Some are making generalized mischaracterizations. People \nhave not read the amendment, or taken the time and effort to understand \nit. Reason it out, and if you disagree, come up with something so we \ncan move with urgency, with dispatch because we are losing jobs in \nAmerica. We are losing businesses. This would help enormously.\n  That is why the legislation I have introduced, and the Senator from \nOklahoma and others, has broad support from major small business \norganizations across America. They understand. They are hearing from \ntheir membership. And speaking of this, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record two letters of support, one from \n32 major business organizations and another from the Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Snowe and Coburn: As representatives of small \n     businesses, we are pleased to support Freedom from \n     Restrictive Excessive Executive Demands and Onerous Mandates \n     (FREEDOM) Act of 2011. This legislation puts into place \n     strong protections for small business to help ensure that the \n     federal government fully considers the impact of proposed \n     regulation on small businesses.\n       In an economy with high unemployment, and where almost \\2/\n     3\\ of all net new jobs come from the small business sector, \n     we appreciate that your legislation would require regulators \n     to further analyze the impact of certain proposals on job \n     creation. The annual cost of federal regulation per employee \n     is significantly higher for smaller firms than larger firms. \n     Federal regulations--not to mention state and local \n     regulations--add up and increase the cost of labor. If the \n     cost of labor continues to increase, then job creation will \n     be stifled because small businesses will not be able to \n     afford to hire new employees.\n       The Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act expands the scope \n     of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) by forcing government \n     regulators to include the indirect impact of their \n     regulations in their assessments of a regulation's impact on \n     small businesses. The bill also provides small business with \n     expanded judicial review protections, which would help to \n     ensure that small businesses have their views heard during \n     the proposed rule stage of federal rulemaking.\n       The FREEDOM Act strengthens several other aspects of the \n     RFA--such as clarifying the standard for periodic review of \n     rules by federal agencies; requiring federal agencies to \n     conduct small business economic analyses before publishing \n     informal guidance documents; and requiring federal agencies \n     to review existing penalty structures for their impact on \n     small businesses within a set timeframe after enactment of \n     new legislation. These important protections are needed to \n     prevent duplicative and outdated regulatory burdens as well \n     as to address penalty structures that may be too high for the \n     small business sector.\n       The legislation also expands over time the small business \n     advocacy review panel process. Currently, the panels only \n     apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These panels have \n     proven to be an extremely effective mechanism in helping \n     agencies to understand how their rules will affect small \n     businesses, and help agencies identify less costly \n     alternatives to regulations before proposing new rules.\n       We applaud your efforts to ensure the federal government \n     recognizes the important contributions of job creation by \n     small business, and look forward to working with you on this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Air Conditioning Contractors of America; American Bakers \n           Association; American Chemistry Council; American Farm \n           Bureau Federation; American Trucking Associations; \n           Associated Builders and Contractors; Food Marketing \n           Institute; Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association; \n           Hispanic Leadership Fund; Independent Electrical \n           Contractors; Institute for Liberty; International \n           Franchise Association; National Association for the \n           Self-Employed; National Association of Home Builders; \n           National Association of REALTORS; National Association \n           of the Remodeling Industry (NARI); National Automobile \n           Dealers Association (NADA); National Black Chamber of \n           Commerce; National Federation of Independent Business; \n           National Funeral Directors Association.\n         National Lumber and Building Material Dealers \n           Association; National Restaurant Association; National \n           Retail Federation; National Roofing Contractors \n           Association; Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors--\n           National Association; Printing Industries of America; \n           Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council; Snack Food \n           Association; Society of American Florists; Society of \n           Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates; U.S. Chamber of \n           Commerce; Window and Door Manufacturers Association.\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\n           \n                                  ____\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Snowe and Coburn: As a longstanding advocate \n     for reducing excessive regulatory burdens on small \n     businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports S. \n     1030, the ``Freedom from Restrictive Excessive Executive \n     Demands and Onerous Mandates (FREEDOM) Act of 2011.'' If \n     enacted into law, this legislation would expand the \n     responsibilities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) \n     of federal agencies during the rulemaking process so that a \n     more thorough economic impact of proposed regulations on \n     small businesses would be taken into account by regulators.\n       One provision in the bill would force agencies to take into \n     account the foreseeable indirect economic impact of rules on \n     small entities when analyzing potential burdens. As a result, \n     regulators would have a better picture of the downstream \n     implications of a proposed rule on other businesses that \n     might not otherwise be considered.\n       Another section of the bill would subject agency guidance \n     documents to the small business safeguards contained in the \n     RFA. In many cases agencies have circumvented their \n     rulemaking responsibilities by issuing informal guidance. \n     Requiring agencies to perform small business economic \n     analyses before publishing informal guidance documents would \n     help prevent regulators from subverting their rulemaking \n     duties under the law.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest \n     business federation, representing the interests of more than \n     three million businesses and organizations of every size, \n     sector, and region. More than 96 percent of the Chamber's \n     members are small businesses with 100 or fewer employees. On \n     behalf of these small employers, we applaud your leadership \n     on introducing this important piece of legislation and look \n     forward to working with you on its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Our amendment includes a number of other provisions that \nwould be important. For instance, we asked the Internal Revenue Service \nto consider small business impact on rulemaking, and that agencies \nreview their rule penalty structures. I think we should ask the \nInternal Revenue Service to consider small business impact as well. It \nis reasonable. They obviously have a broad effect on small businesses \nacross America.\n  I have spoken on this issue at great length because I think it is \nthat important. I have been a ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee. I have been chair of the Small Business Committee, since \n2003 in either capacity. My State of Maine is a small business State \nwith over 97 percent small businesses, so I fully understand and \nappreciate the magnitude of the situation, the circumstances in which \nthey find themselves and struggle to survive. The interchange fee \namendment to this bill, was an important issue that consumed a lot of \ntime in the Senate. I certainly did not complain because I understand \nthat. It did not have a hearing. It is a new proposal--that did not \nhave any hearings. I did not complain, but it is important to \nunderstand--I just want everybody to understand not every amendment \noffered on the Senate floor, every proposal, has a hearing. Far from \nit. Very few ever do.\n  We had a hearing on small business regulations last fall. That is why \nI am working this out, but we cannot work it out. There is no process \nor mechanism. It is all talk. No action for where it matters most, and \nI feel the despair and anxiety of my constituents. I feel it \nintuitively. I wish we could do better.\n  I have been in the legislative process, as I said earlier, for the \nbetter part of four decades. My whole reason for serving in public \noffice is to rise to a higher level. I believe it is my responsibility \nto solve the problems on behalf of people I represent and, hopefully, \nthe country. There are only 100 United State Senators. It matters for \nour States, and it matters for our country. I would hope we could \naspire to a higher level than this; certainly, in the aftermath of the \nlast election, where there was an indisputable, unequivocal message \nfrom the American people begging and pleading with us to solve \nproblems.\n  We have an individual and a collective responsibility. We know how to \ndo it, and we can do it. The genius of America has always been working \ntogether to solve our problems. It has been the hallmark of the \ninnovation and the can-do spirit of America. I happen to believe in \nthat can-do spirit. I know it is possible if we have a process and a \nprocedure in the Senate that allows for it.\n  When I get up every day, it is about what I can do for the people I \nrepresent and for this country at a very trying and anguishing moment, \nwhere the uncertainty is permeating the American psyche; to feel and to \nunderstand the fear that people get up with every day wondering if they \nare going to find a job or keep a job. Even if they get a job, it is \nabout one-third of what they were making before. I heard that story \nyesterday from some constituents, about the hundreds who apply for a \njob for one-third of what they were making. How are they going to keep \ntheir families afloat, their homes? If they can keep it. That is what \nit is all about.\n  Why is it we cannot replicate it here in actions and speak to the \nAmerican people and give voice to those fears and say we are going to \ndo it, we are going to do it right here, and then systematically tackle \nthose issues one after the other and just do it and do it as long as it \ntakes, even if we have to work weekends? Americans are working \nweekends, two and three jobs. They are doing everything. We take \nrecesses. We do this. We ``obfuscate'' is the word that comes to mind, \nsort of create a confusion, a masquerade that we are doing something to \nmix it up.\n  The practical impact in the absence of what we are doing is directly \nfelt at home on the average American. I know we can do better. There \nhave been soaring moments in this Chamber and there can be again. This \nis one of the most consequential times in our economic history, and we \nhave an obligation to lift up the spirits of the people by working \ntogether on the issues that matter, and this is one issue that matters \nbecause there are 30 million small businesses in America. They are the \njob generators and creators, and if we do not recognize the reality of \nthis type of reform and we cannot get it done, then we have failed to \ndo our jobs. And I regret that.\n  I believe we can do it, and working it out instead of talking about \nhearings at some point, some ambiguity, as if we cannot appreciate or \nunderstand what is happening in the real world and households every day \non our Main Streets. If you do not, then I suggest you take a few Main \nStreet tours and talk to small businesses and talk about their fears. \nThese are Americans who are working mighty hard to make a difference in \nthis world. All they want is a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies and their children and, in fact, we are retreating.\n  We have an obligation to stand up to do what is right. I hope we can \nfind our way somehow, somewhere. This is a great place to start to make \na difference.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the passion with which my \ncolleague spoke, and I could not disagree more with her when she says \nwe are masquerading as if we are doing something.\n  Were we masquerading when we brought the small business jobs bill to \nthe floor, and Senator Landrieu, who chairs the Small Business \nCommittee, stood here day after day after day and only faced a \nfilibuster from the Republicans? We could not get that bill done, and \nmillions of jobs were in the balance. Were we filibustering? No, they \nwere. Were we masquerading?\n  Were we masquerading when we brought the FAA bill to the floor, in \nwhich my colleague, Senator Snowe, played a huge role? Thank God, we \npassed it. Were we masquerading? That bill is held up because the House \nRepublicans have not chosen conferees, and we are waiting to have a \n21st-century aviation system in this great Nation where we are using \nradar that was used in the last century--practically the century \nbefore. Come on. We are trying to do our job.\n  She talked about the last election. I will talk about the last \nelection. I was on the ballot, so I can talk about it. It was about \njobs. I told my people when I get back here: Jobs, jobs, jobs. I am \nproud to say we have on the floor right now a bill to reauthorize the \nEconomic Development Administration, a program that has been around \nsince 1965 and one which has a stellar record of attracting $7 of \nprivate capital for\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\nevery $1 we spend. The cost of each job created is approximately $3,000 \nper job, and they are good jobs. The Chamber of Commerce arm is \nsupporting this and the AFL-CIO.\n\n  We are dealing with amendment after amendment after amendment, and it \nis fine. It is everybody's right, and I appreciate the fact that we \nwill be voting on this amendment at 2:15. We even have an amendment to \ndo away with the very agency we are trying to reauthorize by Senator \nDeMint, even though in 2005 he had a very big press release lauding the \nEDA and, as recently as last year, his staff attended a workshop where \nthey were working with the EDA and praising the EDA for their work to \nreinvigorate jobs.\n  I appreciate being lectured--and it is everybody's right to do it--\nand I will do anything to defend my colleagues' right to say whatever \nthey want. It is just not true. The masquerading here is being done by \nRepublicans who filibuster almost every single thing we do.\n  I hope we are going to get to the series of amendments. We are being \nvery cooperative with our colleagues. We are going to take some of \nthese--some of these amendments are for show. Fine. Everyone has that \nright. It is fine. But let's get it done, and let's get going with \nauthorization of a bill that is going to create jobs. That is the whole \nidea of it. The last time we voted on it, we had a unanimous vote. \nSince 2004, we had a unanimous vote, and George Bush signed this into \nlaw.\n  I just want folks to know I have another couple minutes of remarks, \nand then I will yield such time as he may require to Senator Brown of \nOhio.\n  Mr. THUNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. What are the rules of discussion or debate right now? When \nthe Senator from California wraps up her remarks, would it not be \nappropriate to have someone from the other side speak at that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order for speakers. The Senators \nfrom Maine and California control the time, and they yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am happy to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest so that at the conclusion of my remarks Senator Brown will \nspeak for, say, 10 minutes and then it would go to Senator Thune; is \nthat all right?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate that, Mr. President. I don't know if there is \nany time agreement, but I think it is appropriate to go back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have said I would offer a unanimous consent agreement. \nWe are dividing the time between the two of us. It is my decision to \nyield to Senator Brown because Senator Snowe has spoken for a very long \ntime and I want him to have some time and I am wrapping up my comments. \nI would be happy to propound a unanimous consent request that after \nSenator Brown's remarks for 10 minutes, we then turn to Senator Thune \nfor 10 or 15 or 20 minutes or whatever it is he wishes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, point of clarification. My understanding is \nthe Senator from California cannot yield time to another Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can yield time but not the floor.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. So is there objection to my unanimous consent \nrequest that Senator Thune be recognized immediately after Senator \nBrown for as long as he wishes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from California \nhas been addressing the Senate, so wouldn't it be appropriate for the \nSenator from South Dakota to speak?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My unanimous consent request is that I have the right to \ncall on Senator Brown. I can yield to Senator Brown is my \nunderstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can yield time but not control of \nthe floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to yield time to Senator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does not give Senator Brown the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So then I will yield to him for some questions. I can do \nthat under the rules; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. So that is what we will do, unless my \ncolleagues would rather do it the way I said before. If not, I will \njust yield for questions. Either way. It is up to my colleagues.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the request was that at the conclusion of \nthe remarks of the Senator from California, the Senator from Ohio would \nhave how many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then Senator Thune would be recognized for as much time \nas he wishes.\n  Mr. THUNE. I don't have any objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Reserving the right to object, I wish to include the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the conclusion of Senator Thune?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \ncould we have some indication of timeframe? It is all fine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Fifteen.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. I think I have the time; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let's make sure. Up to 10 minutes for Senator \nBrown of Ohio, then Senator Thune to follow, and then Senator Coburn \nwill follow.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have one more question. I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I said at the conclusion of my remarks we would turn to \nSenator Brown. How many minutes remain on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 68 minutes for the majority and 47 \nminutes for the minority.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I will wrap up in a couple minutes \nand come back later.\n  I think it is very important to reiterate what I said before. I don't \nthink we are masquerading around here; I think we are trying to do our \nwork. The bill before us was voted out of the committee. It had \nhearings. It had a vote. It was bipartisan, unlike the amendment \noffered by my friend who never had a hearing. Let's be clear. We are \nnot masquerading; we are doing our work.\n  I only hope this bill gets better treatment than the small business \nbill. My friend is speaking for small business. We all know small \nbusiness is the engine of jobs, and that is why it was shocking to me \nthat the Republicans filibustered the last small business bill that was \non this floor. It is outrageous, when we say we want jobs.\n  The reason I am going to vote to table the Snowe amendment or against \nthe Snowe amendment--there are many, but one is process. We haven't had \na hearing. It is very far-reaching. But I also wish to speak as \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. One of our \nbiggest laws and regulations that stem from it has to do with the Clean \nAir Act. The way my friend has put forward her amendment, there would \nbe no benefit put into a regulation because of its impact on the health \nof us and our families.\n  The Clean Air Act has been attacked by those who want to say let's \nnot have regulations for this segment of business and that segment. We \njust had a vote in California and 60 percent of the people--\nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents--more than 60 percent said we want \nto see our health protected.\n  Here is what has happened. In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented \n160,000 cases of premature deaths--premature deaths. Now we are going \nto come in with some regulation that has never had a hearing, never had \na vote, that is not going to take into account the benefit of a health \nregulation such as that. By 2020, that number is projected to rise to \n230,000 cases of premature deaths.\n  In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 1.7 million asthma attacks--1.7 \nmillion fewer attacks. We want jobs. We want\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\npeople healthy. They can't go to work if they can't breathe, because if \nyou can't breathe, you can't work. So let's not get up here and pass \nsomething that hasn't had a hearing, hasn't had a vote, and suddenly \nsay we are no longer going to take into account the benefits of some of \nthe regulations we have.\n  In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 130,000 acute heart attacks. In \n2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 3.2 million lost days at school.\n  So my point is, yes, we want regulations to be sensible; yes, we want \nthem to be flexible; yes, we should work together to make sure our \nbusinesses aren't facing undue delays and all the rest and I am very \nwilling to do that. But what I am not willing to do is pass something \nthat has far-reaching impacts. We don't even know what it would mean to \nthe health and safety of our families, and it would absolutely ignore \nthe benefits of regulations that protect our children's health, their \nsafety, their well-being and our working families because a lot of \nthese regulations are meant to protect them.\n  I hope we will vote down the Snowe amendment. I appreciate the \npassion on all sides. I truly believe we are not masquerading. We have \na bill with real impacts, a bill that I have shown has made a major \ndifference in job creation, in business creation, and in bringing hope \nto our most ravaged communities. It is such a good program that even \nSenator DeMint, who says he doesn't like this program, certainly \nthroughout his career has praised the progress it has made in his \nState.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, and I thank the Senator from South Dakota also for his \nindulgence. I will be no more than 10 minutes.\n  I listened to Senator Boxer. This EDA issue is important for job \ncreation. I know when it comes to something such as this, there is a \nwhole array of issues that EDA is involved with in job creation. Just \none of them is what EDA does with incubators and accelerators.\n  Last week, I was in Shaker Heights, OH, at a place called the \nLaunchHouse. It used to be an auto dealership, and there are now 40 \nentrepreneurs working there. We know EDA investment, public dollar \ninvestment, in these incubators pays real dividends. The EDA estimates \na $10,000 investment creates 50 or more jobs. We are seeing that in \nplaces such as Shaker Heights and Youngstown, one of the best \nincubators in the country. Athens, OH, is the home of the National \nAssociation of Incubators, and they know what that means.\n  Before the Senator from Alaska was presiding, I was in the chair \npresiding and listening to some of this debate. I am a bit amazed by \nit. First of all, let's remember a little bit of history. I hear the \ntalking points, apparently distributed to all 47 of the Republican \nSenators, all coming to the floor and blaming government regulation for \nevery problem known to humankind. They are forgetting government \nregulation is seat belts, airbags, safe drinking water, prohibition on \nchild labor, the Food and Drug Administration so our food is pure and \nour pharmaceuticals are safe. But they lump it all together and say get \nrid of all this government regulation. I think the history they need to \nthink about is the last time they preached on the Senate floor about \nderegulation, they were successful in deregulating Wall Street, and \nlook what happened to that.\n  When I hear this sort of preachy: ``We have to get rid of government \nregulation,'' let's be a little more specific. There are some \nregulations, to be sure, that we should do away with. But when I hear \nthem talk about trillions of dollars of regulation, a lot of that is \nwhat keeps our food pure, our drinking water safe, our workplaces safe, \nour quality of life better for the broad middle class. Let's not forget \nthat.\n  I wish to speak for the last 5 or 6 minutes about something my \ncolleagues and I will be debating fairly soon; that is, the pending \ntrade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. It is a bit of \ndeja vu--as Yogi Berra said, deja vu all over again. The promise of \njobs is an echo we hear about every 3 or 4 years: Time to do a new \nfree-trade agreement; time to promise lots and lots of new job \ncreation; promise more exports for the United States. We heard it with \nNAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, almost 20 years ago. We \nheard it with PNTR with China in the late 1990s. We heard it with the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement in the last decade--2003, 2004, \n2005, 2006--and now we are hearing it again with Colombia and South \nKorea and Panama.\n  I recall both Republican and Democratic administrations saying \n200,000 new jobs created by NAFTA. I heard proponents of PNTR promise a \nmore balanced trade relationship with China, and new, increased \nexports. We have seen increased exports to China but nothing like the \nnumber of--there were jobs created because of that, I acknowledge that, \nbut nothing like the export of goods from China to the United States, \nwhich, in essence, is outsourcing jobs in the United States.\n  There is a company in Bryan, OH, called the Ohio Art Company. They \nmake something we are all familiar with, and that is the Etch A Sketch. \nWe all played with it as kids. Walmart went to that company--the \nbiggest retailer in the history of the world--and said: We want to sell \nyour product for less than $10 at Walmart. Do my colleagues know what \nthey did? They basically shut down production in the United States and \nmoved to China so they could sell it for $10, costing hundreds of jobs \nin that northwest Ohio community.\n  Before PNTR, before these promises about increased jobs, we had a $68 \nbillion trade deficit in goods with China. Last year, it was $273 \nbillion. About $600 million or $700 million every single day we bring \nin--we buy from China, then we sell to China. I hear this word \n``unsustainable'' in this body all the time about Medicare, whatever \nthey are talking about. But this is what is unsustainable. We can't \nkeep adding to that trade deficit and think we are going to have good \njobs.\n  In April alone, our trade deficit with China was $21 billion--in 1 \nmonth, $21 billion. So when I hear, this year, the Korean Free Trade \nAgreement--and the President of the United States is going to submit it \nto Congress fairly soon, I assume, depending on what happens with the \ntrade adjustment assistance; and this President has made this agreement \nwith Korea, significantly better than the last President's trade \nagreement with Korea but not all that good yet--the Congressional \nBudget Office estimates this agreement will cost--in addition to the \njobs issue, but hold on to that for a second--about $7 billion over the \nnext 10 years--$7 billion.\n  My conservative friends on the other side of the aisle are going to \nsay: How are we going to pay for $7 billion? They want to offset cuts, \nthey want to offset any other kind of spending, but they do not seem to \nwant to offset spending on this trade agreement. So this trade \nagreement is costing us $7 billion. So free trade simply is not free.\n  The administration says this agreement is expected to support--not \ncreate--70,000 jobs. Do the math. It is about $100,000 for every job \nsupported. But do another piece of math, if I could ask the indulgence \nof the Presiding Officer. George Bush the first said for every $1 \nbillion trade deficit or surplus, that translates--these are his \nnumbers--into about 13,000 jobs. So when I mentioned that trade deficit \nwith China a minute ago--$21 billion in just April alone--for every $1 \nbillion, 13,000 jobs are either gained or lost. If it is a trade \ndeficit of $21 billion, that means 13,000 jobs for every $1 billion of \nloss. So you can see, without belaboring this point or putting too fine \na point on it, there is significant job loss from these trade \nagreements.\n  The Obama administration sought to address the Bush administration's \nneglect of American automakers, which the free-trade agreement the Bush \nadministration negotiated with Korea did. But I fear we have not gone \nfar enough. Korea is the most closed automotive market in the world to \nAmerica and other foreign autos. No manufacturer can export vehicles in \nsignificant volumes into Korea--not Toyota, not Volkswagen, not Ford, \nnot Fiat. U.S. vehicle exports to Korea in 2010 were 7,500 units. In a \ncountry approaching perhaps 90 million people in Korea--80, 90, 95 \nmillion people--we sell them 7,500 cars? Imports currently make up \nabout 6 percent of the Korean auto market.\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\nSix percent of the cars driven around in South Korea are made somewhere \nother than South Korea. That is not quite fair trade.\n  This bill, this Korean Free Trade Agreement, does not get us there. \nThe Obama administration approved it, but nothing like it needs to be. \nSo I just caution my colleagues, the Korea Free Trade Agreement is a \npermanent agreement. If we pass this agreement in a couple months, what \nwe pass in establishing that formalized trade agreement with that major \nindustrial country in East Asia is a permanent relationship.\n  It does not sunset like a so-called authorization. It does not sunset \nthe way many of my colleagues have recently let the trade adjustment \nassistance lapse for service workers and for workers who lose their \njobs to countries we do not have a free-trade agreement with. Some of \nmy colleagues insist trade adjustment assistance needs to be \nreauthorized in the short-term, little baby steps, year-by-year \nintervals, while they press for more permanent trade agreements.\n  Here is the deal. Madam President, I know you in North Carolina have \nshown real leadership on these trade relationships. Here is the deal \nconservative politicians in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives want. They want us to pass permanent trade agreements, \nbut then they may want to take care of workers for just 1 year at a \ntime, 6 months at time--6 weeks at a time the last time they \nreauthorized this.\n  This does not make sense. The trade agreement with Korea is a \nsignificant problem for job growth in our country and for protecting \njobs in our country. There is nothing wrong with the word \n``protecting'' jobs in our country. But at the same time, before we \neven consider that, we need to make sure we pass the trade adjustment \nassistance. We should have learned our lessons from NAFTA, from NPTR \nwith China, from CAFTA, and from these other trade agreements that the \npromises coming from an administration on job creation, when it comes \nto trade agreements, are mostly empty promises.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I thank Senator Thune from South Dakota for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment that \nhas been proposed by my colleagues from Maine and Oklahoma, Senators \nSnowe and Coburn, the Freedom from Restrictive Excessive Executive \nDemands and Onerous Mandates Act of 2011. This is a very commonsensical \npiece of legislation. It is something that certainly responds to a \nconcern I hear from small businesses all across this country about the \nneed for relief from burdensome, one-size-fits-all Federal regulations.\n  We hear a lot of discussion--in the Senate and around this town and \naround the country, for that matter, because that is where it truly \nmatters--about creating jobs. Yet for all the rhetoric about job \ncreation, it seems there is very little that is actually being done \nwith regard to the substance of putting the right kind of policies in \nplace that will make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to \ncreate jobs. It seems as if everything we do makes it harder, more \ndifficult, and more expensive for our small businesses to create jobs.\n  As the Senator from Maine very correctly pointed out, 70 percent of \nthe jobs in our economy are created by small businesses. I think there \nare a whole range of issues that impact small businesses in this \ncountry and their ability to create jobs.\n  My colleague from Ohio just talked about trade. I happen to have a \nview on trade that you ought to have trade agreements that are fair, \nthat are enforceable, obviously, but that we are a country that \nbenefits enormously from the opportunity to export the products we grow \nand make to other countries around the world.\n  To just give you an example of one particular country, one of the \nbilateral trade agreements that is under consideration--or at least I \nwish was under consideration; it has been negotiated and has not been \nsubmitted by the White House yet to the Congress for consideration--is \nthe one with Colombia. I mentioned this earlier today in some remarks \non the floor, if you look at it and its impact on agriculture in this \ncountry: In 2008, in the commodities of corn, wheat, and soybeans, our \ncountry had 81 percent of the Colombian market when it comes to those \nthree agricultural commodities. In 2010, that was down to 27 percent. \nWhy? Because a lot of other countries that had negotiated free-trade \nagreements with Colombia have stepped in to fill the void because we do \nnot have that kind of agreement.\n  This has very direct and profound impacts on the American economy. \nBecause when you lose that kind of market share--81 percent in 2008, \ndown to 27 percent in 2010--that is a significant number of jobs that \nare impacted in industries in this country. The same would be true with \nPanama and South Korea, all of which would be trade agreements that are \nteed up that have been sitting and languishing for 3 or 4 years now \nwithout action in the Senate. It is absolutely insane for us not to be \nmoving trade agreements that could benefit our economy and create jobs \nat a time when job creation--certainly, at least rhetorically around \nhere--is stated to be the No. 1 priority we deal with.\n  When it comes to jobs and the economy--and I think there are a number \nof things, as I said, that impact that, trade being one--there are a \nnumber of policies coming out of Washington that impact small \nbusinesses and their ability to create jobs. Clearly, tax policy is \none. Tax policy is something I think needs to be reviewed. We need tax \nreform. It is long overdue. It is making us noncompetitive with other \ncountries around the world because our tax laws are outdated relative \nto other countries, our takes rates are higher relative to every other \nindustrialized country in the world, with the exception, perhaps, of \nJapan. That is something we need to be looking at. If we are serious \nabout being competitive and about growing our economy and in the global \nmarketplace creating the kind of jobs we need here at home, we have to \nhave trade policies, tax policies that are conducive to economic growth \nand job creation.\n  The other area, however, on which we can be impacted by what happens \nin Washington is regulation. That is what this particular amendment is \nall about. It is about making regulation coming out of Washington, DC, \nreasonable, making it based upon common sense, making it based upon \nscience, making it where any objective bystander or person out there--\nan observer who looks at these regulations--would say: They are trying \nvery hard not to make it more difficult for small businesses to create \njobs in this country.\n  But I think what happens too often is the exact opposite. It looks \nlike what is coming out of Washington are heavyhanded, burdensome \nrequirements, mandates, and regulations which drive up the cost of \ndoing business in this country. Frankly, I do not disagree with what \nsome of my colleagues on the other side have said about regulations \nthat are important to public health and safety. What I am talking about \nare excessive, overreaching regulations, which in some cases go beyond \nthe congressional intent, the statutory purpose that Congress, when \nthey enacted the laws, wanted to see take place. So you have regulatory \nagencies that go way beyond the congressional intent and the statutory \npurpose with regard to many of these policies that are being put in \nplace.\n  I have to say that when I travel in my State of South Dakota--and, \nfor that matter, outside the State of South Dakota--and I talk to small \nbusinesses, I talk to agricultural producers, the overriding theme, the \nconsistent theme I hear over and over and over again is: You have to \nget these out-of-control regulatory agencies under control. They keep \nspinning and kicking out more and more regulations that are making it \nmore difficult for us to grow our businesses and to create jobs.\n  Maybe that is a function of the fact that we have a government that \nhas gotten too big and out of control. If you look at government today \nrelative to historical standards, we are looking at government, as a \npercentage of our entire economy today, of being somewhere in the 24- \nto 25-percent range. I mentioned earlier this morning in some remarks \non the floor that back in the year 1800, the government was actually 2 \npercent of our entire economy. For our entire economic output at that\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\ntime, 2 percent represented what we spent on the Federal Government. \nToday we are spending one-quarter--one-quarter--of every dollar of our \nentire economic output in just the Federal Government. That does not \ninclude State and local governments. When you add those in, you get up \nover 40 percent. The trajectory we are on today will take us up to 40 \npercent of spending on the Federal Government to GDP in the not-too-\ndistant future. If you look at 2035, 2040, that is where we are headed \nif we stay on our current path.\n  So it necessarily follows, I suppose, that when government keeps \ngetting bigger and more expansive, more government regulations, more \ngovernment redtape, more bureaucracy is a natural outgrowth of a \ngrowing government. What I think makes the most sense is for us to be \ncreating jobs in the private economy. What we have seen here in just \nthe last few years is that the government economy is growing relative \nto the total economy. The private economy, thereby, is shrinking. We \nhave seen, over the last 40 years, the average of the Federal \nGovernment, as a percentage of our entire economy, being 20.6 percent. \nSo 20.6 percent of our entire economy spending has been by the Federal \nGovernment. As I said, now it is 24 to 25 percent.\n  So we are on a path where we are rapidly ramping up, we are rapidly \ngrowing the size of government relative to our entire economy. That is \nnot where we want to go if we are serious about creating good-paying, \npermanent jobs for people in this country. Those jobs originate and \ncome from the private sector. They come from small businesses. That is \nwhere we want to create the jobs.\n  So I would say the amendment that is being proposed by the Senator \nfrom Maine and the Senator from Oklahoma is a very reasonable one \nbecause all it is simply saying is, before these new regulations go \ninto place, the small businesses ought to have access to some review \nand perhaps even, if necessary, to the court system, to make sure those \nregulations are consistent with the legislative intent and not overly \nburdensome and putting an unnecessary and excessive burden on our small \nbusinesses.\n  I think it is common sense. If we are serious about job creation, if \nwe are serious about economic growth, getting the economy back on \ntrack, this is the very type of legislation we ought to be supporting. \nToo often around here we end up off on these tangents, working on \nthings that do not have an impact on job creation. I will say that one \nof the things we should be working on--and that we are not--it has now \nbeen 771 days since Congress passed a budget. Think about that: $3.8 \ntrillion, $3.7 trillion, $3.8 trillion in annual spending, and it has \nbeen 771 days now since Congress passed a budget.\n  It strikes me, at least, that if we are serious about getting our \nfiscal house in order and sending signals to the economy and to the \nmarket that we want to create jobs, the first thing we could do is get \nthe fiscal house in Washington, DC, in order. Yet we have had 771 days \nnow without a budget.\n  If you are really serious about getting the economy back on track, \nyou have to also restrain spending. You have to grow the economy, you \nhave to restrain Federal spending, because when you have a government \nthat is growing at the rate ours is, it does crowd out private \ninvestment. It makes it more difficult for small businesses to get \naccess to capital and create jobs because they are competing with the \ngovernment.\n  Back to the issue at hand here--that is regulations--I think that \nwhether it is a farmer or rancher in South Dakota--by the way, I spoke \nyesterday with someone who is in town representing a livestock \norganization in my State--the No. 1 issue is overreaching government \nregulation driving up the cost of doing business.\n  You look at some of the proposals and suggestions that are out there, \nand sometimes they fall into the category of ``you can't make this kind \nof stuff up.''\n  There was a proposal under consideration here recently at the EPA--\nwhich they have not, to be fair, promulgated regulations on yet or \nproposed regulations on yet--that would regulate fugitive dust. I mean, \nimagine and think about what that means in an agricultural. What it \nessentially means is you could not have dust from your property drift \nover onto someone else's property.\n  Some of this stuff borders on insanity. I think that is the point \nthat is being made by the amendment of the Senator from Maine. Let's \nuse some common sense. Let's use some reason. If we are going to have \nthese regulations, let's at least put them forward in a way that does \nnot disproportionately adversely affect small businesses and make it \nmore difficult for them to create jobs.\n  Here is another example. Just last month, the DOT started seeking \ncomment on the need for commercial driver's licenses for individuals \nwho are driving off-road farm equipment such as tractors. Well, where I \ncome from, that is a pretty important part of our economy. You have a \nlot of young people working in farm operations, a lot of people, \nperiod, who are out there who grow up learning or knowing how to drive \ntractors, how to handle farm equipment, and this particular requirement \nwould force them to get a commercial driver's license.\n  I mean, some of this stuff, as I said, falls into the category of \n``you can't make these kinds of things up.''\n  The EPA recently threatened ranchers in the Flint Hills region of \nKansas to stop or limit the controlled burn of their prairie pastures, \nwhich is a practice that allows for the new growth of grass to feed \ncattle, or to be faced with EPA-mandated regulations.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  It strikes me again that when you have as many of these studies that \nare out there, and a lot of data supports these arguments, we ought to \nbe responding in a way that recognizes that science, data, and input \nfrom people who are impacted by these regulations ought to have more of \nan influence on the regulations that are imposed by these agencies. \nWhat this does is it simply puts in place a way in which small \nbusinesses can get access to that kind of a review.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will support the Snowe-Coburn \namendment and move us in a direction where we are dealing fundamentally \nwith the issues that are important to our economy right now because, \nfor all of the rhetoric, as I said earlier, about wanting to grow the \neconomy and create jobs, it seems as though every policy coming out of \nWashington, DC, is contrary to that objective, whether that is tax \npolicy, trade policy, energy policy, but perhaps more important now \nthan ever, regulatory action coming out of the executive branch of the \ngovernment and running amok by creating all kinds of roadblocks and \nhurdles and impediments to job creation in this country.\n  Again, when you are at 9.1 percent unemployment, when you have as \nmany people out of work as we have and who have been out of work for as \nlong as they have, you would think that, first and foremost, we would \nbe looking at policies that make it easier and less expensive to create \njobs in this country. And what is happening is we are making it more \ndifficult and more expensive to create jobs by these excessive, \noverreaching, runaway regulations that are coming out of Federal \nagencies every single day.\n  It is hands down the thing I hear more than anything else from people \nin my State of South Dakota. As I said, whether that is the Farm Bureau \nor a livestock group or a small business organization, right now \ngovernment regulation is the thing they state most often as the biggest \nimpediment to them going out there and creating jobs.\n  So this is a very commonsense amendment. It is something our small \nbusinesses are all supporting. We saw the list of small business \norganizations the Senator from Maine put up earlier. This is something \nthis Senate ought to act on and act on today. I hope we will get a \nstrong affirmative vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Would the Senator yield for a question? Is the Senator \naware that there are at least four other bills--Senator Vitter, Senator \nRoberts, Senator Collins, and Senator Portman--and, in addition, that \nSenator Lieberman is developing a comprehensive bill on reg reform? Is \nthe Senator aware of those other bills?\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, I would say through the Chair that there may be\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\nmany efforts, as there typically are here in the Senate, to address \nsome of the issues, and a lot of our Members have different ideas about \nhow best to do that. I happen to believe the proposal put forward by \nthe Senator from Maine is, as I said, a very reasonable, commonsense \napproach to this.\n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act is something that is in need of some \nrevisions, particularly in light of the fact that we have so many \nregulations coming out of these agencies that are so costly, so \ndifficult, and so burdensome for small businesses in this country. I \nthink we ought to be, at every opportunity, looking for ways to lessen \nthe cost and the difficulty for our small businesses to create jobs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Through the Chair, I understand Senator Coburn, under \nthe UC, has the next 15 minutes. But, through the Chair, I would end my \nquestion by saying that I think the Senator is right. There are some \nregulations that are coming fairly fast and furiously. But I think the \nSenator would also understand that the normal process is reviewing the \nbills at the committee level, comparing and contrasting, and then \nbringing the best approach to the floor. And that is what some of us \nare objecting to. It is not the goal of reducing regulations; it is the \nprocess.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate all \nmorning, as an original cosponsor with Senator Snowe on her bill. I \nwish to talk about the EDA first, and then I will talk about what most \nof us do not realize because most of us have not taken the time to \nlook.\n  There are 80 economic development programs in the Federal Government \nthrough 4 agencies that spend $6.6 billion a year. Not one of them has \na metric on it to see if it is successful.\n  We have heard all morning about $3,000 per job. That is all self-\nreported stuff. No oversight on it. No committee oversight on it. No \nhard work to see--there is not a metric on one of these programs to see \nif it is working. Now we have a bill on the floor to spend another $500 \nmillion a year on something we have no idea what--we have anecdotal \nevidence, but what does the OIG say? The OIG says, first of all, this \nprogram has been used as a congressional slush fund to direct money to \nfriends of Members of Congress. That is what they say. Fully one-third \nof the projects never come to completion. So the money that was spent \non it ends up being totally wasted. We are reauthorizing a bill that \nnobody can show the statistics that it is, in fact, effective. It is \nnot just that we are reauthorizing this bill, we have 79 other \nprograms.\n  Ask yourself a question. We are $14 trillion in debt. We are nearly \nbankrupt. We are running a $1.5 trillion deficit. And we have a bill on \nthe floor to spend $500 million, and we do not know whether it works. \nWe claim, anecdotally, we see positive things every now and then. Well, \nyou know, there are positive outcomes to illness too. But the fact is, \nwe do not know what we are doing.\n  What the Congress ought to be doing is saying: If, in fact, it is a \nrole for the Federal Government to have economic development \nactivities, then we ought to center it in 1 area, and we ought to have \n1 or 2 programs, not 80 with 80 sets of administrators, 80 sets of \ncommissions, and $6.6 billion a year, with half of it not accomplishing \nany purpose for the American people other than make the Senators and \nCongressmen feel good because they think they may have done something.\n  So the whole idea that we would put forward a bill that has never \ntruly been oversighted in terms of the way everybody else would \noversight the way they spend their money to see if it is effective in \nthe whole, not anecdotal evidence of one company or one benefit--put it \nall together, and if we have a role, let's put together a program that \nwill work, No. 1; No. 2, that has metrics on it so we can measures \nwhether it is effective when we are actually borrowing the money to do \nthis. By the way, if we actually pass this bill and $500 million gets \nspent, we are going to borrow $200 million from the international \nfinancial community to do it. When we know one-third of it is wasted, \nthat just does not make any sense.\n  So the whole idea of Congress passing this EDA bill, in light of not \ndoing oversight on the other 79 economic development programs under the \nother 4 agencies, is the definition of insanity. We don't know what we \nare doing.\n  Now, let's talk about regulation for a minute. There is well over $2 \ntrillion in the United States sitting in small, medium, and large \nbusinesses right now that is not invested for jobs. Why is that? Why \nare people afraid to go out and invest and get a return on capital? It \nis because they do not see any clarity in the future. The \nadministration we have today has issued 40 percent more regulations--40 \npercent more regulations--than any administration in history in the \nfirst 2 years. One of the reasons people do not have confidence is they \ncannot handle the regulatory framework that is coming at them so fast.\n  The other thing I have observed is that when regulations are written, \nthey are oftentimes written without people with the real knowledge of \nwhat they are writing the regulations for. Eighty percent of the \nregulations written in this country are written by lawyers within the \nagency in which they are doing it. Now, I like lawyers. That is good \nenough. But how about having someone who has real experience in the \narea in which they are writing the regulation rather than a lawyer \nwrite a regulation for it?\n  A great example is that one of the good things about the new health \ncare bill was going to be where we combine things into accountable care \norganizations, where we end up putting hospitals and doctors and \nphysical therapists and mental health workers all together, and then we \nwork as a team so we can cut the costs and not have duplication and get \nbetter outcomes. The regulations on that were 220 pages long, with 65 \nthings you have to do every day on every patient to report back to the \nFederal Government. Well, that is just idiotic. It is asinine. Yet that \nis the regulation that came out on what I view as one of the few \npositive things about the affordable care act.\n  The Senator from Maine outlined the cost of business regulation to \nsmall businesses and large businesses. It is $1.7 trillion a year; that \nis, fully 12 percent of our GDP is the cost of regulations that are \ncoming from the Federal Government.\n  All this bill says is--it is a way to force the administration and \nthe agency--it does not matter if it is a Republican or Democratic \nadministration. They are both the same. It does not have anything to do \nwith what party is in power in the administration, but to hold the \nagencies accountable, that they will look at the impact of the \nregulations they write so they are not counterproductive to our \ncountry.\n  We are at a time period where we are at great risk as a nation--great \nrisk--because we are so overly exposed on our debt and our deficit. For \nevery 1 percent increase of interest rates that we are going to see \nnext year, it is going to cost us, the taxpayers of America, $150 \nbillion additional. And there is no question we are going to see \ninterest rates rise in this country. So we do not create the confidence \nof the small and medium businesses to go out and build that next \nproduction line or build a way to produce this next new idea, because \nwhat they are seeing is so much blowback from an unaccountable, \nmisdirected Federal Government.\n  So what Senator Snowe wants to do is totally connected with common \nsense. But you know what, we don't want to do that. We don't want to do \nthat. And the excuse is that we have not been through committee. Well, \nlet me tell you, one-third of the bills that come to the floor of the \nSenate have never been through the committee, and now we are saying an \namendment has to come through the committee. It is ludicrous. It is \nalso false. It is that we really don't trust the American people. That \nis what it really says, we really don't trust the American people to \nuse common sense. The reason we don't is because we have no connection \nwith common sense whatsoever in this body, and because we can't figure \nit out, we don't think they can. So Big Brother has to tell you every \ntime, every location, at every situation what you can do.\n  The thing that has changed in my adult lifetime is when I was a \nmedical device manufacturer in the seventies,\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\nthe presumption was on the government to prove that I was doing \nsomething wrong.\n  With our regulatory framework now, the presumption is on you, the \nAmerican citizen, to prove you didn't do something wrong. That is why \nthis overregulation, this attendance to detail matters to nothing, \nexcept a gnat on the top of a pin. It is out there and is so costly, in \nterms of the cost of compliance, it makes no difference in terms of \nsomebody's outcome. But, mainly, it is costing us jobs. It is costing \nus the very thing that built this country--the premise that you can put \ntogether an idea and build on that idea with hard work and minimal \ncapital and make it a success.\n  The thing that is blocking that is the regulation coming from the \nFederal Government. This is a straightforward bill. Let's hold the \nbureaucrats accountable. If they will not be held accountable, you will \nhave a way to hold them accountable.\n  I don't get it. I don't get why anybody would object to this because \nit is not stopping regulation; it is saying you have to figure out \nwhether it is prudent. If you are not following the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, then we are going to make you do it because, we will \ngive you a basis in a court of law to be able to do that.\n  What is wrong with that? Nobody has addressed what is wrong with \nthat. They have just said, no, we don't like it, we don't want it. So \nwe are going to do everything we can to make sure an amendment, which \nwill fix the problems in this country and start creating jobs, and will \nactually move money into investment to create new opportunities for \njobs for Americans, when we have 17 million Americans who want to work \nbut can't, we are going to defeat it. We are so disconnected with what \nis important in this country, and it is so frustrating. I am surprised \nI still have hair on my head.\n  Senator Snowe knows more about small business in this Senate than any \nother Senator. She has worked on it for years. She knows the problem. \nShe has offered a solution that is common sense, that will work, that \nwon't cost a lot of money, but will rein in the bureaucracy when they \ndo the wrong thing or they don't follow the law.\n  For us to say, no, we are not going to do it because there may be a \nsmall amount of risk that something might go wrong, that is exactly the \nsame way the bureaucracies work. Let me tell you how they work. They \nnever do what is best for the country, they do what is safe for the \nbureaucracy. That is why we have so much regulation, because they don't \nwant to be criticized. You can't walk through life without being \ncriticized. Nobody is perfect. No action is perfect. So let's hold them \naccountable and help them be better. Let's be uplifters to them and put \nsome tools there that will enable us to have a good regulatory \nframework that actually accomplishes the purpose of the regulations but \ndoesn't destroy what small amount of manufacturing business we have \nleft.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand our side has about 50 \nminutes left in this debate on the Snowe amendment and we will vote at \n2:15. I will speak for the next 15 or 20 minutes. There is nobody else \non the floor on our side. I will continue to try to answer some of the \nissues raised in the last few minutes about this particular amendment.\n  First of all, I have a great deal of respect for the Senator from \nOklahoma, and nobody has worked harder on trying to bring more \nefficiency to the Federal Government. He has spent hours and hours and \nhours in meetings, official meetings, informal meetings, on budgets, \nefficiencies, and regulations. I have a great deal of respect for the \nSenator from Oklahoma personally. But I do take offense at some of \nthe--not just the suggestions but accusations and specific attacks made \non the floor against the government. Two or three were issued in the \nspeech he just gave--statements like this: ``The bureaucracy never \ntakes risks.''\n  I wish to ask him, what bureaucracy did he think supported the \nelimination of Osama bin Laden? Does the Senator from Oklahoma believe \nthere were no risks taken by this bureaucracy that he so routinely \nwants to degrade--to no good end? I would ask him, if he were still on \nthe floor, were no risks taken by anyone when they launched the strike \nagainst Osama bin Laden that eventually killed him?\n  Would the Senator from Oklahoma suggest we have no regulations on \nWall Street; that we should trust the big international bankers of the \nworld to do what is right every day for the people of Oklahoma? I know \nthe people on Wall Street wake up every morning and think to themselves \nwhile they are eating breakfast: What can I do today to help the people \nin Oklahoma or in Louisiana?\n  Of course, that is absurd. There is a place for appropriate \nregulation, and bureaucracies aren't always bad. When George Washington \nled the creation of this country, he most certainly had in his mind a \ngovernment that worked for the people, by the people.\n  Let's fix the government. Let's not tear it down by statements that \nhave no basis in fact, that do not uplift people, do not encourage \npeople. They numb people. They make people angry. They make people \nthink there is no hope, when there is. There are thousands of people \nwho put on a uniform every day and go to work for this country. They \nare mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They work hard \nand they do not deserve the disparaging remarks that come too often \nfrom the other side of the aisle.\n  If you don't like government--you have made it plain--then fix it. \nOne of the ways to fix it is to take a bill--and this is not an \namendment that Senator Snowe has, it is a bill. I have seen it. She \nasked me to cosponsor it, and I have declined. It is a bill--a major \nbill--that has jurisdiction that will find its jurisdiction not in one \ncommittee--the Small Business Committee--but in five committees that \nhave jurisdiction over the aspects of Senator Snowe's bill. One of the \nreasons we should not vote favorably is not because we are not for \nregulatory reform but because this bill has ramifications that go far \nbeyond the Small Business Committee, which I chair, and five or six \nother committees need to look at the provisions in her bill. That is \none reason we have asked to go through the committee process.\n  No. 2, there are, at least to my knowledge, four other bills that \nattempt to fix this overregulatory reach which, I agree with Senator \nThune, with Senator Coburn, and I agree with Senator Snowe, needs to be \ntapped down and harnessed--not eliminated--and made less onerous for \nall business, not just small business. There are at least four other \nbills I know of that are attempting to do that. One is by Senator \nVitter, one by Senator Roberts, one by Senator Collins, and one by \nSenator Portman. I have not had the opportunity to review in detail all \nof these other bills, but I am sure they have some very excellent \npoints to them.\n  The committee process allows a chairman such as Senator Lieberman, \nwho is not here today, whose committee would have primary jurisdiction \nover this, to bring all five bills before his committee, hear the best \naspects of each, potentially combine them into a bill, and bring them \nto the floor. Do you know what. Senator Lieberman, I know, has offered \nto do that in his committee. That bill could potentially come out of \ncommittee--potentially with Senator Snowe as lead author, with other \ncosponsors--a bill that both Democrats and Republicans can agree to, \nwhich could give relief to reg reform.\n  This is not about finding a solution. This is about public relations, \ncampaigns, and Republican rhetoric about the election. That is what I \nobject to. If this were about regulatory reform and finding a solution, \nthe five Senators who have bills, and other Senators--Senator \nMcCaskill, for one, who is here today, is developing a bill, and \nSenator Carper, who has spent years on this subject and is quite the \nexpert--they would all come before the Homeland Security Committee, on \nwhich I have the privilege of serving, and in a short amount of time--\njust a few weeks--figure out something the majority could support.\n  This is not about fixing the problem. This is about bumper stickers \nfor elections, and I am very tired of it. I am not the only one. As \nchair of the Small Business Committee, I can promise you that our \ncommittee, with Senator\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\nSnowe as ranking member, has worked every day very hard through this \nrecession to put forward bills on this floor that could help create \njobs, bring relief. In fact, regarding one of the most burdensome \nregulations that the business community was screaming about, our \ncommittee was very aggressive in helping to eliminate that. That was \nsection 1099, which would have required every business to report to the \nIRS any purchase they made for goods over $600. It would have brought \nmany businesses to their knees, buried in paperwork.\n  Did our committee sit around and twiddle its thumb? No. We worked \nhard. We had, I think, the only hearing in Congress on 1099, and we \nrepealed it. It took us a while to find the right offset. The minute \nthe business groups brought it to our attention, we said we made a \nmistake and it will take us a while to find the $20 billion to offset \nit, but we will look at it before it goes into effect and repeal it. We \ndid that.\n  When Republicans say Democrats don't care about regulatory burdens, I \nfind that offensive. It is not helpful. This bill is not on the floor \non regulatory relief. This bill is on a small but effective economic \ndevelopment program that has worked beautifully in my State. Contrary \nto what the Senator from Oklahoma and others have said, this program--\nin Louisiana, as far as Louisiana is concerned--actually works. One of \nthe reasons it works so well is because many of the decisions about the \ngrants are not done in Washington but at the regional level. Our office \nhappens to be in Austin, TX. When the Chamber of Commerce comes to \nvisit me--and they are not always huge supporters of the Democratic \ncaucus--they say to me: Senator, one of the best programs that our \nmembers like and feel the Federal Government does a very good job with \nis the EDA grants, because they are not that bureaucratic. They make \nquick decisions and help us fill gap financing in programs that make a \nmeaningful difference to people in our communities. I didn't raise this \nsubject to the Chamber of Commerce; they raised this subject to me.\n  Maybe the Senator from Oklahoma is correct that some of these moneys \nwere earmarked. But we don't allow earmarks anymore. So this program is \ngoing to go on without earmarks directed by Members. It is going to be \ndone on a regional basis, and these programs have been--at least in \nLouisiana's experience--quite effective. Louisiana Tech, one of my \nuniversities, received a $2 million EDA grant. I will submit this for \nthe Record: Our ongoing partnership with EDA has greatly enhanced the \nuniversity's overall economic development efforts. We are creating the \nEDA University Center.\n\n  This is from the mayors of both cities. You know, I do trust my local \nelected officials. I do trust the people I represent. When they say a \nprogram works, I like to believe them.\n  There is a list of projects and recent investments in Louisiana--$1.2 \nmillion to Tulane University.\n  Can I tell you one thing about Tulane University, since it was \ndamaged significantly after Hurricane Katrina? We have over 45,000 \napplicants to this school. Why do people want to come to Tulane? They \nwant to come because not only is it a great school, but it is in a \ngreat city that is rebuilding itself. An EDA grant--that some people \nwish to eliminate--is helping to rebuild our city. So $1.2 million to \nTulane University. It is a microloan program.\n  I believe the people at Tulane University. I have a great respect for \nScott Cowen and their board. Everywhere I travel around the United \nStates as a Senator I could not be more proud when people come up to me \nand comment what a great university Tulane is. I don't need somebody in \nWashington telling me how good this program is. I have the people I \nrepresent at home telling me.\n  We have $75,000 given to the downtown development district which was \nunderwater after Katrina for the Idea Village. You know where the Idea \nVillage was recently advertised? Maybe on the front page of Enterprise \nMagazine; maybe in Time magazine. This Idea Village is one of the best \nideas in the whole country. You know who funded it? The program Senator \nBoxer is trying to reauthorize.\n  We have $400,000 for a startup fund for the creation and development \nof stimulus funds to support fledgling enterprises in the greater New \nOrleans region. Our seafood industry went completely--no pun intended--\nunderwater after the BP oilspill. This agency stood up, when no one \nelse would--BP wouldn't give them a penny, Ken Feinberg wouldn't give \nthem any money--and gave them $350,000 to keep their head above water--\nthe Seafood Promotion Board. That is why, in large measure, people are \neating gulf coast shrimp today.\n  So I don't know what report Senator Coburn is looking at, but the May \n19 GAO report states they have not concluded that duplication exists \namong programs, and plans to address these issues in their future work \non overlap and duplication.\n  I don't know if the Senator has asked his Chamber of Commerce from \nOklahoma, but I am going back to my office and I am going to call them \nmyself, because I wish to find out. Maybe their program works \ndifferently in Oklahoma than it works in Louisiana. But when I call my \npeople at home--and they will tell me: Senator, some of these programs \naren't worth a hill of beans and you should eliminate them; these \nprograms are too difficult. I have that all the time about some \nprograms. Not all the time, but some programs. This isn't one of them.\n  The reason I am a little exercised is because this is like deja vu. I \ncame to this floor 4 weeks ago to try to get a similar program in \nsize--a $1.2 billion program that has worked so well. Senator Warren \nRudman had created it. It is a great program. It is the country's best \nventure capital program for all small business. It makes money. It \ndoesn't lose money. We got the same thing done to us by the other side \nof this aisle that says we don't care about small business over here \nbecause we have to talk about X, Y, and Z.\n  So this is the second time for one of our chairmen. I was the first, \nand now Senator Boxer is trying to bring to the floor a program that is \nnot that complicated. It is a little program but it has big bang for \nthe buck. It gets rave reviews from the people in my State--Republicans \nmainly but Democrats as well--and we can't seem to get this program \napproved until we take bills that Members want to put on this bill that \nhave nothing to do with it and that haven't gone through committee.\n  I am going to be voting against Senator Snowe's bill. But to make \nclear, I support Senator Snowe's efforts to reduce regulation. My \npeople in Louisiana are screaming about this. I have tried to \ncommunicate this to the administration in many ways, whether it is EPA \nor the Corps of Engineers, or the more recent one coming out of one \nagency that wants all my oilfield workers to put on HAZMAT suits to go \nto work. If you put on a HAZMAT suit in Louisiana when it is 100 \ndegrees, you won't get to the oil rig because you will faint before you \nget there.\n  I am not unaware--I want the Senator from Oklahoma to understand--of \nsome ridiculous rules and regulations that come flying out of some of \nour agencies. But the way to fix them is not to bring a bill to the \nfloor that has not had a hearing when six different committees have \njurisdiction, when Senator Lieberman, who has the lead jurisdiction as \nchair of Homeland Security has indicated a complete willingness to take \nthis on.\n  There are enough bumper sticker printing operations in America today. \nThere is only one U.S. Senate. I suggest we start acting like the U.S. \nSenate and stop acting like a bumper sticker operation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments. I \nsaid in my earlier comments there are some good things about the EDA. \nBut the fact is, they are all self-reported. There is no data. There \nare no methods. Any time you send money to the State of Oklahoma, I \nguarantee you the people who are going to get the money are going to \nlike it. But there isn't one metric, one set of metrics that measures \nthe effectiveness of the money that has been spent through EDA in terms \nof job creation. Fully one-third of the dollars don't get through to \ncompletion over the history of the program.\n  The very idea we would defend the bureaucracy--the bureaucracy didn't \nhelp us on 9/11 because they were\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\nstovepiped and they didn't communicate. The bureaucracy failed to \nensure the safety of the levees in New Orleans--this same bureaucracy \nthat doesn't need to be controlled. The bureaucracy didn't protect us \nfrom the financial crisis of 2008 because we didn't do the oversight. \nThe bureaucracy didn't protect the gulf from the Deepwater Horizon. We \nhad a bureaucracy that was supposed to be in charge of that, but they \ndidn't do their job.\n  The SBIR--you had my full support on SBIR; the Senator from Louisiana \nknows that. She had my support on that because that is one of the \nproven programs inside the SBA that actually has metrics on it that \nworks. So the debate is whether we hold back the regulatory framework.\n  I find it ironic that you agree with us in principle but won't vote \nwith us on this amendment because it didn't go through a committee. It \nis amazing.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to finish my points and then leave the floor \nbecause I have something else I have to do.\n  It is amazing the negative effects we all are hearing from all across \nthe country. Every Senator is hearing how regulation is drowning out \nopportunity for investment that creates jobs in this country. Every \nprogram has some positive aspects to it. The question isn't whether \nthey have positive aspects, it is what is our priority now that we are \nbankrupted. Where should we be spending the money so we get the best \nbang for the buck. How do we pull back the regulatory framework so that \nit is common-sense oriented rather than bureaucratic oriented? That is \nwhat Senator Snowe is trying to do and to give some type of power to \nthe very people who are being regulated. Because we certainly won't do \nthe oversight. We haven't done the oversight.\n  It is interesting that when the GAO put out this last report on \nduplication, they are right, they didn't say in these particular \nprograms. But I put out a report 9 months before that detailed the \nduplication in these programs, and it was published, so you can find \nthe duplication.\n  The important point is we are strangling business and job \ndevelopment--small and medium. The big guys can take all this \nregulation, and they are already staffed up. The small- and medium-\nsized businesses can't. We have to give them a way to force common \nsense onto the bureaucracy. That is all this does. Everybody hears it \nfrom all of their constituents, that regulation is killing business \nformation and job creation. Why would we not want to put in some \nbalance? I don't understand it.\n  The real problem with the regulatory agencies is us, because we won't \noversight them. There was no oversight hearing on the EDA. Nobody ever \nasked the question: Where are the metrics? We hear all this anecdotal \nevidence about how great it is when we give money to the States that \nthey can do things, but where are the numbers that show the job \ncreation for every thousand dollars that gets spent? It is self-\nreported, but there is nothing that looks at it that says statistically \nhere is the proof.\n  If the EDA is the best way to create jobs in this country, I am all \nfor it. But I want to see some data that says that right now. We have \njob training programs, 47 of them in this country, and we spend $18 \nbillion a year on them. We have 104 science, technology, engineering, \nand math programs across nine different agencies we are spending $16 \nbillion on a year. We have no data on any of those programs anywhere, \nbut we have it out there. We have no idea what we are doing because we \nwon't ask the hard questions and we won't study it. Nobody would have \n104 science, technology, engineering, and math programs. We have 64 \nprograms--and 20-some of them are outside the Department of Education--\nto improve teacher training quality.\n  The reason we are in trouble is because we haven't done our job on \noversight. So anyone can claim anecdotal evidence that something is \ngood, but you should know that when we spend $1,000 of the taxpayers' \nmoney--money we don't have today because we are borrowing it from \nChina--we ought to be certain that it is actually going to create \nsomething because our kids are paying the bill. The next generation is \ngoing to pay the bill, and they will pay that bill through a markedly \nlower standard of living.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Republican \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thirteen minutes. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to make a few points. It is about solving problems. That is \nwhat this is all about. It truly amazes me that we have an amendment \nhere on regulatory reform that everybody agrees with in principle and \neverything else, that goes to the heart of the issues concerning the \neconomic well-being of small business and, hence, America's well-being \nin these desperate times, yet we can't manage to get it together and to \nwork on these issues.\n  I made a number of good-faith changes in my legislation, and I would \nhave done more if I had heard any response from the other side to \nworking those out. I made five major changes to the proposition back in \nApril to respond to this. But there is no response. Then I hear about \nthese hearings. Can somebody please tell me where it is in the rules of \nthe Senate that every amendment has to have a hearing?\n  We had a major vote yesterday on interchange for the second time. \nThat is important to small business. But even the committee of \njurisdiction didn't have a hearing. So this is, again--as I describe \nit--the politics of obfuscation. Let's get to the heart of the matter \nand solve the problems for America. It isn't about who authors it and \nwho is doing it. Let's do it. That is the point: We are not doing it. \nWe are just sitting here talking, recessing, going home today, going to \ndo something else, going to have recesses.\n  We have five committees that have jurisdiction over this issue. We \nare going to need a roadmap pretty soon. I don't want to go home and \ntell my constituents this is what happened on regulatory reform. So let \nme get this straight. Let me get this straight. We have five \ncommittees, there are a number of bills, time is running out, people \nhave to leave, and we can't have enough time to debate this.\n  That is what I was told this morning. All of a sudden I was given a \ncall saying: Sorry, you have to do it right now. I said: Well, is the \nbill over? We just started. There are a number of pending amendments \nthat haven't even been addressed yet. Let's vote on those. This is an \nimportant issue. Let's give this the equivalency of the interchange \namendment. Let's do something that is important for small business. \nAbsolutely not.\n  This is about jobs at a very difficult time in America.\n  Let me repeat, 40 months after the start of the four deepest postwar \nrecessions, our economic output averaged 7.6 percent. Here we are, our \nGDP has only increased .1 percent. Those are terrible numbers. But \nbehind those numbers are people and human beings because it means we \nare not creating jobs.\n  We heard here today that sometimes bureaucracy is good. Well, \nbureaucracies, by definition, and I read, mean ``excessive \nmultiplication of, and concentration of power in administrative bureaus \nor administrators'' Absolutely. They are unelected. We are elected. We \nunderstand the problems. Even the President--let's read this headline, \n``Obama to scale back regulations in an effort to spur economic \ngrowth.''\n  What is interesting about all this--nobody is accusing the President \nof decimating the environment or workplace or health care. \nUnderstanding that, 6 days after I was denied a vote on this very \namendment where I made five different adjustments to respond to the \nother side, you have the President's Economic Competitiveness Council \ncoming out with four major priorities, one of which is a need to \nimprove the regulatory process because there are decades of overlapping \nand uncoordinated regulations.\n  Even by the administration's estimate, this White House's own \nestimate, that regulations last decade cost anywhere from $44 to $62 \nbillion, last year's alone with a $26 billion. This is a serious issue.\n  Can we work it out? Can we do it? Do we have the capacity to work on \nissues anymore, thoroughly and deliberatively? It has been almost 2 \nmonths\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\nand we have not gotten any further. We haven't even had a hearing. \nSomewhere, somebody has bills. Great. Bring them up. Let's debate them. \nLet's compare them. Let's do something. Let's do something for small \nbusiness. They desperately need it. Now I will be glad to yield to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I would like in this context to focus on the \neconomic policy, to look at where we are right now, the state of the \neconomic union and the State of Illinois.\n  If we look at basic numbers we see we will take in about $2.1 \ntrillion in tax revenue, but our government is currently projected to \nspend $3.4 trillion in tax revenue, yielding a deficit of approximately \n$1.3 trillion. We will have to borrow from the American people, from \nChina, and other foreign powers.\n  Total unfunded liabilities of the Federal Government are $61 \ntrillion, yielding a debt of $196,000 per American, currently. When we \nlook at economic growth and the way to expand the available pie for the \nUnited States, our economy last year grew at a 2.8-percent rate. China, \non the other hand, grew at 10.3 percent, and Libya--currently under \nattack by NATO--grew at 4.2 percent. In fact, quiz question: Which \neconomy grew more last year, the United States or Iran? The answer: The \nIranian economy grew at a faster rate than the United States.\n  The situation probably is even more bleak in the State of Illinois. \nFor the State of Illinois, we are going to take in about $27 billion in \nrevenue, spending $33 billion, for a $5.8 billion gap. This is for a \nState whose credit rating is deteriorating quite rapidly, having not \nfunded its pensions to a greater degree than almost any other State, \nthe unfunded liability of the State of Illinois of $62 billion for a \nper-citizen debt on top of the Federal debt of $4,800.\n  When we look at our State and its economic growth, the State of \nIllinois is at just 1.9 percent growth. Other States, Wisconsin, even \nwith its highly controversial Governor now rapidly improving its \nbusiness climate at 2.5 percent; the State rated No. 1 for creating \njobs in America, 2.8 percent, and the State that is on fire, the State \nof Indiana at 4.6 percent. This is clearly a sign that things are going \nwell in Indiana, things are going well in China, things are even going \nbetter in Libya than in the United States, and it shows that we need to \nchange course for our country economically, to back the amendment of \nthe Senator that she has here, and to make sure we can lay out better, \nmore pro-productive policies like the small business bill of rights \nthat represents 10 new policies to accelerate economic growth.\n  On behalf of that entity, which represents half of all the jobs in \nthe United States, and my own State--these are private sector jobs. \nThey are sustainable. They do not depend on a failed stimulus which is \nnow running out of gas--given the records, I think we can see it is \nclear we ought to go back to economic fundamentals to correct the \nsystem and look clearly at the state of economics where we are now.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Maine and thank her for the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I now yield to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Brown.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 4 minutes, and the \nremaining time for the Democratic side is 35 minutes.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for additional time \non the bill, since the vote is not going to occur until 2:15, and that \ntime be equally divided.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield the remainder of the time to Senator Brown. It is \nregrettable, since this is an important issue, that we couldn't have \nmore time on this key issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I want to begin by \nexpressing my support for what Senator Snowe has been doing and for the \nEDA Reauthorization Act. I applaud the committee for producing a good, \ncomprehensive bill. These EDA grant programs provide vital resources, \nnot only for Massachusetts economic development and its businesses, but \nalso other States throughout the country to help communities get back \non their feet in this tough economic climate. For that reason, the \nreauthorization of this bill is incredibly important, and I encourage \nthat it be done.\n  I rise to speak about two amendments to this bill that affect the \nstability of our small businesses. Senator Snowe and Senator Coburn's \nFREEDOM Act, to reform the small business regulatory system, is one \nthat I have consistently supported because it is a commonsense \nsolution. When I am traveling around my State, no matter where I go and \nno matter with whom I speak, from CEOs all the way down to the worker \nwho is just doing the everyday work, one thing I hear over and over is \na plea to get rid of the one-size-fits-all Federal regulations that are \nlimiting businesses.\n  Businesses need certainty and stability in order to create an \neconomic climate for jobs not only to be created but to be retained, \nnot only in Massachusetts but throughout the country.\n  This amendment would require that Federal agencies conduct \ncomprehensive analysis on the potential impact of regulations on small \nbusinesses. It has the support of the NFIB and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. Simply put, burdensome regulations are hurting our small \nbusinesses and job creators and are preventing them from growing and \nhiring. It is a shame this amendment got caught up in partisan \nvolleying in the SBIR reauthorization. I am happy to have an \nopportunity to speak about it today.\n  I also want to turn the Senate's attention to amendment No. 405 to \nrepeal the 3 percent withholding tax, a malignant and business-\nthreatening provision. It is based on S. 164, the Withholding Tax \nRelief Act, which enjoys bipartisan support and is critically needed \nnow. Senator Snowe is a cosponsor, as well as 14 of my colleagues.\n  We need to repeal once and for all this onerous and costly unfunded \nmandate. This is a jobs amendment, plain and simple. It would repeal a \npart of our Tax Code that promises to kill jobs.\n  As you know, Mr. President, we have had many comments about how this \nbill would, in fact, cost potentially as high as $75 billion to \nactually implement. The moneys received back to the Federal Government \nwould be about $8 billion over that same period. It is absurd. Any \nprogram that costs more to implement than it brings in revenues should \nbe repealed immediately.\n  Two months ago I received a letter from the Massachusetts State \nsecretary of finance, Jay Gonzalez, warning Congress of the inevitable \nthreat to the ability of small businesses to survive in this economic \nclimate if we allow the continuation of this stealth tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I encourage colleagues to also adopt that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator from California was on the \nSenate floor this morning, Mrs. Boxer, advocating passage of this bill \nand urging colleagues to vote against the Snowe amendment. I am here to \nsupport that position.\n  I would like to respond briefly to Senator Coburn's last couple of \nstatements about where the bureaucracy failed. He didn't have to remind \nme, of course, the bureaucracy failed to respond to Katrina and Rita, \nthe largest disasters by far in the history of the country. But we have \nspent 6 years fixing that bureaucracy, not printing bumper stickers for \nreelection campaigns. You know what. It has worked because our efforts \nto fix the bureaucracy have helped the people of Missouri and Arkansas \nand Tennessee and Montana and Indiana who are currently experiencing \nterrible disasters as we speak.\n  The bureaucracy that showed up at the Superdome is a lot better today \nin many ways--it is better today than the bureaucracy that showed up at \nthe Superdome. That is because we had hundreds of hours of committee \nmeetings, where this hard work is done, to bring\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\nsignificant and important bills and changes that take debate, not on \nthe Senate floor but take debate in the work of the committee. When you \nare working on major pieces of legislation that have major impacts, \nthat is where it is done.\n  Besides the FREEDOM Act that is on the floor today, there is the \nRegulatory Responsibility For Our Economy Act, sponsored by Senator \nRoberts with 46 cosponsors. I am assuming--I don't have the list, but I \nam assuming they are Democratic and Republican cosponsors. That is a \nmajor regulatory relief bill.\n  There is a bill by Senator Collins called the CURB Act, Clearing \nUnnecessary Regulatory Burdens. The CURB Act has two cosponsors.\n  Then there is a smaller bill by Senator Portman that has no \ncosponsors, but he is the lead sponsor. That looks to me like it is a \nsmaller bill and has limited scope but nonetheless on regulatory \nreform.\n  There could be 12 other bills filed in the Senate--I don't know--and \nhundreds of other bills filed in the House. Forget the House bills. \nWhen bills like this are filed in the Senate, the usual route and the \nmost effective route is to go through the committee of jurisdiction. \nYou can understand in this topic, which is so broad--regulatory \nreform--it is regulatory reform in the Department of Commerce and \nregulatory reform in the Department of EPW, Environmental and Public \nWorks, regulatory reform for the Department of Homeland Security, \nregulatory reform in the Department of Defense. There are many \ncommittees of jurisdiction.\n  What everyone has agreed to is to have the hearing in the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, which has broad jurisdiction, and get the work \ndone. Senator Lieberman is not here today because he is on Jewish \nholiday. He has said time and time again he will have this hearing in \nthe committee and that is the appropriate place so we can come forward \nwith a bill on regulatory relief.\n  There are a couple of reasons why this particular approach is flawed. \nI would like to read the comments from the administration. I would like \nto read three specific reasons why this particular FREEDOM Act is not \nin the proper position it should be. But the way to fix it is not \ndebating on the floor of the Senate on a bill that is not really \ngermane to the bill that we are debating, that we are trying to pass. \nIt is to have this kind of debate in committee so we can work out these \ndetails. Senator Snowe has shown herself to be in the past, and still \ntoday, willing to work in a very cooperative manner, and the place to \ndo this is in committee.\n\n       No. 1: The bill as currently drafted would allow judicial \n     review before the completion of rulemaking. That provision in \n     the Freedom Act would undermine regulatory certainty, making \n     it harder for businesses--\n\n  not easier, harder--\n\n     for businesses to plan for the future and compete in the \n     marketplace. It would also invite excessively costly and \n     unwieldy litigation.\n\n  We don't want to have more lawsuits. We want to have less lawsuits. \nThat is one of the problems small businesses are facing today--lawsuit \nafter lawsuit after lawsuit. The last thing we want to do is encourage \nmore of them. Many people have reviewed the technical writing of the \nbill in its current form and believe it will result in more lawsuits, \nnot less. We wish to fix that in committee.\n\n       The amendment would make it harder, not easier, to see the \n     actual cost of regulation, by expanding the Regulatory \n     Flexibilities Act definition to include indirect effects.\n\n  I can understand why she wants to do it, but in interpreting the \nlanguage as the Senator has written it, this legislation would likely \nundermine any reliable and meaningful economic analysis of regulation, \nthereby distracting the agencies from focusing on what the actual \nimpacts of the rules would be.\n\n       Finally, the amendment inappropriately links regulatory \n     decisions to budget cuts. Decisions about regulation should \n     be based on sound economic science and not on the threat of \n     budget cuts.\n\n  This is a preliminary review of some of the current problems.\n  Senator Snowe is right, I guess. We could stay on the floor for the \nnext 2 or 3 or 4 weeks and the other Senators who are not on the floor \ncould agree to come and debate their bills on the floor, which is \nhighly unusual. But why not just go to the Homeland Security Committee, \nhave all of the sponsors of these major pieces of legislation present \ntheir bills and have that committee work through these technical \ndifficulties? Because it is an important issue. Many of us support \nregulatory reform. We know there are some burdens, particularly on \nsmall business. We want to get it fixed, so let's fix it instead of \ncontinuing to rail on this subject on every bill that comes before the \nSenate, whether or not it has anything to do with regulatory reform.\n  One thing I wish to point out to the Senator, and I point this out \nwith the greatest respect, about 6 months ago or longer now, we were \nboth on the floor trying to pass the small business jobs act, a very \nsignificant bill that would actually help to bolster this economy and \nhelp provide literally billions of dollars of loans to small businesses \nthat couldn't get them anywhere. Their credit card companies had raised \nthe rates so high or their banks had shut down their lines of credit. \nSenator Snowe and I worked together to bring a bill to the floor--and \nwe did, and passed it, unfortunately, without the support of the other \nside of the aisle. But in that debate, the Senator from Maine said--\nbecause I included in that bill, with a 60-vote margin--I got Senator \nVoinovich and Senator LeMieux to vote for the small business lending \nfund, which was a little unusual. She said:\n\n       . . . not included in the overall. First and foremost, it \n     has not had a single hearing with respect to this issue, and \n     in my view, it certainly does resurrect the controversial \n     TARP program . . . and because it hasn't had a hearing, this \n     should not pass.\n\n  Yet, within a year, she is back arguing against that argument--that \nher bill, which hasn't had any hearing in the committee--should pass.\n  So there is some inconsistency here. I say this with the greatest \nrespect to the Senator from Maine. But if we want to be serious about \nregulatory reform, we have to have this debate in the committee of \njurisdiction, which is right now Homeland Security, and then have the \nother chairmen of the committees try to cooperate with that committee \nand bring something to the floor. We will be happy, many of us, to vote \nfor it. But doing this in this way is not helpful. It is not going to \nfix the problem. It is only going to make the burden on small business \nworse. We have to move past it.\n  I wish to refer my colleagues to the floor remarks Senator Snowe made \non July 22, 2010.\n  Can these be fixed? Yes. But this is not the place, on the Senate \nfloor, when there are many other bills as well. Senator Snowe could \nremain the main sponsor because she has put in the most work. She has \nbeen a tireless advocate. She should get tremendous praise for bringing \nforth this issue and keeping the fires burning and pushing the Senate \nto this end, and that would be terrific. Many of us would join that \neffort. But this is not the bill to do it on. This is not the place to \ndo it. I would suggest that, again, taking this to the committee of \njurisdiction, working it out, bringing the administration forward so we \ncan actually make some real progress on curbing regulatory overreach by \nthe Federal Government would be welcomed by all.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont is here on the floor. I am assuming he \nwants to talk.\n  How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 24 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the final 10 minutes be \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Snowe and Boxer, with \nSenator Boxer controlling the final 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of majority \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Deficit\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, there are a number of huge issues facing \nour country. Our middle class is collapsing. Poverty is increasing. We \nare in two wars. We are concerned about global warming, the quality of \nour education, and massive unemployment. So this country today has its \nshare of serious problems we have to address.\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\n  Right now, a whole lot of attention, not inappropriately, is on our \nvery large deficit and a $14 trillion-plus national debt. This is an \nissue which is perhaps going to come to a head over the next few months \nas it becomes tied to whether we raise the debt ceiling. I wish to say \na few words on this issue.\n  No. 1, when we talk about deficit reduction, it is important for us \nto understand how we got to where we are today. How did it happen? How \ndo we have a $1.5 trillion deficit this year, and a $14 trillion-plus \nnational debt? Let's remember that not so many years ago, at the end of \nPresident Clinton's tenure, this country had a significant budget \nsurplus and the expectation was that surplus was going to grow in the \nyears to come.\n  But then a number of things happened during the Bush years. No. 1, we \nbecame engaged in two wars. No. 2, we passed a Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program. No. 3, we bailed out Wall Street. And No. 4, \nwe gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country. Then, \nas a result of the Wall Street-caused recession, revenue dropped, and \nthe result was that we now have a very high deficit and a very large \nnational debt. But it is important to remember how we got to where we \nare today.\n  It is also important when we talk about deficit reduction to take a \nlook at American society today in order to determine what is a fair \nway--a fair way--to address deficit reduction. When we look at American \nsociety today, the trends are very clear. The middle class is, in many \nways, disappearing as a result of stagnant or, in fact, lowered wages \nfor millions and millions of American workers. Median family income \nover the last 10 years has gone down by about $2,500. The middle class \nis hurting. Many millions of Americans, in fact, have left the middle \nclass and entered the ranks of the poor. Poverty is increasing. But at \nthe same time as the middle class is shrinking and poverty is \nincreasing, there is another reality we cannot ignore--or I am afraid \nmany of my colleagues choose to ignore it--and that is that the people \non top are doing phenomenally well. Over a recent 25-year period, 80 \npercent of all new income went to the top 1 percent. The top 1 percent \nnow earns more income than the bottom 50 percent. When we talk about \ndistribution of wealth, we have the top 400 Americans--the 400 \nwealthiest Americans--owning more wealth than the bottom 150 million \nAmericans.\n  That gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing wider. \nIt is important to discuss that issue about what is happening to the \nmiddle class, to lower income people, and the growing gap between the \nwealthy and everybody else when we address the issue of deficit \nreduction.\n  My Republican colleagues in the House came up with an idea that I \nthink most people almost can't even believe they would pass; it seems \nso incomprehensible. At a time when the middle class is hurting and \nthings are getting worse as a result of a recession, our Republican \ncolleagues say, Well, what we want to do is move toward deficit \nreduction by making savage cuts in Medicaid, in education, in \ninfrastructure, in nutrition, in virtually every program that low- and \nmoderate-income Americans depend upon. Furthermore, what we want to do \nin the House--what they have done--is to end Medicare as we know it, \nconvert it into a voucher program, giving seniors a check for $8,000 \nand have them go out and get a plan from a private insurance company \nwhich clearly will be totally inadequate for most seniors and end up \nraising their out-of-pocket expenses.\n  Then when it comes to the wealthiest people who are doing \nphenomenally well, not only do our Republican colleagues not ask the \nwealthiest people or the largest corporations to pay one nickel more in \ntaxes to help us with deficit reduction, they come up with this \nbrilliant idea that we are going to give $1 trillion in tax breaks over \na 10-year period to the wealthiest people in America. So the rich are \ngetting richer, and they get tax breaks. The middle class is shrinking, \nand what they are asked to do is to assume huge cuts in programming \nwhich will impact them very strongly.\n  This is clearly the Robin Hood proposal in reverse. We are taking \nfrom working families who are hurting and giving it to the wealthiest \npeople who are doing phenomenally well. The Republican plan is clearly \nabsurd, and I think most Americans understand that.\n  The question is, What will the President do? What will the Democrats \ndo? It is my very strong hope Democrats will be strong on this issue. \nThe President has to be strong on this issue. The President has to go \nout to the American people and win the support that is there for a \ndeficit reduction package of shared sacrifice. We need to say very \nclearly to the American people: No, we are not going to move toward \ndeficit reduction solely on the backs of the most vulnerable people in \nthis country. No, we are not going to decimate Medicare so elderly \npeople will not be able to get the health care they need when they are \nold and sick. No, we are not going to throw millions and millions of \npeople off of Medicaid and endanger families who have their parents in \nnursing homes. We must have shared sacrifice. The wealthy and large \ncorporations must be involved and contribute toward deficit reduction.\n  There is a lot of responsibility on the President, but let me make it \nvery clear. I, personally, as a member of the Budget Committee and as a \nSenator from Vermont, will not be supporting any package that does not \ncall for shared sacrifice.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President I have supported regulatory reform since \nbefore my election to the Senate in 1978, to make regulations more \nsensible and efficient while protecting the public's health and well-\nbeing. The Snowe regulatory reform amendment would amend the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, RFA, to require that Federal agencies consider all \npotential direct and ``indirect economic impacts'' of proposed \nregulations. I will vote against this amendment because it is so broad \nand undefined. Also, the Snowe amendment would give standing to seek \njudicial review and seek injunction of a rulemaking while the rule is \nstill in its draft form and still receiving public comment. I am \nconcerned that such a change could paralyze the regulatory process, not \nreform it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as cosponsor of the Freedom Act, I \nwould like to add my voice to those who have spoken in its support.\n  But first I would like to thank Senator Snowe for her dedication and \nhard work in support of the many small business owners across her state \nand across the country who would benefit from this legislation.\n  As we all know, America's job creators are suffocating under \nregulations and redtape.\n  The administration doesn't seem to realize that all its interference \nhas a human cost.\n  Businesses want to create jobs and help communities recover, but they \ncan't.\n  Whether it is new financial requirements, health care mandates, \nenergy mandates, onerous new fees, burdensome tax filing requirements, \nor threats of higher taxes, businesses today are faced with so many new \nrules and requirements from Washington that they can hardly see \nstraight.\n  The Freedom Act says enough is enough.\n  This regulatory reform amendment would help give small businesses \nmuch-needed relief from the Federal government and its one-size-fits-\nall approach.\n  Specifically, it would modernize the Regulatory Flexibility Act to \nrequire that from now on, Federal agencies conduct a comprehensive and \ncareful analysis of the potential impacts--both direct and indirect--of \nregulations on small businesses. It would make sure that the voices of \nsmall business owners are heard in government agencies that frankly \ndon't seem to be listening to them.\n  This amendment has broad support from the small business community.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses have issued strong letters of support.\n  At a time when nearly 14 million Americans are looking for work, this \nis exactly the kind of legislation that would help America's job \ncreators.\n  When I ask business owners what they want us to do to help them \ncreate jobs, they usually have a simple five-word response: get out of \nthe way. That is what we are doing with this legislation.\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\n  And the only people who could possibly oppose it are those who think \nthe needs of bureaucrats in Washington are more important than the \nneeds of job creators everywhere else.\n  I thank Senator Snowe and Senator Coburn for their strong advocacy on \nbehalf of small businesses.\n  I intend to vote for this important amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 390\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are working on a bill that is a jobs \nbill, plain and simple. It does not have any fancy parts to it. It is a \nreauthorization of a program that was set up in 1965. The purpose was \nvery clear: to go into areas in our States where the communities are \nhurting for jobs, where the communities are hurting for business. It \nworks in a way that every $1 we put into the program attracts $7 of \nprivate investment.\n  I will show you the job creation on some of these charts that we see. \nAt the $500 million funding level that is authorized in the bill, the \nEDA is projected to create up to 200,000 jobs a year and over the life \nof the bill up to 1 million jobs. It is done at a very low cost per \njob. Mr. President, $3,000 per job is what it costs the Federal \ntaxpayers because of all the leverage that comes in as cities join in, \ncounties join in, and so on.\n  I have a list of projects we can talk about today. I have talked \nabout a number of projects that have been funded through the EDA over \nthe course of this debate in the last few days. I have talked about \nthem in California and Minnesota and I wish to add just a couple other \nrecent projects from across the country.\n  In California, EDA awarded $3 million to the Inland Valley \nDevelopment Agency in a county that is going through some tough times, \nSan Bernardino, to support the renovation of an existing building at \nthe former Norton Air Force Base. This project is going to help the \nconversion of that base into a commercial and light industrial area, \nattracting new companies that are interested in locating there.\n  This investment, funded by the Department of Defense Office of \nEconomic Adjustment and administered by EDA, is part of a $3.6 million \nproject that will create 100 jobs and generate $20 million in private \ninvestment.\n  So here you have a $3 million investment that is going to be \nleveraged to $20 million. It is pretty extraordinary, and this is the \nbill we are talking about.\n  In Florida, the EDA awarded nearly $4 million to construct a new \nwastewater system for western Palm Beach County. The region suffered \nflooding in 2008 from Tropical Storms Hanna and Fay, which caused \nenvironmental damage. It closed local businesses.\n  The construction is going to support three city industrial parks and \na general aviation airport, as well as a major inland port and \nintermodal center that are being developed. That investment is part of \na $5.3 million project that will create 240 jobs, save 270 jobs, and \ngenerate $48 million in private investment.\n  So a $4 million investment attracting $48 million in private \ninvestment.\n  In Idaho, we have a very good example of a $4.4 million grant to the \nCollege of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls to fund the construction of the \nApplied Technology and Innovation Center. This new LEED-certified \nfacility will help the college meet the region's needs for a higher \nskilled workforce. They will learn to operate computer-driven \nmanufacturing equipment, maintain alternative energy systems, and to \nuse environmentally sound construction processes for these green \nbuildings. This investment is part of a $6.9 million project that will \ncreate 486 jobs.\n  In Indiana, EDA provided $2.4 million; in Kansas, $1.4 million to the \ncity of Hutchinson. I will go on with this in my remaining time that I \nwill have later.\n  But the point is, this is a jobs bill, and it is being hijacked by a \nslew of amendments, and I see the handwriting on the wall. I have been \nhere long enough to know what is going on. There is no cooperation. We \nhave everything from the Snowe amendment to endangered species, dealing \nwith a chicken that somebody wants to take off the endangered species \nlist. I mean, I was not born yesterday, as you can tell. I know what is \nhappening. This is a dance. It is a slow dance. It, unfortunately, \nsignals to me maybe the slow death of this bill. I think that is very \nsad, when you have a bill that has been supported by Republican \nPresidents, Democratic Presidents over the years, and the last vote on \nthis floor was unanimous, in 2004--by unanimous consent--and George W. \nBush signed it. I have fought George W. Bush in a number of areas. He \nand I saw eye to eye on this one. This is not controversial.\n  I hope we can dispose of this amendment. I will have more to say on \nthe amendment in a couple minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Maine has the next 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is about \njobs. It is about small businesses. It is about the well-being of \nAmerican families. Just remember this: the stark numbers. The \nunemployment rate is at 9.1 percent; the average over the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, 9.4 percent. For 23 out of the last 28 months, unemployment has \nbeen at 9 percent or higher. Housing prices are at the lowest level \nsince mid-2002. This is the longest recession since modern record-\nkeeping.\n  These are stark, grim numbers. What I am hearing here today is a \nbureaucratic process and response, exactly what we are trying to \nattack. This is not indiscriminate, as some have described on the other \nside of the aisle about this regulatory reform measure. It is very \nconsistent.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana was talking about several of the \nissues. I would like to go through them.\n  First of all, she mentioned about the concerns of the judicial \nreview. But this provision is nearly identical to one that she and \nSenator Cardin introduced in their own legislation in the 111th \nCongress.\n  The Senator also was concerned with our tying budget cuts to the SBA \nto this amendment as a way of paying for some of the costs of it. But, \nto avoid controversy, we specifically selected as offsets, cuts in the \nSBA that had been proposed by the Agency's Inspector General, and in \nthe President's very own budget.\n  The Senator from Louisiana talked about the problems associated with \nconsidering indirect economic effects on small businesses when issuing \nrules. But, for that provision we used the exact same language \nsuggested by the President's chief small business regulatory appointee, \nthe chief advocate at the Small Business Administration.\n  So this is not indiscriminate and some are mischaracterizing the \nprovisions in this legislation because they have not bothered to read \nthe amendment. I made a number of changes in order to address the \nconcerns on the other side. If there were further concerns, that we \ncould work through, I would have addressed those as well. So I think we \nbetter make sure we get our facts straight because it is about small \nbusinesses and jobs. That is what it is about. We are just stalling, \ndeferring, delaying.\n  We heard concerns that we did not have a hearing on my specific \namendment. Well, the Senate did not hold a hearing on it since I was \ndenied a vote on it on May 4. And the President came out a few days \nlater and said regulatory reform was one of the top four issues for \nAmerican economic growth and job creation.\n  Then we hear a bureaucratic conversation about hearings and multiple \njurisdictions and committees and committees. I have to say, I have \nnever known amendments to require hearings before they are considered \non the floor. In fact, I believe the Senator from California had 19 \namendments in the last Congress--19 amendments--8 of which were \naccepted and none had hearings. Yesterday we had a major amendment on \ninterchange. We did not have a hearing on that major issue.\n  I am just making a point. This is just bringing up issues to \nobfuscate and obscure. I do not know exactly what the concern is, to be \nhonest with you. If there are some issues to address, then let's \naddress them. But to just postpone in conversation, debating--the talk \ngoes nowhere. There are no hearings. There is nothing.\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\n  The President scaled back regulations, as I said earlier in an effort \nto spur economic growth, including some in the Environmental Protection \nAgency. He did not undercut the Endangered Species Act. Nobody is \naccusing him of scaling back every environmental law that has ever been \non the books.\n  I think we ought to get away from extreme mischaracterizations, \ninaccuracies and untruths. Let's talk about the facts. Let's read the \nbill. Let's know what we are talking about and get our facts straight. \nThis goes to the heart of economic growth. It goes to jobs.\n  It goes to the American people's well-being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in my 5 minutes, here is what I wish to \nsay: Yes, I have offered many amendments on this floor, as have all my \ncolleagues. But if I see an amendment and colleagues see an amendment \nthat could hurt, we believe, the health of people, I am going to say, \nyes, let's have a hearing.\n  I wish to show you a picture of a child with asthma. She is \nbeautiful. This is not a pretty picture.\n  I will show you another picture of a little boy with asthma. This is \nalso a beautiful child and a terrible picture.\n  Let me tell you, we are trying to protect these children. We are \ntrying to protect our families. We are trying to stop premature deaths. \nHow do we do it? Yes, we have regulations. Have they worked? You bet \nthey have. That is why I say, if you are going to change them, yes, I \nhope we would look at--you know, everybody is motivated in the right \ndirection. Jobs? Absolutely. But I have to tell you, when you are sick, \nyou cannot go to work. If a breadwinner dies prematurely, the family is \ndestitute.\n  Let me show you just one act that would be impacted by this Snowe \namendment and why I think we ought to have an alternative amendment. If \nyou look at the study that was required by Congress, you find out that \nin just 2010 alone, the Clean Air Act prevented 160,000 cases of \npremature death; if you look at 2010 alone, 1.7 million fewer asthma \nattacks; if you look at acute heart attacks prevented, 130,000.\n  What happens in the Snowe amendment: All you are going to look at is \nthe economic benefits, not the health benefits. It flies in the face of \ncommon sense and our moral responsibility.\n  Here is what I see wrong with this amendment: It hurts protection for \nfamilies and communities. It stops or delays important protections for \nthose people. It ignores public health and safety benefits. It only \nlooks at the benefits of economics. Yes, we have to do that. But we \nalso need a balanced approach. As I said, if someone is sick and they \ncannot go to work, they cannot keep a job.\n  It would also create additional, expensive litigation. The amendment \nallows polluters to sue Federal agencies during the public comment \nperiod on a proposed Federal safeguard that allows one polluter to hold \nup an important, let's say, drinking water or clean air protection \nstandard for months, maybe years.\n  So I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. Let's get together and \ncome up with something that balances economic growth with the \nprotection of the health of our families.\n  I yield the floor and hope we would now go to a vote under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment, I hope, will save our \nbusinesses and our States the millions of dollars they are now spending \nto implement the health care reform bill, which is in the courts.\n  Yesterday, the court in Atlanta--the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals--heard arguments from the government and the State about \nwhether the Florida District Court ruling that the health care law is \nnull and void because it is unconstitutional should be upheld. Since we \nare in this court fight and this will surely go to the Supreme Court--\nthere is no doubt that either side that loses is going to appeal--my \namendment would put a moratorium on the implementation of the law. So \nit would save the Federal Government and the taxpayers who are paying \nfor it, and it would save the State governments that are trying to \nimplement a law that may be unconstitutional and cost millions of \ndollars to adjust their system and the businesses across our country \nthat are trying desperately to determine if they are going to be able \nto even offer health insurance or if they want to offer health \ninsurance to their employees anymore.\n  We are in a time when there are unprecedented regulatory burdens on \nour businesses. We are facing a $14 trillion national debt in this \ncountry--trillion. We are looking at having to raise that debt limit if \nwe don't severely cut spending and get our house in order.\n  In the past 2 years alone, this Federal Government has borrowed an \nadditional $3.2 trillion. Washington passed a health care reform bill \nthat cost nearly $2.6 trillion and a stimulus bill that cost $821 \nbillion, which has only given us higher unemployment since the stimulus \nbill passed. The U.S. economy is frozen, job creators are facing new \nlevels of taxes, they are looking at this health insurance cost going \nup and, on top of that, new regulations.\n  Heavyhanded government regulation is not what we need right now. The \nhealth care reform bill is a perfect example of government regulations \nhamstringing our businesses with more redtape and bureaucracy. It has \nbeen over a year since that bill was passed, and businesses are still \nfacing unprecedented premium increases--as high as 20 percent. \nEmployers are finding their policies being canceled because insurers \nare closing up shop due to new Federal regulations. Health care reform \nis requiring individuals and businesses to buy government-approved \nhealth care or they pay hefty fines. Health reform has discouraged \nbusinesses from hiring, because if you go over 50 employees, new \nFederal regulations that will be imposed on you are going to be costly.\n  A new study out this week confirms that health reform will not let \nyou keep your health plan, as promised. This report found that when \nbusinesses fully understand all the new regulations required under \nhealth reform, as many as half of them say they will definitely or \nprobably stop offering health insurance benefits to their employees. \nThat would leave as many as 78 million Americans on their own to find \nhealth insurance for themselves and their families.\n  That is why I have filed amendment No. 423--to delay further \nimplementation of health reform until the courts determine whether it \nis constitutional. My amendment would pause further implementation of \nthis law so we don't spend millions more taxpayer dollars at the \nFederal and State levels, costing small businesses as well, when it \ncould be struck down.\n  Twenty-six States have joined together to sue the Federal Government, \nand a Florida district court found in favor of these 26 States, saying \nCongress had overstepped and overreached its authority and that \nmandating individuals to purchase health insurance was \nunconstitutional. The 11th Circuit Court, as I said earlier, is \nconsidering this case as we speak and we should not burden any further \nbusinesses, States and taxpayers who support the Federal Government \nuntil we know if this law is constitutional. Let us put in place a \nmoratorium, a pause, so that no one gets penalized for not continuing \nthe implementation process. That is what my amendment would do. Let's \nclarify, and then, if the law is constitutional, there is plenty of \ntime to go forward. But if it isn't, as I hope is the case, we will be \nable to start all over. We would make health care more available and \nmore affordable in this country without cutting Medicare, overburdening \nour taxpayers and businesses, and maybe even get our economy going and \nstop this rising unemployment we are seeing in our country right now. \nNine percent unemployment is too high, and health care reform is a part \nof the problem that is causing it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 417 and 418 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, today we are considering a bill intended \nto promote economic development, and I think it is only appropriate we \nalso talk about regulations, because, unfortunately, regulatory \nmandates are stifling economic growth today and keeping us from \ncreating the jobs we so badly need.\n  I hear it all over my State, and I am sure my colleagues do as well. \nCompanies are saying they want to expand. They say: We have a good \nidea, we have a business plan that works, but we are deterred by the \ncost of complying with regulations. It is the redtape and also the \nuncertainty. It is not just the bureaucracy and redtape, it is the \nuncertainty about future regulations.\n  This regulatory burden on employers, by the way, is growing, and it \nis already a mess. There is a recent study commissioned by the Small \nBusiness Administration and the Obama administration which estimates \nthe annual toll now of Federal regulations on the American economy is \n$1.75 trillion. That is more than the IRS collects in income taxes in a \nyear. With the unemployment rate now at 9.1 percent, we can't continue \nto ask businesses to spend more on redtape. Instead, we want them to \ninvest in job creation.\n  The current administration, unfortunately, I believe, is moving in \nthe wrong direction on this score. We have seen a sharp increase over \nthe past couple of years in new ``major'' or ``economically \nsignificant'' rules. These are regulations that impose a cost on the \neconomy of $100 million or more.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, the Obama \nadministration has been regulating at a pace of 84 of these new \n``major'' or ``economically significant'' rules--costing the economy \nover $100 million--per year, including rules issued by independent \nagencies. By the way, that is about a 50-percent increase over the \nregulatory output during the Clinton administration, which was about 56 \nmajor rules per year.\n  I was very encouraged by the words of President Obama as he \nintroduced his January Executive order on improving regulation and \nregulatory review, but now we need action. We need to be sure the \nagencies are actually taking the measures necessary to provide \nregulatory relief for job creators and reducing this drag on our \neconomy.\n  One commonsense step we can take now is to strengthen a piece of \nlegislation that is already in place. It is called the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act. It was passed by Congress and signed into law by \nPresident Clinton in 1995. It was bipartisan legislation. I was one of \nthe authors of this legislation in the House of Representatives. UMRA, \nas it is called--Unfunded Mandates Reform Act--was a bipartisan effort \nbasically to say that regulators had to evaluate a rule's cost and find \nless costly alternatives before adopting one of these so-called \n``major'' rules.\n  The two amendments I am offering today would improve UMRA in a way \nthat is entirely consistent with the principles President Obama himself \nlaid out in his January Executive order on regulatory review. The first \namendment, 418, would require agencies specifically to assess the \npotential effects of new regulations on job creation and to consider \nmarket-based and nongovernmental alternatives to the regulation. It \nwould also broaden the scope of UMRA to require cost-benefit analysis \nof rules that impose direct or indirect economic costs of $100 million \nor more. It would require agencies to\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\nadopt the least costly or least burdensome regulatory option that \nachieves the policy goal set out by this Congress. A commonsense idea.\n  The second amendment, 417, would extend UMRA to independent agencies. \nIn 1995, it was imposed upon the executive agencies but not on \nindependent agencies. Those independent agencies have grown, and so \nhave their regulations. This would be an agency such as the SEC--the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission--or the CFTC or even the new \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has gotten a lot of \nattention here in the Senate in the debate over the Dodd-Frank Act. \nRight now they are exempted from the cost-benefit rules that govern all \nthese other Federal agencies.\n  Major rules issued by what is called the ``headless fourth branch'' \nof government are not even reviewed for cost-benefit justification by \nOIRA, which is the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at OMB \nwhich reviews regulations from all the other agencies.\n  Based on information from the GAO, it now appears that between 1996 \nand this year independent agencies issued nearly 200 regulations that \nhad an impact of $100 million or more on the economy. So again, over \n200 regulations were not subject to review under UMRA because they were \nfrom independent agencies. There is a clear need to extend UMRA to \nthese independent agencies. Closing this loophole is a sensible reform.\n  By the way, this reform was endorsed by the President's own \nregulatory czar, Professor Cass Sunstein, who wrote in a 2002 law \nreview article that it only made sense to require independent agencies \nto undertake the same cost-benefit analysis that we require of \nexecutive agencies.\n  No major regulation, whatever its source, should be imposed on \nAmerican employees or on State and local governments without serious \nconsideration of what the costs are, what the benefits are, and whether \nthere is available a less burdensome alternative. That is what these \namendments are all about. Both would move us further toward that goal, \nand I urge my colleagues to support them both.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 428\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to speak to amendment No. 428 on \nthe regulation of mortgage servicing. We spend a lot of time in \nWashington talking about many topics but often not getting to the issue \nmost important to American citizens; that is, getting them back to \nwork, creating jobs. Creating jobs should be the paramount concern of \nevery person in this town. We are not going to get job growth going \nagain until we deal with the housing crisis that started this recession \nand that is blocking our recovery.\n  Three years ago, our economy was nearly destroyed by a combination of \nhigh-risk, high-cost subprime mortgages and reckless bets on Wall \nStreet. Since then we fixed many of those problems in subprime \nmortgages. We have ended three of the key predatory practices. One of \nthose was undocumented loans, otherwise known, commonly, as ``liar \nloans,'' where the information was fictionalized.\n  Then we had the prepayment penalty. It was a steel trap in which a \nmortgage document would lock people into a loan with an exploding \ninterest rate and would prevent them from being able to get out of that \nloan. We knew from a Wall Street Journal study that 60 percent of the \nfamilies in these predatory loans with the steel trap prepayment \npenalties qualified for regular, ordinary, fully amortizing 30-year \nprime loans.\n  That leads us to the third point, which was the undisclosed bonuses, \notherwise known as steering payments or kickbacks, that were paid to \nmortgage originators when they steered families from the prime loan \nwith a fair interest rate and 30-year amortization into the predatory \nsubprime loan with an exploding interest rate and a steel trap \nprepayment penalty.\n  It is good that we ended those practices for the future. But for the \nfamilies who have been caught up in the flood of foreclosures, it is as \nthough we rebuilt the levees but we have not done anything to take away \nthe water that is still flooding their living rooms.\n  Just last week, new reports, the Case-Shiller Index, showed that home \nprices have reached their lowest level since 2002. If home prices are \nthat low, it is also hard to build new homes. Indeed, a recent report \nsaid the number of new homes being built each month had reached the \nlowest level since 1965--that is almost 50 years ago. Simply, our \neconomy is not going to recover until our housing market recovers. A \nhome is the single biggest investment that most families make, and it \nis the key to their financial success. It is often the key to happiness \nin retirement.\n  In addition to the impact on millions of families--and we are looking \nat the possibility of 5 to 8 million more families facing foreclosure \nstemming from this predatory lending crisis that melted down our \neconomy in 2008 and 2009--in addition to the impact on those families, \nit has an impact on our communities. When there is an empty house on \nthe street, it pulls down the value of every other home on that street \nby as much as $2,000 to $5,000 per home. That further drives down \nprices, which means more foreclosures, more families underwater, less \nconfidence in the recovery, more inclination to hold onto every dollar \nrather than to spend in our economy, so the consumer spending is \nsuppressed and our GDP is directly linked, both to the amount of money \ninvested--and we know many companies around America are sitting on vast \nsums rather than investing them--and on the amount of money families \nspend.\n  These things all tie together, whether our economy is going to \nsucceed or remain in its current paralyzed shape. Often it is important \nto take these big numbers and translate them to individual stories. I \nwould like to share today a story about Tim Colette and his son in my \nState of Oregon. We received this article from Economic Fairness \nOregon. It is titled, ``A Homecoming With No Home.'' I will read the \nfirst paragraph. Mr. Colette says:\n\n       My biggest problem now is, my son comes home from the \n     military in August and my home is being foreclosed on in 18 \n     days. He's been hit by an IED, people shooting at him and he \n     just wanted to come home and sleep in his room in his bed and \n     be safe for 15 days . . . and I told him I'd make that \n     happen. I don't know how yet, but I will.\n\n  Mr. Colette shared his story with Oregon lawmakers in a recent \nhearing on foreclosure reform, and I thank him for sharing his story. \nFor Tim and countless others, it did not need to be this bad. We have a \nprogram in America called the Mortgage Modification Program, or HAMP, \nHousing Affordable Modification Program. That program has not worked \nvery well. Indeed, it is a voluntary program. It has been more or less \na nightmare for the families who have been applying.\n  Often a servicer will encourage families to apply because they make \nmore money when a family is behind on their payments than when they are \ncurrent on their payments. So often the servicer will say: You know, \nyou probably qualify. What you need to do is stop making your payments \nfor a period of 3 months or maybe 6 months or what you need to do is \ncut your payments in half and that will show financial distress and you \nwill qualify for this program.\n  So the family follows those directions, understands they are in the \nprocess of getting a modification, and then it turns out the servicer \nhas a different story to tell, often saying: You know what. Your credit \nscore is not very good because you have only been making half payments \nfor 6 months. So, you know what, you don't qualify after all, and you \nowe us a lot of money. If you do not pay us, we are foreclosing.\n  That is the nightmare of a program that was supposed to help families \nbut has often hurt families. Mr. Colette's story is one of these \nstories of going through the difficulty of this program. He bought his \nhome in 2006. At the time it seemed like a great investment for him and \nhis son, especially considering that he was in a position to put down \nmore than $100,000 as a downpayment. It is a situation that very few\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\nfamilies can emulate. He was able to afford his mortgage payments quite \neasily within his income.\n  But when Wall Street's bad bets sparked the national recession, \neverything changed. He lives in one of the hardest hit areas of the \nState of Oregon, Deschutes County, and the construction industry dried \nup overnight and therefore his business, his construction business, \ndried up overnight. He called his mortgage servicer to begin the \nmortgage modification process, and he did what the bank asked him to.\n  At the time the bank extracted partial payments, actually for years, \non the false hope that Tim could receive a long-term fix. So month \nafter month his equity, that original $100,000 downpayment, was \nsiphoned away. It was siphoned away through bank fees, it was siphoned \naway through declining property values, until there was nothing left.\n  Had his request for a modification been processed promptly, either he \nwould have been approved or denied. If he would have been approved, it \nwould have been great. It would have locked in his payments, and he \ncould have continued with that fine financial foundation. If he had \nbeen denied, he would have had the ability to say: I have to make a \ndecision then. Do I put this home up for a short sale? Do I put it up \non the market and try to sell it for what is owed to the bank? He would \nhave had some savings left over to pick up and start over.\n  Tim did all that was right and he played by the rules, but he is in a \nprecarious position today. In just 9 weeks, his son, serving our \ncountry overseas, will come home. Let's hope it is a homecoming with a \nhome, not a homecoming without a home.\n  This amendment does three important things: The first is, it \nestablishes a single point of contact so when a family talks to their \nservicer they do not have to start from scratch every single time, \nexplaining their story. With that single point of contact there will be \nsomebody who has a coherent file. So often, each time a family talked \nto a different person at the servicer, that person had lost the file or \nlost key papers in the file or was sent additional information that had \nbeen requested but did not put it into the file. So a single coherent \npoint of contact.\n  Second, this amendment ends the dual track on which servicers proceed \nto pursue foreclosure at the same time they are talking to the customer \nabout a modification. Very simply, this amendment would set aside that \ndual track, that foreclosure track, until they make a decision. They \ncan make it over a longer period of time, over a shorter period of \ntime, but until they make the decision and tell the customer, they set \naside the foreclosure track. That would reduce a lot of the stress, a \nlot of the confusion, a lot of the enormous frustration that families \nface.\n  The third point in this amendment is that it requires a third-party \nreview before a servicer sends a home into foreclosure. That simply \nguarantees that the law has been followed, that there was a coherent \nexamination of the paperwork and a foreclosure is in order at the same \ntime a modification has been approved or a foreclosure is in order at \nthe same time a modification is on the verge of being approved or that \na foreclosure doesn't proceed because a document is missing from the \nfile. Connecticut and Maine have such a program, and it has kept 60 \npercent of the families who would otherwise be out of their houses in \ntheir houses. So three basic, fundamental reforms.\n\n  I wish to thank my Republican cosponsor, Olympia Snowe, who stepped \nforward on behalf of homeowners across this Nation to say yes to \nfairness. I also thank the other dozen or so Senators who in the last \nday have signed up as cosponsors. Many of them have been real champions \nin their States, and some of them have worked very hard on these \nissues, including Senator Reid and Senator Whitehouse. In fact, I would \nnote that Senators Akaka, Blumenthal, Durbin, Inouye, Levin, McCaskill, \nSanders, Shaheen, Whitehouse, and Wyden, and I imagine many more will \njoin us.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support fundamental fairness: single \npoint of contact and a foreclosure dual track and have a third-party \nreview so that homeowners get a chance, like Mr. Colette, to stay in \ntheir homes.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 411 and 412 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendments Nos. 411 and 412.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I still ask unanimous consent to call up \nboth amendments. It is my understanding amendments are allowed, but if \nthere are some amendments that are not allowed, I think we ought to \nunderstand that. I understand the strength of the ethanol lobby, but \nthere was an agreement that amendments would be allowed to be called \nup. If that is not the case, then I would obviously have to resort to \nother parliamentary measures.\n  So I repeat my unanimous consent request to set aside the pending \namendment and call up both amendments, Nos. 411 and 412.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes amendments \n     en bloc numbered 411 and 412.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 411\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of Federal funds to construct ethanol \n              blender pumps or ethanol storage facilities)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT \n                   ETHANOL BLENDER PUMPS OR ETHANOL STORAGE \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       Effective beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     no funds made available by Federal law (including funds in \n     any trust fund to which funds are made by Federal law) shall \n     be expended for the construction of an ethanol blender pump \n     or an ethanol storage facility.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 412\n\n       (Purpose: To repeal the wage rate requirements commonly \n     known as the Davis-Bacon Act)\n       On page _, between lines _ and _, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPEAL OF DAVIS-BACON WAGE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, \n     United States Code, is repealed.\n       (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law to a wage \n     requirement of subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, \n     United States Code, shall after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act be null and void.\n       (c) Effective Date and Limitation.--The amendments made by \n     this section shall not affect any contract in existence on \n     the date of enactment of this Act or made pursuant to \n     invitation for bids outstanding on such date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will be brief in discussing both of \nthe amendments.\n  The first amendment, amendment No. 411, is a simple amendment that \nwould prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from funding the \nconstruction of ethanol blender pumps or ethanol storage facilities, \nwhich is the latest effort on the part of the ethanol lobby to take \nmore and more of U.S. taxpayers' dollars.\n  I would remind my colleagues that taxpayers have already provided \nbillions of dollars to ethanol producers over the last 30 years. Last \nyear alone, the ethanol tax credit cost the taxpayers $6 billion. In \nthe final hours of the last Congress, the ethanol tax credit was \nextended for an additional year and will likely cost taxpayers an \nadditional $5 billion to $6 billion this year. Seeking to double-dip in \nthe Federal Treasury, advocates for the ethanol industry are seeking \ntaxpayer support for infrastructure for ethanol such as blender pumps \nand storage facilities.\n  The Department of Agriculture was happy to comply with the industry's \nrequest to fund infrastructure construction. On April 8, 2001, the \nSecretary of Agriculture issued a rule that--get this--would classify \nblender pumps as a renewable energy system. In other words, pumps are \nnow a renewable energy system, which would qualify it for funding under \nthe Rural Energy Assistance Program.\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\n  There is no one--no one--who believed the Rural Energy Assistance \nProgram would apply to putting ethanol pumps and storage facilities in \ngas stations. When Congress created the Rural Energy Assistance \nProgram, it didn't have any intention of paying gas station owners to \nupgrade their infrastructure and further subsidize the ethanol \nindustry.\n  According to the USDA, an ethanol blender pump and tank could cost an \naverage of $100,000 to $120,000 to install. With over 200,000 fuel \npumps currently operating in the United States, it would cost over $20 \nbillion to convert them all--a corporate welfare project of significant \nproportions.\n  I might point out that an amendment similar to this was \noverwhelmingly supported in the other body during the consideration of \nH.R. 1 by a vote of 261 to 158.\n  It is time we stop this. I am a well-known opponent of ethanol \nsubsidies to start with because it has never been of any value. It has \ndistorted the market, and it has been an incredible waste of taxpayers' \ndollars. But now they want to go further by having us pay as much as \n$20 billion so they can install, under the Rural Energy Assistance \nProgram, blender pumps and storage facilities.\n  So the ethanol advocates today have issued a release opposing this \namendment because it would enforce the foreign oil mandate over our \ntransportation fuels marketplace by blocking a job-creating effort to \npromote the installation of flex pumps. So now this is all about jobs. \nWe want to create jobs by spending taxpayers' dollars to build pumps.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at this and support this \namendment.\n  The other amendment, amendment No. 412, basically eliminates Davis-\nBacon requirements from this legislation. The issue of Davis-Bacon is \nwell known. All it would do is, in my view, reduce costs by some 60 \npercent from market rates if we are indeed not imposing Davis-Bacon Act \nrequirements.\n  While I am on the floor, I wish to mention to my colleagues that as \nwe face increasing costs at the gas pump of $4 or more--there are \npredictions that the cost of gasoline and a barrel of oil will continue \nto increase--this administration continues to reject nuclear power in \nevery possible way.\n  Yesterday, a House committee released the latest evidence detailing \nthe administration's mishandling of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste \nrepository, providing further examples of this administration's \nblatantly political decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain project \nand close the facility.\n  I quote from the committee report:\n\n       Despite the President's continued assertions that his \n     nuclear waste management policy decisions would be driven by \n     sound science, the administration has repeatedly refused to \n     provide a scientific or technical justification for its \n     shutdown decision, instead simply stating that Yucca is not a \n     workable option.\n\n  This coincides with an April 2011 GAO study that reported:\n\n       DOE decided to terminate the Yucca Mountain repository \n     program because, according to the Department of Energy \n     officials, it is not a workable option and there are better \n     solutions that can achieve a broader national consensus. DOE \n     did not cite technical or safety issues.\n\n  There is a simple reason that neither Department of Energy Secretary \nChu nor any other member of the administration has put forth a single \nscientific justification on the decision not to move forward with Yucca \nMountain--because there is none.\n  When the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board rejected the \nDepartment of Energy's request to withdraw the license application, it \nnoted:\n\n       Conceding that the Application is not flawed nor the site \n     unsafe, the Secretary of Energy seeks to withdraw the \n     Application with prejudice as a ``matter of policy'' because \n     the Nevada site ``is not a workable option.''\n\n  In fact, according to the House report, the NRC staff review of DOE's \nYucca Mountain license application agreed overwhelmingly with the \nDepartment of Energy on the scientific and technical issues associated \nwith the site, ultimately concluding that the application complies with \napplicable Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety regulations necessary \nfor the site to proceed to licensing for construction.\n  The political interference orchestrated by the administration comes \nwith a very real cost. As of 2010, the taxpayers have spent $15 billion \nto research and develop the Yucca Mountain site.\n  In addition, even while the administration is attempting to terminate \nthe place, the energy industry and therefore the ratepayers are still \ncontributing to the Nuclear Waste Fund that was established to pay for \na nuclear waste repository. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Nuclear Waste Fund is holding over $25 billion of \nratepayers' money. To date, no one has stated whether the energy \nindustry or the ratepayers will be refunded those fees, and it is \nlikely the taxpayer will end up footing the bill for the lawsuits filed \nagainst the Federal Government by those who have been unfairly charged.\n  The need for a permanent waste repository remains clear. In fact, a \ndraft subcommittee report from the President's blue ribbon commission \non nuclear waste stated that ``permanent disposal of nuclear waste is \nneeded under all reasonably foreseeable scenarios'' and that ``we do \nnot believe that new technology developments in the next three to four \ndecades will change the underlying need for a storage strategy \ncombining interim sites with progress toward a permanent facility,'' \nthereby completely refuting statements by the administration that \ntechnology and temporary storage sites are a sufficient replacement for \npermanent disposal. In fact, the administration and the Secretary of \nEnergy himself have publicly stated that our most promising technology \nto lessen the burden of storage--waste reprocessing--is not even being \nconsidered as a viable option for addressing waste-storage needs. \nUnfortunately, it has been reported that members of the commission have \nbeen told that under no circumstances are they allowed to recommend \nYucca Mountain as a permanent waste repository--regardless of where the \nscientific evidence leads them.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, the termination of \nYucca Mountain would set back the opening of a new geologic repository \nby at least 20 years and cost billions of dollars. Of course, these \nbillions would be in addition to the $15 billion taxpayers have already \nspent to research and develop the Yucca Mountain site. It is really a \nsad day when we allow politics or political influence to cause us to \nallow at least $15 billion of the taxpayers' money to be wasted and to \nreally doom, to a large degree, the future of nuclear power in this \ncountry.\n  We need to have energy self-sufficiency. I believe in wind. I believe \nin tide. I believe in solar. But nuclear power must be a part of any \nequation if we are going to be truly energy independent. And by closing \nYucca Mountain and by wasting already $15 billion of the taxpayers' \nmoney, we have made that goal much, much harder to reach.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 440\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 436, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to discuss for a minute the \nmodification to my amendment.\n  Corn prices today are at their highest level since 1974. Corn supply \nis at its lowest level since 1974. We have tremendous problems with \nfood inflation in this country. What we put forward this afternoon is a \nmodification to the blending tax credit, as well as the import tax fee \non ethanol, and we look\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\nforward to that debate as we go forward.\n  The Federal Government now spends $6 billion a year paying over 40 \ncents a gallon to have ethanol blended, which is already mandated by \nlaw that they have to blend it anyway. So this, in essence, will save \n$3 billion this year for the Federal Government.\n  No. 2 is, it will take significant pressure off corn prices, which \nwill lower food prices both here and abroad.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma, who wishes to speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment for consideration of the following three amendments: \nNos. 429, 430, and 438.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I reserve the right to object.\n  I ask the Senator if he can hold off for a moment. We wish to consult \nwith the chairwoman.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. While I am holding off, it is my understanding \nthat some of the rest of them are getting in the queue, and I am trying \nto get these three in with the same treatment that has been afforded \nthose before me.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 430 and 438\n\n  Madam President, I amend my previous request and ask unanimous \nconsent to set the pending amendment aside for the consideration of two \nof the amendments, Nos. 430 and 438.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 430.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To reduce amounts authorized to be appropriated)\n\n       On page 27, line 6, strike ``$500,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$300,000,000''.\n\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself, Mr. \n     Blunt, Mr. Johanns, and Mr. Cochran, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 438.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask by unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business, which I know the Chair will \nhonor.\n  However, I want to mention one of these two amendments. I think it is \nvery significant. It is somewhat similar, I think, to the amendment \noffered by the senior Senator from Maine. What it has to do with is \nthese various regulations, and actually most of these are coming from \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  One of the serious problems we have in the committee on which I am \nthe ranking member, the Environment and Public Works Committee--that is \nchaired by Senator Boxer from California--we have oversight over the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and we have been watching what has \nbeen happening in the last several months. Many of the things they have \nbeen trying to get through, they have been unable to get through \nlegislation here on the floor of this Senate, so they are trying to do \nthe very things they are unable to get done through legislation by \nregulation. And these are very expensive.\n  Right now, we have a problem with our economy. We have overregulation \nthat is killing a lot of the businesses that are out there. What I am \ntrying to do is an amendment--and that is what amendment No. 438 is--to \nget it into the Record. The bill sets up a committee to assess the \neffects of the EPA's regulatory mandates, including key provisions of \nthe Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Solid Waste Disposal \nAct. This would include greenhouse gas regulations, Boiler MACT, \nUtility MACT, ozone and particulate matter standards, coal ash \ndisposal, and water discharge requirements.\n  The assessment includes an evaluation of the cumulative effects of \nthe EPA's mandates on employment, economic development, and this type \nof thing.\n  It does not otherwise modify or affect the statute. The reason I wish \nto have this in here is we have now quantified what it is costing the \nAmerican people in terms of employment, in terms of dollars, and just--\ngreenhouse gas, for example. We know that the costs, if they do \nanything like the cap and trade that they have tried to do through \nlegislation--and that is exactly what they are attempting to do right \nnow through regulations at the EPA--are somewhere between $300 and $400 \nbillion of loss in GDP per year. That is every year.\n  You can call that a tax increase if you want to because that is \nexactly what it is, the same as a loss in GDP. In my case, in Oklahoma, \nbecause it is confusing when we--and this administration has been \ntalking about hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars. Nobody \ntruly has a handle on what it costs.\n  I keep track as to how many families file tax returns. In my State of \nOklahoma, if you take the number of families who file tax returns and \ndivide it and do the math, that would be somewhere around a little over \n$3,000 per family if we were to pass a cap-and-trade regulation.\n  What is wrong with this? A lot of people are out there saying: \nInhofe, you have been wrong all this time. Since you are wrong on the--\nyou may be wrong or what if you are wrong. My response is this: We have \na very fine Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa \nJackson. I can remember talking to her about what would happen if we \nwere to pass any of these bills where we are going back to maybe the \nWarner-Lieberman bill or Waxman-Markey bill or even by regulations, cap \nand trade, the costs would be excessive.\n  However, my question to her was: If we were successful in doing this, \nwould this reduce the greenhouse gases? The answer was no. The reason \nit would not is because it only applies to the United States of \nAmerica. So if we were going to pass a tax increase on every tax-paying \nfamily in my State of Oklahoma of $3,000 a year, and they admit we are \nnot going to get anything for it, then we need to stop them from doing \nthat.\n  I could do the same thing about the ozone, the National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards. That would be $676.8 billion lost in GDP by 2020; \nthe boiler MACT rules and regulations, some $1 billion lost in GDP; \nutility MACT, $184 billion in compliance costs. That is just between \nthe years of 2011 and 2030; the cement MACT, some $3.5 billion.\n  I am saying this because we need to have our eyes open and tell the \nAmerican people what the cost is of all these things. This will be done \nby this amendment, No. 438, and we will hopefully be able to get a vote \non that.\n\n\n                             Cote d'Ivoire\n\n  Madam President, I am going to take a little time on something else \nthat has to be said, and that is what I have been on the floor six \ntimes already talking about. The only reason I am continuing to do this \nis because somehow the State Department, the French, the United \nNations, and all of them seem to be laboring under this misconception \nthat I will go away and I will not talk about it anymore.\n  I am not going to go away. I am going to keep talking about it. The \nproblem we have right now started some time ago. I will share with you \nsome of the new developments today.\n  We are talking about the rigged election that took place in Cote \nd'Ivoire and the fact that someone whose name is Alassane Ouattara--we \nhave demonstrated very clearly--won the election by fraudulent means.\n  The President of that country is Laurent Gbagbo. He has been \nPresident now for a number of years. His wife, Simone Gbagbo, has been \na gracious and great First Lady.\n  What I wish to do--this is the seventh time I have been on the floor \ntalking about this--is give you the latest on this grave situation in \nCote d'Ivoire. I can only say it continues to be a targeted genocide \nagainst supporters and perceived supporters of the deposed President of \nLaurent Gbagbo.\n  This will be, as I said, my seventh time speaking about this on the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\nThe last time we talked about it was on April 4. When we first started \ntalking about this, we were hoping we would be able to stop this, the \nState Department and others from going along with what is going on now \nin Cote d'Ivoire. I know it is complicated. A lot of people do not \nremember the genocide in Rwanda of 1994. Now we look back and say what \na horrible event that was. Sure, it was horrible.\n  But right now what is going on in the streets of Abidjan in Cote \nd'Ivoire is something that has to be raised to the surface in front of \nthe American people. I have new information that proves what I have \nbeen saying for the last 7 weeks, that the rebel leader Alassane \nOuattara is still carrying out death squads, killing people in the \nstreets of Abidjan in Cote d'Ivoire. There they are. That is a death \nsquad. These are the people who are murdering and torturing people in \nAbidjan as we speak.\n  I bet there are not a handful of people who even know where Abidjan \nis. But this is the city, the capital of Cote d'Ivoire, a beautiful \ncountry. These people, coming in from the north, under this Alassane \nOuattara, are in there today. I do not know how many hundreds of people \nthey are murdering just today, but they are doing it and they are \ntorturing and they are raping.\n  Before I tell you the most recent information that came out from \nHuman Rights Watch, I wish to remind you of what I said back on the May \n27. That was when Amnesty International reported that a manhunt--I am \nquoting now from Amnesty International--they reported that ``a \nmanhunt''--what I said right here from this podium. ``A manhunt was \nlaunched against Gbagbo loyalists in Abidjan and several senior \nofficials close to him were beaten in the hours after his arrest.''\n  That was 2 weeks ago. I am further quoting now from Amnesty \nInternational. ``In the west of the country, thousands of people who \nfled their homes are still living in the forest, too frightened to \nreturn.''\n  Look at this. There are the burned, charred bodies of people who have \nbeen tortured to death. This just happened. This is going on today, \nright now. Here is a man who was severely beaten. He died right after \nthat. Here is a small child who was put to death in the same way. Here \nthey are in the middle of executions. That is going on right now.\n  Gaetan Mootoo, who is Amnesty International's west Africa researcher, \nsaid:\n\n       Human rights violations are still being committed against \n     real or perceived supporters of Laurent Gbagbo. Alassane \n     Ouattara's failure to condemn these acts can be seen as a \n     green light by many of his security forces, and other armed \n     elements fighting with them, to continue. Ouattara must \n     publicly state that all violence against the civilian \n     population must stop immediately.\n\n  That is what the mandate was 2 weeks ago. That is what they were \nsupposed to do 2 weeks ago. They went on to say from Amnesty \nInternational:\n\n       Attacks against villages inhabited by people belonging to \n     ethnic groups considered supporters of Gbagbo--\n\n  The legitimate President--\n\n     continued in the first weeks of May. . . . Between 6 and 8 \n     May several villages were burned and dozens killed. \n     Ouattara's republican forces justified these acts by saying \n     they were looking for arms and Liberian mercenaries.\n\n  They went on to describe this. There is an article in Guardian \nmagazine that talked about this. This, again, was a little over 2 weeks \nago. They said ``an Amnesty delegation spent 2 months in Ivory Coast, \ngathering more than 100 witness statements from people who survived the \nmassacre in Duekoue. . . . ''\n  That is what this actually is in that small town of Duekoue and the \nneighboring villages on March 29.\n\n       All the statements indicated a systematic and targeted \n     series of killings committed by the uniformed republican \n     forces [loyal to Ouattara], who executed hundreds of men on \n     political and ethnic grounds.\n       Before killing them, they asked their victims to give their \n     names, show identity cards. . . . Some of these cards were \n     found beside the bodies.\n       A woman who lived in Duekoue told researchers: ``They came \n     into the yards and chased the women. Then they told the men \n     to line up and asked them to state their first and second \n     names and show their identity cards. They then executed them. \n     I was present--\n\n  Quoting a woman who was watching her husband--\n\n     while they sorted out the men. Three young men, one of whom \n     was about 15, were shot to death in front of me.''\n       Amnesty's report also accuses the UN mission, which has a \n     base less than a mile from Duekoue, of fatal inertia.\n\n  ``Fatal inertia,'' means they did nothing. They let this go on. We \nare talking about the United Nations.\n  People around here--there are a lot of liberals in this body who do \nnot think that anything is worthwhile unless it comes from some big \nbody such as the United Nations. That is what is happening right now. \nSo I wish to go ahead--I know there is someone else on the floor who \nwants to speak, but I just want to be sure we are informed that what \nwas going on then--what I talked about 2 weeks ago--is still happening \ntoday.\n  What happened today? The newly released report by Human Rights Watch \nstates--this is a different group from Amnesty International and this \ncame out today:\n\n       Armed forces loyal to President Alassane Ouattara have \n     killed at least 149 real or perceived supporters of \n     the former President Laurent Gbagbo since taking control \n     of the commercial capital of Abidjan in mid-April, 2011.\n\n  The report goes on to describe the gruesome details, barbaric \nepisodes of torture and the deaths at the hands of the Ouattara forces. \nThis is happening today--right now. Here are a few examples. This is \nfrom Human Rights Watch.\n\n       Ouattara's Forces . . . sealed off and searched areas \n     formerly controlled by pro-Gbagbo militia . . . and the \n     majority of documented abuses occurred in the longtime pro-\n     Gbagbo stronghold of Yopougon.\n\n  That is the town in that stronghold in the south part of the--you \nhave to keep in mind Ouattara's forces came from the Muslim area up \nnorth.\n\n       Most killings were point-blank executions--\n\n  You are seeing a point-blank execution. That is what it looks like \nright there, the gun to the head.\n\n       Most killings were point-blank executions of youth from \n     ethnic groups generally aligned with Gbagbo, in what appeared \n     to be collective punishment for these groups' participation \n     in Gbagbo's militias.\n       One man described how Republican Forces soldiers killed his \n     21-year-old brother: ``Two of them grabbed his legs, another \n     two held his arms behind him, and a fifth one held his \n     head,'' he said. ``Then a guy pulled out a knife and slit my \n     brother's throat. He was screaming. I saw his legs shaking \n     after they'd slit his throat, the blood streaming down. As \n     they were doing it, they said they had to eliminate all of \n     the [Young] Patriots that had caused all the problems in the \n     country.''\n\n  During the raid in Abidjan, the forces, the UN forces, the French and \nOuattara, they went in--and it happens that the seated President, \nPresident Gbagbo, had not a lot of armaments, but he had a whole lot of \nyoung people. They were armed not with weapons but with baseball bats, \nwith wooden clubs, and they surrounded the palace to try to protect \nhim, knowing they would kill their President. This is where they are \ntoday. These are the young kids. That is in a gas station up here. They \nare all lined up there. They are executing some of them, starving, \nbeating the rest of them. But look at that. There are the pictures of \nwhat is going on.\n  These young patriots were young supporters to President Gbagbo, who \nsurrounded his palace in a human chain, armed with just sticks and bats \nagainst the UN and French attack helicopters, which were bombing \nGbagbo's residence, now being searched out by Ouattara's forces for \ntorture and death.\n  The report goes on. This report came out today.\n\n       Another woman who witnessed the killing of 18 youths . . . \n     was brutally raped by a Republican Forces soldier after being \n     forced to load their vehicles with pillaged goods. On May 23, \n     an elderly man in the same neighborhood saw Republican Forces \n     execute his son, whom they accused of being a member of the \n     pro-Gbagbo militia.\n       Another witness described seeing the Republican Forces slit \n     the throat of a youth in front of his father after finding an \n     AK-47 and grenade in his bedroom during a 4 a.m. house-to-\n     house search. The witness was stripped and forced to hand \n     over his laptop computer, cell phones, and money.\n\n  And was murdered.\n\n       Human Rights Watch documented similar pillaging of scores \n     of houses in Abidjan.\n\n  By the way, I personally talked to these people in Abidjan who \nwitnessed this going on.\n\n       The witness, like many others interviewed by Human Rights \n     Watch, wanted to flee\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\n     Abidjan to his family village, but had no money for \n     transportation since the Republican Forces had taken \n     everything.\n       Human Rights Watch says it documented 54 extrajudicial \n     executions at detention sites, including police stations and \n     the GESCO oil--\n\n  That is the station we just now saw. Those were the executions of the \nyoung kids taking place.\n\n       In addition to the killings--\n\n  I am reading now--\n\n       Human Rights Watch interviewed young men who had been \n     detained by the Republican Forces . . . and arrested for no \n     other apparent reason than their age and ethnic group. Nearly \n     every former detainee described being struck repeatedly with \n     guns, belts, rope, and fists . . . for alleged participation \n     in the Young Patriots.\n\n  Those were the young people surrounding the palace.\n\n       Several described torture, including forcibly removing \n     teeth from one victim and placing a burning hot knife on \n     another victim, then cutting him.\n\n  Human Rights Watch reports ``witnesses consistently identified the \nkillers and abusers as the Republican Forces'' of Ouattara, and they \nwere ``overseen'' by Ouattara and Soros. Soros is a general of \nOuattara. He is the one who is responsible for going into Duekoue. That \nis where they murdered all the people. The Soros they speak of is the \none who was responsible for that under the supervision and direction of \nOuattara.\n  So the Human Rights Report calls on Ouattara ``to immediately ensure \nthe humane treatment of anyone detained'' by his forces. This is \nsomething I have been demanding for 7 weeks. I hope now this report is \ngoing to draw attention so at least the State Department knows what is \ngoing on because our State Department is going along with all of this. \nThey had an opportunity to voice their opinions and come up with a \nsolution. The solution is to offer amnesty or to send him to a country \nwhere he will be able to live.\n\n  I have been very critical of the State Department's handling of the \nsituation in Cote d'Ivoire. I sent them evidence months ago that showed \nAlassane Ouattara engaged in massive election fraud during last year's \nPresidential election. I called for an election and then a new \nelection. Of course, it was met with deaf ears. I called on the State \nDepartment to inquire as to the health and safety of President Gbagbo \nand his wife Simone. To date, we have heard nothing.\n  Last year, I urged the State Department to use its power and \ninfluence and allow the reconciliation process in Cote d'Ivoire by \nallowing Gbagbo to go into exile. I pointed out that at least half of \nthe population of Cote d'Ivoire supports Gbagbo. I acknowledged one \nAfrican leader who is willing to accept Gbagbo in his country--a Sub-\nSaharan African country. The State Department has been aware of this \nfor over a month.\n  I strongly suggest that is a solution. It has been done before. It \nwas done in Haiti with ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier. I know people are tired \nof hearing me talk about Cote d'Ivoire.\n  I had a pleasant experience yesterday. I met the nominee for the \nUnder Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Bill Burns. I had a \nchance to visit with him about this and other problems. I found him to \nbe very receptive. I am convinced he embodies the high traditions of \nthe foreign service--selfless, nonpartisan diplomatic service. He \nindicated to me he will follow through with my requests of the State \nDepartment regarding the health and well-being of the Gbagbos. I \nappreciate that.\n  I will finish by letting you see a photo of the two Gbagbos. Here is \nthe President, Laurent Gbagbo, who I believe should be the legitimate \nPresident of Cote d'Ivoire. The first photo was a happy guy I knew. \nThis next photo was him right after they took him. This side of his \nface is bashed in. His wife is a beautiful lady, Simone. Here is a \npicture of her. I have known her for over 15 years. She is a gracious \nlady and everybody loves her. After Alassane Ouattara took her, here is \nwhat she looked like. They ripped her hair out by the roots and went \ndancing up and down the streets of Abidjan with the hair. You have to \nuse your imagination.\n  This is what is going on today in Cote d'Ivoire. There they are, the \ndeath squad, and there is the First Lady, Simone.\n  The last thing is that I hope somebody in the State Department cares \nenough to intervene and allow that party to go into exile. There is \nalready an operation for that. Almost every President of every African \ncountry who called me is in agreement to what we are trying to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 427\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Madam President, I thank my friend from Illinois for \nallowing me to do that. I appreciate it and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, yesterday I voted for the Tester \namendment on debit card interchange fees. This amendment would give the \nFederal Reserve more time to study the impact of proposed debit card \nfee\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\nregulations on consumers and the community banks and credit unions that \nserve them.\n  I vigorously support the intent of the original Durbin amendment, and \nI thank Senator Durbin for working to bring an end to the gouging and \nthe profiteering at the largest banks.\n  My No. 1 priority is consumers. I have always made sure I was on the \nside of consumers and Main Street and against unfair and abusive \npractices on Wall Street. I have a deep suspicion of how big banks \ntreat the little people and what they do with the little people's \nmoney.\n  I voted for the original Durbin amendment during the debate over the \nWall Street reform bill because something had to be done to rein in \nthese hidden fees that kept rising and rising--and getting passed on to \nconsumers. The amendment included an exemption for banks with less than \n$10 billion in assets to ensure that only the largest banks would be \naffected.\n  Since then, the community banks and credit unions in my State tell me \nthat they are afraid that the current $10 billion exemption for debit \ncard issuers will not protect them and that they will be forced to stop \nservices, charge consumers new fees, or risk the stability of their \ninstitution if they are not adequately protected from the debit card \nfee limit. I take these concerns very seriously.\n  In this fragile economy, we have to be very careful about the \nstability of our community banks and our credit unions. Often, they are \nthe only ones lending to our neighbors and small businesses. And making \nsure that Americans in the middle class are not denied access to these \ninstitutions is consumer protection, too.\n  After careful consideration, I am voting for Senator Tester's \namendment. I want to ensure that consumers are not hurt by unintended \nconsequences of well-intentioned regulations. That is why I call for \nmore study. It is the prudent thing to do. But I recognize that delay \ncan be a tool to derail, and my intent is not to derail. We must be \nprudent, but we also must be prompt. Let me be clear, I will not let \nthis drag on indefinitely. If, at the end of 12 months, this issue is \nnot resolved--I will urge the Fed to act quickly and support \nlegislation to force action.\n  I have a long history on this issue. My family has fought for \ngenerations to protect consumers and expand access to credit.\n  Before the stock market crash in 1929, when banks in downtown \nBaltimore wouldn't lend to people who they regarded as on the wrong \nside of the tracks, my grandfather, along with small businesses in the \narea, got together to start a savings and loan to serve the community. \nThey lent to small businesses that didn't have access to credit and \nthey lent to women when no one else would.\n  When the tough times came in the Great Depression this savings and \nloan was there so people didn't lose their homes. They refused to \nforeclose on homes and businesses. If you paid a nickel a week on your \nmortgage, you were considered current.\n  Later, in the heart of the African-American community in Baltimore, \nwhen there was no access to credit, community members would be targeted \nby Happy Harry. And why was Harry happy? Because he charged 18 to 20 \npercent interest for a loan and knew his customers had nowhere else to \nturn.\n  So I worked with the Parish Council at St. Gregory's Church to \nestablish a credit union so that there would be access and to end the \nscamming, the scheming, and the gouging.\n  As a Senator, I continued these fights. When I heard that innocent \npeople in Maryland and across the country were being gouged and ripped \noff, I vowed to stop it. I helped create a flipping task force in \nBaltimore that was to be a model for the Nation.\n  In 2003, after hearing that the Fairbanks Capital Corporation was \nthreatening a number of Marylanders with foreclosure, I called for a \nFederal investigation of Fairbanks. The company paid $40 million into a \nrestitution fund so victims could get their money back and innocent \nhomeowners could get their good name back.\n  And in 2009, I put funding in the Federal checkbook to help the FBI \ninvestigate mortgage fraud so that they can have the resources to help \nstop the scamming, the scheming, and the gouging.\n  I said during the debate over the Wall Street reform bill that we had \ngotten into a financial situation where we bailed out the big banks. We \nbailed out the whales, we bailed out the sharks, and we had left the \npeople in the community, the little minnows, to swim upstream and be on \ntheir own.\n  When I traveled around my State that summer, in diners and dry \ncleaners, I heard anger and frustration in people's voices. They \nwatched Wall Street mortgage brokers profit off irresponsible lending \nwhile their husbands work an extra shift to make sure they could make \nthe monthly mortgage payment. And they watched big firms take very \nrisky gambles with their money without any regulation.\n  We need to put government back on the side of the middle class. The \nbanks got their bailout; how about we make sure we protect the middle \nclass against fraud, duplicity, and gouging?\n  But we don't just need effective regulations to keep Wall Street in \nline. We need to make sure our community banks and credit unions--the \ninstitutions where Marylanders have savings accounts and where the \nteller knows their name and their family--are not swallowed up by the \nsharks and the whales on Wall Street.\n  I want to see that consumers are treated fairly in the debit card \nmarketplace. I want to be sure that the good guy community banks and \ncredit unions--and the customers who rely on them--are not harmed by \nthe unintended consequences of these regulations.\n  That is why I voted for the Tester amendment: to give the Federal \nReserve the additional time it needs to finalize its regulations so \nthat consumers, community banks, and credit unions are protected.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a bipartisan \namendment I have filed to S. 782, the Economic Development \nRevitalization Act of 2011. This amendment, the Small Business \nContracting Fraud Prevention Act of 2011, is cosponsored by Senators \nMcCaskill, Grassley, Hagan, Collins, Merkley, and Enzi.\n  In the past year, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has \nidentified vulnerabilities and abuses in virtually all of the SBA's \ncontracting programs, including the 8(a) Business Development Program, \nthe Historically Underutilized Business Zone, HUBZone, program, and the \nService-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business, SDVOSB, program. Our \namendment attempts to remedy the spate of illegitimate firms siphoning \naway contracts from the rightful businesses trying to compete within \nthe SBA's contracting programs.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I take very seriously our responsibility of vigorous \noversight. That is why, last December, Senator Landrieu and I sent a \nletter to the SBA highlighting the recent press headlines and GAO \nreports of fraud and abuse that have plagued the agency's contracting \nprograms. That letter stated unequivocally that our committee's first \npriority this Congress is ensuring that all of the SBA's contracting \nprograms are running efficiently, effectively, and free of \nexploitation. Adopting this critical small business legislation is an \neffective first step at ensuring all small businesses are competing \nfairly and honestly within the Federal marketplace.\n  The SBA has begun to take positive steps to address issues of fraud, \nbut reports continue to surface showing additional tools are needed. As \nrecently as Saturday, March 12, the Washington Post, as part of an \nongoing investigation, published an article titled, ``D.C. insiders can \nreap fortunes from federal programs for small businesses.'' This \narticle states ``Government officials were not monitoring contracts for \ncompliance with rules.'' The report exposes a glaring deficiency in \ncontract oversight. Moreover, an SBA spokesperson is quoted as saying \nthe SBA ``long ago transferred that authority to the Pentagon and other \nagencies.'' This hands-off attitude is unacceptable, and as I told the \nSBA Deputy Administrator at a recent Small Business Committee hearing, \nthe ultimate authority for monitoring fraud lies with the SBA.\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\n  This amendment contains recommendations both from the SBA inspector \ngeneral and the GAO for combating these reports of fraud and addresses \nvulnerabilities in the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business \nprogram, the HUBZone program, and the 8(a) program. Additionally, the \nbill will work to change the culture at SBA to make the process of \nsuspensions and debarments more transparent.\n  In order to effectively execute the small business contracting \nprograms, the SBA needs a comprehensive framework to provide effective \ncertification, continued surveillance and monitoring, and robust \nenforcement throughout the SBA's contracting portfolio. This bill aims \nto increase criminal prosecutions as well as suspension and debarments \nfor businesses found to have attained contracts through fraudulent \nmeans, and requires the SBA to submit a report to Congress annually \ndetailing the specific data on all suspensions, debarments, and cases \nreferred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecutions.\n  My amendment provides the SBA more stringent oversight capacity \nacross all the SBA contracting programs. It is SBA's duty to utilize \nevery fraud prevention measure at its disposal and this amendment puts \nthe tools in place to punish the bad actors that have infiltrated the \nSBA contracting programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I think most of us involved in public \nlife realize that few people meet us and many more people meet those \nwho represent us. That is why if you are a success as a Congressman or \nSenator or as an elected official, you really have to rely on the \npeople who work for you, who time and again will represent you. Their \napproach, their sense of caring, their promptness, their courtesy will \nreflect on you.\n  If you are lucky--really lucky--you will have some extraordinary \npeople working for you who cover you with glory every single day--even \nwhen you don't know it.\n  I started in politics and was lucky to have two early mentors. As a \ncollege student, the Senator who held this seat, Paul Douglas, inspired \nme to take an interest in government. Later, there was a man he \nintroduced me to, Paul Simon, whom I succeeded in the Senate. I spent \nmore time with Paul Simon, and he truly was my mentor. I inherited many \nof my good habits from him.\n  I also inherited something else. I inherited one of his biggest fans \nand hardest workers, who came on my staff. Her name is Betty Hamilton. \nShe first had her brush with public service in 1984 when she \nvolunteered to work on the Senate campaign of Paul Simon. Paul had a \nway of bringing out the best in people and bringing the best people \ninto politics. Betty sure fit the bill.\n  In that first campaign, Betty used to pull her two toddlers, Will and \nBen, in a little wagon as she walked door-to-door in her neighborhood, \nknocking on doors and dropping campaign literature for Paul Simon. She \nwas part of an army of volunteers who helped Paul score an upset \nvictory in a very tough year, politically. Later, she signed on as \nvolunteer coordinator and office manager for Paul Simon's reelection \ncampaign.\n  After that election, Betty joined my staff when I was still in the \nHouse of Representatives. She has been with me ever since.\n  Betty works in casework. It sounds simple and routine, but it is not. \nMost of her work is with senior citizens. If an older person in \nsouthern Illinois calls my office because they are having a problem \nwith Social Security or Medicare or some other Federal program or \nagency, Betty most often takes that call.\n  The people she works with often have no place else to turn. They \ncan't afford lawyers. They just need someone who cares and who is \ncompetent. Maybe they have been incorrectly denied Medicare or \ndisability payments or some other benefits they are entitled to, and \nthey have tried but cannot cut through the bureaucracy to resolve their \nproblems. Many of them are desperate. Some have spent every penny they \nhave ever saved and have nothing left. They are on the verge sometimes \nof even losing their homes.\n  Betty Hamilton listens to them and she gets to work making phone \ncalls, writing letters, sending e-mails, trying to make the wheels of \ngovernment turn the way they should. She is an advocate for fairness \nand good government.\n  Over the years, Betty has talked with more than 8,000 people in \nIllinois. They are the lucky ones. She has saved hundreds of people \nfrom losing their homes. She has given them hope.\n  I go back on Fridays to Springfield, and I usually have a couple of \nthank-yous on my desk, and they always relate to staffers who have done \na good job. Usually Betty's name is on them. I can't count the number \nof people who have written me about the work she has done. They say: \nThank you for helping me. I greatly appreciate it. It is good to be \nable to pay my bills and take care of my kids, and a special thanks to \nBetty Hamilton.\n\n  I know Betty worries some nights about the people she tried to help. \nShe has come in on many Saturdays to write one more letter or make one \nmore call she thinks might help. Just last week she helped someone in \nmy State collect $31,000 in disability payments that had been \nincorrectly denied them.\n  Like most people who grew up in St. Louis, Betty is a die-hard St. \nLouis Cardinals baseball fan. So she knows what I mean when I say I \nconsider Betty Hamilton the Stan Musial of casework. Like Stan the Man, \nwho played for the Cardinals for 22 years, she has worked for me for \ntwo decades. Like him, she is a modest person, and like Stan Musial, \nBetty has compiled a long and consistent record of success that is \nlikely to remain unbroken for a very long time.\n  Betty didn't take to government initially. She has a master's degree \nin horticulture. Four years ago, she and her husband John, then retired \nfrom the State of Illinois, decided they would buy a farm near \nSpringfield where they could raise produce--some of the best green \nbeans and tomatoes you ever tasted. You could find them at the \nSpringfield Farmers' Market downtown on Wednesdays and Saturdays. I \nknow, I have seen them there the last two Saturdays. Don't miss their \nstand; it is the best. That is where I am going to be able to see her \nfrom now on.\n  Betty is retiring from my office, and I will miss her. More \nimportantly, the people who have had her fine public service will miss \nher too. We are going to miss her greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3667-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3667-S3668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BEST WISHES TO SARA FROELICH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, back in the year 2000, my wife Loretta \nand I went to the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles, and we ran into \na young college coed from Illinois. She was a student at Wesleyan \nUniversity in Bloomington, IL--originally from the Twin Cities of \nMinnesota. At that time, her name was Sara Nelson.\n  Sara Nelson had a class assignment to cover the convention for a \nweekly newspaper in Illinois. She was out there sleeping on the floor \nof somebody's apartment and wandering around trying to write a story \nfor a weekly newspaper. She was a bright-smiling young woman, and \nLoretta and I liked her instantly.\n  As fate would have it, we ended up on the same plane flying back to \nChicago when the convention had ended. We landed at Midway late, and as \nLoretta and I were leaving the baggage section, we saw Sara Nelson \nsitting on her bag by the curb. We said: Sara, where are you going?\n  She said: I missed my bus down to Bloomington--which is a little over \n100 miles away--and I have to wait for one that will come later \ntonight.\n  I said: You're in luck because Loretta and I are driving down there. \nGet in the car.\n  She hopped in the car with us, and we drove down to Bloomington.\n  During the course of the trip, we got to know her and liked her even \nmore.\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nShe told us how much she loved politics and government and that she was \nsoon going to graduate from Illinois Wesleyan University.\n  So I said: Why don't you call me sometime. Maybe you can be an intern \nin my office.\n  She agreed. She was not only an intern, she was one of the best. As \nsoon as she graduated, we hired her. A year later, she was promoted to \nhandle immigration and citizenship casework, and she did a great job. \nThen there was an opportunity for her to work as my deputy director for \nthe entire downstate portion of Illinois. This was in 2006.\n  So Sara Nelson took off and became my representative, going all over \nthe State and speaking for me at meetings and representing me and \nworking on projects as important as the new courthouse in Rockford, IL, \nand the new bridge across the Mississippi River connecting Granite City \nwith downtown St. Louis. There was no project too daunting for her. She \ntook them on.\n  In the meantime, to nobody's surprise, she found the person she \nwanted to marry, John Froelich. She and John got married several years \nago, and we went to the wedding--a beautiful event. Her family came \ndown from Minnesota, and the two of them were perfect. John was in \nmedical school studying to be an orthopedic surgeon. Lo and behold, \nshortly, about a year or so after that, along comes baby Naomi. I \ncannot tell you how much she loves that baby. She replaced politics, \nsoccer, and the World Cup in her list of most important things. I see \nSara out in the park on weekends pushing the stroller, sometimes \nrunning behind it with little Naomi giggling along the way.\n  There is some good news for Minnesotans and bad news for Illinois as \nthis story comes to an end. John Froelich is a medical student and will \nstart his fellowship at Mayo Clinic in Rochester in a few weeks, so \nSara and Naomi and John are moving on. I will miss her. She has been a \nterrific asset on my staff and a terrific person. She is a great mom \nand has been a great ally in the course of the years she has worked for \nme.\n  Loretta and I wish Sara and John and Naomi the very best and thank \nthem for the wonderful years of service they have given to me and the \nState of Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3668-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3668-S3669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 2 years ago, I embarked on a legislative \nmission to pass a bill called the DREAM Act. The purpose of the DREAM \nAct was to give to young people who came to this country as children, \nand who were raised in the United States, who have graduated high \nschool, who have done a well and made a good life in this country, a \nchance to become legal residents in the United States of America. They \nare long-term U.S. residents. They have good moral character. They have \ngraduated high school, and we say: If you will complete at least 2 \nyears of college and military service in good standing, we will give \nyou a chance to become legal.\n\n  There are thousands of young people who fit this description in the \nUnited States. They were brought here as kids. If their parents came to \nthe United States and overstayed a visa or crossed the border when they \nshouldn't have, these children shouldn't be held accountable. They were \nchildren. We don't hold children accountable for any wrongdoing by \ntheir parents. They grew up here, they pledge allegiance to the flag in \ntheir classrooms here, they sing our national anthem, and many of them \nspeak no other language other than English.\n  The purpose of the DREAM Act is that we should not punish children \nfor their parents' actions. That is not the American way. Instead, the \nDREAM Act says to these students: America is going to give you a \nchance, a chance to continue living here and to make this an even \nbetter nation.\n  The DREAM Act is not just the right thing to do, it makes America a \nbetter country. The young people who would qualify for the DREAM Act \nare class valedictorians, star athletes, honor roll students, and ROTC \nleaders. They are the future doctors, soldiers, computer scientists, \nand engineers who will make this country even better.\n  The DREAM Act would strengthen our national security by giving \nthousands of highly qualified, well-educated young people the chance to \nenlist in the Armed Forces. The DREAM Act has the support of not only \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates but also GEN Colin Powell.\n  The DREAM Act will help our economy by giving these talented young \npeople the chance to become engineers and entrepreneurs, doctors, \nlawyers, teachers, small business owners, and nurses. That is why the \nDREAM Act has the support of business leaders from across the country, \nsuch as Rupert Murdoch and the CEOs of companies such as Microsoft and \nPfizer.\n  The talented young people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act \ncall themselves Dreamers. When I first embarked on this mission 10 \nyears ago, they used to kind of hold back in the shadows of a meeting, \nkind of whisper to me as I went by that they would be saved if the \nDREAM Act were passed. Well, now they are stepping forward, and I am \nglad they are, so America can see who they are.\n  Every day these Dreamers contact my office to tell me their stories. \nThese stories have energized me to keep up the fight. The last time we \nhad a vote on this act on the Senate floor was last December. We had a \nmajority. But when it comes to controversial issues, it takes 60 votes. \nI want to take this up again and give these young people a chance.\n  I want to tell you about two of these DREAM Act-eligible people.\n  Herta Llusho was brought to the United States from Albania when she \nwas 11. She and her mother settled in Grosse Pointe, MI, a suburb of \nDetroit. Herta came here legally, but shortly after arriving, Herta's \nmother filed an application to stay in the United States.\n  Herta quickly learned English and became an academic star. She \ngraduated from Grosse Pointe South High School with a 4.05 grade point \naverage. In high school, she was a member of the varsity track team, \nwon an Advanced Placement Scholar Award, and was a member of the \nNational Honor Society.\n  Here is a picture of Herta at graduation. Herta is currently a junior \nat the University of Detroit Mercy, where she is an honors student \nstudying to be an electrical engineer. She has a grade point average of \n3.98 and has completed two internships at engineering firms.\n  She is also very involved in the community, volunteering at homeless \nshelters, tutoring programs, and her church. Listen to what one of her \nfriends says about Herta:\n\n       I am humbled by Herta's willingness and desire to serve. I \n     have had the privilege of going to the same church at which \n     she faithfully serves. She spends hours tutoring kids and \n     volunteering with the junior high Sunday school class. It is \n     a joy to watch so many children run up to her at church \n     because of the love they receive when they are with her.\n\n  In 2009, after 9 years of legal proceedings and deportation \nproceedings, here is what Herta said about being placed in deportation.\n\n       I was shocked. My friends are here, my education is here, \n     my community is here. All of a sudden, I was asked to leave \n     behind everything I know and go back to a country I barely \n     know. When I lived there, I was little, so I don't remember \n     much and I barely speak Albanian any more.\n\n  Herta's community rose to her defense. Thousands of people signed an \nonline petition to stop her deportation. Last year, the Department of \nHomeland Security granted Herta a 1-year stay--just 1 year. The \nDepartment is now considering whether to delay it for another year. I \nsincerely hope they will.\n  Would it be a good use of taxpayer dollars to deport Herta? Of course \nnot. There is so much discussion in America today about what we need \nfrom our young people for America to succeed in the future in the so-\ncalled STEM fields--science, technology, engineering, and math. Every \nyear we issue thousands of H-1B visas to bring foreign workers to the \nUnited States in the STEM fields.\n  Herta is a straight-A student in electrical engineering, a STEM \nfield. She doesn't need an H-1B visa. She is a homegrown American \ntalent. Why in the world would we create a law to allow someone who has \nnever lived in the United States to come here and legally reside to \nbecome an electrical engineer and tell Herta, who has lived\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\nhere all of the life she remembers, she has to leave? That is just \nplain wrong.\n  Herta came to Capitol Hill to speak at a briefing I sponsored for the \nDREAM Act, and this is what she said.\n\n       I'm a typical story. There are thousands of stories out \n     there just like mine. Please support the DREAM Act so \n     students like me don't have to leave. We are worth it. This \n     is a country we have come to love.\n\n  Herta is right. She and thousands of others are worth it. They have \nso much to contribute to America if we just give them a chance.\n  Let me introduce you to one other student. This is Julieta Garibay. \nJulieta was brought to the United States in 1992 at the age of 1. She \ngraduated from the University of Texas with a bachelor's degree in \nnursing. She was on the dean's list and the president's honor roll and \nvolunteered more than 500 hours at hospitals in Dallas and Austin. \nJulieta went on to earn a master's degree at the University of Texas in \npublic health nursing. She is a member of Sigma Theta Tau, the \ninternational Honor Society of Nursing. She has been a registered nurse \nsince 2004.\n  Here is the problem. Julieta is undocumented. She cannot legally work \nin the United States of America. Let me tell you something else about \nJulieta. She is married to SSG Armen Weinrick, who serves in the U.S. \nAir Force Reserves. Here is a picture of Julieta and Staff Sergeant \nWeinrick at Julieta's graduation. Staff Sergeant Weinrick is currently \nawaiting deployment. He will go overseas to defend our country, but \nwhile he is gone serving America, his wife could be deported. That is \njust plain wrong.\n  Julieta sent me a letter, and here is what she said about her dreams \nfor the future.\n\n       I desperately need the DREAM Act to pass so I can practice \n     my beloved profession--nursing. I have been dreaming of being \n     a nurse for the past 7 years since I earned my nursing \n     license. Once the DREAM Act passes, I will join the military \n     in hopes of making up the lost time and serve the country I \n     call home as a nurse.\n\n  Do we need more nurses in America? Of course, we do. In fact, the \nUnited States imports thousands of foreign-trained nurses each year to \nmeet the needs of our country. What is wrong with this picture? This \nyoung lady has a master's degree in nursing from the University of \nTexas. I am sure my colleague on the Senate floor would acknowledge \nthat is one of the most highly regarded universities in America. She \nhas this master's degree, and they are planning to deport her. If they \ndo, she will probably cross paths in the airport with a nurse coming \nhere from some foreign country on a work visa to work in our hospitals. \nThat isn't fair, it isn't smart, and it just doesn't make sense.\n  The DREAM Act would give Julieta the chance to serve the America she \nloves, the America she calls home.\n  I first introduced the DREAM Act in 2001. Since then I have met so \nmany immigrant students who would qualify, such as Herta Llusho and \nJulieta Garibay. They are Americans in their hearts. They are willing \nto serve our country and to make it a better place. We have to give \nthem a chance.\n  I ask my colleagues: Please, in your heart of hearts, think about the \nfairness and justice behind this legislation. Let's support and pass \nthe DREAM Act. It is the right thing to do. It will make America a \nstronger nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, I wish to speak briefly today about \nMedicare, about the law, and specifically a law that Congress passed in \n2003 which provided for something called the Medicare trigger. This \nprovided that when the Medicare trustees would indicate that a Medicare \nfunding warning should issue according to that law, then the President \nof the United States under that law must, within 15 days, submit to \nCongress proposed legislation to respond to that warning.\n  What does all this mean? We know the Medicare trustees made the \nsituation clear that Medicare will run out of money by the year 2024. \nMedicare's unfunded liabilities are more than $24 trillion and growing. \nIn other words, there is a $24 trillion gap between the promises the \nU.S. Government has made to seniors and the funding to pay for it. Of \ncourse, as the Chief Actuary stated, this is actually an optimistic \nscenario, that we can fund Medicare through 2024.\n  The President of the United States has failed to comply with this law \nduly passed by Congress and signed into law. I do not really know why \nthe President has failed to meet this legal responsibility of the law. \nI hope it is an oversight, and I hope it is one he will correct \nshortly. Having no plan while the President has criticized the House \nfor the plan they passed is bad enough, but failing to submit a plan \nwhen the President of the United States is required to do so by law is \na violation of the law, something the President has taken an oath to \nuphold.\n  There is no doubt about it, section 802 entitled ``Presidential \nSubmission of Legislation'' uses the word ``shall.'' It is not ``may,'' \nit is not ``can,'' and it is not ``it would be a good idea.'' It says \nthe President shall submit to Congress, within a 15-day period \nbeginning on the day the budget submission to Congress is made, \nproposed legislation responding to this Medicare funding warning. March \n1 marked the day 15 since the President submitted his budget, and the \nMedicare trustees, as we all know, have been ringing the alarm bell for \nyears. But, unfortunately, this is not the only provision of the law \nthe President has neglected.\n  We could talk about the Greek debt crisis. On Tuesday, the President \ntalked about the Greek debt crisis in a joint press conference with \nAngela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. This is what the President \nsaid about the Greek debt crisis:\n\n       We have pledged to cooperate fully in working through these \n     issues on a bilateral basis but also through international \n     and financial institutions like the International Monetary \n     Fund.\n\n  Obviously, Greece has suffered a debt crisis. They have the \nInternational Monetary Fund, funded by various nations, to bail them \nout. Unfortunately, when the United States has a debt crisis, if we do \nnothing about it, there will be no one left to bail us out.\n  The problem with the statement of the President about the \nInternational Monetary Fund is that the Congress has also spoken on \nthat issue. Senator Vitter and I sponsored an amendment last summer \nthat was incorporated into the so-called Dodd-Frank Act or the \nfinancial services regulatory reform bill. This amendment was approved \nunanimously by the Senate and became law by the President's hand. This \nprovision, included in section 1501 of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the \nTreasury Secretary to determine whether IMF loans to countries that are \nalready deeply in debt will likely be repaid and certify that \ndetermination to Congress. Furthermore, if an IMF loan will not be \nrepaid, the Treasury Secretary is required to direct the executive \ndirector to vote in opposition to the proposed loan. These provisions \nbecame Federal law for a reason--because we sought to protect U.S. \ntaxpayers from being used by the IMF to bail out foreign nations that \nhave been making irresponsible spending decisions.\n  As I said earlier, I hope the failure of the President to comply with \nthis mandatory requirement under the Medicare law we passed in 2003 is \nsimply an oversight. But we know that so far the President and the \nmajority party in the Senate have not submitted--the President has \nactually submitted a budget that doubles the debt in 5 years and \ntriples it in 10 years, but he has made no response to the Medicare \ntrustees' statement that Medicare will be insolvent in 13 years. \nInstead, he has attacked the only people who have been responsible \nenough to come up with a proposal. Admittedly, the proposal may not be \nperfect, but it is a responsibility of all of us to do what we\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\ncan to try to solve problems, not just attack people and use it for \npolitical advantage when other people try to step up and meet their \nobligations.\n  The issue is respect for the law, and the issue is whether the checks \nand balances in our Constitution are still in place. The question is \nwhether the President somehow considers himself above the law or \nwhether the law applies to him just as it does to each one of us.\n  I hope this is an oversight. I hope the President will remedy that \noversight and he will submit proposed legislation to deal with this \nimpending insolvency of Medicare forthwith.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor again today, as I \nhave week after week since the health care law has been passed, with a \ndoctor's second opinion about the health care law. As you know, I have \npracticed medicine for 25 years in Wyoming, taking care of Wyoming \nfamilies.\n  I have great concerns about this health care law that has been passed \nby this body as well as the House, signed by the President. The \nAmerican people continue to learn more and more about this health care \nlaw, and the more they learn, the more concern they have about this law \nbeing bad for patients; bad for providers, the nurses and doctors who \ntake care of the patients; and bad for the payers, the taxpayers of \nthis country who are going to get hit with an incredible bill.\n  The main subject I wish to talk about today is a new report that has \ncome out that says to me that the taxpayers are going to get hit with a \nbill much higher than they initially thought. It is a report from the \nMcKinsey Quarterly called ``How U.S. health care reform will affect \nemployee benefits.''\n  In the debate and speeches the President had given in the runup to \nthe election and the vote on this bill, he said that if you had care \nyou liked, you could keep it; that the American people, if they had a \nplan they liked, would be able to keep it. It was a promise he made to \nthe American people, a promise the American people wanted to believe. \nBut now this report shows that the American people were right in being \nskeptical, and, as we see, the more the American people learn about the \nhealth care law, the less they like it and the more they oppose \nit. What this report says is that a shift away from employer-provided \nhealth insurance will be vastly greater than expected and will make \nsense for many companies and lower income workers alike.\n\n  When we work our way through this report, what we see is that more \nand more private companies that today--today--provide health insurance \nfor their employees will be much less likely to be willing to provide \nthat insurance in the future. Why? Because it is going to be a lot more \nexpensive to provide the insurance. The mandates, the quality, and the \nhigh level of expense involved with providing that insurance is going \nto be a significant burden to those companies. And if they don't \nprovide the insurance at all, there are going to be other chances for \nthose employees and it will actually be cheaper for the business to not \nprovide insurance, give the people a raise, and pay the penalty of the \nhealth care law and leave people without the insurance.\n  When we take a look at this overall health care law, we see it as one \nwhere this body and this President raided Medicare. They took $500 \nbillion away from our seniors on Medicare, not to save Medicare but to \nstart a whole new government program. With the President's Payment \nAdvisory Board, he additionally wants to ration Medicare--ration \nMedicare. They have raided Medicare and rationed Medicare. Is it any \nsurprise that people on Medicare are having a much harder time finding \na doctor as doctors refuse to see patients on Medicare?\n  So with all of this, now we get this report. This report says--and \nthis is a very reputable national consulting firm. This report says \nthey did a survey of 1,300 employers across the country--different \nindustries, different geographies, different employer sizes--and the \nresults ought to be a huge wakeup call for all workers and all families \nacross the country, because what this group has seen from this study is \nthat overall, 30 percent of all employers--30 percent of all \nemployers--will either definitely or probably--so likely--stop offering \nemployer-sponsored health coverage in the years after 2014. That is \nwhen ObamaCare goes fully into effect.\n  Among employers with a high awareness of how the program actually \nworks for health care reform--who have actually studied what the law \nsays--in that group, those who are most well informed, they are saying \nmore than 50 percent and upwards to 60 percent will pursue other \noptions. They will likely stop offering their employees health \ncoverage. At least 30 percent of the employers would gain economically \nfrom dropping coverage even if they completely compensated the \nemployees for the change of losing their insurance. This is very \nalarming for our country.\n  There was a well-written editorial in yesterday's Wall Street Journal \nby Grace-Marie Turner, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Grace-Marie Turner is president of the Galen Institute \nand coauthor of a book called ``Why ObamaCare Is Wrong For America.'' \nHaving read the book, I will tell my colleagues a lot of the things I \nhave been talking about during the debate leading up to the vote on \nObamaCare and that I have been talking about afterwards as a doctor's \nsecond opinion are included in her book. She specifically writes that \nno, you can't keep your health insurance. There are about 150 million \nAmericans who get their coverage at work. We are not talking about \npeople on Medicare; we are talking about nonelderly Americans who get \ntheir coverage at work.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, when we were debating the health \ncare law, estimated that maybe 9 million, 10 million of those people, \nor about 7 percent of the employees who currently get their health \ninsurance through work, may lose their health insurance at work, in \nspite of the fact that the President said if you like what you have, \nyou can keep it. But this survey of 1,300 different companies--\norganizations that provide health insurance--30 percent of them say I \ndon't think we are going to follow that route. We are talking about a \nsignificantly larger number than the Congressional Budget Office had \neven anticipated. The numbers are astonishing.\n  In a study last year, Doug Holtz-Eakin, who is the former director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, estimated not what the current CBO \nsaid--maybe 10 million--he thought maybe 35 million workers would be \nmoved out of employer-covered plans into subsidized coverage, paid for \nby the taxpayers, and he thought by getting to that number, it would \nadd an additional $1 trillion to the estimate of what the real costs \nwere going to be for the President's health care law. If these numbers \nare true, this newer, higher number of 30 percent pulling out--and \nmaybe 50 percent once they find out what is actually in the law, in the \nmandates on these businesses--the additional costs, at a time when we \nare looking at 9.1 percent unemployment in this country, are going to \ngo even higher with the significant subsidies that exist for families \nmaking up to $88,000 a year.\n  So I come to the floor to say that the more we learn about this \nhealth care law, the more unintended consequences we find; that many of \nthe predictions made about this health care law from this side of the \naisle are now coming true.\n  I have spoken in the past about waivers. We now are at a point where \n3 million people who get their health insurance through work--3 million \npeople covered with health insurance in this country--have gotten \nwaivers. Whole\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nStates have gotten waivers so they don't have to live under the \nmandates of the health care law, and they are going to be back for \nwaivers again next year and the year after that.\n  We see additional concern with what is in this health care law. As \nNancy Pelosi said, first you have to pass it before you get to find out \nwhat is in it. As more and more people find out what is in it, we are \nfinding that more and more people who maybe had coverage they liked are \nnot going to be able to keep that coverage and are going to lose that \ncoverage, and the taxpayers are going to get stuck footing the bill.\n  That is why I come back to the floor week after week with a doctor's \nsecond opinion, because there is new information that comes out week \nafter week, as this McKinsey & Company study and report came out this \nweek. That is why I continue to say we need to repeal and replace this \nterribly broken health care law.\n  Thank you.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                No, You Can't Keep Your Health Insurance\n\n                        (By Grace-Marie Turner)\n\n       A new study by McKinsey suggests that as many as 78 million \n     Americans could lose employer health coverage.\n       ObamaCare will lead to a dramatic decline in employer-\n     provided health insurance--with as many as 78 million \n     Americans forced to find other sources of coverage.\n       This disturbing finding is based on my calculations from a \n     survey by McKinsey & Company. The survey, published this week \n     in the McKinsey Quarterly, found that up to 50% of employers \n     say they will definitely or probably pursue alternatives to \n     their current health-insurance plan in the years after the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act takes effect in \n     2014. An estimated 156 million non-elderly Americans get \n     their coverage at work, according to the Employee Benefit \n     Research Institute.\n       Before the health law passed, the Congressional Budget \n     Office estimated that only nine million to 10 million people, \n     or about 7% of employees who currently get health insurance \n     at work, would switch to government-subsidized insurance. But \n     the McKinsey survey of 1,300 employers across industries, \n     geographies and employer sizes found ``that reform will \n     provoke a much greater response'' and concludes that the \n     health overhaul law will lead to a ``radical restructuring'' \n     of job-based health coverage.\n       Another McKinsey analyst, Alissa Meade, told a meeting of \n     health-insurance executives last November that ``something in \n     the range of 80 million to 100 million individuals are going \n     to change coverage categories in the two years'' after the \n     insurance mandates take effect in 2014.\n       Many employees who will need to seek another source of \n     coverage will take advantage of the health-insurance \n     subsidies for families making as much as $88,000 a year. This \n     will drive up the cost of ObamaCare.\n       In a study last year, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former \n     director of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated that \n     an additional 35 million workers would be moved out of \n     employer plans and into subsidized coverage, and that this \n     would add about $1 trillion to the total cost of the \n     president's health law over the next decade. McKinsey's \n     survey implies that the cost to taxpayers could be \n     significantly more.\n       The McKinsey study, ``How US health care reform will affect \n     employee benefits,'' predicts that employers will either drop \n     coverage altogether, offer defined contributions for \n     insurance, or offer coverage only to certain employees. The \n     study concludes that 30% of employers overall will definitely \n     or probably stop offering health insurance to their workers. \n     However, among employers with a high awareness of the health-\n     reform law, this proportion increases to more than 50%.\n       The employer incentives to alter or cease coverage under \n     the health-reform law are strong. According to the study, at \n     least 30% of employers would gain economically from dropping \n     coverage, even if they completely compensated employees for \n     the change through other benefit offerings or higher \n     salaries. That's because they no longer would be tethered to \n     health-insurance costs that consistently rise faster than \n     inflation.\n       Employers should think twice if they believe the fine for \n     not offering coverage will stay unchanged at $2,000 per \n     worker. ``If many companies drop health insurance coverage, \n     the government could increase the employer penalty or raise \n     taxes,'' according to the new study, authored by McKinsey \n     consultants Shubham Singhal, Jeris Stueland and Drew \n     Ungerman.\n       The case for repeal of ObamaCare grows stronger every year. \n     The massive shift of health costs to taxpayers thanks to the \n     disruption of employer-sponsored health insurance will add \n     further to the burgeoning federal budget deficit. Congress \n     can and must develop policies that allow the marketplace to \n     evolve and not be forced into ObamaCare's regulatory \n     straitjacket.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, the Book of Matthew, chapter 23, verses 11 \nand 12, reads:\n\n       The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who \n     exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble \n     themselves will be exalted.\n\n  I rise today to recognize five of Montana's greatest servants--five \nMontana heroes.\n  Our State has faced severe flooding, unrelenting flooding for the \npast several weeks. As water levels rise, Montanans across the State \nare stepping up to help. This is the essence of what it means to be a \nMontanan: stepping up to help fellow Montanans, ordinary folks doing \nextraordinary things for their friends and neighbors. We are all in \nthis together.\n  That is why I have begun calling attention to the Montana heroes \ngoing above and beyond the call of duty in the floods we are \nexperiencing in our State today.\n  I want to recognize Pastor Cathy Moorehead of the United Methodist \nChurch and Father Daniel Wathan of Saint Benedict's Church of Roundup. \nLast week, Cathy and Daniel showed me the flood damage caused by rising \nwaters from the nearby Musselshell River. Most of the town of Roundup \nhas been underwater for days.\n  I remember many times I had gone to the Busy Bee Cafe in Roundup. \nNever in my wildest dreams did I ever think that restaurant might be \nunderwater. A few days ago, it was. The floods have come back again. It \nis not entirely underwater, but so much of it is, it is virtually \ndestroyed.\n  Cathy and Daniel took it upon themselves to make sure their neighbors \nhad a hot meal, a dry place to sleep, medical care, and a shoulder to \ncry on--and it is food not only for those displaced by the floods but \nalso for the National Guard so the National Guard does not have to eat \nall those rations they otherwise would have to eat.\n  I have talked to the Guard. They are so appreciative that they do not \nhave to eat the food they otherwise had been given. Ask anyone around, \nand they will tell you Cathy and Daniel's outstanding efforts continue \nto be indispensable.\n  Floodwaters have returned to Roundup, and our prayers are with them \nall today.\n  This month, the Crow Indian Tribe also faced devastating floods. \nRising water has severed food and water supplies. There is no drinking \nwater. Rushing water has swept away bridges and streets.\n  As soon as the floodwaters struck the Crow Reservation, Crow Tribe \nmember April Toineeta got to work. April worked with the Red Cross to \nset up shelter for flood victims. She made sure the Indian Health \nService had the latest information about where medical care was most \nurgently needed. She was universally recognized as the go-to person for \nhelp. April. April Toineeta. April has been working 18-hour days, \nsleeping on the floor of the Crow Housing Authority, doing whatever it \ntakes to help her community. April's hard work inspires all of us to \nhelp each other through the floods in any way we can.\n  When Box Elder Creek burst its banks, floodwaters destroyed the \nHarris family home north of Mill Iron, just outside of Ekalaka. \nNeighbors Charlie and Gail Brence hopped on four-wheelers and went to \nrescue the Harris family of seven. When they arrived, the Harris home \nwas under 6 feet of water, rapidly rising. They offered the Harris \nfamily a warm and safe place to stay, a shoulder to cry on, and a \nhelping hand as they worked to save their cattle and salvage personal \nbelongings from the destroyed home. Gail Brence said: ``We're \nMontanans. This is what we do.''\n  Pastor Cathy, Father Dan, April, and Charlie and Gail are the best of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nbest Montana has to offer. They represent our can-do attitude, our \nwillingness to help our neighbor. Our belief is that when times are \ntough, we know we are the strongest when we work together.\n  There are hundreds of other unsung heroes across Montana. I am \ncalling on all Montanans to share their stories of ordinary folks doing \nextraordinary things for their friends and neighbors, whether on \nFacebook or call my office. We want to hear these inspiring stories. We \nwant to share them.\n  You know, some folks in our State say--and it is somewhat true--that \nMontana is really one big town. We tend to know each other. We are big \nin area, few in people. But we tend to know each other, about one or \ntwo degrees of separation. We are really one big small town. We are \nthere to help each other.\n  In closing, I wish to share a humble thank-you for all Montana's \nheroes back home. I do not know what we would do without you. Thank you \nfor your service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                          Flooding in Missouri\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, Missouri has withstood a number of \ntremendous natural disasters this spring. In fact, the flood our good \nfriend from Montana just talked about is headed down the Missouri River \nfrom Montana, to the Dakotas, to Missouri right now.\n  We have had floods along the Mississippi. We have had floods of the \nBlack River that required the evacuation of part of Poplar Bluff, MO. \nWe have had tornadoes in both St. Louis and Joplin and now, as I said, \nthe Missouri River floods.\n  The Missouri River flood is beginning to reflect what has happened \nupstream with the above-normal snowpack that we do not see much of, but \nwe see it when it melts in the spring. And high rainfall amounts this \nspring have made the difference in what is happening in our State.\n  The flooding along the Missouri River, which is about to get to \ncrisis stage, will now join floods along the Mississippi River, the \nBlack River, and tornadoes in St. Louis and Joplin. River levels are \nexpected to rise near record levels and remain there until early or \nmid-August. This, of course, will put a tremendous pressure on our \nlevee system. The estimates I heard this week were that between now and \n2 weeks from today, there will be at least two dozen levees underwater, \nwhich means the water will have gotten high enough to come over the \ntops of these levees, and maybe over 50 levees on the Missouri River \nbefore it gets to St. Louis will be underwater and will have water on \nboth sides of them until well into the summer. Of course, that begins \nto undermine the very basis of the levee itself when it stands in water \non both sides.\n  The Corps and local sponsors are working to reinforce the levees \nalong the Missouri River. We see that the Department of Agriculture and \nthe Corps also have to get engaged to get the damaged land cleared and \nrehabilitated for all this levee protection to be restored.\n  There is some discussion on the opening of the levee in the boot \nheel, a place called Birds Point. That had been the plan, to open that \nlevee in a flood disaster, since 1937, but it had not happened since \n1937.\n  Mr. President, 130,000 additional acres of farmland means at this \nmoment we probably have 500,000 acres of farmland--a little more than \nthat--underwater, and that number will be much higher than that by this \ntime next week. But that 130,000 acres at Birds Point will still be \nunderwater most of next year unless the Corps goes back in, as they \ncommitted they would, and gets a temporary levee that becomes a \npermanent levee in as soon as possible.\n  We also cannot underestimate--and it would be hard to even \noverestimate--the challenges Joplin, MO, faces, a city in which the \ndeath toll from the tornadoes has now exceeded any tornado in the last \n50 years. I think the mid-1950s was the last time this much loss of \nlife occurred in a tornado.\n  I live about 60 miles from Joplin in Springfield, MO. I represented \nboth Joplin and Springfield in the House of Representatives for 14 \nyears. I had an office in Joplin. I have been there literally hundreds \nof times. And as a southwest Missourian, I have seen lots of tornado \ndamage, but I have never seen anything like this damage.\n  I went to the area Tuesday after the tornado hit over the weekend. I \nthink the tornado hit on Sunday afternoon late. I was there most of the \nday Tuesday. I was riding with a veteran police sergeant down streets \nthat both he and I had been down many times, and neither of us could \never really tell quite where we were because the devastation was that \ngreat. Every street looked like the street next to it. The buildings \nwere ground up. The 2 by 4s had become toothpicks. It was almost \nunrecognizable.\n  This same tornado, if it would have hit and stayed on the ground for \n6 miles in an area of farmland, would have done some damage, but there \nwould not have been nearly as much damage. As it happened, it ripped \nthrough the city of Joplin in a swath that was at least half a mile \nwide and in some places three-quarters of a mile wide. It stayed on the \nground for 6 miles and destroyed approximately 30 percent of the \nbuildings in a town of 50,000 people. There were 141 people killed, \nincluding those who in the hospitals from injuries since the tornado, \nbecause of the tornado. More than 900 people were injured, and 8,000 \nhomes and apartments were destroyed. And I think here the word \n``destroyed'' is the right word. Others were damaged; these were \ndestroyed. Mr. President, 8,000 places where people lived 3 weeks ago \naren't there today, and more than 500 commercial properties were \ndemolished by this devastating tornado.\n  Homes, churches, the high school, the vo-tech school, three \nelementary schools, and the Catholic school at all levels are all gone, \nand then other schools were damaged. How you get back to school in \nAugust and September of this year with those schools gone is a huge \nchallenge, one that a community would assume it would never have to \nmeet, but the community has been meeting it, as have people from all \nover the country and particularly from our State.\n\n  Rescue efforts, led by groups such as Missouri Task Force 1 and other \npublic safety officials--fire departments, law enforcement, medical \npersonnel, the volunteers--have up until now been tireless, but I can \ntell you they are getting pretty tired.\n  People in Missouri and across America have been overwhelmingly \ngenerous with their time and resources in the aftermath of this storm, \nand all Missourians are grateful for it. Large corporations and small \ncommunity organizations and individuals have helped. People have \nresponded to calls on the phone by doing whatever they were asked to do \nto make a small donation.\n  The General Motors Foundation announced a $100,000 grant to the Red \nCross, along with two vehicles, full-sized vans, and free access to \ntheir OnStar service after the disaster.\n  The Ford Motor Company donated another $50,000 to Feeding America for \nJoplin, and their employees in the Kansas City plant are assisting as \nvolunteers in relief efforts.\n  Walmart committed $1 million.\n  Home Depot and Walmart both had--there was a Walmart supercenter and \na Home Depot store that were totally demolished, 100-percent \ndemolished. In both cases, they had late-Sunday-afternoon shoppers in \nthem.\n  In one store was a man and his 4-year-old and 1-year-old. I am not \nsure they were on the way to the Home Depot, but at the last minute \nthey were running into the Home Depot, thinking that would be the \nsafest place to be, and those big concrete walls collapsed inward, and \nthe mom who sent them to get lightbulbs or whatever she had sent them \nto get never saw those three people who were so much of her life \nbefore.\n  The St. Louis Cardinals donated $25,000 to Convoy of Hope.\n  The Kansas City Royals and Kansas City Chiefs each gave $35,000 to \nHeart to Heart International.\n  Duracell opened a Power Relief Trailer.\n  Tide opened a Loads of Hope location, offering laundry services for \nthe thousands of affected families.\n  Heart of Missouri United Way collected over $1 million and pledged \nthat 100 percent of those funds that were raised in that drive would go \nto Joplin.\n  Target contributed $95,000 to relief.\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\n  AT and Verizon both gave $50,000.\n  Sprint, a Missouri company, a Kansas City area-based company, gave \n$100,000.\n  TAMKO gave $1 million. Their headquarters are in Joplin. Their \nheadquarters were not affected, but many of their employees were.\n  Loves Travel Shop gave $150,000.\n  Great Southern and Southwest Missouri Bank both donated $10,000.\n  The Girl Scouts in Houston, MO, were collecting toys for the children \nof Joplin who had lost their toys.\n  The University of Missouri produced a tornado relief t-shirt with the \nslogan ``One State. One Spirit. One Mizzou.''\n  The Mizzou football team and D. Rowe's Restaurant partnered to fill a \nsemi truck of groceries and other items to send to the location.\n  The American Red Cross, the Harvesters Community Food Network, sent \n14,000 ready-to-eat meals.\n  The Kansas Speedway and the Highway Roadhouse and Kitchen collected \nitems for victims.\n  The Ozarks Technical Community College is collecting funds to help \npeople.\n  The students in a high school in St. Louis, which had its own \ntornado, sent things to Joplin as well.\n  FEMA is doing what it can.\n  We need to prioritize spending.\n  As I reach the conclusion of my remarks and mention the people who \nneed to be mentioned--I sent President Obama a letter. I spoke with \nSecretary Napolitano shortly after this disaster insisting that the \nFederal Government do what we did in Katrina and reimburse taxpayers \nfor their expenses at the 100-percent level. We have gone from 75 to \n90, so only 10 percent more, and I will be happy with that number. Mr. \nPresident, 75 percent was the first number discussed, but we are at 90 \nnow. The Federal Government needs to do this. And local utility \ncompanies need to get the same kind of assistance others have had in \nsimilar disasters.\n  In all cases, the first responders were people's neighbors. Their \nneighbors will still be there 6 months later when people are still \nstruggling.\n  But with thanks to everyone who has helped, with appreciation for the \nFederal employees who have been there and absolute insistence that we \ndo everything we need to do to treat this disaster as it needs to be \ntreated because it truly is a disaster, I will be working with \neverything we can find to make this situation a challenge the community \ncan meet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I am \nrecognized, Senator Whitehouse be recognized--we are speaking on the \nsame topic--for up to 10 minutes and, at the conclusion of that time, \nSenator Alexander from Tennessee be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today along with my \ncolleague, Senator Whitehouse, to help mark the 350th anniversary of \nthe settlement of Block Island, RI.\n  Block Island sits 12 miles south of coastal Rhode Island, and for \nover three centuries has contributed to the economic and ecological \nvitality of my home State. It has a rich history.\n  In 1614, the Dutch merchant and explorer Adriaen Block charted the \nIsland, which is named for him.\n  In 1661 colonists from Massachusetts sailed to Block Island and \nestablished a community that would later become the town of New \nShoreham.\n  During the Revolutionary War, Block Islanders warned American \nsoldiers of approaching British ships by lighting fires on Beacon Hill, \nthe island's highest point. And, over the past 200 years, Block Island \nhas constructed two lighthouses that have provided safe passage for \ncountless sailors and travelers.\n  Today, Block Island is home to over 1,000 permanent residents and \nwelcomes up to 20,000 visitors each day during tourist season.\n  Block Island has been graced by visits by two sitting Presidents--\nPresident Ulysses S. Grant in 1875 and in 1999 by President William \nJefferson Clinton. I was pleased to have guided President Clinton as \nwell as First Lady Hillary Clinton, who is now Secretary of State, \naround the Mohegan Bluffs and the historic Southeast Lighthouse, which \noverlooks the Atlantic Ocean, during their visit.\n  Throughout the years, the local community has worked hard to preserve \nthe Island's natural beauty and landmarks. In the 1980s and early 1990s \nCaptain John R. Lewis, a Block Island resident known to all as Rob, \nspearheaded a campaign to save the Southeast Lighthouse, which was \nthreatened by an eroding shoreline. With a coalition of friends and \nlocal residents, Rob worked to secure nearly $1 million in Federal \nfunding and he persuaded Block Islanders to help raise $270,000 through \ndonations.\n  I must also applaud the efforts of John Chafee and Claiborne Pell, my \npredecessors--particularly Senator Chafee--who worked hard to ensure \nsupport for the movement of the Southeast Lighthouse. Their efforts, in \nconjunction with Federal and State leaders, saved this historic \nlandmark, which still stands today.\n  Over 40 percent of the Island is now preserved land. The Island \nboasts dramatic bluffs, pristine beaches, and 25 miles of public hiking \ntrails. Over 40 kinds of endangered species call Block Island home and \nthousands of migratory birds pass through each year making this a truly \nexceptional place.\n  Indeed, Block Island was included on the Nature Conservancy's list of \n``Last Great Places.'' This honor identifies sites in the Western \nHemisphere with significant biodiversity and ecosystems with rare or \nendangered species.\n  Block Island is not only unique for its rich history; it also has a \nbeautiful landscape.\n  Generations of Block Islanders have preserved what the Narragansett \nIndian tribe called ``God's Little Island.'' As we celebrate the 350th \nanniversary of Block Island's settlement, it is fitting that we \nrecognize and congratulate Block Islanders for all of their efforts to \npreserve one of our country's most treasured places.\n  I yield to Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nSenator Reed in commemorating the 350th anniversary of Block Island and \nthank him for his leadership in this moment of recognition.\n  Every Rhode Islander can recall their first trip to Block Island. For \nmost it starts with a drive down to Galilee where countless visitors \nhave boarded the Block Island ferries--the Carol Jean, the Block \nIsland, and the Anna C. The ride from Galilee lasts about an hour, \nwinding out of the Pt. Judith harbor of refuge and into the open ocean. \nAnd as the mainland--with all its cares and concerns--slips away off \nthe stern a small speck on the horizon ahead grows larger with each \npassing minute. Soon the great bluffs of the island come into view, \nfollowed by the friendly hustle and bustle of Old Harbor.\n  As the ferry pulls into dock, the full scene unfolds: the National \nHotel, Ballard's Inn, the docks and moorings, and all the shops and \nrestaurants along Water Street. As you step ashore, you can't help but \nfeel enchanted by the scene. A mere 12 miles separate the island from \nthe mainland of our Ocean State, but it can easily seem a world away.\n  Generations of young Rhode Islanders have made that trip, and most of \nthem will continue returning, year after year, only to find with a sigh \nof relief that the scene is just as they left it. It is no wonder that \nthe Nature Conservancy has named Block Island as one of the Earth's \n``Last Great Places.''\n  Formed by a receding glacier thousands of years ago, the land was \nfirst inhabited by the Narragansett Indians, who named their home \n``Island of the Little God.'' It took its modern name from Adrian \nBlock, a Dutch explorer who charted the island in 1614. It was later \nsettled by a group of families from Massachusetts in 1661--350 years \nago this year. In the centuries since, Block Island has been occupied \nby British Redcoats during the War of 1812, served as home to artillery \nspotters in World War II, and become a favorite destination for \nsailors, fishermen, and families across the region.\n  Today the island is a mainstay of Rhode Island's tourism industry. \nThe Southeast Lighthouse is one of the many ``must-see's'' for Ocean \nState tourists, right up there with historic Newport and Slater Mill. \nAnd the jobs generated by Block Island--from the ferry workers to the \nshop owners--are\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\na real help to our economy in these tough times.\n  Today I join with Senator Reed to commemorate 350 years of history \nfor the people of New Shoreham. Congratulations on this historic \nmilestone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3674-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3674-S3675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RIGHT-TO-WORK LAW\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, next Tuesday, the Nation's largest \nexporter and employer of more than 150,000 Americans will be appearing \nbefore an administrative judge in Seattle to defend itself against a \nclaim brought by the acting general counsel of the National Labor \nRelations Board, NLRB. The claim is that a corporate decision to expand \nproduction of its next generation airliner in South Carolina, a right-\nto-work State, was a violation of Federal labor law.\n  Since 1947, Federal law has affirmed the right of States to enact \nwhat we call right-to-work laws, which prevent unions and employers \nfrom requiring employees to join a union, as well as pay dues or fees, \nin order to obtain or keep their job.\n  In Tennessee, for example, manufacturers such as Nissan, Volkswagen, \nand General Motors have built factories and increased their production \nof cars made and sold in the United States, in large part due to the \nenvironment offered by Tennessee's right-to-work law.\n  The President recently visited a Chrysler plant in Toledo, OH, where \nhe stated that the auto bailout helped to restore the American \nautomobile industry. I respectfully disagree. I think that what \nrestored the American automobile industry was the right-to-work laws in \n22 States, by creating a more competitive environment in those 22 \nStates, as well as in the Midwest and other States where the laws don't \nexist, and permitting manufacturers to be able to make the cars and \ntrucks in the United States that they sell in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, American companies and our 22 right-to-work States are \nunder assault from a government agency that is driven by an \nantibusiness, antigrowth, and antijobs agenda. This may be the most \nimportant battle over labor laws in the United States today. That is \nwhy Senator Graham, Senator DeMint, and I--actually, we have 35 \nSenators cosponsoring the bill--introduced legislation to preserve the \nlaw's current protection of state right-to-work laws and prevent the \nNLRB from moving forward in their case against this company and others.\n  The Job Protection Act will prevent the NLRB from ordering a company \nto relocate jobs, will guarantee employer rights to decide where to do \nbusiness, and will protect employer free speech associated with the \ncosts and benefits of a unionized workforce.\n  The company that will be tried on Tuesday is Boeing--a solid and \nupstanding American success story. Over the last century, Boeing has \nbuilt the passenger planes that allow Americans to travel the world; \nbuilt the warplanes and weaponry that enable our soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and airmen to defend freedom; built the spacecrafts that send \nour astronauts into orbit and to the Moon; and built the satellites \nthat deliver communications around the globe.\n  Boeing's newest commercial passenger airliner is the 787 Dreamliner. \nIt is a shining example of American innovation and entrepreneurship. It \nhas been designed with a paramount focus on efficiency and performance, \nto allow a mid-sized aircraft to travel as far as a jumbo jet, while \nusing 20 percent less fuel and producing 20 percent less emissions than \ntoday's similarly sized aircraft, and while traveling at roughly the \nsame speed as a 747 or 777.\n  It has also been a tremendous commercial success despite these \ndifficult economic times. Since 2004, 56 customers, spanning 6 \ncontinents, have placed orders for 835 Dreamliners, valued at $162 \nbillion.\n  President Obama has recognized the leadership of this company. He \nnamed the chief executive officer of Boeing, Mr. Jim McNerney, as \ncochairman of the President's Export Council. And more recently, he \nnominated Mr. John Bryson, who serves on the Boeing Board of Directors, \nto be the Nation's Commerce Secretary.\n  The Dreamliner's success prompted Boeing to decide in 2009--2 years \nago--to establish a second assembly line for the airliner in South \nCarolina. This is in addition to its current assembly line in \nWashington State. South Carolina is a right-to-work State and \nWashington is not.\n  On Tuesday, the NLRB acting general counsel will ask an \nadministrative judge in Seattle to stop Boeing from expanding \nproduction in South Carolina, arguing that the decision was made in \nretaliation for past strikes by union employees in Washington. That \nclaim ignores these facts: No union jobs are being lost here; nobody is \nbeing demoted; no personnel are being moved; and no benefits, salaries, \nor work hours are being cut back as a result of this expansion. It \nfurther ignores the fact that Boeing's decision was announced, as I \nhave said, nearly 2 years ago.\n  Down in South Carolina, 1,200 construction jobs have been created and \nover 500 new workers have been hired by Boeing to work at this assembly \nplant, which is supposed to open next month, in July. At the same time, \nBoeing has actually added 2,000 new jobs in Washington State since the \nannounced expansion in South Carolina. That is 2,000 new union jobs in \nWashington State.\n  South Carolina, of course, is a right-to-work State, where employees \nmay choose to join or not join the union. Suspending Boeing's expansion \nwill result in billions of dollars of lost economic development and \njobs to that State. But, the NLRB's acting general counsel doesn't seem \nto care about these facts, or the impact of this case on those jobs. \nRecently, several Boeing employees in South Carolina, whose jobs are \nhanging in the balance, asked to intervene in the case. The acting \ngeneral counsel opposed the request, stating that ``these Boeing \nemployees in South Carolina have no cognizable interest in \nparticipating in the proceeding sufficient to justify their \nintervention.''\n  It is hard to imagine anybody with a more direct interest in this \nthan the Boeing workers in South Carolina.\n  Facts like these don't seem to matter when you have an agenda. This \ncase is about more than airplanes, more than Boeing, and more than \nSouth Carolina. This case is about the future of our economy and our \ncompetitiveness as a nation. It is the latest attempt by this \nadministration to chip away at right-to-work laws, to change the rules \nand give unions more leverage over employers, and to allow politically \ninfluenced bureaucrats in Washington determine the means of production \nfor private industry in the United States.\n  If the acting general counsel's request is affirmed following next \nweek's hearing, it will be prima facie illegal for a company that has \nexperienced repeated strikes to move production to a State with a \nright-to-work law. The CEO of Boeing pointed out that this will not \nonly hurt the 22 right-to-work States. It will also hurt States that do \nnot have right-to-work laws. Those non-right-to-work States will suffer \nbecause a company that operates in their State and is unionized will \neffectively be prevented from growing or expanding to a right-to-work \nState, therefore hindering the ability of any State to attract new \nmanufacturers and create new jobs.\n  So, instead of making it easier and cheaper to create jobs in the \nUnited States, manufacturers will be further incentivized to expand or \nopen new facilities in Mexico, China, or India to meet their growing \nneeds. Boeing and its 787 Dreamliner are shining examples of what is \nright in America and what is necessary to rebuild and grow our \ncountry's economy.\n  This new jetliner assembly plant in South Carolina is the first one \nto be built in the U.S. in 40 years. We need to remember that Boeing \nsells airplanes everywhere in the world and it can make airplanes \nanywhere in the world. But, we would like for Boeing and other \nmanufacturers to make in the United States what they sell in the United \nStates, so that jobs can stay and grow in this country, instead of \nmoving overseas.\n  As this Administration's Commerce Secretary, Gary Locke, correctly \nobserved in his March testimony before the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n       Manufacturing is essential to America's economic \n     competitiveness. . . . [it] is a vital source of good middle-\n     class jobs. It is a key driver of innovation.\n\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\n\n  With 9.1 percent unemployment, with a soft economy, government and \nWashington must allow manufacturers such as Boeing to prosper, \ninnovate, and create jobs. We need to make it easier and cheaper for \nthose manufacturers to make in the United States what they sell in the \nUnited States.\n  Expanding new production lines in South Carolina was a business \ndecision made by Boeing's executives and board members, on behalf of \ntheir shareholders, who believed it was in the company's best \ninterests. As I mentioned, those board members and executives are well \nrespected, including by the President of the United States, who has \ninvited many them to be a part of his Administration.\n  But under this Administration, the NLRB Acting General Counsel seems \nonly concerned about the interests and agenda of organized labor--an \nagenda that has been soundly rejected by the vast majority of private \nsector workers in both right-to-work and non-right-to-work States \nacross the country in recent years.\n  All eyes will be on Seattle next Tuesday, when one of our Nation's \ngreatest assets and contributors to our economic future will be put on \ntrial for investing, creating, and innovating at a time when we are in \nthe middle of an economic recession. This will be a true test of \nwhether manufacturers are able to make in the United States what they \nsell in the United States, or whether they will be encouraged to make \noverseas what they sell in the United States. It will test whether they \nput jobs over there, instead of creating them here. And it will test \nwhether the Administration's economic policy is exporting airplanes or \nexporting jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3675-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3675-S3677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon because, on \nMay 12, 2011, the National Academy of Sciences released a significant \nreport entitled ``America's Climate Choices.'' In 2007, Congress \ndirected the academy to write this report. The researchers who \ncontributed to the report include scientists, economists, and \npolicymakers from world-class institutions such as the Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory, DuPont, and MIT. The list of the States from which \nthe committee comes is very broad: California--scientists came from--\nNorth Carolina, Maryland, Georgia, Virginia, Michigan, Wyoming, \nWashington State, Tennessee, Arizona, Missouri, Massachusetts, New \nYork, New Jersey, Colorado, and Texas. The report was peer reviewed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks the list of the \ncommittee, which is page V of the report, be printed as an exhibit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The report was peer reviewed by academic reviewers \nfrom such universities as Stanford, the University of Texas, the \nUniversity of South Carolina, Harvard, and Carnegie Mellon. Yet this \nsignificant report, requested by Congress, drafted by experts, peer \nreviewed by science, has fallen on deaf ears in our Nation's Capital. \nWhy is this? Is it because the report addresses a problem we have \nalready solved? No. Is it because the report tells us not to worry? No; \nit is not that either. The report, ``America's Climate Choices,'' adds \nto the body of climate science evidence and reflects the clear \nconsensus of the scientific community, which is that carbon pollution \nis creating dangers across our planet and must be addressed if we are \nto avoid its most disastrous consequences.\n  These are the facts in the report:\n\n       Climate change is occurring. It is very likely caused by \n     human activities and poses significant risks for a broad \n     range of human and natural systems.\n\n  Are we prepared for these significant risks? No, we are not, \nconcludes the report. I quote again:\n\n       The United States lacks an overarching national strategy to \n     respond to climate change.\n\n  The report warns further:\n\n       Waiting for unacceptable impacts to occur before taking \n     action is imprudent because the effects of greenhouse gas \n     emissions do not fully manifest themselves for decades and, \n     once manifested . . . will persist for hundreds or even \n     thousands of years.\n\n  Starkly, the report calls on us now to begin mobilizing for \nadaptation. The precise quote: ``Begin mobilizing now for adaptation.''\n  The report is an urgent call to action by a widespread group of our \nmost responsible scientists, peer reviewed by our most responsible \nuniversities. Why, then, is it being ignored? I believe many of my \ncolleagues are ignoring this report because they are hoping this \nproblem of carbon pollution changing the atmosphere and the climate of \nour planet will go away. They are hoping that somehow, if we don't \ndiscuss it--indeed, if we deny it--climate change will not happen. If \nwe ignore the laws of physics and chemistry and biology, those laws may \ncease to apply to us. We can repeal a lot of laws in this Senate, but \nwe cannot repeal the laws of nature, and we are fools to ignore them.\n  Some even attack the underlying science; this is a strategy that is \nas old as industry reaction to science industry does not like. A recent \nbook looked at the EPA efforts to protect us from secondhand smoke at a \ntime when the tobacco industry wanted the unregulated ability to smoke \nand did not want people protected from secondhand smoke and pretended \nsecondhand smoke was not dangerous. The writers conclude:\n\n       Most of the science upon which the EPA relied with respect \n     to secondhand smoke was independent, so attacks on the EPA \n     wouldn't work alone. They have to be coupled with attacks on \n     the science itself.\n\n  A memo from Philip Morris's communications director, Victor Han, said \nthe following:\n\n       Without a major concentrated effort to expose the \n     scientific weaknesses of the EPA case, without an effort to \n     build considerable reasonable doubt, then virtually all other \n     efforts will be significantly diminished in effectiveness.\n\n  In other words, in order to create doubt, they had to attack the \nscience directly, and they have done so, to the point where Mr. Han \nsaid the EPA is an agency that is, at least, misguided and aggressive \nand, at worst, corrupt and controlled by environmental terrorists.\n  So it is not a news story for industry to try to deny the science \nthat shows the danger of what an industry is providing. But these \nattacks simply will not stand. The facts are too strong against them.\n  Over the last 800,000 years, Earth's atmosphere has contained \nCO2 levels of 170 to 300 parts per million. That is solid \nscience. That is a fact. That is not a theory. It is not in dispute. \nThat is the range within which humankind has lived for 8,000 centuries. \nBy the way, it is not clear that 8,000 centuries ago mankind had yet \nmastered the art of controlling fire. Essentially, the entirety of \nhuman history has taken place within that bandwidth of 170 to 300 parts \nper million of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.\n  In 1863, the Irish scientist John Tyndall determined that carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere trapped heat and trapped more heat as the \nconcentration of carbon dioxide increases. That is textbook science. It \nhas been textbook science for generations. That is not in dispute \neither.\n  Since the Industrial Revolution, our industrialized societies had \nburned carbon fuels in measurable amounts, usually measured as gigatons \nor metric tons. A gigaton, by the way, is a billion, with a B, metric \ntons. We now release, depending on the year, up to 7 or 8 gigatons--7 \nor 8 billion metric tons--each year. That is not in dispute either.\n  We now measure carbon concentrations going up in the Earth's \natmosphere. Again, that is a measurement. This is not a theory. The \npresent concentration exceeds 390 parts per million. Remember, for \n8,000 centuries, humanity has existed in a bandwidth of 170 to 300 \nparts per million, and we are now at 390 parts per million--well \noutside the bounds we have inhabited for the last 800,000 years. That \nalso is not in dispute. That is a fact.\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\n  ``America's Climate Choices'' documents the changes in climate that \nhave already been observed and measured in the United States. Again, \nnot theory but documented, measured, and observed. These are also not \nin dispute. Over the past 50 years, our U.S. average air temperature \nhas increased by more than two degrees Fahrenheit. Our total U.S. \nprecipitation has increased, on average, by about 5 percent. Sea levels \nhave risen along most of the U.S. coasts. Heavy downpours have become \nmore frequent and more intense in the Southeastern and Western United \nStates and the frequency of large wildfires and the length of the fire \nseason have increased substantially in both the Western United States \nand in the Presiding Officer's home State of Alaska.\n  If we take a look at the increase in carbon concentrations in our \natmosphere, they can be plotted. Today is one of the last days our \npages are with us after many months, and they have been here in school \nin the very early mornings. They have been learning mathematics, and it \nwouldn't surprise me if our pages were able to take a series of points \nand plot a trajectory off of those points. That is not a complicated \nscientific endeavor. If we plot the trajectory of our carbon \nconcentration, it puts us at 688 parts per million in the year 2095, \nand 1,097 parts per million in the year 2195. That is a pretty long way \noff, but when we think that for 800,000 years we have inhabited a \nplanet in which the carbon concentration in the atmosphere was between \n170 and 700 parts per million and in a matter of a century and a little \nmore we will have more than doubled that concentration and another \ncentury hence another 300 points up, that is a very significant--\nindeed, an epic--shift. These carbon concentrations are outside the \nbounds not of the last 8,000 centuries but of millions of years of this \nplanet's history.\n  The National Academy of Science report warns us this way as well:\n\n       In addition to the potential impacts that we are able to \n     identify, there is a real possibility of impacts that have \n     not been anticipated.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       In addition to the potential impacts that we are able to \n     identify, there is a real possibility of impacts that have \n     not been anticipated.\n\n  When we travel outside a range that has protected our species and our \nplanet for 8,000 centuries, we create forces that are hard to \nanticipate and, consequently, could create dangers that are hard to \nanticipate.\n  This National Academy of Sciences report does not just stop at \ncataloging the effects of climate change, however. As requested by \nCongress and as indicated by the report's title--``America's Climate \nChoices''--the report lays out the choices we have moving forward, if \nonly we will acknowledge the facts of this problem and act responsibly.\n  The laws of nature, of course, do not care if we are paying \nattention. Climate change is happening and it poses grave risks to us \nand it will go forward whether or not we choose to acknowledge it. As I \nsaid earlier, we can do a lot of repealing of laws in this Senate, but \nwe don't get to repeal the laws of nature. There are real risks we are \nfacing, but there are also many positive reasons we should address the \nproblem of carbon pollution. Developing clean and truly renewable \nenergy sources and working to run our American businesses more \nefficiently will help us retain our economic leadership in the global \nmarketplace, and that means jobs for Americans.\n  Here is the report again on the potential harm to our economy if we \ndon't invest in a clean energy future:\n\n       The European Union has already increased its reliance on \n     renewable energy and put a price on CO2 emissions \n     from major sources without detectable adverse economic \n     effects. China has placed low carbon and clean energy \n     industries at the heart of the country's strategy for \n     industrial growth, and is making large scale public \n     investments (for instance, in ``smart grid'' energy \n     transmission systems) to support this growth. . . . Firms \n     operating in the United States could find themselves \n     increasingly out of step with the rest of the world and \n     without the same robust domestic markets for climate-friendly \n     products. Moreover, U.S. firms in energy-intensive sectors \n     could be disadvantaged relative to their more energy \n     efficient foreign competitors if energy prices rise in coming \n     decades. . . .\n\n  That is no idle speculation. We are already seeing the United States \nfall behind in clean energy technologies. We invented the first solar \ncell. We now rank fifth among the countries that manufacture solar \ncomponents--fifth. The United States has only 1 of the top 10 companies \nmanufacturing solar energy components and only 1 of the top 10 \ncompanies manufacturing wind turbines.\n  Half of America's installed wind turbines were manufactured overseas. \nPortsmouth, RI, has installed two wind turbines. One was manufactured \nby a Danish company. The other was manufactured by an Austrian company, \nits components delivered to Rhode Island by a Canadian distributor. \nImagine if we drove demand for domestic manufacturing of wind turbines, \nof solar cells and panels, of rechargeable batteries. Imagine the \npeople we could put back to work, the factories we could reopen, the \nenergy this growth would infuse into our economy.\n  The new energy economy that beckons us has been described in \ncongressional testimony as bigger than the tech revolution that brought \nus our laptops and our iPads and these BlackBerries, and the Internet \nservices that are now such an important part of our daily lives, \nwhether we Twitter or go on eBay or shop Amazon or do Facebook. In 15 \nyears, that Internet grew from nothing to a $1 trillion economy--a $1 \ntrillion economy. By comparison, the global energy economy is $6 \ntrillion. We do not, as a country, want to fall out of the race to \ncontrol that new energy economy. Yet that is exactly what we are doing.\n  America designed much of the underlying energy technology the world \nis using. But other countries have set smart policies and provided \nfinancial incentives to their industries, and now they are pulling away \nfrom us in bringing those new technologies to market. A $6 trillion \nmarket, and our foreign competitors are pulling away from us in \nbringing our own technologies to that market. Our competitors are \nseizing the advantage in the development and deployment of new energy \ntechnologies, and we are letting them.\n  But we can still change this trajectory. We can face up to the facts \nof climate change, see the opportunity in that looming threat, \nstrengthen our economy, and create jobs. The National Academy of \nSciences report is just one more reminder of this historic charge to \nour Congress--a historic charge at which right now we are failing in \nour duty.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 Committee on America's Climate Choices\n\n       ALBERT CARNESALE (Chair), University of California, Los \n     Angeles\n       WILLIAM CHAMEIDES (Vice-Chair), Duke University, Durham, \n     North Carolina\n       DONALD F.

The \nFlanders region, of course, was made famous by Canadian physician and \nLTC John McCrae, who wrote the poem ``In Flanders Fields'' on May 3, \n1915, after he witnessed the death of his friend, LT Alexis Helmer, 22 \nyears old, the day before. While Senator Leahy visited the cemetery, \nwhich serves as a resting place for many American soldiers killed \nduring World War I, he made brief but eloquent remarks in honor of \nthose brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for \nfreedom and justice. His remarks follow and I commend them to my \ncolleagues and everyone else who reads the Congressional Record as a \nmost fitting Memorial Day tribute:\n\n       We are gathered in a cemetery consecrated by the sacrifice \n     of soldiers of our countries who died in the final days of \n     what, in their time, was called the ``Great War'' and ``The \n     War To End All Wars.''\n       It was a battle so fierce that almost a century later, as \n     we gaze across their places of rest, we can still feel their \n     valor and their anguish. These crosses, row on row, carry \n     remembrance forward, and so does the annual reappearance of \n     the poppies in these fields.\n       Like the Vermonters who have fallen in Afghanistan and \n     Iraq, and their numberless comrades in conflicts before and \n     after the strife of these nearby battlefields, these brave \n     soldiers made no appointment with death. We hail these fallen \n     patriots for braving the violence and tragedy of war.\n       But more than that, we honor our fallen here because they \n     sacrificed all for a cause larger than themselves--defending \n     humanity, freedom, and the ties of family and friendship that \n     irrevocably bind our countries together.\n       They were of a generation of Americans, Belgians, British, \n     and French who fought, shoulder to shoulder, and gave their \n     all so we and others could live in freedom.\n       Four of them were sons of the states of Alabama and Iowa, \n     which two of my Senate colleagues, who are here today, \n     represent.\n       I am the second United States senator to speak at this \n     solemn resting place. The first was Senator Francis Ryan \n     Duffy of the state of Wisconsin, who came to dedicate the \n     chapel, 74 years ago.\n       It is worth recalling what Senator Duffy said here in 1937, \n     as the spreading shadow of war was once again darkening \n     Europe:\n       He said:\n       ``If the boys who are buried out here could sit up in their \n     graves and speak to us today, it would be to give voice to \n     the agonizing question--`Cannot some other means be found to \n     settle international disputes?' ''\n       Just two years later the world was plunged into the Second \n     World War, and every generation of Americans since has known \n     war's brutality.\n       Across the globe, in the century since then, innocent \n     civilians increasingly have joined the ranks of those in \n     uniform as the victims of war.\n       Over the years, standing with families from Vermont as they \n     bid farewell to loved ones sent away to fight, I have seen \n     the terrible costs: wives and children left alone, parents \n     who must bury a child.\n       Lives with so much possibility suddenly cut short, as were \n     those of the soldiers we honor here.\n       The men who sacrificed everything at Flanders Field--and \n     who are commemorated so vividly through Colonel John McCrae's \n     poetic tribute, heard 'round the world--believed that some \n     things are worth fighting for.\n       They knew that vanquishing tyranny, and defending the \n     ideals our countries share, were among them. Of course those \n     same values are worth pursuing peacefully. Our obligation to \n     our fallen, and to all of humanity, is to use every peaceful \n     means at our disposal before committing any of our countrymen \n     to battle.\n       We are here today to solemnly affirm that we remember their \n     sacrifice, and that we will never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3677-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE CARBONE AUTO GROUP\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention the hard work, dedication, and perseverance of the Carbone \nAuto Group in Bennington, VT. The Carbone Auto Group is celebrating its \nrecent showroom expansion, where they have merged their Ford, Hyundai, \nHonda, and Toyota dealerships.\n  From its first garage in 1933, to its 25 franchises currently running \nacross Vermont and central New York, the Carbone Auto Group is an \naward-winning business that has garnered many regional and national \naccolades. Approaching eight decades in business, the Carbone Auto \nGroup deserves recognition for its diligence in running such a \nprosperous family-owned business. The company's longevity and success \nis a testament to its dedicated staff members and management--\nparticularly the founding partners, Joe Carbone and Phil Sacco. The hub \nof the auto group, Don-Al Management Company, Inc., is now managed by \nthird-generation family members Joe, Don, Jr., Enessa, and Alex.\n  The Carbone Auto Group has helped hundreds of Vermonters purchase \nvehicles over the years, and it has created numerous Vermont jobs. I am \npleased to see this local business celebrate its recent expansion, and \nI wish them continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3677-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3677-S3678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING JAMES J. HAGGERTY\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nlate James J. Haggerty of Dunmore, PA. Jim was my good friend and on \nSunday, June 12, he would have celebrated his 75th birthday. He died \nthis past February 8.\n  Jim and his wife Celia were married for 40 years and they were the \nparents of seven loving children: Jean, Mauri, James, Matthew, Cecelia, \nDaniel and Kathleen.\n  Jim was raised in Dunmore and graduated from Scranton Preparatory \nSchool. After graduating from the College of the Holy Cross in 1957, \nJim graduated with honors from Georgetown Law School. He returned home \nto northeastern Pennsylvania to become the first law clerk to U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge William J. Nealon. Jim's passion for public \nservice led him to run for Congress in 1964 and State senate in 1966. \nWhile he was not successful in those campaigns, Jim was undeterred in \nhis efforts to serve the people of Pennsylvania. For the next 40 years, \nhe was a close friend and an ever-faithful supporter of my father \nRobert P. Casey and me in all of our campaigns for public office in \nPennsylvania. Jim was a brilliant lawyer and he had a very successful \nlaw practice in Scranton for many years.\n  When my father was elected Governor in 1986, Jim came to Harrisburg \nto serve the people, first as secretary of the Commonwealth and then as \ngeneral counsel. Jim's friendship and counsel served Governor Casey \nwell during his two terms. He handled his responsibilities with \nintegrity and a deep commitment to public service. He believed, as the \nScriptures tell us, that ``to whom much is given, much is expected.''\n  After his years in State government, Jim welcomed me as a law \npartner. He mentored me in life as much as in the law. He understood \nthe call to serve and supported me generously when I decided to seek \npublic office.\n  Jim's life was a life of hard work and service, faith and family. No \npersonal or professional accomplishments outweighed the love he had for \nCelia, his children and 18 grandchildren.\n  While we are all saddened that we cannot spend his birthday with him, \nwe will be comforted that he leaves us his example. As his good friend \nFrank J. McDonnell said at Jim's funeral mass, Jim embodied the words \nfrom scripture that ``a faithful friend is a sturdy shelter; he who \nfinds one has found a treasure.'' For my family and many others in \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, Jim Haggerty was our faithful friend and, \nfor his family, a sturdy shelter of caring and love.\n  Happy Birthday, Jim. We miss you every day.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the Scranton Times obituary from \nFebruary 11-13, 2011.\n  The information follows.\n\n                           James J. Haggerty\n\n       Attorney James J. Haggerty of Dunmore died Tuesday in \n     Naples, Fla. His wife is the former Cecelia Lynett. The \n     couple would have celebrated 45 years of marriage on Feb. 19.\n       Born in Scranton, son of the late James J. and Margaret \n     Kearney Haggerty Cummings, he was a graduate of Scranton \n     Preparatory School, the College of the Holy Cross and \n     Georgetown University Law Center, where he was a member of \n     the Law Review. He received honorary degrees from Villanova \n     University and the University of Scranton. Jim served active \n     duty in the Army Infantry and as a member of the Pennsylvania \n     National Guard and Army Reserve. Jim served as law clerk to \n     the Honorable William J. Nealon, chief judge, U.S. District \n     Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania. A lifelong friend and \n     adviser to former Gov. Robert P. Casey, Jim served as the \n     secretary of the commonwealth and later as general counsel to \n     the late governor. At the time of his death, Jim was a\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\n     partner in the Scranton law firm of Haggerty, McDonnell & \n     Hinton, formerly Casey, Haggerty & McDonnell and later \n     Haggerty, McDonnell & O'Brien. He also served as president of \n     the Lackawanna County Bar Association and was a permanent \n     member of the Third Circuit Judicial Conference. Jim served \n     as chairman of the board of trustees for the University of \n     Scranton and Scranton Preparatory School. He was president of \n     the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Lackawanna County and \n     served as director of the Greater Scranton Chamber of \n     Commerce and the United Way of Lackawanna County. Jim was \n     also a member of the board of directors at the Country Club \n     of Scranton and First National Community Bank.\n       Jim was a loving and vibrant man, known to close friends as \n     ``the Big Fella,'' and recognized by countless others who had \n     the privilege to befriend him as larger than life. Jim had a \n     renowned sense of humor and an ease with people that endeared \n     him to all whose lives he touched. His infectious personality \n     was outdone by his impressive professional accomplishments as \n     a successful lawyer. He was respected by his peers and \n     revered by fellow members of the bar for his honesty, ethics \n     and fair dealing. He ranks among the most loyal Dunmoreans \n     and Democrats of all time. Loyalty was paramount to his very \n     being. Above all, Jim was a devoted husband, father and \n     grandfather and the most positive role model to those he \n     loved so dearly. His favorite times were spent with his sons \n     and friends golfing at the Country Club of Scranton, and he \n     most relished time spent with family. Summers in Avalon, N.J. \n     with his wife, children and grandchildren brought him \n     indescribable joy. Jim's generosity in life continued as an \n     organ donor.\n       Also surviving are seven children, Jean McGrath and \n     husband, Christopher, Dunmore; Mauri Collins and husband, \n     Joseph, Scottsdale, Ariz.; James J. Haggerty, Jr. and \n     fiancee, Wendy Lettieri, Scranton; Matthew and wife, \n     Christina O'Brien Haggerty, Scranton; Cecelia O'Rourke and \n     husband, James, New York, N.Y.; Daniel Haggerty and fiancee, \n     Meghan Stott, Wilkes-Barre; and Kathleen James and husband, \n     Brian, Scranton; 18 grandchildren, James, Christopher, \n     Cecelia, Nora and Margaret McGrath; Clare, Catherine, \n     Cecelia, Rita and Elizabeth Collins; Abigail, Caroline, \n     Cecelia and Matthew Haggerty; Brian, Patrick, Edward and \n     Margaret James; and several nieces and nephews. He was also \n     preceded in death by a brother, Joseph O. Haggerty; and his \n     stepfather, John P. Cummings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3678-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HONORAIR\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak about a very \nspecial flight that just took place. The Louisiana HonorAir flight that \ncame into Washington on Saturday, May 28, included a group of 77 World \nWar II veterans from Louisiana. These veterans visited the various \nmemorials and monuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's \ninvaluable military members.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, sponsored this \nlatest trip--its 22nd flight--to the Nation's Capital. The organization \nhonors surviving Louisiana World War II veterans by giving them an \nopportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this \ntrip, the veterans visited the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo \nJima memorials. They traveled to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a \nwreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there are roughly 21,000 living WWII veterans, and each \none has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory of freedom over \ntyranny. The oldest in this HonorAir group was born in 1915 and 7 \nveterans on this HonorAir flight were women. These veterans served in \nvarious branches of the military--20 Army, 26 Navy, 12 Army Air Corps, \n11 Marines, 1 Coast Guard, and 7 in women's services.\n  Our heroes served across the globe, participating in major invasions \nsuch as those at Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Guadalcanal, Leyte, the \nPhilippines, and southern France. One was a prisoner of war who also \nreceived the Army of Occupation medal, while others fought in the \nhistoric Battle of the Bulge or at Pearl Harbor during the infamous \nattack in 1941. Many of these veterans have been decorated with honors \nsuch as the Purple Heart or the Bronze Star Medal.\n  These men and women, who have given so much for our country, truly \nrepresent our greatest generation. I ask the Senate to join me in \nhonoring these 77 veterans, all Louisiana heroes, that we welcomed to \nWashington on May 28 and Louisiana HonorAir for making these trips a \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3678-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID CRAIG\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President on behalf of Senator Cantwell and \nmyself, it is with great privilege that I congratulate a hard-working \nWashingtonian, Mr. David Craig, on his well-deserved retirement on June \n23, 2011, after forty seven years of dedicated service to the students \nof Highline High School.\n  Mr. Craig taught business in classroom 216 at Highline High School \nfor his entire career. To put his extraordinary longevity in \nperspective, Mr. Craig's first graduating class were 18 years old \nduring the 1964-1965 school year. During that same year, President \nLyndon Johnson declared war on poverty and signed the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct; Beatlemania was sweeping the globe, and Muhammad Ali was named the \nheavy weight champion of the world. Today, those 18-year-old students \nare now senior citizens.\n  Over the course of five decades, Mr. Craig has touched the lives of \nover 10,000 students. He had the pleasure, as few teachers do, of \nhaving his children, Michael and Shelley, as students. He taught Royce \nBadley, now his coworker and Academic Dean of Students for the Highline \nHigh School, and Shaya Calvo, now senior prosecuting attorney for King \nCounty. He has also seen his share of tragedies, including losing \nstudents to conflicts in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Yet he is \nconsistently reminded of the joy of teaching, seeing it not only in the \nyoung people he continues to help today, but also in the frequent \nencounters he has with former students in his day-to-day life.\n  It is important moments such as the retirement of a great teacher \nthat we reflect on their impact on their school and community. In \nassessing the legacy of a teacher like Dave Craig, Henry Adams perhaps \nsaid it best: ``a teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his \ninfluence stops.'' The legacy that Dave Craig leaves is one that has \npositively affected the lives of thousands of young people, giving them \none of the greatest gifts America can bestow upon its citizenry: the \ngift of education. As a teacher, Dave Craig has served his school, his \ncommunity, his country and most importantly his students with \nenthusiasm and dedication. We should all be very thankful for his \nselfless devotion to Highline High School.\n  On behalf of all Washingtonians, we commend David for his many years \nof commitment to our State. His knowledge, experience, and loyalty to \neducation will be sorely missed. We congratulate David and wish he and \nhis wife Paula the best of luck in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3678-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3678-S3679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING TOWLE'S HARDWARE AND LUMBER STORE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, while our efforts here in Washington \nregarding small business are often focused on how to help start new \ncompanies, our economy also relies on those small firms which have been \nin operation for generation after generation. One such small business, \nTowle's Hardware & Lumber Store in Dixfield, this week celebrates its \n100th anniversary. Today I commend Towle's for its remarkable \nachievement and highlight its tremendous story.\n  Towle's Hardware and Lumber Store opened its doors in 1911 as C.H. \nTowle's Hardware, when Charles Towle purchased the former Stockbridge \nHardware Store on Weld Street in Dixfield. At that time, Towle's \noffered its customers a wide variety of basic necessities, from paint, \nlumber, and tools, to cast iron stoves, electric and gas refrigerators, \nand even John Deere tractors.\n  The Towle family considers the company's long-term success and \nlongevity as byproducts of its work ethic, attention to customer \nservice, and decision\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\nto sell quality products at reasonable prices. Indeed, over the years, \nthe business has expanded in size, installed an elevator, and opened a \npackage shipping operation in the 1980s. In the 1960s, Towle's joined \nAmerican Hardware, one of the Nation's earlier co-operative hardware \ncompanies, and to this day it remains a member of True Value, with \nwhich American Hardware later merged. In 2008, Towle's Hardware moved \ninto a new 6,000-square-foot location just a few yards from the old \nlocation. That same year the family also opened the Towle's Corner \nStore to serve the community in even more ways.\n  This week, Towle's is holding a week-long celebration of the \ncompany's centennial. Events include free product giveaways, raffles \nfor Towle's gift certificates and other prizes, and a recognition \nceremony for the company, which includes the presentation of a special \nplaque to Towle's in honor of its centennial by officials from the town \nof Dixfield and True Value.\n  Small businesses like Towle's Hardware are the heart and soul of our \nNation's communities. Main Streets across America are chock full of \nrestaurants, grocery stores, and shopping boutiques which provide \ncitizens with the goods and wares they need. Towle's Hardware and \nLumber is a prime example of a small business that has persevered \nthrough turbulent economic times--from the Great Depression to the most \nrecent recession--time and time again. I congratulate everyone at \nTowle's for their major milestone and wish them many more years of \naccomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3679-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3679-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3679-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3679-S3682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1991.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to restore \nintegrity to and strengthen payment limitation rules for commodity \npayments and benefits; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to introduce a piece \nof legislation that I have introduced many times in past Congresses. I \nhave made some progress on the goals I seek but have not gotten 100 \npercent finality of the policies I want. I am always able to do this \nwith a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Today, I present this with Senator Johnson of South Dakota. I will \nlet Senator Johnson speak for himself, but I want to give the reasons I \nam introducing this bill in my remarks. First, I want people to know \nthis deals with farm policy, and on farm policy the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Johnson, and I agree on most everything.\n  Mr. President, this is a piece of legislation that is probably going \nto come up not so much as a stand-alone, as when we discuss the \nreauthorization of the farm bill--which generally could start this year \nand probably go into next year--but as an effort that I am not going to \ngive up on. It deals with the issue of how much one individual farmer \nshould get from the farm program. My approach is to put what one might \ncall a hard cap on the amount of money that one farmer can get, and my \nremarks will explain why.\n  Also, though, at a time when we have great budget deficits, people \nmight think I am introducing this bill just because I am concerned \nabout the budget deficit. It is true this bill, if enacted, will save \nabout $1.5 billion, but that is not my main purpose for doing it. My \nmain purpose is to have the historical basis for a safety net for \nfarmers; to espouse the principle that our safety net ought to be \ntargeted toward small- and medium-sized farmers. So today, Senator \nJohnson and I are introducing the Rural America Preservation Act.\n  America's farmers produce the food that feed our families. The bill \nhelps ensure that our farmers are able to provide a safe, abundant, and \ninexpensive food supply for consumers around the world while \nmaintaining the safety net that allows small- and medium-sized farmers \nto get through tough times.\n  Everybody sees tough times that are out of their control, but the \nimportance of the farm safety net can be seen no further than the \ndinner table each of us sits around, as recently as last night. Stop to \nthink what you would do if you were unable to feed your children for 3 \ndays. There is an old adage that says something like this: You are only \nnine meals away from a revolution. Maybe in those circumstances, if you \nlove your children--and maybe you wouldn't think this could happen to \nyou because we have such an abundance of food in America, but we are \nall aware of the fact a lot of countries do have food riots when there \nis a shortage of food--you might do just about anything--steal, riot, \nwhatever it takes--to give your children the food you want them to have \nto keep them alive after not having food for 3 straight days.\n  So the cohesion within our society, the social cohesion, that is one \nof the reasons it is vitally important we maintain a farm program that \nwill make sure there is a readily available food supply.\n  Another reason I am not going to go into in these remarks is that \nfood is very essential to the national security of our country--in \nother words, the defense of our country. All we have to do is rely upon \nan old adage Napoleon used to use: An army marches on its belly. More \nrecently, however, we can look at the farm programs in Germany and \nJapan where they recall the mistakes made in their war effort during \nWorld War II--and, thank God, they didn't succeed--when they did not \nhave enough food for their military people. So I also want to think in \nterms of a sure supply of food not only for social cohesion but also \nfor national security purposes.\n  To ensure the family farmer remains able to produce a food supply for \nthis cohesive and stable society that I have talked about, we need to \nget the farm safety net back to its original intent--to help small- and \nmedium-sized farmers get over the ups and downs of farming that are out \nof their control. As an example, it could be a natural disaster, it \ncould be grain embargoes such as those put on by the President of the \nUnited States, it could be the situation where President Nixon froze \nthe price of beef and ruined the beef industry in the Midwest.\n  The original intent of the Federal farm program was not to help a \nfarmer get bigger and bigger. But the safety net has veered sharply off \ncourse, and that is why I talk about the necessity for a hard cap on \nany one farmer getting help from the farm program. We are now seeing 10 \npercent of the largest farmers actually getting nearly 70 percent of \nthe total farm program payments coming out of the Treasury of the \nUnited States.\n  There is no problem with a farmer growing larger in his operation. \nLet me make that clear. If you want to get bigger and bigger in \nAmerica, that is an American right to do so. But the taxpayers should \nnot have to subsidize that effort, and that is what is happening today. \nThere comes a point where some farms reach levels that allow them to \nweather the tough financial times on their own. Smaller farmers do not \nhave that same luxury, and these same small farmers play a pivotal role \nin producing the Nation's food.\n  I have been approached time and time again by farmers concerned about \nwhere the next generation of farmers will come from when the price of \nfarmland is shooting up or the price of cash rent is shooting up, \nparticularly when the Federal taxpayers are subsidizing that effort. It \nis important that we keep young people on the farm so they can take the \nlead in producing our food when the older generation of farmers is \nready to turn over the reins. But the current policies that allow 10 \npercent of the largest farmers to receive nearly 70 percent of the \ntotal farm program payments creates a real barrier for beginning and \nsmall farmers.\n  The current system puts upward pressure on land prices, making it \nmore difficult for small and beginning farmers to buy a farm or to \nafford the cash rent. This allows the big farmers to get even bigger, \nand this is not unique to my State of Iowa. I am sure it is not unique \nto the State of South Dakota, where my cosponsor friend, Senator \nJohnson, comes from. This upward pressure on land prices is occurring \nin many States. It is simply good policy to have a hard cap on the \namount a single farmer can receive in the farm program payments. We \nwill keep in place a much needed safety net for the farmers who need it \nthe most, and it will help reduce the negative impact farm payments can \nhave on land prices and cash rent.\n  Our bill sets the overall cap at $250,000 for married couples. Now, \npeople listening in the Senate, or people listening back home on \ntelevision, probably think it is outrageous to have a figure that high \nand call it a hard cap. But this is something that is national policy \nand may not be applicable just to my State, so it is necessary to reach \nsome sort of common ground in the Congress. I recognize that \nagriculture can look different around the country, so this is a \ncompromise.\n  Just as important as setting the payment limits is the tightening of \nthe meaning of ``actively engaged.'' I will not go in depth as to what \nactively engaged is about at this point, but it generally means, if you \nare a farmer, you ought to be a farmer and not a city slicker from New \nYork City benefiting from the farm program. This will help make sure \nthat farm payments only go to those who deserve them.\n  In light of the current budget discussions, everyone should agree \nthat we don't want money going to those who fail to meet the criteria \nset for the program. This bill will help do that.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree this bill takes a common sense \napproach to improve our farm safety net, and a help to make sure the \ndollars spent go to those who need it most.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n                                S. 1161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect children and other consumers against \nhazards associated with the accidental ingestion of button cell \nbatteries by requiring the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \npromulgate consumer product safety standards to require child-resistant \nclosures on remote controls and other consumer products that use such \nbatteries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Button Cell \nBattery Safety Act of 2011. This bill will protect the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society from the hazards of button cell battery \ningestion. These small batteries, which are present in more and more \nconsumer products each year, can be deadly if swallowed. While most \nswallowed batteries pass harmlessly through the body, a toddler who \nputs one in her mouth can be severely injured in just two hours and the \ndamage can be fatal after only eight hours.\n  Button cell batteries are small, round, and are approximately the \nsize and shape of common coins. Just the sort of thing a curious child \nmight put in his mouth. When ingested, these batteries can become \nlodged in the throat or elsewhere in the digestive system and cause \npermanent damage to the tissues.\n  Between 2007 and 2009, more than 3,400 button battery ingestion cases \nwere reported to U.S. poison centers annually. The number of ingestions \nthat result in serious injury or death\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\nhave increased sevenfold since 1985 due to the higher voltage of newer \nbatteries. Hundreds of children have been severely injured and six have \ndied from these ingestions in the last two years alone.\n  Despite the severe risk, most parents and caregivers remain unaware \nof the danger.\n  Imagine not realizing a child has swallowed one of these batteries. \nIt gets lodged in the esophagus, begins to cause severe burns, and \nstays there for days with parents and doctors not realizing something \nis terribly wrong. It may seem like a respiratory infection, or a \nstomach virus. But it is not. It is the chemical reaction of a button \ncell battery, lodged in the esophagus. Even if the battery is removed \nwithin several hours, the damage is done. The child can end up in the \nintensive care unit for weeks, following hours of surgery. There can be \npermanent damage to the vocal cords, or to the gastrointestinal tract, \nmeaning the child would require feeding tubes, home nursing care, and \nmultiple surgeries. As severe and painstaking as this is for the child \nand for the parents, the child is fortunately given a second chance at \nlife.\n  For a small number of the 3,400 cases of button cell battery \ningestion reported to poison control centers every year, the damage \nfrom the battery proves to be fatal. Aidan Truett of Hamilton, Ohio, \nhad a battery surgically removed after nine days of severe symptoms and \ndoctor visits. The doctors found the battery when they ordered an X-\nray, looking for pneumonia. Two days after his surgery, Aidan died from \nhis injuries. He was 13 months old.\n  Two year old Elaina Redding, from Fort Lupton, CO died after the \ncurrent from a swallowed battery set off a chemical reaction that \neroded her esophagus and aorta. Four days after clutching her chest in \npain, she was taken to the hospital and the battery was removed. Two \nweeks after being sent home, Elaina suffered a bloody coughing fit that \nsent her back to the intensive care unit where she bled to death.\n  These stories are horrifying and compel us to act. Small batteries \nwhich are in multiple products in our houses--in remote controls, toys, \nand musical greeting cards--are highly dangerous in the hands of \ntoddlers who may swallow them. We have the ability to protect children \nand we must do so.\n  We need to make sure that these batteries are securely enclosed in \nproducts and cannot be removed by curious children. And we must also \nmake sure that parents and caretakers are aware of the danger. No \nparent should leave batteries lying around the house after removing \nthem from a product, or hand them to a small child.\n  This legislation would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nto promulgate a safety standard requiring child-resistant closures on \nconsumer products that use these types of batteries. We already have \nFederal safety rules that require toys that use batteries to have such \ncompartments; now it is time to make sure all products that utilize \nthese particular batteries are secured in a manner that will reduce \nchildren's access to these potentially harmful batteries.\n  In addition, the legislation will require warning labels that alert \nadults of the danger of these batteries. Such labels will be required \non the packaging for replacement batteries, in the user manual of \nproducts that use these batteries, and where appropriate, on the \nproduct itself. Too many injuries occur because batteries are left out \nand accessible after they have been replaced.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to support this simple and straightforward \nbill that will save lives and prevent unnecessary injuries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Brown \n        of Ohio, Mr. Franken, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1166. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to expand coverage under the Act, to increase protections for \nwhistleblowers, to increase penalties for high gravity violations, to \nadjust penalties for inflation, to provide rights for victims of family \nmembers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nour obligation to protect workers across America and to urge my \ncolleagues to support the Protecting America's Workers Act, which I am \nvery proud to introduce today.\n  Mr. President, middle-class families across this country are \nstruggling. So many of them have lost their homes or their jobs and are \nfighting to keep their heads above water. We are working hard here to \ncreate jobs and get the economy back on track, but we also owe it to \nmiddle-class families to make sure those jobs are safe and healthy.\n  In 2009 alone there were 4,340 deaths in workplaces across America, \nand over 3 million more were injured or sickened while on the job. If \nmore than 4,000 Americans were killed in 1 day, it would be on the \nfront page of every newspaper in this country. If an epidemic in this \ncountry claimed 4,000 lives, it would lead the nightly news each week. \nBut that is not the way it works with workplace injuries. They happen a \nfew at a time, spread out across the country, in communities such as \nAnacortes in my home State of Washington, where a fire broke out last \nyear at the Tesoro Refinery and killed seven workers.\n  These were men and women who were taken too young, with so much life \nto live and with so many people to live it with; workers who took on \ntough jobs and worked long hours during difficult economic times to \nprovide for their families. They were people who made tremendous \nsacrifices and who embodied so much of what is good about their \ncommunities and their States. They have been dearly missed.\n  Washington State investigators looked into that incident and \ndetermined that the tragedy could have been and should have been \nprevented. The problems that led to what happened were known \nbeforehand. They should have been fixed, but they weren't. That is \nheartbreaking.\n  Every worker in every industry deserves to be confident that while \nthey are working hard and doing their jobs, their employers are doing \neverything they can to protect them. That is why I am proud to \nreintroduce the Protecting America's Workers Act. This legislation is a \nlong overdue update to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, \nor the OSH Act.\n  Since that groundbreaking law was passed over 40 years ago, we know \nAmerican industry has changed significantly. Businesses and workplaces \nhave become much more complex, and workers are performing 21st-century \ntasks, but the government is still using a 1970 approach to regulations \nto protect employees. It doesn't make sense, and it needs to change.\n  We need to update the way we as a country think about our worker \nsafety regulations, and this law is a very important step in that \ndirection. This is not about adding more regulations, it is about \nhaving smarter regulations. It is about having regulations that protect \nworkers and make sense for business.\n  Mr. President, the Protecting America's Workers Act makes a number of \nkey improvements to the OSH Act, but I want to highlight just a few.\n  First of all, it increases protections for workers who blow the \nwhistle on unsafe working conditions. Protecting workers who tell the \ntruth is just common sense. In fact, in other modern laws, such as the \nConsumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and the Food Safety \nModernization Act of 2010, they do exactly that. But since the OSH Act \nhas not been updated, the vast majority of workers today don't have \nsimilar protections.\n  An important part of my bill would make sure a whistleblower's right \nto protection from retaliation cannot be waived through collective \nbargaining agreements, and they have the option to appeal to the \nFederal courts if they believe they are being mistreated for telling \nthe truth about dangerous practices.\n  The Protecting America's Workers Act also improves reporting, \ninspection, and other enforcement of workplace health and safety \nviolations. It expands the rights of the victims and makes sure \nemployers who oversee unsafe workplaces are pushed to quickly improve \nthem to avoid further endangering worker health and safety.\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\n  This is a good bill. I am proud to have a number of cosponsors in the \nSenate, as well as the support of many prominent national groups in our \nefforts to improve workplace safety.\n  Nothing can bring back the workers we lost in communities such as \nAnacortes, but we certainly owe it to them to make sure workers \neverywhere are truly protected on the job. So I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Protecting America's Workers Act and to keep working with \nus to make workplaces safer and healthier across America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1167. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \ndiagnosis and treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I join with my \ncolleague and friend from Iowa, Chuck Grassley, in introducing the \nRural America Preservation Act of 2011, which will provide for common-\nsense, meaningful farm program payment limitations. Particularly given \nour country's budgetary constraints, this is a straight-forward and \nfiscally responsible proposal that would target our farm program \npayments and safety net.\n  The current farm program payment structure has, quite frankly, failed \nrural America. According to the United States Department of \nAgriculture's Economic Research Service, in 2008, the largest 12.4 \npercent of farms received 62.4 percent of farm program payments. The \ncurrent rules permit the most capitalized farming corporations to \nreceive massive subsidies and deprive small and medium-sized family \nfarmers of the opportunity to thrive. The farm bill is intended to \nprovide programs that function as a safety net for farmers, in contrast \nto the cash cow they've become for a few producers. It is important \nthat we maintain a safety net for producers, but such a system must be \ntargeted to family farmers instead of large agribusinesses.\n  The 2008 farm bill took some important first steps in strengthening \nthe integrity of our farm programs. Under the law, anyone making more \nthan $500,000 in non-farm Adjusted Gross Income will not receive farm \npayments and producers making over $750,000 AGI will lose their direct \npayments. Additionally, the law eliminates the triple-entity loophole \nand farm payments now go directly to an individual, rather than a \ncorporation or general partnership, through direct attribution. I \nsupport direct attribution and elimination of the triple-entity \nloophole; however, I believe these provisions should have been much \nstronger and I have consistently pressed for a hard payment cap of at \nleast $250,000. The bill we introduced today would finally provide for \nmeaningful payment limitations and ensure that assistance goes to small \nand medium-sized family farms.\n  Our legislation includes several specific limits. Direct payments \nwould be capped at $20,000 per producer and counter-cyclical payments \nwould be limited to $30,000. Additionally, the bill would establish a \ncap of $75,000 on loan deficiency payments, LDPs, and marketing loan \ngains. There is currently no cap on LDPs and marketing loan gains, \nessentially meaning there is no effective payment limitation.\n  Just as important as establishing a hard payment limitations cap is \nhow we define whether an individual is actively engaged in the \noperation of a farm. Current law lacks a defined active management \ntest, and therefore someone could participate in no more than a yearly \nconference call and be eligible to receive payments. Our bill closes \nthe management loophole which has allowed ``paper partners'' to collect \npayments without contributing any real or meaningful role in the \noperation. This proposal will improve the management standards \ndetermining payment eligibility by requiring that management be \nprovided on a regular, substantial, and continuous basis through direct \nsupervision and direction of the operations of the farm. These are \nreasonable and common-sense requirements which seek to further ensure \nthe integrity of the farm safety net.\n  Agriculture is the economic engine that drives our rural communities, \nand without viable family farmers, our small towns and Main Street \nbusinesses throughout South Dakota would face significant financial \nhardships. I am proud to join with my friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, who has also been a longtime champion of family farmers, in \nintroducing this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1173. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmodernize payments for ambulatory surgical centers under the Medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today, once again, to advocate for \npatients and their access to more choice and competition in providing \ngood quality health care by introducing The Ambulatory Surgical Center \nQuality and Access Act of 2011 with my colleague, Senator Crapo.\n  Advocates for health care reform and a healthier nation continue to \nemphasize the importance of keeping patients ``out of the hospital.'' \nASCs can help do that by providing cost-effective services in an \noutpatient setting.\n  There are more than 5,200 Medicare-certified ASCs across all 50 \nStates, with 83 in Oregon alone. These facilities, that employ the \nequivalent of 117,700 full-time workers nationwide, ensure that \npatients from Portland to Hermiston, from Klamath Falls to Coos Bay, \nhave access to safe, effective, and quality surgical care.\n  But ASCs can do more than provide the same services found in a \nHospital Outpatient Department; they can do it at lower cost. Medicare \nsaves an estimated $3 billion each year when surgical procedures are \nperformed in ASCs rather than hospitals due to ASC reimbursement \nequaling 56 percent of what a hospital receives.\n  Currently, Medicare uses two different factors to update \nreimbursement: one for ASCs and a different one for hospitals. ASC \npayments are updated based on the consumer price index, while hospital \nrates are updated using the hospital market basket, which specifically \nmeasures changes in the costs of providing health care. Both facilities \ncan provide identical surgical procedures, so why aren't their \nrespective reimbursements linked to the same update mechanism? Why \nshould there be a double standard?\n  This inequity could have significant consequences for both patients' \naccess to services and Medicare's rate of outpatient expenditures if \nfacilities begin consolidating or hospitals begin acquiring these \npractices in an attempt to reimburse for the same services at a higher \nrate--and cost to the taxpayer.\n  The legislation Senator Crapo and I have introduced today, however, \nbegins to address this in two ways: First, this bill creates parity by \nallowing ASC payment rates to be updated using the same market basket \nupdate hospitals use; and second, the bill goes a step further by \nestablishing a Value-Based Purchasing program which will dispense \nshared savings payments based on quality reporting and improved \nperformance.\n  The Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality and Access Act puts \ncommonsense policies in place that will enhance patients' access to \nquality care in a cost-effective way. I urge my colleagues to join us \nin cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Horse Protection Act to prohibit the \nshipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, \npurchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be \nslaughtered for human consumption, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in \nintroducing the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act. This bill will \nprohibit the slaughter of horses for human consumption, a practice that \nthe majority of Americans oppose and of which many are unaware. The \nlast American horse slaughterhouses were closed in 2007, and there is \nvirtually no demand for horse meat for human consumption in the United \nStates. Unfortunately, tens of thousands of American horses are still \nbeing inhumanely transported to foreign processing plants, where they \nare brutally slaughtered.\n  Horses are domestic animals that have served men and women as loyal, \nhard working companions for thousands of years; and today, they are \nused primarily for recreation, pleasure, and sport. Horses differ from \nother livestock animals in that we do not raise them for the purpose of \nslaughter. We raise and train them to trust us, perform for us, and \nallow us on their backs. As such, they are entitled to a sense of human \ncompassion, of which the practice of horse slaughter is void.\n  Throughout the development of this country, human consumption of \nhorse meat has not been a widely accepted activity. This is undoubtedly \ndue to the unique relationship enjoyed between mankind and horses for \nthousands of years. Horses were there in our work, on our farms, for \ntransportation and communication in the taming of a vast American \nFrontier, and on every battlefield prior to World War II. They have \nproven their loyalty and nobility, and without them, the development of \nour country might not have been possible and at the least, would have \nbeen significantly more difficult. In modern time, horses provide joy \nand entertainment. Through racing, jumping, recreation, and even \ntherapy to the disabled, horses touch the lives of many Americans. \nClearly, they hold a special place in our culture, and it is for these \nreasons, that so many people are strongly opposed to horse slaughter in \nAmerica.\n  Unfortunately, horse owners do have to face the realities of \ninfirmity, age, or other reasons that may necessitate putting down \ntheir animal. However, this calls for humane euthanasia, and slaughter \nis simply not an appropriate alternative. The average cost for humane \neuthanasia and disposal is about the same as the cost of one month's \ncare, so it is not unreasonable to expect horse owners to accept \nresponsibility and incur this minor expense.\n  Additionally, because we do not raise horses with the intent to \nslaughter for human consumption, they are frequently treated with drugs \nnot approved for use in animals raised for human consumption. These \ndrugs can be toxic when ingested by humans. We have no system in the \nUnited States to track which medications a horse has received \nthroughout its lifetime, and as such, American horse meat poses a food \nsafety and export risk.\n  It is for all of these reasons that I am committed to ensuring that \nthis bill is brought to the attention of all of our colleagues here in \nthe Senate. I look forward to working with the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina and others to address this important issue and pass a \ncommonsense bill that reflects the desires of many of our constituents, \nwho support the humane treatment of our horses and the prohibition of \ntheir slaughter for humane consumption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide grants to States to improve high schools \nand raise graduation rates while ensuring rigorous standards, to \ndevelop and implement effective school models for struggling students \nand dropouts, and to improve State policies to raise graduation rates, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a series of \neducation bills S. 1177, S. 1178, and S. 1179, that reflect many of my \nlegislative priorities in K-12 education policy and the reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. As Chairman Harkin, \nRanking Member Enzi, and my Senate colleagues on the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee continue negotiations on the \nreauthorization of ESEA, I feel that it is appropriate to introduce \nlegislation that I have developed for inclusion in the reauthorized \nlegislation. While the bills I have introduced today do not address all \nof the many changes that I feel are necessary to fix No Child Left \nBehind, they do emphasize areas of particular and longstanding concern \nto me and my constituents.\n  I strongly believe that there must be a continued federal role in \neducation in the United States. I have great respect for State and \nlocal school officials, and as such I believe that they continue to \nrequire Federal support to improve student achievement and improve \ngraduation rates. Given the severe education funding challenges in my \nhome State of New Mexico and across the country, Congress has a \nparticular obligation to retain its focus on student achievement, \nespecially among low-income and disadvantaged youth.\n  Federal education policy should prioritize ending the nationwide high \nschool dropout crisis; supporting the effective use of education \ntechnology, especially in high-poverty schools; ensuring that students \nbenefit from high expectations, rigorous standards and curriculum; and \nextending the school day, week, and/or year to ensure that U.S. \nstudents do not continue to fall behind our global competitors.\n  Each year in the United States, approximately 1.2 million students \ndrop out of school without receiving a diploma, at an estimated annual \ncost to the country of over $300 billion. My home State of New Mexico \nhas one of the lowest statewide graduation rates in the country. The \nGraduation Promise Act, which I am introducing today, authorizes a new \nFederal focus on helping underperforming high schools improve student \nachievement and increase graduation rates.\n  The Federal Government should support teachers using the most up-to-\ndate technology to prepare students for success in college and 21st \ncentury careers. Today, I reintroduced the Achievement Through \nTechnology and Innovation Act of 2011. This bill would renew and \nstrengthen the existing education technology program in ESEA. The \nATTAIN Act recognizes that learning technologies are critical to \npreparing students for the 21st century workforce, ensuring high \nquality teaching, and improving the productivity of our Nation's \neducational system. The Act would provide Federal funds to states and \nlocal school districts to train teachers, purchase education technology \nhardware and software, and support innovative learning methods and \nstudent technological literacy.\n  All students, regardless of their income levels, should be able to \nbenefit from high expectations, high academic standards, and college-\nlevel academic opportunities. The Advanced Programs Act of 2011 would \nrenew the current ESEA program, which provides Federal funding to pay \nlow-income students' AP exam fees and incentive grants to expand \nstudent access to AP courses and exams.\n  Finally, I wish to highlight my cosponsorship of the Time for \nInnovation Matters in Education Act, which Chairman Harkin introduced \non April 14th of this year. The TIME Act authorizes Federal funding to \nsupport expanded learning time, ELT, initiatives in public schools. \nAmerican students spend about 30 percent less time in school than \nstudents in other leading nations, which hinders our students' ability \nto succeed and compete. ELT programs typically provide extra time for \nacademic student, enrichment activities, and teacher collaboration. \nStudies show that programs that significantly increase the total number \nof hours in a regular school schedule can lead to gains in academic \nachievement, particularly for students who are furthest behind.\n  Taken together, these four bills present a coherent, consistent \nvision for the Federal role in education reform. We must turn around \nstruggling high schools and improve our high school graduation rates. \nWe must use the best technology available to provide solid instruction \nand develop the student technological literacy necessary for success in \nthe digital age. We must provide all students with access to high \nstandards and college-level academic opportunities. We must support \nschools adding the school time necessary to allow our students to keep \npace with students in high-performing countries.\n  Now is not the time for the Federal Government to back away from its \ncommitment to helping disadvantaged students succeed in school and in \nlife. While the Elementary and Secondary Education Act needs to be \nreconsidered and substantially reworked, we must not roll back Federal \npolicy and ignore the persistent achievement gaps that limit our \nnational competitiveness and deny millions of our children access to \nthe American dream.\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3694-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 23--DECLARING THAT IT IS THE POLICY OF THE \n     UNITED STATES TO SUPPORT AND FACILITATE ISRAEL IN MAINTAINING \nDEFENSIBLE BORDERS AND THAT IT IS CONTRARY TO UNITED STATES POLICY AND \nNATIONAL SECURITY TO HAVE THE BORDERS OF ISRAEL RETURN TO THE ARMISTICE \n                   LINES THAT EXISTED ON JUNE 4, 1967\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Moran, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Inhofe, \nMr. Barrasso, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Burr, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Thune, Mr. \nPortman, Mr. Coats, Mr. Coburn, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \nBrown of Massachusetts, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Isakson, \nMs. Murkowski, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 23\n\n       Whereas, throughout its short history, Israel, a liberal \n     democratic ally of the United States, has been repeatedly \n     attacked by authoritarian regimes and terrorist organizations \n     that denied its right to exist;\n       Whereas the United States Government remains steadfastly \n     committed to the security of Israel, especially its ability \n     to maintain secure, recognized, and defensible borders;\n       Whereas the United States Government is resolutely bound to \n     its policy of preserving and strengthening the capability of \n     Israel to deter enemies and defend itself against any threat;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 \n     (1967) recognized Israel's ``right to live in peace within \n     secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of \n     force'';\n       Whereas the United States has long recognized that a return \n     to the 1967 lines would create a strategic military \n     vulnerability for Israel and greatly impede its sovereign \n     right to defend its borders; and\n       Whereas Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu \n     correctly stated on May 20, 2011, that the 1967 lines were \n     not ``boundaries of peace. They are the boundaries of \n     repeated war'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the policy of the United States to support and \n     facilitate Israel in creating and maintaining secure, \n     recognized, and defensible borders; and\n       (2) it is contrary to United States policy and our national \n     security to have the borders of Israel return to the \n     armistice lines that existed on June 4, 1967.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to rise and offer, with \nmy good friend, the senior Senator from Connecticut, a concurrent \nresolution which reaffirms our Nation's steadfast and unshakable \ncommitment to the security of Israel, specifically through the \nestablishment of secure, recognized, and defensible borders.\n  It is unfortunate that I am compelled to offer such a resolution. For \nyears, both Republican and Democratic administrations have recognized \nthat Israel's boundaries of June 4, 1967 are indefensible and if \nreestablished will create a strategic military vulnerability for our \nstaunch ally.\n  That is why President Obama's recent comments were so dumbfounding. \nThe President's prepared and thoroughly considered remarks called for \nthe starting point of negotiations to be what we all know are the \nmilitarily indefensible 1967 lines.\n  Remember, if Israel returns to the 1967 lines its territory will, in \nsome locations, be only 9 miles wide.\n  As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu correctly stated in a friendly \nand appropriate correction to the President's remarks, the 1967 lines \nare not boundaries of peace. They are boundaries of repeated war.\n  Israel would have to give up the Golan Heights, the strategic \nelevated location which dominates northern Israel. Does the President \nnot remember during the 1973 War the Syrians launched a massive armored \nattack on the Golan Heights which almost succeeded?\n  This raises the question of who President Obama was attempting to \nappease with his ill-advised statements, which unnecessarily drove a \nwedge between the United States and Israel?\n  The fact is the national security interests of the United States and \nIsrael are linked. The threats Israel faces are the threats the United \nStates faces. Whether it is Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza \nStrip or these groups' benefactor, Iran, we share a common foe.\n  Unfortunately, that foe, Iran, appears to be growing stronger and \nmore capable. Iran has repeatedly stated it wishes to wipe the United \nStates and Israel off the map. Iran's obvious aim is to establish \nstrategic dominance over the entire region. Their relentless pursuit of \nnuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology is of grave concern.\n  Much has been said about Iran's nuclear program, but much less has \nbeen articulated about its ballistic missile program. In order to \nachieve its strategic objectives, Iran has embarked on a significant \nballistic missile program. Iranian officials have boasted they have the \nability to produce a ballistic missile with a 1,250 mile range. In \n2009, the Iranians were able to launch a multistage space launch \nvehicle that the Air Force concluded ``can serve as a test-bed for \nlong-range ballistic missile technologies.''\n  Even more troubling the Iranians appear to be developing a new long-\nrange multistage solid rocket motor missile. Why is that important? If \nthe Iranians successfully field this type of technology, they will be \nable to launch, almost instantaneously, missiles which carry warheads \nover great distances.\n  With these ominous developments emanating from Israel's and the \nUnited States common foe, do we really want to be seen as distancing \nourselves from one of our staunchest allies--especially on such a \npivotal issue as Israel's borders. This issue of these borders is only \nunderscored by the constant attacks on Israel's borders by Iran's \nsurrogates, Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  That is why I believe this Concurrent Resolution is so important. It \nreaffirms the long-held, bipartisan policy of the United States, that \nwe will ``support and facilitate Israel in maintaining defensible \nborders and that it is contrary to United States policy and our \nnational security to have the borders of Israel return to the armistice \nlines that existed on June 4, 1967.''\n  The United States has no greater friend than Israel and Israel has no \ngreater friend than the United States.\n  Israel too often finds herself alone in the world, unjustly singled \nout by the left as a nation uniquely without the moral authority to \ndefend itself.\n  From my perspective, Israel does not need to apologize to anyone for \ndefending itself against those who would do her harm, and I will always \nstand by Israel as she seeks to protect her citizens against terrorists \nand their state sponsors.\n  Having said that, I also believe many Iranians, especially the young \npeople, know Iran is causing problems in the Middle East. We must \nsupport those people who are searchers for freedom.\n  The security of both our nations is irrevocably linked. This \nbipartisan concurrent resolution removes any harmful ambiguity the \nPresident's remarks last week might have caused.\n  The United States must stand by Israel. With his remarks last week, \nPresident Obama undermined her.\n  Israel faces consistent unprovoked aggression by longtime supporters \nof terrorism. But Israel is not a victim. All she asks is the ability \nto defend herself and for free people to support her right to self-\ndefense.\n  This is no time for the United States to distance itself from Israel, \nand I will do everything I can to affirm Israel's territorial integrity \nand ability to protect her citizens against the unprovoked attacks of \nterrorist and state actors.\n  Because Israel is a true friend, I am not surprised that this \nresolution has strong bipartisan support. My colleague, Senator \nLieberman, and I will be joined by members of both parties who want to \nremind the world the United States is steadfastly committed to the \nsecurity of Israel and especially our ally's ability to maintain \nsecure, recognized and defensible borders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/09/senate-section/article/S3694-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3694-S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 434.
