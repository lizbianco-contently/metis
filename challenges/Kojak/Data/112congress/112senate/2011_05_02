Mr. President, late last night, we learned the news we have \nbeen longing to hear since the worst morning in our memory: an American \noperation brought Osama bin Laden to justice. This was an American \nmission ordered by President Obama and accomplished by America's brave \nand brilliant military and intelligence professionals.\n  Last night's news stunned the world. But this operation's success \nshould surprise no one. America's special forces and intelligence \noperatives are the best--the best trained, the best equipped, the best \nled.\n  Every day of every year they risk their lives for our sake, for our \nsafety. They are the most professional and proficient forces on the \nplanet. Yesterday, they brought down the most wanted mass murderer on \nEarth. Their success is the most significant victory yet in the fight \nagainst al-Qaida and terrorism and sends a strong and unmistakable \nmessage to terrorists who threaten our country, our people, and our \ninterests.\n  This success is a direct result of President Obama's leadership and \nthe national security priorities he outlined when he took office and \nthe green light he gave our forces this weekend. President Obama \ninsisted that we refocus on Afghanistan and Pakistan as the central \nbattlefields in our fight against terrorism.\n  Those tremendous military, diplomatic, intelligence, and economic \nefforts are the reason we woke up this morning in a world that is no \nlonger home to Osama bin Laden. But the end of his life is not the end \nof the fight. Yesterday's operation is indeed a measure of justice, but \nit is only one measure of justice. Absolutely it is a definitive \nvictory, but it does not define absolute victory. America welcomes the \nsuccess of our fellow citizens' extraordinary mission.\n  Even as we breathe a sigh of relief, though, we are not relieved of \nour duty to be vigilant, to be persistent and defeat our enemy and to \nmake our Nation stronger. The leader of al-Qaida is gone, but his \norganization is not. We know our enemy is widespread and motivated. The \ntruth is, it may be more motivated today then it was yesterday.\n  Our troops continue to fight. Our intelligence professionals continue \nto work. Their families continue to sacrifice. We continue to support \nall of them and support each other.\n  We also pause today to, once again, lend a shoulder to those whose \ngrief\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nnever ends, not with time, not with bin Laden's demise, not ever. This \nsignificant measure of justice is but a small measure of comfort for \nthose who lost loved ones in America and around the world, in New York \nand Virginia and Pennsylvania, aboard the USS Cole, and in American \nEmbassies in Africa, on trains in London and Madrid, and in so many \nother places.\n  Bin Laden's death does not bring back the thousands of innocent \npeople his thugs killed or make whole families who will be forever \nincomplete. But it is an important milestone that reminds the world \nAmerica does not suffer the wicked and will not submit to evil. Our \nresolve is strengthened when it is challenged and our unity, though it \ntoo is often tested, is unbreakable.\n  Because of the hard work of courageous Americans and our military, \nintelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement communities, a long evil \nchapter in our Nation's history closed yesterday. Today, we welcome the \nspring of a new optimism and renewed patriotism. The chapter now behind \nus ended with justice. We hope the chapter ahead of us will bring \nsecurity and peace.\n\n\n                             Work Continues\n\n  While the Nation and the world absorb this crucial development, the \nwork of the Senate continues. Today, we begin a new month and a new \nwork period and a new opportunity to come together to create jobs. I \nhope this month will be a productive month. There are several important \nand time-sensitive items on our plate. One, I hope to wrap up the small \nbusiness jobs bill. This has been on the floor for weeks and weeks and \nweeks--far too long--and we need to resolve it so we can move on to \nother matters.\n  Two, we will have the same debate in the Senate that the American \npeople are having at home; that is, the question of whether we should \nkeep giving away money to oil companies that clearly do not need \ntaxpayer handouts. That will be part of a larger debate we will \ncontinue having about how best to reduce our reliance on foreign oil \nand invest better and smarter in clean energy.\n  Three, we will vote on the House-passed budget. A majority of the \nHouse has embraced it, a majority of the American people have rejected \nit, and the Senate will soon have its say.\n  Finally, we will confirm judicial nominees, many of whom we have \nwaited a long time for in the Senate. If the minority forces us to file \ncloture on those nominees in order to get a final vote, I will file \ncloture. I think it is too bad if we get involved in this with trial \ncourt judges. We cannot waste any more time or play these games for a \nlonger period of time. The country needs these empty benches filled.\n  We also have other nominations to confirm, including the Attorney \nGeneral's top Deputy, No. 1 Deputy, Jim Cole. The Deputy Attorney \nGeneral runs the day-to-day operations of the Department of Justice. He \nis also the person who signs the critical warrants to permit our \nintelligence officials to conduct surveillance on suspected terrorists. \nBut he cannot do that unless the Senate confirms him. So we must do \nthat soon.\n  Especially given last night's developments, it is unthinkable that \npartisanship and legislative ploys would keep a well-qualified nominee \nout of this important national security role.\n  A moment ago we began this remarkable new day in the Senate the same \nway we begin every day in session. We begin it with the Pledge of \nAllegiance to our flag. Its closing words were the powerful closing \nwords of President Obama's address to the Nation last night. Their \nmeaning is even more profound today, the first day of this new era.\n  The words ``liberty and justice for all'' represent America's \npurpose. This weekend, in the name and pursuit of liberty, heroic \nAmericans halfway around the world secured justice for an evil man's \nvictims, for the survivors of his terror, for Americans, their allies, \nand the entire world. ``Liberty and justice for all.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2560-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, Americans and all who long for \njustice woke to the good news: nearly 10 years after the United States \nset out to kill or capture Osama bin Laden, justice has been done. The \nman who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and who reveled in the horror of \nthat day is dead. And those who follow his twisted vision are again on \nnotice: America is in pursuit.\n  This was a long time coming. For two decades, Osama bin Laden and the \nal-Qaida network he created, sustained, and led has been at war with \nthe United States.\n  The path of terror extended from the first World Trade Center bombing \nto the bombing of the Khobar Towers and the U.S. embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania, to the bombing of the USS Cole, to the horrors of 9/11, and \nthrough two long and difficult wars that followed. 9/11 may have been \nthe day that this pattern of violence became suddenly and undeniably \nclear. But bin Laden's destructive path was already long by then, and \nfor the past 10 years, America has been determined to bring this \nmonster to justice.\n  From the beginning of this fight, the mission has been clear: to deny \nal-Qaida and any of its affiliates around the world a sanctuary from \nwhich they could plan, prepare, or launch another attack on U.S. soil. \nAnd the effort to prevent that long-feared attack has been an \nundeniable success under two administrations in the ongoing war on \nterror.\n  Yet despite this success, and our early success in Afghanistan, al-\nQaida's senior leadership was able to find a safe-haven in Afghanistan. \nA few short years after 9/11 al-Qaida had regained enough strength to \nonce again pose a serious threat to the United States. Meanwhile, the \nTaliban had reestablished its headquarters in Pakistan and had gained \nenough strength to return to Afghanistan and to risk the success of our \nmission there.\n  And as the years went by, Osama bin Laden's ability to elude capture \nhad become a greater source of frustration to us, and a source of \npropaganda to his followers.\n  Over the years, Americans had become all too familiar with bin \nLaden's dark pronouncements, from his perverse declaration 3 years \nbefore 9/11 that it was the obligation of every Muslim ``to kill and \nfight Americans and their allies, whether civilian or military in any \ncountry'' . . . to his declaration after 9/11 that he had calculated \nthe number of innocents he could kill that morning, and that he was the \nmost optimistic planner of them all.\n  Last night, those proud pronouncements ended at the barrel of a gun. \nThe last thing Osama bin Laden saw on this earth was the small team of \nAmericans who shot him.\n  So Americans can be proud of the efforts of our military and \nintelligence communities, and the focused efforts of two \nadministrations in fighting al-Qaida, and now, in capturing, its self-\nappointed leader.\n  This is indeed a signal achievement, a huge victory in the war \nagainst terrorism, and a day of great pride for our country. The \nPresident made the right call, and we thank him for it.\n  We can never bring back those who died on 9/11 or those who have \ngiven their lives in this long and difficult war, but all Americans can \nsay with renewed confidence today that we have kept our pledge, and \nthat this is a war we will win.\n  Some will recall that Osama bin Laden launched this war many years \nago on the false assumption that America didn't have the stomach for \nthe fight. While it may have taken longer than we hoped, last night he \nand his followers learned just how wrong he was. We take great \nsatisfaction in knowing that Osama bin Laden will no longer be able to \ncarry out his evil plans, that he has made his last video, and that \nwhenever someone suggests the United States has grown weary, complacent \nin this war, we have shown how determined we are to fight it to the \nend.\n  History is full of fallen despots and madmen who underestimated the \nresolve of the United States. Last night, we added one more to their \nranks. But we don't rest, because we know al-Qaida's determination to \nattack the United States didn't end on September\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\n11, 2001, and it didn't end last night. We continue to fight, knowing \nthat al-Qaida remains committed to attacking our homeland and our \nallies. We were reminded of this last week when police in Germany \narrested three men associated with al-Qaida who were planning an attack \nthere.\n  Since the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom, we have matched \nthe terrorist threat with the valor of our armed services and \ncounterterrorism professionals. The men and women of the Central \nIntelligence Agency's Counterterrorism Center have unselfishly devoted \nthemselves to preventing attacks against us and in hunting down bin \nLaden. Last night, their determined efforts met with success, and we \nare deeply grateful for their efforts.\n  As for the broader war, the death of bin Laden may create the \nopportunity to renew our efforts with Pakistan to bring fresh pressure \non al-Qaida's senior leadership. President Obama noted in his remarks \nof last night that it is essential for Pakistan to join us in this \nfight. Today is the day to redouble our efforts in pursuit of al-Qaida.\n  In the coming weeks and months, these same counterterrorism \nprofessionals will focus on determining what bin Laden's death means \nfor the threat posed by al-Qaida affiliates in Somalia, Yemen, North \nAfrica, and for the remainder of al-Qaida's senior leadership. But \ntoday the world knows once again that wherever al-Qaida lurks--wherever \nthey lurk--we will find them. It may not be days from now; it may not \nbe months. But those who plot harm to innocent Americans and our allies \nwill be captured or killed. For them too justice will be done.\n  Anyone who lived through the horror of 9/11 remembers exactly where \nthey were on that terrible September day. Now they will remember where \nthey were when they first heard the news that the man behind it had \nbeen killed by brave American forces inside Pakistan. We will remember \nwhere we were when, after years of effort, we finally got our man. \nAmerica didn't seek this fight; it came to us. But ever since 9/11, we \nhave been determined to fight al-Qaida to the end. We knew from the \nstart it would require patience and great sacrifice, and that effort \nhas paid off. Thanks to the skill and perseverance of many brave men \nand women, we have done what we said. America has not wavered, it has \nnot lost sight of the mission, and we will prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2561-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it was a little less than 10 years ago \nthat I was in northern Wyoming driving home. It was the day of \nSeptember 11, 2001. On that drive home that evening, I heard the press \nreport saying that Osama bin Laden was behind the terrorist attack on \nthe trade center, the Pentagon, and in that field in Pennsylvania where \nthe plane went down. I said to myself then that it was just a matter of \ntime before the United States would catch him and justice would be \nserved.\n  Mr. President, across the remote mountains and dingy suburbs of \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, thousands of American troops dedicated \nthemselves to stamping out Osama bin Laden and the evil he defined. All \nof those Americans made painful sacrifices at home, and many still are. \nMany are struggling with injuries, seen and unseen, and thousands have \ngiven their precious lives.\n  Of course, we will never forget the innocent lives taken in cold \nblood on that day of September 11, 2001. We all know how that day \nchanged the course of world history. One man was behind it all. We have \nhunted him for the better part of a decade.\n  Now, thanks to the hard, diligent work of America's Special Forces \nand intelligence agents, that man is dead. At long last, catching him \nin a corner, a handful of American troops delivered justice to the \nentire world.\n  The price for Osama bin Laden's death was enormous. Although \nyesterday's precision strike was executed by the toughest, smartest, \nand most effective special operations force on Earth, its justice is \nthe result of all the countless soldiers, marines, airmen, sailors, and \nintelligence agents and their families who went ``all in'' for us over \nthe past decade.\n  This country--now and among future generations--will never forget \ntheir sacrifices.\n  Thirty-six Montanans have been killed in worldwide operations since \n9/11. Dozens more have been seriously wounded, and a few were longtime \nservicemembers, but many of them joined the military specifically \nbecause of that awful day and what happened on September 11, 2001.\n  We are so thankful to them for all they gave and for all their \nfamilies gave.\n  While Osama bin Laden's death is a true victory, our vigilance in the \nworldwide fight against terrorism doesn't end here. The hundreds of \nMontanans still serving abroad today remind us of that every day.\n  Yesterday we blotted out Osama bin Laden forever, and that will make \nour world safer. But working together with the international community, \nour Nation will continue to be steadfast in our commitment to security, \nsafety, and opportunity for all Americans.\n  Security and opportunity and freedom aren't just American values, \nthey are human values. As Americans, we will never be afraid to fight \nfor them.\n  In the days and months ahead, I expect we will refine and recalibrate \nthe future of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. As this next chapter \nunfolds, my thoughts and prayers will always remain with the hundreds \nof Montanans serving there. We are grateful for their service. We are \nanxious to bring them home.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to deliver a very difficult \nspeech. This will be my farewell speech to the Senate. Serving as \nNevada's 24th Senator has truly been the greatest professional \nprivilege of my life. Growing up with a single mom in very humble \nsurroundings, I simply never imagined that one day I would end up as a \nMember of such an august body.\n  Unfortunately, the amazing experiences that stem from the more than \n10 years of my Senate service cannot be summed up in one single speech. \nI owe a humble thank you to many people who helped to get me here and \nwho have helped me serve effectively, from campaign volunteers, staff, \nand donors, to some of the best people with whom I have ever worked, my \nSenate staff. I cannot thank you enough for the honor of the past many \nyears. Each of you has helped me to achieve more than my individual \ntalents alone could have ever accomplished. When I look back over my \ntime, both here and in the House of Representatives, I am very proud of \nthe many accomplishments that we together have been able to achieve. I \nwish to take a moment to mention a few.\n  The beauty of the State of Nevada has been greatly enhanced and \nprotected for the enjoyment of future generations because of my work in \nauthoring the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act and several \nother important lands bills. Because of these lands bills, Nevada has \nbeen able to\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nkeep over $3 billion that has been raised from land sales in southern \nNevada. This is money that did not have to come out of the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  In the past, BLM land; that is, the public land in Nevada, was \nexchanged for sensitive land around the State. But as a result of the \nlands bills we worked on, we were able to, instead, auction this BLM \nland, raising far more money for the State of Nevada than the land \nexchanges ever were able to do. This land revenue has been used to \npurchase sensitive land to protect it for future generations, but also \nto construct over 100 beautiful parks and trails in southern Nevada. I \ncannot tell you how proud I am when I drive around Las Vegas and see so \nmany families enjoying these beautiful areas. These lands bills have \nmade the great quality of life we enjoy in Nevada that much better.\n  Additionally, for those in northern Nevada, my love for Lake Tahoe \nhas been evident throughout the years. I have worked hard to ensure \nthat the beauty of those tranquil waters and surroundings will be just \nas beautiful decades from now as they are today, and our lands bills \nhelped to achieve this goal. Through this legislation, hundreds of \nmillions of dollars have been devoted to preserve its ecosystem, and \nimportant fuel reduction projects around our State will help prevent \ncatastrophic wildfires that so threaten the future of our State and its \nbreathtaking landscape.\n  Additionally, I have been a passionate advocate for education reform. \nOur lands bills have directed millions of dollars to Nevada schools as \nan endowment our State will benefit from for many years yet to come. I \nthank Senators Reid and Bryan for their cooperation in helping draft \nthis legislation that so greatly benefits our State. I also thank the \nfolks on my staff, especially John Lopez, who worked so hard to turn \nthese pieces of legislation into law.\n  Speaking of legislation that became law, I wish also to highlight \nanother accomplishment of which I am so proud.\n  As the only bipartisan provision in the so-called ObamaCare bill, \nSenator Tom Carper and I worked against some powerful interest groups \nto get the Healthy Behaviors Act added to the health reform bill.\n  Our provision was modeled after efforts by Safeway in the private \nsector to both improve health care quality and to reduce the cost of \nhealth care. Essentially, our provision rewards people in the form of \nlower health care premiums for making healthy choices, such as quitting \nsmoking. If we as Americans continue to eat too much, exercise too \nlittle, and to smoke, it really does not matter what kind of health \ncare reform we enact in this country; costs will continue to escalate. \nI hope this provision will highlight the individual contribution we can \nall make to reduce our health care costs.\n  Certainly this legislation would not have become law if it were not \nfor the spectacular job Michelle Spence from my office did. As I \nmentioned earlier, I simply cannot list the number of things or the \nnumber of people on my staff who have helped me with legislation. We \nhave accomplished a lot. I wish I could do it in just one speech, but \nit is not possible. I could speak at length about my fight for lower \ntaxes and individual freedoms, protection of constitutional rights, the \ndignity of our service men and women, education reform, and so much \nmore, but there is not enough time. I hope my voting record and \nlegislative record in the Senate will continue to speak for me long \nafter I have left this Chamber. I would like to speak, though, about a \nfew observations I have made through the course of my time here.\n  When I first ran for office back in 1994, I was rather naive. I was \nalso very idealistic. I simply wanted to make a difference in this \ngreat country. Throughout the years, I may have lost my naivete, but I \nnever lost my idealism. I still strongly believe the United States is \nthe greatest country in the history of the world, and it is worth \nfighting for and worth protecting.\n  I will leave this place knowing there are some really outstanding \npeople here who are just as idealistic or maybe more so than I ever \nwas, and they are willing to take the tough political votes that are \nnecessary to save this country from total bankruptcy. My prayer is that \nmore people will join them in that courage. Our children and our \ngrandchildren deserve to have the same country we enjoyed, and it is up \nto the House, the Senate, and the White House to stand together with \nthe American people to save the future of the United States from self-\ndestruction.\n  When I first arrived in the Senate, I observed several people who \nwere so caught up in their own self-importance and busyness that \narrogance literally dripped from them. Unfortunately, they were blind \nto it, and everyone could see it but them. When one takes a position of \nleadership, there is a very real danger of getting caught up in the \nhype surrounding that status. Oftentimes, the more power and prestige a \nperson achieves, the more arrogant a person can become.\n  As easy as it was for me to view this in other people, unfortunately, \nI was blind to how arrogant and self-centered I had become. I did not \nrecognize that I thought mostly of myself. The worst part about this is \nthat I even tried not to become caught up in my own self-importance. \nUnfortunately, the urge to believe in it was stronger than the power to \nfight it. This is how dangerous the feeling of power and adulation can \nbe.\n  My caution to all of my colleagues is to surround yourselves with \npeople who will be honest with you about how you really are and what \nyou are becoming, and then make them promise to not hold back no matter \nhow much you may try to prevent them from telling you the truth. I wish \nI had done this sooner, but this is one of the hardest lessons I have \nhad to learn. I believe that if I had learned this lesson earlier, I \nwould have prevented myself from judging two of my colleagues when I \nhad no place to do so.\n  When I was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, \nI was confronted with the personal issues facing Senator Larry Craig \nand Senator Ted Stevens. Following Larry's admission and Ted's guilty \nverdict, I too believed in the power of my leadership position, and I \ncalled on both of them to resign. I sincerely struggled with those \ndecisions afterward, so much so that I went to each of them a few weeks \nafterward and admitted what I did was wrong, and I asked both of them \nfor forgiveness. Each of these men was gracious enough to forgive me \neven though publicly I did not show them the same grace. I am very \ngrateful to both of these men. When I announced my personal failure 2 \nyears ago, Larry Craig was one of the first to call and to express his \nsupport. I truly cannot tell you what that meant then and what it means \nto me today.\n  The purpose of me speaking about this is to humbly show that in life \na person understands mercy a lot more when they need it and when it is \nshown to them. Again, this is a hard lesson I have had to learn, but I \nhope I can now show mercy to people who come into my life who truly \nneed it.\n  As I conclude, I have a few others I want to thank.\n  My colleague from the State of Nevada, Senator Reid. I ran against \nSenator Reid in 1998. He beat me by a little over 400 votes. Afterward, \n2 years later, when I was fortunate enough to win the election, Senator \nReid and I sat down and we kind of made a pact between us that we were \ngoing to get along even though we were of different parties, we were \ngoing to put the past behind us, and we were going to work together for \nthe people of the State of Nevada. A funny thing happened along the way \nover these last 10-plus years: Senator Reid and I developed a \nfriendship--two people with opposite voting records, opposite views on \nmajor national issues, but we worked together on a lot of issues that \naffected our State. A friendship formed between our staffs, and a true \nfriendship formed between Senator Reid and myself. And for that, I want \nto thank him.\n  To my Senate colleagues, I would like to take a moment to apologize \nfor what you have had to go through as a result of my actions. I know \nmany of you were put in difficult situations because of me, and for \nthat I sincerely apologize.\n  My wife Darlene, who has been through so much with me and has fought \nthrough so many struggles, is owed more than I could ever repay. I do \nnot deserve a woman like her, but I love her, and I am so grateful the \nLord has put her in my life.\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\n  Our children, Trevor, Siena, and Michael, have never known anything \nother than their dad leaving each week to come back to Washington, DC, \nfor my work. All three of them are incredible, and it has been a \nblessing and a privilege just to be their dad.\n  I have also been very blessed with a great set of parents who have \nstood by me through thick and thin, and also the rest of my extended \nfamily. I also have wonderful friends who have been there with me and \nmy family through the highs and the lows.\n  Lastly, most importantly, I want to thank God for allowing me to be \nhere. I have been encouraged by some not to mention God because it \nlooks hypocritical because of my own personal failings, but I would \nargue that I have not mentioned him enough. I am glad the Lord not only \nforgives, but he actually likes it when we give Him thanks. So, Lord, \nthank you for all you have done in my life. I hope I can do better in \nthe future. I hope I can learn to love You with all my heart, soul, and \nto love others as myself.\n  My colleagues, I bid you farewell. Know that you will all be in my \nprayers.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have heard some terrible stories about \nsevere weather and the damage it is causing across the United States. \nMy heart goes out to the people of Tuscaloosa, AL, and all the \ncommunities in the South that were ravaged by tornadoes of record force \nand velocity.\n  In the Midwest, our problems are more subtle but also devastating in \nterms of the impact of floodwaters. It is nothing new in our part of \nthe world. We have the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers at \nthe southern tip of our State, further north on the Mississippi, the \nIllinois River and the Missouri River. Whenever there is heavy rainfall \nin one area or more, it ends up raising the levels of those rivers to \nperilous heights, which can inundate communities.\n  I can't tell my colleagues how proud I am of the people who come \nforward in the midst of this type of challenge every single year. Thank \ngoodness it seems as though there is never a lack of volunteers. People \nare always willing to step up, starting with the National Guard. They \nalways do the best job possible, and I thank them over and over for \nwhat they do. Then, local law enforcement works overtime--the \nfirefighters, the police, and all the rest. Then there is the extra \nwork that is going on in hospitals and clinics and nurses and doctors \nworking overtime.\n  In my part of the world too, State and Federal employees have pitched \nin at every level, starting with the Army Corps of Engineers, the \nDepartment of Natural Resources of the State of Illinois, the Illinois \nEmergency Management Agency, and the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency. It is an amazing outpouring of support.\n\n  Last Friday, I boarded a plane in Chicago and flew down to Marion, \nIL, and took a helicopter into Cairo. Cairo, of course, is at the \nsouthern tip of our State, as I mentioned earlier, at the confluence of \nthe Ohio and the Mississippi Rivers. I saw there some things going on \nin the town of Cairo, IL, which were truly frightening and disturbing.\n  This is a town which in its heyday was one of the major port cities \nin Middle America. Cairo, as the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers came \ntogether and then coursed on down to the Gulf of Mexico, was a major \ncity with major economic activity. Over the years, as river traffic \nchanged and the economy changed, Cairo changed too. Now it has a \npopulation of a little less than 3,000 people. Many of them are very \npoor. They have an African-American mayor, Mayor Childs. I believe he \nis their first, if not their second, African-American mayor. They have \nhad issues of racial strife over the last 50 years. They struggle to \nkeep businesses in place. Their schools are always challenged, and now, \non top of that, comes a flood.\n  If you went along the Ohio River leading up to Cairo, you would see \nan amazing levee. It is the kind of wall of protection, concrete wall \nof protection, which every river community would love to have--on the \nMississippi side, not so much. But the interesting thing I found when I \nwent down there is even that side of the river, the Ohio River, with \nthis huge concrete levee, has serious problems. It turns out that the \nwater table is so high in Cairo, IL, that the pressure of the rising \nOhio River is forcing the water into what are known as sand boils. So \nout of nowhere, in the midst of a lot or a street, up pops a geyser of \nriver water. You think, what is going on here? It is 10, 15, 20-50 feet \naway from the levee. That is because the entire ground is so saturated \nand the river is working its way underneath, eating up the \nunderlayment.\n  I walked along there with a National Guardsman who was taking \npictures of the scene. We went to one street that had been closed with \ntwo major openings where water was bubbling, and as the National \nGuardsman was taking my photograph, the street collapsed under him and \nhe fell 2 or 3 feet down because all of this water has eaten out all of \nthe substrata under this street. That is why this has become so serious \nthat the mayor, Mayor Childs, started with the voluntary evacuation and \nthen last Saturday night said: Let's everybody leave this town. We \ndon't know what is going to happen next. That is the reality not only \nof Cairo but of several other communities.\n  The 2,800 people of Cairo, IL, were evacuated Saturday when the Ohio \nRiver reached its highest level since 1937. It rose above the 15\\1/2\\-\nfoot level this weekend and is expected to go higher. Five other \nIllinois communities are now under a voluntary evacuation order. The \npeople of Old Shawneetown, Junction, Brookport, and Golconda are being \nasked to clear out for their own safety.\n  The biggest threat of major damage is still at Cairo. I was in Cairo \njust a few days ago, and I can tell you the water levels there were \ncontinuing to rise.\n  I show you a picture of a home in Cairo, IL. The water level is \nalready so high that the home is uninhabitable. I saw many homes like \nthis, but I also saw some superhuman efforts which are hard to even \ndescribe, where people decided, even with a home that close to the \nriver, they were going to build a wall of sandbags around their home \nand save it. It sounds impossible, but they are doing it. The sandbags \nare up to 5 feet high, holding back the water which, if they were not \nthere, would have inundated the home. The pumps are pumping water out \nfrom the home into the surrounding areas, and people are up night and \nday, 24 hours a day, in rowboats, going back and forth trying to \npreserve the one thing on Earth that means so much to them--their home. \nThat is the kind of battle that is taking place in homes all around \nAlexander County and Cairo. The sustained high water level has put an \nunprecedented amount of pressure on the levees.\n  As I mentioned earlier, these giant sand boils are forming, and they \nare working all night to try to contain them. Local volunteers and \nNational Guardsmen are doing all they can, but the Ohio River is \nexpected to stay at or above flood stage for the foreseeable future, \nand the levee may not withstand that pressure. If Cairo's levee bursts, \nthe Army Corps estimates the town will be inundated with as much as 15 \nfeet of water.\n  The entire State of Illinois is operating under a state of emergency; \n320 National Guardsmen are on hand to help evacuate people and monitor \nwater levels. The State has issued and helped fill more than 1 million \nsandbags, working with the Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, and \nlocal responders to put in generators and supplies where they are \nneeded.\n  My thoughts are with the people and families affected by the \nfloodwaters in southern Illinois, especially those who had to leave \ntheir homes. I am grateful for all the people, military and civilian \nalike, who are working around the clock to control the Ohio River.\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\n  General Walsh is in charge of the Army Corps of Engineers' operations \nin this area. I talked to him several times over the weekend. He has a \nvery, very difficult decision to make. I have seen it made in the past. \nIt is never easy. The decision he has to make is, if a city is \nthreatened, like Cairo, IL, he has to determine whether it is the right \nthing to do to open a levee to relieve the water pressure of the rivers \nby flooding adjoining farmland. So people who are now perhaps only \nminor victims of flooding would see their farmlands inundated. That is \nin Missouri, and they do not like the idea. Who would? They resisted it \nin court, and at two levels now the court has said it is an Army Corps \nof Engineers' decision.\n  I spoke to General Walsh all through the weekend, and he walked me \nthrough this decision. What I said to him I will repeat on the floor. I \nsaid: This is a difficult, hard decision you have to make. You will get \nno pressure from me. I believe that Cairo, IL, is right now teetering \non the edge and could be inundated with floodwater and 2,800 people \ncould lose their homes. That is my side of the equation, along with \nthese other communities. But I know you have to make the calculation on \nrainfall, the level of the rivers, and trying to make some calculation \nabout critical infrastructure in both instances. And I said: Just use \nyour best engineering and scientific judgment. I will back you up, \nwhatever you decide.\n  Well, he has put in place the explosives to blow the levee downriver \non the Missouri side to relieve the pressure not only in Illinois but \nin Kentucky and I think parts of Tennessee as well. I think that may be \na decision to be made within the next few minutes. Whatever his \ndecision, whatever the Army Corps decides, I will stand by it because I \nknow it is a good-faith effort to do the right thing. And this I will \nsay: If they end up flooding some farmland in Missouri, I will stand by \nmy colleagues in that State, as well as all others in the Midwest, to \nmake sure that those people are made whole, that they have some \nrecovery through our government for losses in farm profits and the \nlike. It is the least we can do. If they end up saving a city, then the \ncost to the government will be dramatically less than it might \notherwise have been. It is a hard, hard decision. Having seen it \nfirsthand, my sympathy goes to the Army Corps of Engineers and all the \nprofessionals who are fighting this battle every single day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2564-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2564-S2568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last night at about 9 o'clock, I received \na call at my home in Springfield, IL, from Vice President Biden. It was \nkind of a surprising call on a Sunday night, and I was even more \nsurprised when he said Osama bin Laden had been captured and killed and \nPresident Obama would be making a statement very shortly. I waited up \nto hear that statement. I was catching a plane early this morning, but \nI wanted to hear it firsthand.\n  I guess every single one of us can remember where we were on 9/11. I \nknow where I was. I was just a few feet away from here. We were in an \noffice, a room just off the Capitol floor here--the Senate floor--in a \nmeeting with Senator Daschle when we heard about a plane crashing into \nthe Trade Center in New York and then another one. And then we realized \nthis was not an accident. We watched, as America watched, and we \nwondered would we be next, this building, this big target of a \nbuilding, the U.S. Capitol. Thank goodness the courage of passengers on \na plane that was brought down in Pennsylvania probably saved many \nlives, maybe my own.\n  But we came to know that behind it all was a man named Osama bin \nLaden who declared war on the United States of America and was prepared \nto kill thousands of innocent people to push his terrible extremist \nagenda. For 10 years, we have been engaged in the largest global \nmanhunt in history to find this man. President Bush, I am sure, used \nevery resource of the government to do that job, and I commend him for \nthat effort even though he was not successful. But last night, because \nof the courage of Navy SEALs and our military, who stepped up, Osama \nbin Laden was captured and killed.\n\n  I know, having spoken to people in the White House, that the \nPresident stuck his neck out on this because there was a question as to \nwhether he was actually there. They believed there was enough evidence, \nand the President said: Go forward. We did it without any loss of life \non the American side or any loss of innocent life of civilians.\n  But it appears now that we have taken away the leader of al-Qaida. \nThat is a good development for all of us. I do not know if it means \nthere will be a more peaceful world. We probably should assume the \nopposite for at least the time being, that these terrorist \norganizations will now strike at the United States to establish they \nare still credible. Well, we have to be vigilant. We have to stop them \nbefore it happens. And we have to pursue every single one of them for \nwhatever it takes to bring them to justice.\n  Perhaps, though, it will go in another direction. Perhaps we will \nfind that once al-Qaida, the head of the snake, has been chopped off, \nperhaps al-Qaida will start to wither, and I hope it does. If it does, \nmaybe some other organizations will have second thoughts about the \nterrorism business. That would be the best outcome, even better if we \ncould start bringing our troops home from Afghanistan.\n  I commend the men and women in uniform, those yesterday who showed \nsuch courage, those in the intelligence community who have worked night \nand day for almost 10 years trying to find this man. I commend the \nPresident for showing the kind of leadership we needed to bring to \njustice the most dangerous terrorist criminal on the face of the Earth. \nIt is something that I think speaks well for our government and for our \npeople.\n  There is one other point I would like to make, and the President made \nit last night in his statement. He repeated what had been said by \nPresident George W. Bush after 9/11. I had my differences with \nPresident Bush, but there were moments when I could not have agreed \nwith him more and particularly the moment when he made it clear that \nour war against terrorism was not a war against Islam. It was not a war \nagainst Muslims or Muslim Americans. I was so glad he did it because we \nhave seen ample evidence of discrimination against people of that \nreligion who have had nothing to do with terrorism but, unfortunately, \nhave been discriminated against. Last night, the President repeated \nwhat we all believe: Islam is not the enemy. Extremism and terrorism \nare the enemies. We will work with Muslim Americans and Muslims around \nthe world to protect their religion, their honored religion, and will \nwork with them to reduce terrorism.\n  The President also reminded everyone listening last night that when \nit came to the victims of Osama bin Laden's terrorism, Muslim people \nwere the victims time and time again. He was no friend of the Muslim \ncommunity himself. His life, unfortunately, of killing and violence \ntook its toll in many communities, including Muslim communities around \nthe world.\n  I commend those who continue to work night and day, at every single \nlevel--Federal, State, and local--to deal with the threat of terrorism. \nThis eradication of Osama bin Laden is an important step, but there is \nstill much more to be done in terms of fighting this battle. I take \npride in the work that has been done, a pride that is shared, I am \ncertain, by every resident of Illinois and people all across the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, every one of us knows where we were at the \nmoment we heard the tragic news of the attacks on this Nation on \nSeptember 11. And I trust that all of us will long treasure the moment \nwe first heard the great news last night that Osama bin Laden, after a \ndecade of determined\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\nand diligent work by our Armed Forces and by the men and women of the \nAmerican intelligence community, had at long last been captured and \nkilled. The successful operation by the Navy SEALs team yesterday was \nthe capstone of 10 years of distinguished and honorable service by our \nbrave men and women in uniform.\n  In Afghanistan, in Iraq, and around the world, literally tens of \nthousands of Americans over this past decade have faced battle \nresolutely, carried out their mission with valor, and made all of us \nproud. When I visited our troops in Afghanistan in February, I saw \nfirsthand their determination, their level of professionalism, and \ntheir commitment to this important and long task.\n  I hope, as we face the days ahead and the uncertainty of what will be \nthe path forward in our continuing conflict with al-Qaida and all who \nwould do us harm, there is no doubt about the determination of the \nAmerican people about our resolve to pursue, capture, and kill all who \nwould plan attacks on the United States and on innocent civilians \naround the world.\n  I wanted to pause today and simply reflect on all who have sacrificed \nso much. There are hundreds of Delawareans currently serving in \nAfghanistan, some on active duty, some with the Reserves, some with the \nNational Guard. My wife and I and our family pray every night, as so \nmany do in our Nation, for those who serve us overseas, including \npersonal friends of ours, Brooke James, Troy Baucus, and Jeff \nSteinberg, who are folks who are on repeat deployment, whose families \nwe know, along with hundreds of others. They have made the sacrifice of \ndeployment. There are many others--17 in the case of Delaware--who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in this decade of conflict in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, including SGT Sean Moudy, who grew up next door to me, and \nSrA Liz Loncki, the first Delaware woman lost in combat, and many \nothers who are mourned by their families and communities.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins a series of \nsix hearings on our path forward in Afghanistan and a review of our \nrelationship with Pakistan, our alliances in the region, and the \nincredible investments that we need to continue to make to sustain our \neffort to take the fight to those around the world who would do us \nharm.\n  I wanted to come to the floor today and, for a brief moment, pause \nand think about what this historic moment means to the American people.\n  It was just a decade ago in the attacks of 9/11 that a group of \ndetermined and hardened terrorists, led by Osama bin Laden, believed \nthey had struck a blow, believed they had hit their target when four \naircraft that had been commandeered were turned into missiles and aimed \nat principal targets that they thought were the centerpieces of \nAmerica. Two of them succeeded in striking the Twin Towers--knocking \ndown columns of steel and glass. One of them succeeded in striking the \nPentagon and setting ablaze the center of our military might. One more, \nwere it not for the intervention of incredibly brave American citizens, \nmight well have struck this very building we meet in today or the White \nHouse.\n  They did succeed in tragically taking thousands of innocent lives. \nThey did succeed in striking a tough blow to our economy. They did \nsucceed in surprising us with an unexpectedly vicious attack on \nthousands of innocent civilians. But they utterly failed to strike at \nour spirit. They failed to knock down our resolve. I know that around \nthe world many marveled while thousands of folks flooded out of the \nPentagon and the Twin Towers, as hundreds of determined volunteers and \npublic servants flooded in, risking their lives and, in many cases, \nsacrificing their own lives to try to save some of their fellow \ncountrymen. Most important, in the months afterward, millions of \nAmericans took up the cause of volunteering to rebuild and restore our \ncommunities, and thousands volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces.\n  It is their resolve, their commitment, their professionalism, the \ngreat leadership of our Armed Forces, and the decisions made by \nPresident Obama and Vice President Biden in leading our Nation today \nthat have brought us to this moment.\n  I want to close by saying that ultimately those who struck us on 9/11 \nmissed their target. They misunderstood our spirit and our resolve as a \nnation. Last night, on the other side of the world, justice was served. \nThe tragedy of those who were lost and the sacrifice of those who chose \nto serve have never been forgotten. But last night, on the other side \nof the world, justice was served.\n  Let there be no doubt among anyone around the world who would wish us \nharm, who would today plot to carry forward the terrible terrorist \ndreams of this now-dead man, Osama bin Laden: Our spirit is not broken. \nOur resolve is unbending. Justice will be served.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, John D. Rockefeller once said, ``I do not \nthink there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as \nthe quality of perseverance. It overcomes almost everything, even \nnature.''\n  The hunt for bin Laden seemed to battle against the force of nature \nitself. And the perseverance of those that hunted bin Laden--our brave \ntroops, our intelligence officers, and countless other Americans--was \nessential to their success.\n  The brave Americans that hunted bin Laden battled a vast expanse of \nungoverned territory across Afghanistan and Pakistan, central Asia's \nfrigid mountains, endless villages in the most remote part of the \nglobe. Their mission at times seemed impossible.\n  But the perseverance of America's bin Laden hunters helped them \nconquer these challenges: perseverance; hard work; quiet dedication to \nduty. So many Americans worked so hard for so long to make this \npossible. I am so grateful to all those that serve, these quiet \nprofessionals have made all Americans very, very proud.\n  Today, we must pause to reflect on what this means. We remember the \nsuffering of the families who lost loved ones on 9/11. We remember the \nsacrifice by our troops serving in harm's way to keep us safe.\n  It is fitting that bin Laden lived long enough to witness the utter \nfailure of the strategy he masterminded. From his hideout, he saw a \npeaceful revolution in Tunisia. He watched as millions of young \nEgyptians peacefully and proudly demanded change. He learned of \npeaceful protesters embracing democracy, refusing violent extremism in \nevery corner of the Middle East--without bombs, without violence, using \ntheir intellect, their courage, and their pride, these young protesters \ntook a path bin Laden had failed to imagine--a path of peaceful, \ndemocratic change. The future of the Arab world is now in their hands.\n  The success of these young democrats stands in stark contrast to the \nideology of hate and violence that bin Laden dedicated his life to. How \nfitting it is that he saw this Arab spring with his own eyes; that he \ncould witness such a thorough defeat to violent extremism.\n  We must work hard in the coming years to see that the young \ndemonstrators in Tahrir square and across the Middle East succeed. \nTheir success will erase the narrative that radical Islam seeks to \nwrite. These peaceful demonstrations must lead to change and violent \nextremism must continue to fail.\n  Looking forward, we face great challenges across the Middle East and \nCentral Asia. Osama bin Laden's hideout location raises serious \nquestions about our relationship with Pakistan.\n  Since 2002, the United States has provided over $18 billion in \nforeign assistance to Pakistan. In 2009, Congress authorized up to $1.5 \nbillion a year for civilian assistance to Pakistan from 2010 through \n2014. U.S. economic and military assistance to Pakistan was the highest \nof any other country in 2009 except Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In spite of these massive investments, the U.S.-Pakistan relationship \ncontinues to fray. We seem to be near a breaking point. The Pew \nResearch Center found that in 2010 the ``favorable rating'' of U.S. \namong Pakistanis hit 17 percent, the lowest opinion of the U.S. among \nany population on earth.\n  During a visit to Pakistan last year, I made it clear to President \nZardari and General Kayani that Pakistan must do more to eliminate safe \nhavens within their own borders. We cannot accept excuses. We need \nresults.\n  Without progress in Pakistan, we cannot succeed in Afghanistan. \nAmerican troops continue to serve bravely\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\nunder the most difficult conditions every day, without weekends or \nholidays, carrying heavy loads over mountain passes, hunting down the \nTaliban and protecting villages.\n  This July, the U.S. will begin to hand over security responsibilities \nto the Army and police force of Afghanistan. I urge the President to \nmake this transition robust, orderly, and persistent until all of our \ntroops come home. It is time for the Afghan government to step up and \ntake responsibility for this mission. American troops should not be \ndoing the work that Afghans should be doing for themselves.\n  Beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan, our world is rapidly changing. \nPopular movements are transforming the Middle East. Breathtaking \nChinese growth rates are reshaping East Asia. New technology is \nbringing citizens across the globe closer together: to cooperate, and \nto compete.\n  Amid these these changes we are facing enormous challenges at home--\nmassive deficits, bitter partisanship, rising health care costs, high \nunemployment. We need to work together to make sure the 21st Century is \nthe American century. We need to focus on improving education, \nrebuilding roads and bridges, and making the American economy the best \nplace to do business in the world.\n  The death of Osama bin Laden marks a turning point in history. Today \nis indeed a great day for America. I salute the brave men and women who \nmade this day possible. My thoughts are with the hundreds of Montanans \nserving our country overseas. May God Bless America and may He keep our \nbrave troops safe.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is a memorable day in our Nation's \nhistory. Osama bin Laden, the man responsible for the deaths of \nthousands of innocent victims, including so many Americans who were \nlost on September 11, 2001, has been killed.\n  I commend President Obama and his national security team for the \ncareful planning of this operation, as well as the members of our \nintelligence agencies who have spent years collecting information that \nmade it possible.\n  As many of us know, when the President nominated Leon Panetta to be \nthe Director of the CIA, he told him that his first directive must be \nto find Osama bin Laden. I have known Director Panetta for nearly 30 \nyears. I know this is a man who, when he takes on a task, takes it very \nseriously. I commend him and all those men and women who have worked \nwith him on this. I know he gave singular attention to this issue.\n  I join Americans across the country in praising the brave team that \nstormed the compound where bin Laden appears to have been hiding for \nyears. They completed their mission without loss of American lives, \nwhile taking care to avoid civilian casualties.\n  I have had the privilege of watching the special forces train. I have \nseen the tremendous level of training the SEALS and the Joint Special \nOperational Command undergo to prepare for dangerous missions like the \none conducted yesterday. They are remarkable people. Every member of \nthat team had to go into the compound yesterday knowing that they may \nnot return.\n  We remember today the victims of all of the attacks perpetrated by \nthe man who more than any other represents the face of international \nterrorism. The September 11 attacks are at the forefront of our minds. \nNearly 3,000 lives were lost, including those victims of the World \nTrade Center, in the Pentagon, and on the four airplanes. I remember \nthat day as vividly as though it were yesterday.\n  We remember with gratitude the first responders who rushed in to \nsaves lives, even knowing they were risking their own. Many died while \ntrying to save others in amazing acts of heroism. And we remember the \npassengers on Flight 93, who put the lives of Americans on the ground \nahead of their own.\n  We also remember the 6 victims of the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing, and the victims of the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania \nin 1998, which left 224 dead, including 12 Americans. We remember the \nlives of the 17 sailors killed in the bombing of the USS Cole in \nOctober of 2000. The death of Osama bin Laden will not bring them back \nto us, but we all hope it may help bring closure to family members and \nfriends who still grieve their loss.\n  Today we remember the lives of the brave American servicemembers who \nhave served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the sacrifices \nmade by their families, who mourn their loss, or help them recover from \ntheir injuries.\n  Vermonters have answered the call to serve--some for multiple \ndeployments with the Vermont National Guard and many most recently with \nthe 86th Infantry Brigade, which returned last December. Of course, we \nthank the brave men and women who have worked tirelessly to protect \nAmerican soil from additional attacks.\n  Osama bin Laden cloaked his attacks in anti-American rhetoric, but \nhis murderous and criminal path took the lives of innocents around the \nworld, including many of his own faith. He proved himself to be a cold-\nblooded murderer whose indiscriminate attacks led to the deaths or \nmaiming of Muslims and people of other faiths all around the world. \nRegrettably, he leaves behind followers who are committed to the same \nmessage of hate and destruction. They have no regard for the values \nthat unite the rest of humanity in common cause.\n  President Obama pledged that we would bring bin Laden to justice. \nLast night, we learned that bin Laden has suffered the consequences of \nhis atrocities. Justice has been served. Now I hope that Americans will \nclaim this moment to stand side by side, as we did in the weeks and \nmonths following the September 11 attacks. We must transcend our \ndifferences and stand in unity, unified in our support for the victims \nof bin Laden's crimes and in our resolve to keep our great Nation safe. \nWe should also stand united in our commitment to the rights and \nprinciples that define us as a democratic nation that respects the rule \nof law. That respect is what distinguishes us from those who seek to \nharm us. It is what will ultimately enable us to succeed against them, \nand it is what people around the world expect of America.\n  Regrettably, the September 11 attacks, and other acts of \ninternational terrorism, have often been used to justify policies which \nstrayed dangerously from those rights and principles. This has damaged \nour global reputation, hurt our credibility, and made it more difficult \nto build the broadest alliances against terrorism.\n  We must also remember, as so many military leaders have told us, that \nmilitary force, while at times necessary, as it was in the operation \nagainst bin Laden, is not in and of itself a counterterrorism strategy.\n  We have seen how, nearly 10 years after 9/11, and after spending \nhundreds of billions of dollars to combat terrorism, the recruitment of \nterrorists among disaffected youth continues apace around the world, \nincluding in our own country.\n  We have also seen how much more we have to do to counter the \nmisperceptions and misinformation fomented by extremists about the \nUnited States and our intentions. Addressing these challenges should be \na priority as we go forward.\n  I urge all Americans to support our President in this continuing \neffort, and I urge all of us in Congress to join together for the good \nof the country and all Americans.\n  It is remarkable what this country accomplishes, and how strong and \nbrave we are, when we stand together. Now is the time to stand \ntogether. We have done it before. We can do it now. And we are a better \ncountry when we do it.\n  Mr. President, I see the very distinguished Senator from California \non the floor. I yield to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for his eloquent \nstatement he made about the capture and killing of Osama bin Laden and \nthe impact and the need for us to come together as one Nation.\n  Mr. President, almost 10 years ago after the horrific attacks of 9/\n11, I voted to go after Osama bin Laden, as all of us did in the Senate \nat that time, to make sure justice would prevail. Now we know and the \nworld knows that Osama bin Laden has paid the ultimate price for what \nhe did.\n  His death does not lessen the tragic loss of all those killed by al-\nQaida or\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\nthe pain of their loved ones, but it closes a chapter on his \nunspeakable acts, and there were more than one. They go back to October \n2000. They go back to 1998 when their operatives attacked our people on \nthe USS Cole and the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and there are \nother attacks that occurred as well.\n  What I want to do in a few minutes today is go back to some of the \nthings I said on September 12, 2001, from a different seat, because I \ndid not have much seniority. I was somewhere over on the front row. The \nreason I want to restate and read from the Record as to what I said on \nthat day is because I think it is important for me, for myself, to get \nthe type of closure I wanted to get when I cast that vote to go after \nOsama bin Laden, to go to war and get him. It reminds me of that thirst \nfor justice we all had on that day and that we still have.\n  This is what I said on September 12, 2001:\n\n       Today I rise with pain in my heart and great emotion to \n     offer my prayers and my condolences for the people in this \n     country who have been directly hit by an act of war, people \n     in the State of my birth, New York, looking at that skyline, \n     the people who work at the Pentagon every day who have chosen \n     to work to protect our Nation, and the people of California, \n     my State, who were on those planes that were hijacked and, of \n     course, to every other individual who was directly affected \n     and to all of us who have been affected.\n\n  I went on to say this:\n\n       One of our colleagues said we remember where we were when \n     tragedy hit this country. I remember too many things--not as \n     many perhaps as Senators who are older, but I certainly \n     remember where I was when I saw John Kennedy go down and \n     Martin Luther King go down, the Challenger disaster, and \n     yesterday the image of those planes, commercial and American \n     planes, four of them going down, crashing into buildings, \n     being used as lethal weapons against our people--an image \n     that has shaken us but has not shaken our resolve.\n\n  I went on to say:\n\n       I am going to make a very strong statement. When we look \n     back into history and what happened in Bosnia, people \n     suffered genocide because of their nationality, and to the \n     Holocaust, people suffered annihilation because of their \n     nationality. People were killed yesterday because they were \n     Americans. People were killed not because they were bad \n     people--they were good people--they were killed because they \n     were Americans.\n\n  That is what I said on the day after 9/11/2001. Then I said:\n\n       It is time for us to say we will fight and stand up for \n     them and their memories. We will take a stand against \n     inhumanity that occurred on our own soil. We are resolved to \n     honor those who died. We are resolved to make our Nation as \n     safe as it can be from those acts. We are resolved to hold \n     those who planned these attacks and who harbor these people \n     absolutely 100 percent accountable. We will hold them \n     accountable.\n\n  That is what I said on September 12, 2001.\n\n       They must pay because this is the test of a civilized \n     nation. We lead the civilized nations of the world. We will \n     not back down.\n       I stand proudly with my colleagues on both sides of the \n     aisle and with our President. We will be resolved to do \n     everything--and do it well and do it right--to bring justice \n     in the world.\n\n  Later that day, to the press I said:\n\n       I've never been at ground zero in a war, but, after this, \n     war is not an overstatement. The people who perpetrated this \n     are the scum of the Earth, and their views, their philosophy, \n     their version of civilization, if you can call it that, will \n     not stand.\n\n  I am going to conclude my remarks by saying that in my heart, the \nflames of justice are burning bright today. I thank our President for \nhis resolve, for ordering this attack--a successful attack--on bin \nLaden's compound. To the bravest of the brave, I understand they were \nNavy Seals who went in there, not thinking 1 second about their own \nlives. The fact that the President ordered this, that he kept it quiet \nwhile he had to be distracted from things that, let us say, he should \nnot have been distracted with--but he did it. He kept his focus.\n  It is an important moment in our history. The message is going out to \nanyone who would hurt us: They will be held accountable. They can run, \nbut they are never going to hide from us and from justice.\n  We know we cannot let down our guard. We know that. But we also know \nwe are not going to cower in a corner because we are fearful that \nsomebody may try to hurt us. We are prepared. We are going to do \neverything we can to be prepared. But this is quite a moment.\n  I will never forget seeing the Pentagon on fire, flames shooting out. \nI was in an office right near here and looked out the window. We were \ntold to evacuate the Capitol. That is seared in my memory.\n  Anyone who cares about justice, anyone who cares about the truth, \nanybody who cares about fairness and responsibility has to say that \nyesterday was a day when justice was done.\n  I am going to close by reading the names of the Californians who lost \ntheir lives because I told their families I will honor each one in \nevery way I can. I think that ending my statement by paying tribute to \nthem is important: David Angell of Pasadena; Lynn Angell of Pasadena; \nSeima Aoyama of Los Angeles; Barbara Aresteguis of Los Angeles; Melissa \nBarnes of Redlands; Alan Beaven of Emeryville; Berry Berenson of Los \nAngeles; Carolyn Beug of Los Angeles; Yeneneh Betru of Burbank; Mark \nBingham of San Francisco; Deora Bodley of Santa Clara; Touri Bolourchi \nof Beverly Hills; Daniel Brandhourst of Hollywood Hills; David \nBrandhourst of Hollywood Hills; Thomas Burnett of San Ramon; Suzanne \nCalley of San Martin; Jefferey Collman of Novato; Dorothy Dearaujo of \nLong Beach; Darlene Flagg of Corona; Dee Flagg of Corona; Wilson Flagg \nof Corona; Lisa Frost of Rancho Santa Margarita; Ronald Gamboa of Los \nAngeles; Andrew Garcia of Portola Valley; Edmund Glazer of Chatsworth; \nLauren Grandcolas of San Rafael; Andrew Curry Green of Los Angeles; \nRichard Guadagno of Humboldt County; Stanley Hall of Rancho Palos \nVerdes; Gerald Hardacre of Carlsbad; John Hofer of Bellflower; Stephen \nHyland of Claremont; Barbara Keating of Palm Springs; Chandler Keller \nof El Segundo; Jude Larson of Los Angeles; Natalie Larson of Los \nAngeles; Daniel John Lee of Van Nuys; Maclovio Lopez of Norwalk; Dora \nMenchaca of Santa Monica; Nicole Miller of San Jose; Laurie A.

The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe tremendous news our country received last night from President \nObama.\n  Almost 10 years ago on September 11, 2001, I too remember looking out \na window in the Nation's Capitol and seeing the black smoke billowing \nin the air over the Pentagon. On that day, America was brutally \nattacked by terrorists who took aim at the financial, military, and \npolitical centers of our country. And although these evil men killed \nthousands of Americans and caused great devastation, they were unable \nto do what they wanted to do most: break our country's spirit.\n  We came together as a community. We mourned, we rallied around the \nfamilies of those who were lost, and we struck back against those who \ndid us harm.\n  Last night's tremendous news is the close of a major chapter in the \nwar on terror. It is a great day for justice and for all Americans to \nremember the strength and resolve of our Nation. I applaud the superb \nwork of our intelligence communities and the work of this \nadministration that brought the mastermind of the worst attack in our \nNation's history to justice.\n  But today I want to pay special tribute to the men and women in \nuniform who have answered the call to serve after that fateful day 10 \nyears ago. Since the attacks on New York and Washington, DC, more than \n2 million American servicemembers have stepped forward to serve our \nNation. Nearly half of these servicemembers have done more than one \ntour of duty abroad. Many who have served have come from the ranks of \nour National Guard and Reserves and have turned a part-time commitment \ninto a full-time job protecting our Nation. These men and women who \nchose to join our all-\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\nvolunteer force come from all walks of life and from every corner of \nour Nation. In my home State, thousands have come forward to serve \nwhile thousands more have come to Washington State to train and make \ntheir home at our major military installations. These servicemembers \nhave done everything we have asked of them and more.\n  While it appears that yesterday's raid came without American \ncasualties, that, of course, has not been the case for so many missions \nin our fight against terrorism. Since 9/11, nearly 6,000 servicemembers \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, and more than 40,000 \nhave been wounded. For many of our servicemembers, the scars of their \nservice are visible and for others they are invisible. Many have lost \nthose closest to them on the battlefield and have come home with a \nburden that few others know. Others will need a lifetime of care from \nthe Department of Defense and the VA. All have left families behind, \nwho love and miss them, to protect our country. We cannot forget these \nfamilies and the fact they have sacrificed right by our servicemembers' \nside. Moving from base to base, giving up jobs, putting their loved \nones and their country before their own needs is a gift we must repay.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, it is \nmy job to ensure that the lifetime of care that these servicemembers \nand their caregivers need will be delivered.\n  So, today, as we appropriately take pride in the most significant \nvictory yet in our fight against al-Qaida and terrorism, we should also \ntake pause to honor all of the veterans and Active-Duty servicemembers \nwho have paved the way to this day. We must also remember that this \ntremendous victory has come with a tremendous cost, a cost that we must \nbear as a nation for many years to come as our servicemembers return \nhome.\n  Mr. President, this is, of course, also a particularly meaningful day \nfor the thousands of Americans who lost a family member or a friend or \na loved one on September 11. We know this news can't bring back their \nloved ones, but our hope is that it can help ease the pain they live \nwith each day.\n  Like many Americans, my first thought last night after this news was \nof the victims and their families, and my thoughts and prayers remain \nwith them during this time.\n  Going forward we must remain vigilant and focused on the protection \nof the American people from terrorism wherever it may be, and we must \ncontinue to work in the interest of peace and security for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the men \nand women of our military for a courageous mission, and our \nintelligence community for accurate and important intelligence.\n  I would like to congratulate the President for his persistence in \nbringing a mass murderer to justice, and I would especially like to \nsalute the men and women of our military services who, for the last 10 \nyears, have fought the indispensable consequences of the actions of \nterrorism.\n  All of us, as has been said by many Senators today, especially have \nin our hearts and minds the families of the victims of 9/11 and hope \nthat somehow, in some small way, this event helps bring some closure to \nwhat has happened to their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2568-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2568-S2569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EASTERN TENNESSEE DISASTERS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have just returned from visiting east \nTennessee where there were devastating tornadoes last week. The \nPresident, at the request of our entire congressional delegation, has \ndeclared four of our counties--Washington, Greene, Hamilton, and \nBradley--as disaster areas, and we thank him for his prompt attention \nto that.\n  I visited today northern Hamilton County, just north of Chattanooga, \nnorth of where the new Volkswagen plant will be located. In Tennessee \nlast week 36 men and women lost their lives as a result of these \nstorms. The area I visited is one of the two areas most affected, the \nother being Washington and Greene Counties, where our Governor was \ntoday.\n  Someone asked me following my visit if anything about it shocked me. \nI said: It always shocks me when I see the consequences of a \ndevastating flood or especially a massive tornado. This one had winds \nof nearly 200 miles an hour. Wherever you stand, you try to put \nyourself in the shoes of someone who might have been there when the \ntornado came through and try to imagine what it would be like. You see \nthis funnel coming and know it will only interfere with your life for \nabout 20 or 30 seconds; but after that, it will all be devastation. \nThere is no way you cannot be shocked by it, and there is no way I can \nput myself in the shoes of those who were there.\n  I saw one man who was there, Arthur Bates, 70 years old, and I saw \nhis house which was completely demolished. His upright piano was \nupside-down. He told me he had killed a calf and left to take some meat \nto the preacher. He had been gone for about 5 minutes when the tornado \nhit his house.\n  Not so lucky was another family not very far away. All of the members \nof that family were killed except for an 8-year-old boy who was found \nin a tree and survived.\n  Not far away, several families had signs that said: The Lord was with \nus. Surely, it had to seem to them providential that there could be \nsuch devastation almost in their front yards and yet their homes would \nbe safe.\n  Ironically, today, as I went from Nashville to Chattanooga, I was \nreading about a commemoration of the floods that hit Tennessee almost \nexactly 1 year ago--on May 2, 2010. These were floods that affected \ncounties from Nashville to Memphis. In Nashville alone there was $2 \nbillion worth of damage. People are still recovering from that flood a \nyear later. Businesses have closed in some cases, but most have opened. \nThe Grand Ole Opry was shut, but it was opened again. The Opryland \nHotel is open again.\n  Nashville is thriving again, and people are coming back to Nashville. \nBut the commemoration today was for the large number of families in \nTennessee who are hurting and some who are still in recovery.\n  Then, if that weren't enough, in the western part of our State, along \nthe Mississippi River, we have reports that the water is rising and \nwill rise to levels that will be higher than at any time since the \nflood of 1937. People are already preparing shelters. Tributaries of \nthe Mississippi are already rising.\n  On Friday I will be going to Memphis to meet with the Army Corps of \nEngineers and local officials to make sure we are doing all we can. \nNone of us in the Federal Government believe we can make anyone whole \nafter a disaster like this, but we can help. As I said to those I saw \ntoday in Chattanooga, north of Chattanooga, there is a telephone number \nto call--2-1-1--which is a local number for help. There is a FEMA \nnumber to call--1-800-621-FEMA (3362). We found in the flooding of a \nyear ago from Nashville to Memphis that was a big help to many \nTennesseans. I hope the same will be true in east Tennessee and across \nour State today.\n  A year ago Tennesseans distinguished themselves by not looting and \ncomplaining, but by cleaning up and helping one another. I saw that \nagain today in Hamilton County. The sheriff told me within a few hours \nafter the devastation there were 500 or so men with chainsaws out \nclearing debris and trees from the roads and from the yards helping one \nanother.\n  So, Mr. President, I speak today on behalf of all Members of the \nSenate in expressing to those in Tennessee our concern and our \nwillingness to continue to do all we can to help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing these remarks a summary of the actions that we are taking in \nthe events that are happening in Tennessee, as well as a letter from \nthe congressional delegation to the President requesting disaster \nrelief, which he granted promptly, and another to the general who was \npresident of the Mississippi River Commission urging him to take every \naction possible to help the communities along the Mississippi River as \nwater rises there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2011.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the State of Tennessee, we \n     respectfully request that you declare a federal disaster in \n     Bradley, Greene, Hamilton, and Washington counties as a \n     result of the severe storms, flash flooding and tornadoes \n     that struck the state beginning on April 25, 2011.\n       Governor Bill Haslam has requested federal disaster \n     assistance to respond to the devastation caused throughout \n     Tennessee due to this historic tornado outbreak, and we \n     expect a separate request will be forthcoming to respond to \n     the flooding along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. \n     Flooding in many of our communities will only get worse in \n     the coming days, and the unprecedented river stages are \n     threatening the entire levee system.\n       State and local officials are only beginning to be able to \n     assess the level of damage to infrastructure, private \n     property and our economy. Many of the communities affected by \n     these storms and rising flood waters are the same areas \n     devastated by the May 2010 floods. In addition to all of the \n     homes and businesses destroyed by the tornadoes, the flooding \n     along the Mississippi River is forecast to exceed the great \n     flood of 1937 in some areas, and reach the third highest \n     level on record in Memphis by May 10.\n       Federal assistance is critical to help our state and local \n     governments initiate recovery efforts and to start repairing \n     infrastructure. Like so many areas throughout the Southeast \n     ravaged by these storms, our communities are overwhelmed by \n     the destruction and need federal assistance. Public and \n     Individual Assistance in Bradley, Greene, Hamilton, and \n     Washington counties will help communities with debris removal \n     and make victims eligible for a number of vital disaster \n     assistance programs. The Tennessee delegation and state and \n     local officials stand ready to work together with federal \n     officials to make sure that Tennesseans receive the help they \n     need to get back on their feet.\n       Thank you for your expedited consideration of our State's \n     request, and we will provide you with more information about \n     our State's needs as information is available.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lamar Alexander,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Bob Corker,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Steve Cohen,\n       Congressman.\n     Marsha Blackburn,\n       Congressman.\n     Jim Cooper,\n       Congressman.\n     Chuck Fleischmann,\n       Congressman.\n     Stephen L.

Gen. Michael J. Walsh,\n     President, Mississippi River Commission, Vicksburg, MS.\n       Dear Major General Walsh: We urgently request you take \n     every action possible to protect communities in Tennessee and \n     throughout the Mississippi River Valley from rising \n     floodwaters. The State of Tennessee has already declared a \n     State of Emergency, and if necessary, we implore you to take \n     preventative action rather than wait until it is too late to \n     act.\n       The rising flood waters in the Mississippi River are \n     historical in context, threatening approximately 110 miles of \n     Tennessee riverbank. If the Mississippi River overtops or \n     breaches the levees along Tennessee's river banks, thousands \n     of people and acres of farmland are at tremendous risk of \n     flooding.\n       We understand the Governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon, is \n     seeking a temporary restraining order in the U.S. District \n     Court to prevent the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from \n     artificially crevassing the levee at Birds Point and using \n     the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway.\n       While we understand that you are facing an extremely \n     difficult decision, we are concerned about the potential \n     devastation that could be felt by nearly 160,000 Tennesseans. \n     It is our understanding that the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals \n     in the case of Story v. Marsh, 732 F.2d 1375, 1383 (8th Cir. \n     1984), regarding the operation of the Birds Point-New Madrid \n     floodway, stated that the operation of the floodway is within \n     the discretion of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We hope \n     that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will move forward with \n     crevassing the levee, if such a decision becomes necessary.\n       It is our sincere hope that there will not be a need to \n     artificially crevasse the Birds Point levee, but we urge you \n     not to delay and to take appropriate actions to protect the \n     people and property of Tennesseans that live along the \n     Mississippi River, as well as those throughout the \n     Mississippi Valley.\n           Sincerely,\n     Senator Lamar Alexander.\n     Senator Bob Corker.\n     Congressman Stephen L. Fincher.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Roy Bale Dalton, Jr., \nof Florida, to be U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of \nFlorida, and Kevin Hunter Sharp, of Tennessee, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate, equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we return from Easter recess, judicial \nvacancies around the country remain at historically alarming levels, as \nthey have for the last 3 years. With 1 out of every 9 Federal \njudgeships still vacant, and judicial vacancies around the country \nremaining at 95, we have serious work to do.\n  I thank the majority leader for scheduling votes on two more \nnominations to fill judicial emergency vacancies. Roy Bale Dalton, Jr., \nhas been nominated to fill a judgeship in the Middle District of \nFlorida and Kevin Hunter Sharp has been nominated to fill a judgeship \nin the Middle District of Tennessee. Each nomination was reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee more than a month ago. They both \ncould be confirmed unanimously.\n  With cooperation from both sides of the aisle, the Senate could \nconsider the additional 13 judicial nominees ready for final Senate \naction. I had hoped that the Senate would have considered a number of \nthem before taking its Easter recess 2 weeks ago. Among those nominees \nare another five to fill additional judicial emergency vacancies, three \nof them reported by the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, \nincluding one which was reported unanimously but remains stalled on the \ncalendar awaiting final action.\n  We should certainly have proceeded with the judicial nominees for \nwhom there is no opposition and no reason for delay. That would have \nallowed us to confirm another seven nominees. They have all been \nthoroughly reviewed by the members of the Judiciary Committee in a \nhearing and have all been recommended to the Senate unanimously. They \nare Arenda L. Wright Allen to fill a vacancy in the Eastern District of \nVirginia; Michael Francis Urbanski, to fill a vacancy in the Western \nDistrict of Virginia; Clair C. Cecchi to fill a vacancy in New Jersey; \nEsther Salas to fill another vacancy in New Jersey; Paul Oetken and \nPaul Engelmayer to fill vacancies in the Southern District of New York; \nand Ramona Manglona to fill a vacancy in the Mariana Islands. The \nVirginia nominees have been waiting for final consideration longer than \nthose nominees who are being allowed to be considered today.\n  Two of the nominees currently awaiting a Senate vote have twice been \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee and have twice been reported with\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\nstrong bipartisan support, first last year and again in February. They \nare Susan Carney of Connecticut to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and Michael \nSimon to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the District Court in \nOregon. Two of the nominations have been reported favorably by the \nCommittee three times--that of Goodwin Liu to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit and that of Jack McConnell, reported with \nbipartisan support to fill a vacancy for the District of Rhode Island. \nAnother currently pending nomination has been reported favorably four \ntimes, that of Judge Edward Chen to a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nNorthern District of California. All of these nominations have long \nbeen ready for a Senate vote. So is the nomination of Caitlin Halligan \nto fill a judicial vacancy on the DC Circuit.\n  All 15 of the pending nominees have a strong commitment to the rule \nof law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. All should \nhave an up-or-down vote after being considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee, and without weeks and months of needless delay.\n  If we join together, we can make real progress by considering all of \nthe judicial nominations now on the Senate's Executive Calendar. If the \nSenate were to take favorable action on the 15 judicial nominations \ncurrently pending and awaiting final Senate consideration, we could \nreduce vacancies to below 90. In fact, we would be able to reduce them \nto 80 for the first time since July 2009.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many, \nand they have persisted for too long. Whereas the Democratic majority \nin the Senate reduced vacancies from 110 to 60 in President Bush's \nfirst 2 years, judicial vacancies still number 95 more than 26 months \ninto President Obama's term. By now, judicial vacancies should have \nbeen cut in half, but we have barely kept up with attrition.\n  Regrettably, the Senate has not reduced vacancies dramatically as we \ndid during the Bush administration. In fact, the Senate has reversed \ncourse during the Obama administration, with the slow pace of \nconfirmations keeping judicial vacancies at crisis levels. Over the 8 \nyears of the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2009, we reduced \njudicial vacancies from 110 to a low of 34. That has now been reversed, \nwith vacancies staying above 90 since August 2009. The vacancy rate--\nwhich we reduced from 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term \nto 6 percent by this date in President Bush's third year, and \nultimately to less than 4 percent in 2008--has now swelled to nearly 11 \npercent.\n  The two nominations we consider today demonstrate that there is no \nreason the Senate cannot consider and confirm the President's \nnominations to the Federal bench in a timely manner. Both nominees show \nPresident Obama's commitment to working with home State Senators of \nboth parties to identify superbly qualified nominees in districts with \nvacancies. I thank Senators Nelson, Rubio, Alexander and Corker for \nworking with President Obama on these nominations and congratulate them \nalong with the nominees and their families.\n  I have thanked the Ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, for his cooperation this year. I am glad to see him \necho my call to turn the page and end the days of tit for tat on \njudicial nominations. That is what I did from the first days of the \nBush administration in spite of how President Clinton's nominees had \nbeen treated.\n  My friend from Iowa often speaks about the positive action we are \ntaking on nominations. In order to make these statements meaningful, \nthe Senate needs to consider and confirm the 15 judicial nominations \nthat are awaiting final consideration and action by the Senate. That \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee is doing its work is good, but to send \njudicial nominations to the Senate is not enough. It means nothing if \nthey are not considered by the Senate. More than a dozen continue to \nlanguish without positive action by the Senate. Some have been stalled \nsince last year and one from two years ago. They all are waiting for \nwhat I would call ``positive action.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a column by Ashley Belleau, the National \nPresident of the Federal Bar Association be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement, which, in part, says:\n\n       The business of America is business, and when business \n     can't figure out if their patents are good, their contracts \n     are good, they can't figure out what to do about their tax \n     situation, things bog down. Businesses need a strong rule of \n     law and prompt rulings by judges. Vacancies desperately need \n     to be filled; new judges desperately need to be added. We owe \n     that to our citizens. We owe that to our Constitution. We owe \n     that to the rule of law. And we owe it to the cause of \n     justice.\n       Prompt and thoughtful justice, not endless delay, is what \n     the American people expect from their legal system. It is \n     what we deserve. It is what due process requires. And it is \n     the most cost-efficient approach to the resolution of \n     lawsuits in our nation's courts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the \nArizona Range News entitled ``Lack of Federal Judges a Serious Issue'' \nbe printed in the Record at the end of my statement. It mentions a \nresolution by the Phoenix Chapter of the Federal Bar Association urging \nArizona's congressional representatives to work to fill the vacancies \nplaguing the Arizona courts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate must do better. We must work together to ensure \nthat the Federal judiciary has the judges it needs to provide justice \nto Americans in courts throughout the country. Judicial vacancies \nthroughout the country hinder the Federal judiciary's ability to \nfulfill its constitutional role. They create a backlog of cases that \nprevents people from having their day in court in a timely fashion. \nThis is unacceptable. That is why Chief Justice Roberts, Attorney \nGeneral Holder, and the President of the United States have spoken out \nand urged the Senate to act.\n  Just before the Senate adjourned for its two-week Easter recess, the \nWhite House Counsel spoke to the American Bar Association about the \nneed for a sense of greater urgency in filling these judicial \nvacancies. I hope that we will follow this advice and make real \nprogress to ensure that the Federal courts are able to function for all \nAmericans.\n  We have a long way to go to do as well as we did during President \nBush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial nominations, \nbringing the vacancy rate down from 10 percent to 4 percent. We \nconfirmed 100 othose judicial nominations during the 17 months I was \nChairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. So far, well \ninto President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only been \nallowed to consider 79 of President Obama's Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees. We remain well short of the benchmarks we set \nduring the Bush administration; 79 is well short of 205.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Apr. 27, 2011]\n\n     Business, Defendants Harmed in Cost-Cutting at Federal Courts\n\n                         (By Ashley L. Belleau)\n\n       Just as budgets matter, so does justice. The two are \n     connected. Making sure we have enough judges in our federal \n     courts will save dollars, not waste them.\n       The insufficient number of judges in our federal courts is \n     costing our country in dollars and protracted litigation. \n     Manpower and money are foolishly wasted. Record caseloads in \n     many federal judicial districts cause trials to be delayed, \n     especially civil cases. This is not good for the state of \n     justice in our nation.\n       The fact that we don't have enough judges to decide \n     promptly the federal civil and criminal lawsuits in our \n     country owes itself to the Congress and the president. Both \n     have failed to create enough judgeships in high-caseload \n     areas of the country, like California and the border courts \n     in Texas. Both have failed to keep the process moving by \n     timely providing capable, qualified individuals to fill \n     judgeships as they open up due to retirement, death or \n     resignations.\n       As a result our federal court system is bursting at the \n     seams. With 12 percent of judgeships vacant, temporary \n     judgeships expiring, and more courts in emergency mode than \n     ever, there is an unprecedented crisis in our third branch of \n     government. The phrase ``justice delayed is justice denied'' \n     describes the dire situation in many federal courthouses. \n     Judicial vacancies plainly undermine the capacity of our \n     courts to render justice within a reasonable period of time.\n       Sadly, few Americans understand the impact these judicial \n     vacancies have on their lives. Those of us who try federal \n     cases know\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\n     its impact in the continuance of cases for months, even \n     years, without decision. Vacancies and delay add greater \n     costs to already high litigation expenses. For business \n     clients, these costs get passed on to customers. And when the \n     United States is a party to the case, it means that the \n     public is paying that higher tab.\n       For criminal defendants awaiting trial, it can mean more \n     detention time, adding even more costs to the taxpayer. Just \n     last year, the federal cost of pretrial detention alone was \n     $1.4 billion, according to the Department of Justice.\n       At a recent forum sponsored by the Federal Bar Association \n     and the Brookings Institution, Federal District Judge Royal \n     Furgeson commented on the enormous impact that vacancies on \n     the federal bench have on the pace of litigation and \n     ultimately the American economy: The business of America is \n     business, and when businesses can't figure out if their \n     patents are good, their contracts are good, they can't figure \n     out what to do about their tax situation, things bog down. \n     Businesses need a strong rule of law and prompt rulings by \n     judges. Vacancies desperately need to be filled; new judges \n     desperately need to be added. We owe that to our citizens. We \n     owe that to our Constitution. We owe that to the rule of law. \n     And we owe it to the cause of justice.\n       Prompt and thoughtful justice, not endless delay, is what \n     the American people expect from their legal system. It is \n     what we deserve. It is what due process requires. And it is \n     the most cost-efficient approach to the resolution of \n     lawsuits in our nation's courts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n              [From the Arizona Range News, Apr. 27, 2011]\n\n                 Lack of Federal Judges a Serious Issue\n\n       At the beginning of the year, Judge John Roll, the \n     presiding federal judge in Arizona, was seeking permission to \n     delay bringing felons to trial from the usual 70-day \n     requirement to up to 180 days. That's the same Judge Roll who \n     was gunned down just days later in Tucson by a deranged \n     assassin.\n       Roll termed the problem a ``judicial emergency'' prompted \n     by the number of cases flooding the judicial docket in \n     Arizona and the federal court's inability to handle them all \n     in a speedy fashion.\n       The problem is and remains a lack of judges and court staff \n     to handle the caseload.\n       According to news reports, based on its caseload, the \n     judicial district of Arizona is eligible for five more \n     judgeships. The state is authorized for 13, but has three \n     vacancies, two in the Tucson division.\n       As a direct result of illegal immigration prosecutions, two \n     years ago there were 3,023 felony cases filed in federal \n     court in Arizona. That increased to 4,311 the next year and \n     5,219 last year. In just Tucson, felony filings went from \n     1,564 two years ago to 3,289 last year.\n       The power to appoint more judges lies with Congress, but \n     our representatives and senators, while reportedly \n     supportive, have not been proactive.\n       The problem prompted the Phoenix Chapter of the Federal Bar \n     Association to issue last month a resolution to congressional \n     members to get the vacancies filled and to add to the court \n     staff and its facilities.\n       In fact, judicial vacancies are a problem across the \n     nation. According to a CNN report, there are 99 vacancies in \n     the 857 federal district and appeals court judgeships, \n     amounting to about 12 percent of the judicial seats. Just 46 \n     names have been put forth by President Obama to fill those \n     openings. The Administrative Office of the U.S. courts \n     predicts at least 15 more vacancies this year.\n       We urge you to contact your congressional members to \n     champion a solution to the very real needs of the judge and \n     staff shortages facing the federal courts in Arizona.\n       And we would ask you to ask them to act not only for our \n     state's sake, but in memory of Judge Roll who served his \n     state and country well.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination \nof Kevin Sharp to fill a judicial vacancy on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Middle District of Tennessee. The Senate will be voting on the \nPresident's nomination within a few minutes. Kevin is an outstanding \nindividual. I am pleased to be able to support his nomination today.\n  As a Governor, I appointed about 50 judges. I tried to determine in \ndoing that if he or she had the character and the intelligence and the \ntemperament to be a judge, whether that person would treat people \nbefore the bench with courtesy, and most important whether they were \ndetermined to be impartial to litigants before the court. I believe \nKevin Sharp meets these qualifications, and I am pleased that he will \nbring that character and skill to his service on the bench. I \ncongratulate the President for nominating him.\n  Kevin is a native of Tennessee. He is a founding partner of the \nnational law firm of Drescher and Sharp where he has been an expert in \nemployee law, employee benefits, and commercial disputes. He is a \ngraduate of two Tennessee institutions of higher education. He earned \nhis bachelor of science degree from Christian Brothers College, \ngraduating summa cum laude. He earned his juris doctorate from \nVanderbilt, where he was a Weldon B. White Scholar, an Associate \nProblem Editor on the Moot Court Board, a recipient of the Appellate \nAdvocacy Award, and a research assistant on issues of constitutional \nlaw and habeas corpus.\n  As a lawyer, Kevin Sharp has repeatedly earned recognition from his \npeers, being named one of the Nashville Business Journal's best of the \nbar in 2003, and each year from 2005 to 2009.\n  Prior to becoming a lawyer, Kevin served in the U.S. Navy as a flight \ncrew member on the P-3 Orion operating in patrol/reconnaissance, and \nthe antisubmarine warfare capacities as part of the U.S. Pacific fleet.\n  Kevin has broad support in Tennessee. Both the White House and my \noffice and Senator Corker's office have received numerous letters from \nRepublicans, Democrats, and those who didn't indicate any sort of \npartisan leaning, which is the way it ought to be.\n  Although the President nominated Kevin on November 17 of last year \nfor the first time, the seat that he has been nominated to fill is \ndesignated as a judicial emergency. It has been vacant for 4 years, \nsince March 1, 2007. This is the third longest vacancy on the list of \njudicial emergencies, and the people of Tennessee deserve to have this \nvacancy filled.\n  I thank the President for the nomination and the Judiciary \nCommittee's prompt consideration of that nomination. I am grateful for \nthe opportunity to join in support of the nomination of Kevin Sharp, \nand I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the nomination \ntoday.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will confirm two more \nof President Obama's judicial nominees. I continue to work with the \nchairman of the committee to ensure nominees are afforded a fair but \nthorough process and in a timely manner.\n  Today's vote marks the 19th nominee to be confirmed in just 42 days \nthe Senate has been in session this Congress. The Judiciary Committee \nis holding a nominations hearing on Wednesday. On Thursday we will \nreport additional judicial and executive nominees to the floor. Thus \nfar we have taken positive action on 43 of 63 nominees submitted this \nCongress, or 68 percent of all nominees.\n  Let me repeat that, because I am going to say something that makes it \nvery disgusting to me, some things that are coming out of the White \nHouse. Thus far we have taken positive action on 43 of 63 nominees \nsubmitted to this Congress, or 68 percent of the nominees. With this \nprogress, I was then surprised at the recent remarks of the White House \nCounsel before the American Bar Association members this past April 14.\n  This counsel addressed the group and complained about the pace of \njudicial appointments. He encouraged the group to escalate the general \nsense of urgency regarding judicial appointments. Press reports \nindicate that he asked them to play a larger role to ``bring home the \nimpact or the effects of gridlock.''\n  So, Mr. President, not only do I think these remarks are unjustified, \ngiven the pace of confirmations this year--and that is the 68 percent I \nhave referred to--but they also reflect a failure on the part of the \nWhite House Counsel to acknowledge where the problem begins. It begins \nwith the President of the United States and his staff--the White House \nCounsel particularly.\n  This brings me to the point: If we are acting so slowly, why has the \nPresident failed to send to the Senate a nomination for 55 percent of \nthe current judicial vacancies? This statistic certainly does not \nindicate any sense of urgency on the part of the White House, and it \nbrings further attention to the intellectual dishonesty of the White \nHouse in its speech to the ABA members that we are not acting fast \nenough on the Hill.\n  Well, having said that, I want to say a few words about the two \nnominees we are going to be voting on today. Roy Dalton, Jr. is \nnominated to be U.S. District Court judge for the Middle District of \nFlorida. Mr. Dalton received\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\nhis BA with high honors and his JD from the University of Florida.\n  Following law school, he joined the firm of Dean, Ringers, Morgan & \nLawton as an associate where he later became a principal of the firm.\n  In 1982, the nominee founded his first law firm, Roy B. Dalton, Jr., \nP.A. He would later form other practices where he would serve as a \nprincipal. In 1999 he began working as ``of counsel'' for the firm \nGray, Harris & Robinson, where his practice area grew to include civil \nlitigation, government relations, appellate practice, and business \npractice for individuals. As a former Senate staffer, Mr. Dalton spent \nmost of 2005 serving as counsel to his former legal partner and U.S. \nSenator, Mel Martinez. Mr. Dalton has also practiced in appellate \nmatters as ``of counsel'' for the Carlyle appellate law firm, a post he \nhas held since 2004. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him the rating of: substantial majority ``Well \nQualified''; minority ``Qualified.'' I am pleased to support Mr. Dalton \ntoday.\n  I also rise in support of Kevin Sharp to be U.S. District Court Judge \nfor the Middle District of Tennessee. Mr. Sharp enlisted in the U.S. \nNavy following high school and received an honorable discharge in 1986. \nThe nominee received his B.S. from Christian Brothers College and a \nJ.D. from Vanderbilt University School of Law. He began his legal \ncareer as an associate with the firm of Stokes & Bartholomew. After a \nyearlong stint working as an attorney for the U.S. Congressional Office \nof Compliance, Mr. Sharp returned to Stokes, Bartholomew, Evans & \nPetree, eventually making partner. Since 2003, he has been a \nshareholder and partner at Drescher & Sharp, where he has focused his \nlegal practice on employment, labor, and disability law. The ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated him ``Qualified'' \nand I urge my colleagues to support this nominee.\n  I note that the vacancy Mr. Sharp will fill was created by the \nretirement of Judge Echols in March of 2007. A few months later, on \nJune 13, 2007, President Bush nominated Gus Puryear to fill the \nvacancy. Mr. Puryear waited 8 months before he had a hearing. That was \nthe last action the committee took on the nomination. His nomination \nlanguished in committee for another 10 months before being returned to \nthe President in January 2009, at the end of President Bush's term. It \nis both unfortunate and unnecessary that this seat has remained vacant \nfor so long.\n  I congratulate each of these men for their achievements and commend \nthem for the public service they have given and that they will provide \nto the people of this country, and particularly to their respective \nStates in the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield back all remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Dalton nomination is confirmed.\n  The question now occurs on the Sharp nomination.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Kevin Hunter Sharp, of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Middle District of Tennessee?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nMenendez), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), the Senator from \nVermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Udall) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at the beginning of this Congress, we \nentered into an agreement with the minority. One of the things we \nwanted to do was to make sure there was a process for allowing \namendments to bills. We have had the small business jobs bill on the \ncalendar for weeks. I believe this is the fifth week this bill has been \naround. We have had votes on a lot of amendments. But each time we \nthink we can see the way to closure, my friends on the other\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\nside of the aisle come forward with other amendments, making it \nimpossible for us to move forward on this bill that creates jobs. It is \na jobs bill.\n  I do not know how much more good faith we can show than what we have \nshown. Before the recess, we had, I think, nine amendments. We said: \nOK, let's vote on these. Senator Snowe from Maine objected because she \nwanted to have a vote on a bill on which the chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee said there had not even been a hearing.\n  We spent days working on an agreement to have votes on amendments to \nthe small business bill to get us closer to passage. Included in this \nagreement was a Cornyn amendment having absolutely nothing--no \nrelevance--nothing being germane to this bill. We had one from Senator \nHutchison--same thing--dealing with health care. It has nothing to do \nwith this legislation that is before the Senate.\n  We had all kinds of amendments. Very few had anything to do with the \nsubject matter of the legislation. During the course of many weeks of \ndebating the bill, we made efforts to accommodate Senator Snowe and the \nrest of the Republicans on amendments, but there has been no way of \nending this, so we are going to file cloture tonight.\n  We had a vote on another amendment offered by Senator Snowe. She has \nalready had one vote on this amendment, as well as multiple Republican \namendments, nearly all of which, I repeat, have nothing to do with this \nunderlying bill.\n  In light of the accommodation of extraneous amendments, it is \ndifficult for me to understand why we cannot finish debate on this \nbill. But, obviously, the Republicans feel differently. We have been \nmore than fair. We should be able to reach agreement on considering the \nremaining amendments and voting on final passage, but that is not what \nthe Republican leader said is going to happen. I am sure he will tell \nhis Senators we need more amendments and will vote to not allow cloture \nto take place.\n  There is only a limited amount of time we can spend on this \nlegislation. We believe jobs is the key to what we do in the Senate. \nThat is why I worked hard to get the FAA bill done and a bill dealing \nwith patents, to get that bill done, because they create about 750,000, \n800,000 jobs. This bill would create thousands of jobs. But I guess my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are more interested in messages \nthan they are trying to get something done that will be good for the \nAmerican people. So I have to file cloture on this bill.\n  I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nLawrence Elswick for his service to the United States. Mr. Elswick \nserves as a prime example of a man who truly puts others before \nhimself.\n  Having spent the majority of his life in the small town of Big Creek, \nKY, Mr. Elswick has touched the lives of several Kentuckians. Whether \nhe is fixing the plumbing in a neighbor's bathroom or giving away free \nvegetables from his garden, Lawrence never hesitates when offering a \nhelping hand.\n  Although Lawrence came from a humble background, he allowed his \nupbringing to inspire him rather than hold him back. Having grown up as \nthe oldest in a family with 8 children, Lawrence was molded into the \nleader that he still is today. Furthermore, Lawrence knows what it \nmeans to be truly dedicated. He has dedicated his life to serving his \nchurch, the people of the Commonwealth, and his country.\n  Because Lawrence has always selflessly given to others, it came as no \nsurprise when he joined the Army during World War II and willingly \nrisked his life to defend our country. He was among the heroes who \nbravely fought on Normandy Beach in 1944. At one point in time, \nLawrence went missing in action and remained behind enemy lines for a \nweek. It is because of his immense courage and great service to this \nNation that I stand here today honoring his achievements. Lawrence has \nbeen awarded numerous medals because of his service in the U.S. Army. \nHis collection of medals include the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the \nCombat Infantry Badge, the Good Conduct Medal, the European Theater of \nOperations Ribbon with four major stars, the Honorable Service Lapel \nButton, and the Presidential Citation Ribbon. Several of these medals \nare among the greatest honors that are bestowed upon our men and women \nin the service.\n  It is because of Lawrence's strong character, his dedication to his \nfamily and friends, and his giving spirit that the Commonwealth of \nKentucky is so proud to call him one of our own.\n  The Appalachian News Express recently published an article \ncommemorating Mr. Lawrence Elswick's service to the Commonwealth of \nKentucky and\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\nto the Nation, and I ask unanimous consent that the full article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Appalachian News Express, Mar. 2, 2011]\n\n                       Elswick Says He Is Blessed\n\n                           (By Nancy M. Goss)\n\n       ``I've been here all my life, on this creek,'' says 88-\n     year-old Lawrence Elswick. ``My dad bought this place back in \n     1943 when I was in the service. All my kids were born here \n     but my youngest.''\n       Lawrence was born Sept. 30, 1922, the oldest of eight \n     children. He and two brothers, Bill Elswick of Elyria, Ohio, \n     and Sonny Elswick of London, are the only ones still living.\n       He attended a one-room school on Meathouse Fork. His dad \n     taught school for two years and was a deputy clerk for Bessie \n     Arnold Riddle. He was killed in a mining accident just a few \n     days after Lawrence returned from the service.\n       Lawrence Elswick and Rachel Fuller were married Feb. 21, \n     1942. They had five children: Lawrence Jr. of Meathouse Fork \n     of Big Creek, Judith Gail Baker (deceased), Connie Sue \n     Chapnum of Meathouse Fork of Big Creek and Patsy Blackburn \n     and Madonna Kaye Williamson, both of Stratton Fork of Canada. \n     They have 12 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. Rachel \n     died Aug. 15, 2007.\n       ``Mom was known countywide for her biscuits,'' Patsy said. \n     ``And she would cook for anybody who would show up.''\n       Lawrence's nickname is Curly. He has naturally curly hair, \n     but admits to getting perms. ``I was black headed,'' he says. \n     ``They used to call me Dean Martin.''\n       Lawrence is a World War II veteran.\n       In the beginning of his Army career, he was stationed in \n     Mississippi.\n       ``I was put in the 99th Division, then after my training, I \n     came to Camp Shanks, New York, and caught a ship--The George \n     Washington. I was 14 days getting over there, to France.'' He \n     was then in the 4th Infantry Division. Later, he was also \n     part of the military police at Fort Campbell.\n       His medals include The Purple Heart, The Bronze Star, \n     Combat Infantry Badge, the American Campaign, Good Conduct, \n     ETO, Ruptured Duck, Presidential Citation Ribbon, four major \n     battle stars on ETO ribbon, World War II, and Expert \n     Rifleman.\n       ``I had a rough life in the service,'' he says. ``I went in \n     on Normandy Beach. I was missing in action . . . cut off \n     behind enemy lines for a week.''\n       ``I got out on Oct. 3, 1945,'' Lawrence says. ``I was \n     supposed to get out on my birthday, up at Camp Breckinridge. \n     But they held me in the hospital for three days because I was \n     a diabetic--the sugar showed up on me, you know.''\n       ``Dad worked in the mines for a while when he first came \n     out of the service,'' Patsy said. ``And he's put plumbing and \n     bathrooms in every house all up and down Meathouse.''\n       ``I'm one of the best blessed men on Big Creek,'' Lawrence \n     says. ``I never drew an unemployment check and I never was \n     cut off from a job in my life. I worked 38 years for the gas \n     company. I was the maintenance man and worked in four \n     counties. I was a compressor engineer, is what they called \n     it. I'd take care of these pump stations.''\n       Lawrence did plumbing on the side in the evenings while \n     working for the gas company. He said Al Reed helped him plumb \n     every house.\n       ``I'd get him to help me. He was a real nice friend of \n     mine. Another good friend was Sonny Hall of Pikeville. He was \n     like a son to me,'' Lawrence said. ``And I can't not mention \n     Willie B. Thacker and Bethel Thacker. They were just like a \n     daddy and mother to me.''\n       Lawrence says he's always been involved in politics.\n       ``I've been a politician all my life and voted Democrat all \n     my life. Paul Patton came to my house and sat right down \n     there in that chair when he started to run for county judge \n     the first time. And Rick Bartley sat on my porch when he was \n     running . . . and Ira Branham, and Keith Hall, and Eddy \n     Coleman and his wife . . .''\n       ``Dad's friends with all of them,'' Patsy said. I had an \n     anniversary party for him and mom on their 50th wedding \n     anniversary and we had over 300 people show up! I was afraid \n     I would run out of food.''\n       Many years ago, Lawrence also had about 50 game cocks, \n     roosters, on strings at one time.\n       ``That was back before Daddy ever belonged to church . . . \n     he'd referee. He had a colorful life!'' Patsy said.\n       ``That was over in McDowell in Floyd County. I was the head \n     referee over there,'' Lawrence said. ``Now, I'm against it \n     the worst in the world . . . and I used to do it all the \n     time.''\n       Lawrence is a Kentucky Colonel. He's also an ordained \n     deacon in the Big Creek Primitive Baptist Church. He and \n     Rachel were baptized in 1996, but attended church long before \n     that.\n       ``I love my church,'' Lawrence says. ``There ain't but one \n     church and one God and he controls all of it.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nKentuckian who has led a remarkable and inspirational life, Ms. Ethel \nRichardson Martin. In 1911 in Kenton County, KY, Ethel Martin was \nborn--meaning that this March, she celebrated her 100th birthday. And \nshe has much to be proud of, looking back at a century of a life well \nlived.\n  Ms. Martin came from a large family; her parents Eugene and Frances \nhad 11 children. Ethel and her sisters liked to sing, and I am told \nthey once sang at Renfro Valley, site of many great Kentucky music \nperformances. Ms. Martin graduated from Western Kentucky State Teachers \nCollege--now Western Kentucky University--and served as a missionary in \nGeorgia, mostly in the area of Macon. In 1943, with America at war with \nthe Axis Powers, she enlisted in the Women's Army Corps, the branch of \nour country's Armed Forces that GEN Douglas MacArthur once called ``my \nbest soldiers.''\n  Ms. Martin began her WAC training in Des Moines, IA. She served her \ncountry with distinction and rose to the rank of captain. When the war \nended, she participated in the prosecution of the Germany's war \ncriminals. She was one of the first Americans to see the inside of \nAdolf Hitler's mountain retreat called the Eagle's Nest, and she served \nas an adjunct to an attorney who worked on the Nuremburg Trials.\n  In 1947, Ms. Martin was discharged from Army service. She returned to \nAmerica, and she earned her master's degree and her doctorate from the \nUniversity of Cincinnati. She also met and married the love of her \nlife, Ansel C. Martin. Ansel was a music teacher, and he has been \nmissed by all who knew him since his passing in 1991.\n  Ethel found a career in education, and she and Ansel lived in North \nCarolina for a time. She was a leader in the efforts of her church, the \nFirst United Methodist Church located in Hendersonville, NC, to sponsor \nCambodian refugees to the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. In \n2001, she returned to her native Kentucky. We are lucky to have her \nback in the Bluegrass State and happy to help celebrate her 100th \nbirthday. Her long life of service to her country and her community are \nan inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2574-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2574-S2575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FALL CASES BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to alert my colleagues to an \nimportant set of cases that will be heard by the Supreme Court this \nfall. The cases--consolidated under the caption Maxwell-Jolly v. \nIndependent Living Center--concern the ability of Americans to assert \ntheir constitutional rights in court. The issue before the Court is \nimportant not just to the parties involved but to the effective \nfunctioning of our constitutional system.\n  The cases come to the Court out of California. In 2008, the State \nannounced a plan to sharply reduce the reimbursements paid to medical \nproviders under Medi-Cal, the State's Medicaid program. A broad range \nof parties--including pharmacies, medical clinics, hospitals, doctors, \nhealth care providers, senior citizens' groups, and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries--brought suit asking for an injunction to stop the change \nfrom going into effect. They are not looking for money, just an order \nrequiring California to follow Federal law.\n  They argued that the California plan violated--and was preempted by--\nthe Federal Medicaid statute. In particular, they contended that the \nplan\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\nfailed to ``assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, \neconomy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough \nproviders so that care and services are available . . . at least to the \nextent that such care and services are available to the general \npopulation,'' as required by 42 U.S.C. Sec.  1396a(a)(30)(A). In other \nwords, they took California to court to make the State obey Federal law \nand ensure patients have access to the Medicaid benefits required by \nCongress.\n  The court of appeals agreed with the plaintiffs' claims that the \nCalifornia plan was preempted by Federal law. But that wasn't the end \nof it. The Supreme Court decided to review the case. Denying review on \nthe underlying issue of whether California's action is, in fact, \npreempted by Federal law, the Court has taken up the question whether \nthe parties should be allowed to assert that California's plan is \nunconstitutional. The California attorney general has argued that they \nshould not, claiming that private parties cannot have a day in court to \nraise a preemption claim, regardless whether the State's action is \nillegal under Federal law.\n  This case will be significant for our country, and Constitution, for \nyears to come.\n  As my colleagues know, it is foundational to our system of government \nthat States must comply with duly enacted laws of this Congress. The \nsupremacy clause, in article VI of the Constitution, makes clear that \nthe Constitution and ``the Laws of the United States which shall be \nmade in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; \nand the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the \nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.''\n  Our carefully balanced Federal system, designed by the Framers, would \nfall apart without the supremacy clause. As James Madison wrote in \nFederalist No. 44, without that clause we would be left ``a system of \ngovernment founded on an inversion of the fundamental principles of all \ngovernment; it would have seen the authority of the whole society every \nwhere subordinate to the authority of the parts; it would have seen a \nmonster, in which the head was under the direction of the members.'' \nFor this reason, the Supreme Court has enforced the supremacy clause \nsince 1796, striking down State measures incompatible with Federal law.\n  It has previously been widely accepted in the courts of appeals, \nlegal treatises, and filings by the United States--that the American \npeople can go to court to protect themselves from preempted State law.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed big corporations to argue in \ncourt that State actions are preempted by Federal laws and regulations. \nTo take one example, in Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. \nBrown, 2008, business interests sued to enjoin enforcement of a \nCalifornia law that prohibited employers in that State from spending \nState funds to deter union organizing. The Supreme Court held that the \nNational Labor Relations Act, NLRA, preempted the California law. It \ndidn't tell the corporation that it could not assert this argument in \nthe first place. So too, in Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport \nAssociation, 2008, a group of transport carrier associations brought \nsuit to argue that a Maine statute regulating tobacco delivery in order \nto protect minors was preempted by Federal law. Again, the Supreme \nCourt found that the State law was preempted, striking it down without \nprohibiting the corporate interests from making their argument in \ncourt. And in Watters v. Wachovia Bank, 2007, the Court allowed a big \nnational bank to argue that Federal law preempted Michigan's State \nbanking regulations, once again without denying the corporate interest \nthe chance to raise such an argument in court.\n  Now is not the time to inhibit the supremacy clause and preclude \nregular Americans from having their Federal rights enforced in court, \nparticularly when that privilege has been respected for corporations.\n  If the Court does take that step, it will create a legal loophole \nthat invites states to ignore Federal law, and weaken the supremacy \nclause. It will put Americans at risk, weakening hard-won statutory \nprotections. Most important, it will warp the carefully balanced \nFederal system that has served us so well through the centuries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2575-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Donald L.

He was 21 years old. \nSpecialist Nichols enlisted in the Iowa National Guard in March of 2008 \nand was assigned to the Iowa Army National Guard's Headquarters and \nHeadquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry, 2nd Brigade Combat \nteam, 34th Infantry Division, based in Waterloo, IA.

His fellow \nsoldiers remember him as a ``studious soldier who took his duty with \nzeal.'' Donald had decided that he wanted to join the Armed Forces even \nbefore he graduated high school. He showed a dedication to service that \nis typical of all of the men and women fighting for our Nation but one \nthat is so rare in the common man. The memory of his sense of humor and \nhis love for family, friends, and country will remain constantly with \nhis loved ones.\n  SPC Donald L. Nichols will be missed by all that were privileged to \nknow him and my thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones in this \nincredibly difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2575-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2575-S2576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, since 1978 we have set aside the month \nof May to honor Americans who are of Asian and Pacific Islander \ndescent. Today I am pleased to join the celebration of Asian Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month and the many accomplishments and contributions \nof such an inspiring, spirited, and industrious group of people.\n  Efforts to establish an Asian Pacific American Heritage Month first \ntook shape in 1977 when U.S. Representatives Frank Horton and Norman Y. \nMineta introduced a resolution calling on the President to declare a \nweeklong commemoration. Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga \nfollowed suit in the Senate. Both resolutions were ultimately passed, \nand President Carter in 1978 officially designated a weeklong \ncelebration to honor the first Japanese immigrants to the United States \nand the Chinese laborers who completed the Transcontinental Railroad.\n  In 1990, President George H.W. Bush extended the event to a month-\nlong celebration, and in 1992 the designation of May as Asian Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month was signed into law.\n  More than 17 million Asian Pacific Americans live in the United \nStates today, with more than 5 million living in California. Together, \nthese Americans represent more than 30 countries and ethnic groups and \nenhance the diversity that is a hallmark of our Nation. Asian Pacific \nAmericans enrich California through their famous and iconic communities \nincluding Chinatown in San Francisco, Filipino Town and Little Tokyo in \nLos Angeles, Little Cambodia in Long Beach, and Little Saigon in \nWestminster.\n  Asian Pacific Americans have also left a large imprint on the economy \nof the United States, although in this time of economic challenge, it \nis important that we offer as much support as possible to keep those \nbusinesses thriving. This is why I support the White House Initiative \non Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, which is focused on \nincreasing Asian Pacific American participation in areas such as \ncommerce, labor and employment, and economic and community development. \nI am also a cosponsor of legislation that will help create small \nbusinesses and improve small business owners' access to capital.\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\n  This year's theme, ``Leadership to Meet the Challenge of a Changing \nWorld,'' is especially fitting given the many challenges we face today. \nThe leadership of many Asian Pacific Americans who have dedicated their \nlives to public service is especially notable. These trailblazers have \nbeen a strong voice for the community and have empowered Asian Pacific \nAmericans to break barriers and pursue the American dream.\n  Among these respected Americans are my esteemed colleagues in \nCongress, Senators Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, and nine Members of \nthe U.S. House of Representatives, including California Representatives \nJudy Chu, Doris Matsui, and Mike Honda. In the executive branch, we are \nlucky to have the services of Energy Secretary Steven Chu, Commerce \nSecretary Gary Locke, and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.\n  In particular, I would like to recognize Representative Chu on her \nnew position as chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American \nCaucus. I would also like to congratulate Secretary Locke on his recent \nnomination by President Obama to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to \nthe People's Republic of China. These individuals are all leaders in \nthe Asian Pacific American community, and their service inspires future \ngenerations to follow in their footsteps.\n  In addition to their cultures, entrepreneurial skills and dedication \nto public service, Asian Pacific Americans have also made great \nsacrifices to ensure our nation remains strong and secure. There are \nthousands of Asian Pacific Americans serving overseas in our Armed \nForces and here at home in our law enforcement agencies. These \nadmirable citizens risk their lives every day to protect their \ncommunities. They deserve our thanks.\n  I also want to praise the leadership and hard work of the Asian \nPacific American legal community. Since the beginning of 2009, we have \nmade significant progress in our work to diversify Federal courts. Six \nnew Asian Pacific American judges have been confirmed to the Federal \nbench. These include U.S. District Judges Jacqueline Nguyen and Dolly \nGee in Los Angeles and U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose. Two \nhighly qualified nominees still await votes--Professor Goodwin Liu, \nnominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and U.S. \nMagistrate Judge Edward Chen, nominated for the U.S. District Court in \nSan Francisco. I will continue to do what I can to further diversify \nthe judiciary and ensure that qualified Asian Pacific American judges \nare nominated and confirmed to the Federal bench.\n  Unfortunately, this month also brings with it the reminder that my \ngood friend and political strategist Mr. Kam Kuwata is no longer with \nus. Kam was well known and well respected by those in California \npolitics and journalism. He tirelessly pursued civil rights and \nachieved remarkable success in campaigns and State initiatives. He \ncarried with him many of the difficulties Asian Pacific Americans have \nfaced, as his mother's family was interned during World War II. But he \nalso embodied the many accomplishments that Asian Pacific Americans \nhave achieved. Kam was truly one of the most intelligent and sharp \npeople I have ever met. I would like to extend my heartfelt and deepest \ncondolences to his family and friends. He will be dearly missed by all \nof us whose lives he touched.\n  Today, it is my honor to acknowledge the remarkable strength, \ncharacter, and accomplishments of Asian Pacific Americans during Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2576-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE NATIONAL ROAD\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the importance \nof investment in our national infrastructure on the occasion of the \nbicentennial anniversary of the National Road.\n  On May 7, 2011, Americans will gather in Cumberland, MD, to celebrate \nthe bicentennial of the groundbreaking for the construction of this \nfirst federally financed road. Congress approved The National Road in \n1806 and construction was completed in 1818, connecting Cumberland, MD, \nwith Wheeling, WV, located on the Ohio River. This road would connect \nEast to West, allowing for economic growth and opportunity as a young \nnation sought to unite a diverse country and facilitate the flow of \npeople, goods, services, information, and Federal authority in new \nterritory.\n  The National Road's completion created a flow of goods and people to \nand from the Port of Baltimore, along privately developed turnpikes to \nCumberland, and across the mountains to the Ohio River Valley. The road \nwas extended to Vandalia, IL, in the early 1840s. For more than a \ncentury, The National Road was this Nation's only federally funded \ninterstate highway, making its importance to commercial and political \nenterprise unparalleled.\n  By the 1850s, the lure of trade and migration to the West led to the \ndevelopment of the ``horseless carriage,'' running parallel to the \nroad, connecting the Port of Baltimore to the West right through \nCumberland, MD, over the mountains and westward. While The National \nRoad remained important, trains began to transport the bulk of goods \nand people travelling West. In the 1900s, it was the invention of the \nautomobile that brought The National Road back to popularity as \ntravelers and tourists explored America and the natural beauty of \nwestern Maryland and truckers transported goods along with the trains.\n  I would encourage my colleagues and their constituents to take a \njourney on The National Road. The National Road has been designated a \nMaryland Scenic Byway and is marked by signs and historical markers, \nconnecting heritage areas, arts and entertainment districts, and \nhistoric landscapes and structures. A National Register of Historic \nPlaces Travel Itinerary can be found at www.crnps.gov/nr.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this national \nachievement, which reminds us of the importance of supporting \ninfrastructure investments that promote trade and commerce, and in \nthanking the people of Cumberland, MD, for celebrating this national \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2576-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2576-S2577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETER FISCHER\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Peter \nFischer, who is retiring from Senate service. Peter has been an \nessential member of my staff for more than a decade, and he currently \nserves as chief of staff for my Washington, DC, office. I cannot thank \nhim enough for his dedicated counsel and friendship. Time and time \nagain, he has provided helpful insight and contagious optimism that \nhave been instrumental in overcoming even the most difficult \nchallenges.\n  I have been extremely blessed to have Peter as part of my team \nthrough multiple, valuable roles. He joined my 1998 Senate campaign as \ncampaign finance director following his service as an economic \ndevelopment specialist with Idaho's department of commerce and \nindustry. Then, in January of 1999, I was fortunate to have Peter join \nmy congressional staff as State director for economic development. He \nutilized his economic development experience and profound understanding \nof the needs of Idaho communities to help communities navigate the \nFederal bureaucracy and identify partnership opportunities. He \ncontinued this outstanding advocacy after he moved to Washington, DC, \nnearly 2 years later, to become legislative director prior to becoming \nmy Washington, DC, chief of staff.\n  Peter has a remarkable ``can-do'' spirit and resourcefulness, and he \nhas contributed greatly to advancing countless legislative and policy \npriorities for Idaho. For example, his commitment to the Owyhee \nInitiative played a major role in the successful passage of the \nauthorizing legislation and continued implementation efforts. As a \nhunter, fisher and sportsman, Peter also provided valuable perspective \nin enactment of electronic duck stamp legislation. He has also been \nvery active in representing me in countless ways on Capitol Hill. For \nexample, he is a senior Stennis fellow, serves on the Steering \nCommittee for the Bipartisan Chiefs of Staff organization, is the \nRepublican chair of the bipartisan Foreign Policy Study Group,has \nattended numerous chiefs of staff retreats and manages my Washington \ncampaign activities during his free time.\n  A 1971 graduate of the University of California--Santa Barbara with a \ndegree in history, Peter has a fascinating\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\npersonal and professional life that has taken him across the country \nand around the world. His myriad of experiences in the private sector \nand across the globe has made him such an innovative economic \ndevelopment expert and a valued contributor to me. Peter is kind and \ncourteous to a fault. We would be hard pressed to find anyone who has \nmet him who doesn't like him. He has a great capacity to put people at \nease, and people just generally like to be around him, as evidenced by \nhis multitude of friends and acquaintances. It is probably because the \nbest friendship qualities run deep in Peter: He is loyal and can be \ntough when needs be, but he is also a cheerful encourager.\n  Peter has been a great asset to me, my staff and the Senate \nthroughout his service to Idaho and the Nation, and I will miss him \ngreatly. However, I wish my friend and his wife Kris great happiness \nthroughout his retirement. I am hopeful that retirement will provide \nthem more time to spend with their family, including their two children \nKaty and Paul, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren. \nPeter's retirement is a well-deserved respite for his years of hard \nwork for Idahoans and our country. Thank you, Peter, for your great \nservice and extraordinary friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2577-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BRICKLAYERS AND ALLIED CRAFT WORKERS LOCAL 04\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the work and military service of COL Jeffrey Taliaferro, who \nis concluding a 2-year stint as commander of the 28th Bomb Wing, \nEllsworth Air Force Base. During the past 2 years, Colonel Taliaferro \nhas commanded the largest B-1 combat wing in the U.S. Air Force and \nwill now move on to the Pentagon as Chief, Combat Forces Division at \nHeadquarters, USAF-A8PC.\n  Colonel Taliaferro's command tenure at Ellsworth Air Force Base is \nthe latest in a long line of impressive assignments. He received his \ncommission from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1989 and has served in a \nvariety of flying and staff positions. His staff experience includes \npositions with U.S. Air Force headquarters, Office of the Secretary of \nDefense, and U.S. Central Command. He is a command pilot with over \n2,400 flight hours in the B-1 and T-38.\n  During his 2 years at Ellsworth Air Force Base, a large number of \nbase personnel have been deployed to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Odyssey Dawn, as well as \nnumerous other missions. During my years in Congress, I have always \nbeen impressed with the high degree of patriotism, expertise, \ncommitment and dedication of the Ellsworth personnel and the base's \nleadership command. Those qualities have been continued in the great \nleadership of Colonel Taliaferro.\n  I have appreciated Colonel Taliaferro's work on a number of issues \nimpacting Ellsworth Air Force Base and the Air Force in general. He has \npromoted and developed great relationships with the South Dakota \ncongressional delegation and their staffs, with South Dakota State \nofficials, Black Hills mayors and local officials, as well as the media \nand local citizens. He has worked to communicate the intricacies and \ndetails of a number of issues to officials and the general public, \nincluding the proposed expansion of the Powder River Training Complex, \nprivatization of base housing to the local community, the status and \neffectiveness of the B-1 Lancer fleet, the status of the new MQ-9 \nmission at Ellsworth, and efforts to support deployed personnel and \ntheir families.\n  Colonel Taliaferro has provided oversight on a number of \ninfrastructure changes at Ellsworth during his command and has \ncontinued to enhance the great relationship between Ellsworth Air Force \nBase and the local communities. Few bases enjoy such a friendly working \nrelationship with local businesses and the general public as Ellsworth \ndoes with the Black Hills communities, and I commend Colonel Taliaferro \nfor his ability to promote this relationship.\n  I have appreciated the insight and input from Colonel Taliaferro and \nhis staff over the past 2 years.

Mr. President, on April 7, a pall passed over \nmy hometown of Stamford, CT, when the news began to spread that Mrs. \nBetty Ruth Hollander, one of its leading citizens and a good friend of \nmine and my family, had passed away peacefully. A pioneer, \nentrepreneur, philanthropist, inventor, and a devoted wife, mother, and \ngrandmother, Mrs. Hollander lived a truly remarkable life that touched \nand inspired almost everyone she met. Her passing is a great loss not \njust for those of us who were lucky enough to know her personally, but \nfor the entire Stamford community and well beyond.\n  In 1962, while raising four young children, Betty Hollander founded \nOmega Engineering out of her kitchen in Stamford. At a time when women \nfaced pervasive discrimination in many industries, Betty utilized her \nsteady work ethic and sharp business acumen to grow Omega from a firm \nfocused on manufacturing a single line of thermocouples to a globally \nrecognized business that produces over 100,000 state-of-the-art \nproducts for measurement and control.\n  Omega's record of success gave Betty the opportunity to serve on a \nnumber of corporate boards, including Target Corporation--then Dayton \nHudson Corporation--Peoples United Bank and Southern New England \nTelephone. She was also deeply involved with many charities, and served \non the boards of Yale New Haven Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and St. \nVincent Hospital, Bridgeport, CT. among many other corporations and \nnonprofit organizations.\n  Alongside all her success and busy schedule, Betty remained deeply \ncommitted to her family. Even when serving as corporate executive \nofficer of Omega, when asked her occupation Mrs. Hollander would reply \nthat she was ``a wife and mother.'' Later, she was able to add \n``grandmother'' to the title. These, she insisted, were the most \nimportant roles she ever played. In 1952, she married Milton Bernard \nHollander, her best friend since high school, beginning a strong 58-\nyear marriage characterized by extraordinary mutual devotion. Together, \nthey had four children, Eva Lynn, Steven, Aaron, and Joel, and nine \ngrandchildren.\n  To get a sense of the truly exemplary person that Betty Hollander \nwas, all you need to do is look over an online forum set up to honor \nher memory. Already, over 100 individuals from all walks of life have \ntaken the time to express their condolences and share their favorite \nmemories of Betty. One long-time employee in Omega's shipping \ndepartment remembers that, no matter\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nhow busy she was as CEO, Betty would always take the time out to get to \nknow all of her employees personally. Others fondly recalled how she \nwas never too busy to mentor younger employees and helped inspire them \nto pursue their dreams and demonstrate their fullest potential. In \naddition, there are testimonials from those who worked with her on her \ncharitable endeavors, those who were friends, and even those who had \nnever met her, but who were inspired by her success in business and her \nservice to the community. On a personal level, Betty Hollander and my \nmother were great friends--two great Jewish mothers--and I have always \ntreasured having had the opportunity to know her.\n  If we are to be judged in life by the effect we have on others, than \nBetty Hollander's life was a sterling success!\n  We honor Betty Hollander's memory and cherish her decency and \nfriendship. I extend my deepest sympathies to Betty's beloved \n``Miltie'' Hollander and all of Betty's friends and family on their \nirreplaceable loss. They will be in my thoughts and prayers during this \ndifficult period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2578-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2578-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two treaties which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2578-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 15, 2011, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1473.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaties transmitted to the Senate on May 2, 2011, by the President of \nthe United States:\n  Protocols 1, 2, and 3 to the South Pacific Free Zone Treaty, which is \ndocument No. 112-2. Protocols I and II, to the African Nuclear-Weapon-\nFree Zone Treaty, document No. 112-3.\n  I further ask that the treaties be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that they be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's messages in regard to both be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith Protocols I and II to the African \nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (``the Treaty''), signed on behalf of \nthe United States at Cairo, Egypt, on April 11, 1996. I also transmit \nfor the information of the Senate the Treaty to which these Protocols \nrelate, a third Protocol to the Treaty, and the Department of State's \nOverview of the Protocols, which includes a detailed article-by-article \nanalysis of both the Protocols and the Treaty.\n  I am convinced that it is in the best interest of the United States \nto ratify Protocols I and II to the Treaty. This\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nstep will strengthen our relations with our African friends and allies, \nenhance U.S. security by furthering our global nonproliferation and \narms control objectives, demonstrate our commitment to the decisions \ntaken at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and contribute \nsignificantly to the realization of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free \nZone in all its aspects. As the Department of State's Overview of the \nProtocols explains, entry into force of Protocols I and II for the \nUnited States would require no changes in U.S. law, policy, or \npractice.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nProtocols I and II to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, and \ngive its advice and consent to their ratification, subject to the \nstatements contained in the Department of State's Overview of the \nProtocols.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 2, 2011.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith Protocols 1, 2, and 3 to the South \nPacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (``the Treaty''), signed on behalf of \nthe United States at Suva on March 25, 1996.

I understand, Mr. President, you are going to make a report \nto the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair lays before the Senate a \ncommunication regarding the resignation of Senator Ensign.\n  Without objection, the letter will be printed in the Record and \nspread upon the Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2011.\n     Vice President Joe Biden,\n     The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: I am writing to submit my \n     resignation from the United States Senate, effective close of \n     business May 3, 2011. The short time before I leave is \n     necessary to ensure the smooth transition of my office and to \n     assist the dedicated people who work in the office the time \n     to arrange their next positions.\n       The decision to leave the Senate before my term has expired \n     is the most difficult decision I have had to make in public \n     life. I am immensely proud and honored to have served the \n     people of Nevada for more than 10 years. I do not easily or \n     lightly forego the obligation to fulfill the term to which I \n     was elected. However, as my colleagues, friends, and \n     constituents know, my family, my staff and I have gone \n     through an emotional, personal and professional rollercoaster \n     of inquiries by the Department of Justice, the Federal \n     Election Commission, and the Senate Ethics Committee. These \n     inquiries have been time-consuming and distracting to \n     everyone involved and, not unimportantly to me, have been \n     financially very costly.\n       I am gratified that, after extended investigations, both \n     the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission \n     saw no grounds on which to charge me with improper conduct. I \n     was hopeful that, with the closure of these investigations \n     against me the wear and tear on me and on my family and staff \n     would soon be over. That was not the case.\n       As is its right, the Senate Ethics Committee is continuing \n     its investigation of issues into which it has been inquiring \n     for the past year and a half. Indeed, the Committee even \n     decided recently to devote more resources to its \n     investigation by hiring an outside special counsel, even \n     though the issues have been viewed and reviewed by so many \n     others.\n       I firmly believe that I have not violated any law, rule, or \n     standard of conduct of the Senate. But even to prove this \n     publicly I will not subject my family, my staff, my \n     constituents, or the Senate to any further rounds of \n     investigation, depositions, drawn out proceedings, or, \n     especially, potential public hearings. For my family, my \n     staff and me, the continuing personal cost would simply be \n     too great. For my constituents, for the Senate, and for my \n     colleagues and friends in this great institution, they should \n     not have to endure any further distraction from the many, \n     many critical issues on America's agenda. Not another day of \n     effort should be spent on my case when we face the pressing \n     issues of the National debt, tax reform, the next budget, and \n     military conflicts in so many places in the world.\n       Therefore, with the greatest personal sadness and \n     reluctance, I am taking this step of resignation to allow my \n     family and me finally to move on and so that the Senate, in \n     the months to come, may attend fully to the crucial business \n     of the Nation. I cannot thank all my colleagues and \n     constituents enough for the honor of serving and of \n     contributing whatever I have been able to contribute to this \n     body and to the people of the State of Nevada and of the \n     United States of America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Ensign,\n     United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/02/senate-section/article/S2585-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 3, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
