Mr. President, the time we have left to work on a budget \nagreement is extremely short. The window in which we can avoid the \nterrible consequences of a shutdown is closing quickly. It is no longer \nmeasured in months or weeks. We are now down to just a few days in this \ndeadline. The time we have to get the long legislative process started \nin both Houses is measured in hours.\n  It is clear those sitting at the negotiating table have different \npriorities. That is true of any negotiation. We all should share the \nsame goal: to keep the country running and to keep the momentum of our \neconomic recovery moving forward. We all want to cut the deficit.\n  Last week, we agreed upon a number on which to base our budget--$73 \nbillion below the President's proposal. But disagreements remain on \nwhere we should make those cuts. We worked\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\nthrough the weekend to bridge that gap. We have made some progress, but \nwe are not where we should be yet.\n  There is another way in which the sides remain separated. Democrats \nhave demonstrated throughout this process that we are willing to meet \nin the middle, but Republicans and the tea party continue to reject \nreality and insist, instead, on idealogy. Let me give a couple of \nexamples.\n  First, they refuse to recognize H.R. 1--that is the budget the House \npassed--isn't going to happen. The tea party pushed it through the \nHouse over the objections of some Republicans and all Democrats. Then, \nthe Senate soundly defeated it. Even all Republicans didn't vote for \nthis H.R. 1 in the Senate. We all know the President would never sign \nit into law anyway.\n  So the Republican Party and the tea party need to admit the Democrats \nhave proven what the country already knows--that neither party can pass \na budget without the other party and neither Chamber can send it to the \nPresident without the other Chamber. Democrats stand ready to meet the \nRepublicans halfway and the Senate stands ready to meet the House \nhalfway. We hope our partners on the other side are willing to be as \nreasonable.\n  Second, tea party Republicans refuse to recognize that their budget \nis simply an appalling proposal. They stomp their feet and call \n``compromise'' a dirty word and insist on a budget that will hurt \nAmerica rather than help it. It slashes programs for the sake of \nslashing programs. It chops zeros off the budget for nothing more than \nbragging rights. The authors and advocates of the Republican budget \neither completely ignore the practical impact of their dangerous cuts \nor they know the damage they will do and simply don't care. Either way, \nit is not right.\n  Their budget would not do a thing to lower unemployment. In fact, it \nwill cost the country 700,000 jobs. That is not my estimate but the \nestimate of the head of Moody's, an independent economist who has \nworked for both Democrats and Republicans.\n  It will also hurt seniors. It slashes funding from the Social \nSecurity Administration, which means seniors and disabled Americans who \ncount on the benefits they have earned over a lifetime of hard work \nwill have to wait for these benefits. In many cases, those Social \nSecurity checks are seniors' only source of income. In some cases, they \nare the only thing keeping them out of poverty, and those checks have \nnothing at all to do with the deficit--nothing.\n  The Republican budget will hurt women and their families. It cuts \nnutritional programs for women, infants, and children. This program has \nnothing to do with the deficit. This program--the WIC Program, Women, \nInfants and Children--is a program for the very poor. Their budget \nmakes cuts to Planned Parenthood based on ideology, not economics. \nPlanned Parenthood doesn't contribute to the deficit, but it does \ncontribute, in great measure, to the health and safety of women of \nevery age in every State.\n  Their budget will also hurt our veterans. There is a veterans program \nin this country that helps homeless veterans afford housing. Democrats \nthink our Nation's veterans who are down and out deserve a roof over \ntheir heads, and we think it is a worthy program. The Republican budget \nnearly eliminates it.\n  Their budget will also hurt students. The tea party plan kicks \nhundreds of thousands of impoverished boys and girls out of Head Start, \na program to allow them to learn to read--little preschool kids. It \ncuts college students' Pell grants and slashes job training programs. \nThat is no way to recover.\n  Independent economists have analyzed the tea party's plan and found \nit will actually put the brakes on economic growth. The point of this \nwhole exercise--of a budget--is to help the economy. Democrats will not \nstand for a budget that weakens our economy.\n  None of the people I have just mentioned led us into the recession. \nPunishing innocent bystanders, such as seniors, women, veterans, and \nstudents will not lead us to a recovery. This is what we mean when we \nsay their budget is based on ideology and not reality. This is what we \nmean when we say the Republican and tea party budget slashes \nirresponsibly. When they refuse to relent on those dangerous cuts--many \nof which have nothing to do with the deficit--that is what we mean when \nwe say the other side simply isn't being reasonable.\n  Our national budget reflects our values and the tough choices we \nmake. Democrats have made many tough choices because we know sacrifices \nare the cost of consensus, and we believe they are worth it. But we \nhave never forgotten that what we cut is more important than how much \nwe cut.\n  In addition to the many choices about what to slash and what to keep, \nthe Republican leadership has another very big choice to make: It has \nto decide whether it will do what the tea party wants it to do or what \nthe country needs it to do.\n  I am hopeful it will make the right choice and we can come to a \ntimely agreement. But the bottom line is this: At the end of the day, \nwe are all on the same side. Time now is not on our side.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2064-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, amidst all the other business we will \nbe facing this week, I wish to note a welcome development in the war on \nterror. For the last 2 years, the Obama administration has actively \nsought to bring the 9/11 plotters into our communities for civilian \ntrials, a completely horrible idea that rightly drew overwhelming \nbipartisan opposition from the American people and from their elected \nRepresentatives here in Congress. Today, the administration is \nannouncing it has changed course. The administration, incredibly \nenough, today is announcing it has changed course and that Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed and the others who plotted these horrible attacks will \nbe tried in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay rather than in a \ncivilian trial in New York or some other U.S. city.\n  I remember all of our discussions on this issue over the last 2 \nyears. The President issued an Executive order on day 1 to close \nGuantanamo. He indicated they were going to mainstream these terrorists \ninto the U.S. court system, so this change today is truly a welcome \ndevelopment, the administration announcing that KSM and the others who \nplotted these crimes will be tried in a proper jurisdiction, these \nmilitary commissions, at the proper place for these commission trials, \nGuantanamo Bay. This is the right outcome to the long and spirited \ndebate that preceded this decision. Military commissions at Guantanamo, \nfar from the U.S. mainland, were always the right idea for a variety of \ncompelling reasons which I and others have enumerated repeatedly over \nthe last years. For the sake of the safety and the security of the \nAmerican people, I am glad the President reconsidered his position on \nhow and where to try these detailees. Going forward, this model should \nbe the rule rather than the exception. I am sure this decision will \ndraw widespread approval and it is very welcome news.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2064-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the business at hand is the amendments to \nthe small business act. The amendment that has been most talked about \nis the one I have authored, along with Senator McConnell. It is the \nsame thing as the bill I introduced some time ago with Congressman Fred \nUpton of the House and myself in the Senate.\n  To give a little background, let me say this has been about a 9-year \nbattle for me. I have gone back, all the way back to Kyoto when we \ntalked about the fact that we were going to have to do something to \nlimit greenhouse gases at that time. This was a national treaty at that \ntime during the Clinton-Gore administration. Everyone at that time \nstated and believed, and I agreed because no one said anything to the \ncontrary, that anthropogenic gases, greenhouse gases, methane and so \nforth, CO2, caused catastrophic global warming. That started \nwith the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change. It \nmet many years ago, back in the 1990s.\n  Then there was a wakeup call and we thought, Why should we, the \nUnited States of America, sign on to a treaty when the rest of the \nworld was not going to do it, when it was going to be difficult for us \neconomically, and it would not affect the developing world? So we \npassed a resolution saying we were not going to do it.\n  However, right after that, starting in 2003--2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, \nand as recently as last year--different Members have introduced \nlegislation that would impose almost the same thing as the Kyoto treaty \non us and that is cap and trade.\n  At that time, Republicans were the majority. I was the chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. In that committee we \nthought we had better look at this to make sure the science is there. \nThis is important, because we had found out that for us to pass a cap-\nand-trade bill, the cost would be somewhere between $300 and $400 \nbillion a year. My feeling, as chairman of that committee, was let's \nfind out if in fact the science is there.\n  Scientists started coming to me--one after another and another when \nthey knew I was going to at least question the legitimacy of the \nscience--and said: The science is not there. We would like the \nopportunity to get our views in.\n  That became a reality, so we defeated all the bills up to and \nincluding the Waxman-Markey bill that passed the House and came over to \nthe Senate. Let me say we are talking about something that would cost \nthe American people between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.\n  Sometimes I am not quite as smart as some of the guys here, so when \nyou talk about billions and trillions of dollars I like to look and see \nhow does that affect my State of Oklahoma. I have the total number of \ntax returns filed by Oklahomans. I do the math. When you do the math \nwith $300 to $400 billion a year that means it would cost my average \ntaxpayer who files a tax return in Oklahoma a little over $3,100 a \nyear.\n  If that is going to stop the world from coming to the end, maybe it \nis worth that. But what do you get for that? I even asked Lisa Jackson, \nthe Administrator of the EPA. She is one appointed by President Obama. \nI asked her in a public hearing if we were to pass any of these cap-\nand-trade bills that would be so costly to Americans, what would it do \nin terms of greenhouse gases?\n  Her response was it would do very little if anything because that \nwould only affect the United States of America and that is not where \nthe problem is. The problem is in China and India and Mexico, places \nwhere they do not have any restraints on emissions. So as we lost our \njobs to other states, obviously it is going to end up not decreasing \nbut increasing the emissions of CO2.\n  That is where we were. We passed all these things. With the President \nabsolutely committed to doing something about the emissions of \nCO2, he decided he would do through regulation what he could \nnot do through legislation. We had legislation that could not pass and \nso obviously he went ahead and started saying we are going to let the \nEPA do the same thing as we would have done in with legislation. That, \nagain, would cost the American people between $300 and $400 billion a \nyear.\n  This is kind of in the weeds, but to do that you have to have an \nendangerment finding and the endangerment finding has to be a \nproclamation by the administration. It has to be based on science.\n  A year-and-a-half ago, right before the Copenhagen event, again, Lisa \nJackson, the Administrator of the EPA, a very fine person who is \ncourageous enough to tell the truth when asked a question, was in and I \nagain asked in a public forum: Director Jackson, I am going to leave \nfor Copenhagen. I am going to be a one-man truth squad to go over there \nand undo the damage that has been done by people who are going to go \nover there and try to make people think we are going to pass all kinds \nof legislation. If you are going to do this through the administration, \nthat means you have to base it on some type of science. I asked the \nquestion: What science would you base this assumption on, the \nendangerment finding?\n  The answer was the IPCC. That is the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change. It is the United Nations. For others who get offended \nby some of the things the United Nations does, it all started with the \nUnited Nations. We are going to be in a position to see where we would \ngo from here.\n  With that, coincidentally--and it was not by design--somebody \nuncovered a lot of e-mails and things over in Europe that totally \ndebunked or discredited what they were trying to do over there with the \nscience. In other words, the IPCC was cooking the science. I think we \nall know that.\n  Now we have an effort to use an endangerment finding to try to do \nthis by regulation. They are going full ahead as much as they can.\n  I have to say, it is my feeling the Obama administration does not \nwant to have fossil fuels. When I say that, I would back up some of \nthose things by stating what the administration said. Alan Krueger, the \nAssistant Secretary for Economic Policy, said:\n\n       The administration believes it is not longer sufficient to \n     address the nation's energy needs by finding more fossil \n     fuels.\n\n  We are talking about oil, gas, coal, fossil fuels.\n  Then there was a statement made:\n\n       To the extent lower tax rate encourages overproduction of \n     oil and gas, it is detrimental to long-term energy security. \n     . . .\n\n  By this, the Nation is saying we want green energy. That is fine. \nAfter I am dead and gone, I am sure the technology will be there and we \nwill be able to run the country on green energy. In the meantime, you \ncannot do it without oil, gas, and coal. Right now we are depending on \ncoal for 50 percent of all of our energy.\n  I wish to say also, here is another statement out of the Obama \nadministration. Steven Chu, Secretary of Energy, told the Wall Street \nJournal ``somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \ngasoline to the levels in Europe.''\n  In other words, unless we get the American people complaining about \nthe high price of gas, we are not going to be doing anything. The \nbottom line is they are trying to boost the price of gas to do that.\n  This is the surprise here. I could not have said this a year ago, but \nthe CRS, Congressional Research Service, which pretty much is not \nchallenged, came out with the fact that we in the United States have \nmore recoverable reserves in oil, gas, and coal than any other country \nin the world. Here we are. The next is Russia. Next to that is Saudi \nArabia. You can see that we have more than Saudi Arabia, China, and \nIran all put together. That is us right there, the United States of \nAmerica. We have those reserves.\n  You will hear people say we do not because we only have 3 percent of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\nworld's supply of oil and gas. They are saying that because they are \nusing the term ``proven reserves.'' In order to have proven reserves \nyou have to drill to find out and prove the oil is there. Obviously, if \nwe have a government, an administration that will not let us drill for \noil and gas, then we cannot get about proving it, so we have to go by \n``recoverable.'' No one will argue with this--well, they might argue \nbut they cannot do it with a straight face--that our recoverable \nreserves are very large. Here, in the case of oil, it is this amount \nright here--135 billion barrels of oil, 83 percent of the oil. By the \nway, 83 percent of the oil that would be on public lands that we will \nnot allow ourselves--or the liberals in this body will not allow us, \nand the White House, to drill on because of not just a moratorium but \nthey stopped us from doing it sometimes through not issuing permits.\n  But we have enough oil out there to run this country for 50 years \nwithout relying upon anybody else, without relying upon, certainly, the \nMiddle East or any of the rest of our hemisphere.\n  If we were to go ahead with the friendlies in our hemisphere, Canada \nand Mexico, we could be independent of the Middle East in a very short \nperiod of time.\n  The United States has 28 percent of all of the coal, and that is very \nsignificant. As far as natural gas is concerned, we have enough natural \ngas to actually run this country for 90 years at the rate we are using \nnatural gas now, only on our own, if we would allow ourselves to go \nahead and produce it.\n  So that is where we are right now. Of course, I would be remiss if I \ndid not say we have been wanting my amendment. It is amendment No. 183 \nto the Small Business Act. We have been trying to bring it up for 3 \nweeks now. Several times it has been postponed. I think it has been \npostponed for one of two reasons. Either they do not have the votes to \nstop it--and according to Senator Manchin, West Virginia, who stated \njust the other day there are 12 or 13 Democrats willing to vote for my \namendment, and you get all the Republicans, that would be enough to \nreach 60 and pass my amendment.\n  What does my amendment do? It takes away the jurisdiction from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases. \nSimple as that. So maybe we have the votes, but the other reason is--\nand I do not blame the leadership on the other side of the aisle--they \ndo not want to subject their Senators to voting, to have to cast a vote \nthat would allow the EPA to continue harassing and overregulating \nmanufacturers and refineries and businesses and farmers and the rest of \nAmerica.\n  Well, there are two votes that are out there that they have offered \nas cover votes. One is the Baucus amendment; the other is the \nRockefeller amendment. The Baucus amendment would exempt some of the \nsmaller ones. Frankly, I think everyone knows that is something that \nwould not work. In fact, somewhere I have the quote from the American \nFarm Bureau. Well, I do not have it right here, but, by and large, what \nthey say is that they want to be sure everyone understands we cannot \npass the Baucus amendment because that will just--we could exempt some \nfarmers and some other smaller people, schools, maybe churches; but \nwith the higher price of energy, it all trickles down to them. So that \nis why the American Farm Bureau, the Association of Manufacturers, and \nothers are very much in favor of my amendment.\n  The other one is the Rockefeller amendment that would merely delay it \nfor 2 years. The reason I am opposed to this--and on the floor of the \nSenate, Senator Rockefeller made some statements the other day that \nwere not very flattering. That is unlike him because that is normally \nnot the way he would do it. Unfortunately, my effort was dubbed as \n``childlike,'' ``immature,'' and, yes, you guessed it, ``crazy'' too. \nBut I will only say that over the years Senator Rockefeller has stated \nthat the EPA--well, I will just read to you what he has stated: EPA has \nlittle or no authority to address economic needs. They say they do, but \nthey don't. They have no ability to incentivize and deploy new \ntechnologies. They have no obligation to protect the hard-working \npeople. And on and on.\n  So I would agree with those statements of Senator Rockefeller. I \nwould just say, if we are going to get rid of this, the overregulation, \nlet's go ahead and do it. Let's not postpone it for 2 years. We have \ndocumentation from various companies, industries that say we are going \nto put something in place that is going to employ a large number of \npeople, but we cannot do it so long as the uncertainty is out there.\n  At Point Comfort in Texas, 1,182 jobs were lost. They wanted to--they \nwere planning--Formosa Plastics--had been planning a $1 billion \nexpansion. It would have employed 700 construction jobs, 357 service \njobs, and 125 full-time operations and maintenance jobs. Yet they are \nnot doing it because of the regulation that is taking place and the \nuncertainty of what the EPA is going to be doing to us.\n  El Dorado, AR, similar situation. Arkansas-based Lion Oil was forced \nto delay several hundred million dollars in refinery expansion because \nof the uncertainty of the regulation by the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Louisiana, the same thing; 1,850 jobs were lost.\n  I have had people ask me over the years: Inhofe, what if you are \nwrong? Well, this is what I would say and how I respond to that. When \nyou stop and say I am wrong and actually that greenhouse gases do cause \ncatastrophic global warming, if that is the case, then you are not \ngoing to resolve it by having the United States of America do something \nunilaterally.\n  The Chinese are over there celebrating right now, hoping we will pass \nsomething to stop us from regulating or make us regulate greenhouse \ngases because those jobs we have--we have all of the figures. If anyone \nis interested, my Web site is Inhofe.Senate.gov. We can quantify the \njobs lost and money involved.\n  Stop and think about it. Anyone who has a comparable State to \nOklahoma, do you want to increase your taxes by over $3,000 a year and \nget nothing for it?\n  With that, I would make another appeal to the administration and to \nthe Democrats in the Senate, to call a vote on my amendment No. 183. \nJust call it and let's get this behind us. Let's try to save energy for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal.) The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague from \nOklahoma for the leadership he has exercised with respect to the rogue \nEnvironmental Protection Agency attempting to regulate, in effect, what \nwe breathe and the job-killing program that would result from the \nregulations that would be prohibited from being adopted were the \nInhofe-McConnell amendment to be adopted by this body. I share his \ndesire that we be able to vote on that and stop these onerous \nregulations from being put into effect.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak not to exceed 15 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2066-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2066-S2068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to address two things but start with \nhealth care. I recall that during the debate over health care--and we \ncelebrated the 1-year anniversary of the signing of the health care \nlegislation a little over a week ago. But I recall then-Speaker of the \nHouse Nancy Pelosi saying: We will have to pass the bill in order to \nfind out what is in it. I do not think she realized how true her \nstatement really was.\n  I just read something over the weekend from a March 31 edition of the \nWashington Examiner. I ask unanimous consent to have this article by \nByron York printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. KYL. I will read the first sentence and then a couple of other \nitems from it. The headline is ``Uncovered: New $2 billion bailout in \nObamacare.''\n  Here is the first sentence in the story:\n\n       Investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee \n     have discovered that a little-known provision in the national \n     health\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\n     care law has allowed the Federal Government to pay nearly $2 \n     billion to unions, state public employee systems, and big \n     corporations to subsidize health coverage costs for early \n     retirees.\n\n  Then the article goes on to point out that they discovered this in \noversight hearings of an obscure agency known as the CCIO, or the \nCenter for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. The idea under \nthe law apparently was to subsidize unions and States and companies \nthat had made commitments to provide health insurance for workers who \nretired early.\n\n  They point out that there was a $5 billion appropriation in the bill, \nand at the rate of spending by this agency they will burn through the \nentire $5 billion as early as 2012. And where is the money being sent \nto? Well, by far and away, the biggest single recipient is the United \nAuto Workers Labor Union, which so far had received well over $200 \nmillion.\n  Other recipients include AT, Verizon, General Electric, General \nMotors Corporation, and a few State public employees retirement \nsystems. But, by far and away, the contribution to the United Auto \nWorkers and the Teamsters and United Food and Commercial Workers was \nmore than the amount of money sent to the State pension funds--the \npoint being that we learn something new almost every week about \nObamacare.\n  As I said, it was just a little over a week ago that it celebrated \nits first anniversary, and we are only now discovering some of the \nthings that were hidden away in it, which I think had we been able to \ndebate the bill in a more appropriate fashion--remember, it passed on \nChristmas Eve day of the year before last--we probably would have been \nable to discover these things. Had the bill been read, had we had time \nto read all of the fine print, these are the kinds of things that we \nwould have discovered; and I suspect the proponents of the bill, those \nwho voted for it, might not have been so quick to vote for it.\n  Maybe we will have a chance to repeal this particular provision of \nthe bill if there is any money left that has not been spent by the time \nwe get around to doing that. I will propose to my colleagues that we \ntry to accomplish that.\n  The second point with respect to Obamacare that continues to trouble \nme is something called the Independent Payment Advisory Board. This is \ntroublesome for three reasons, two of which have to do with process and \nthe third the substance. The Independent Payment Advisory Board goes by \nthe acronym of IPAP, and it was created in order to try to find savings \nin the Medicare Program.\n  Now, obviously, we have read a lot about the billions, tens of \nbillions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. The problem \nis, this board is not likely to get at that waste, fraud, and abuse \nbecause its primary mission--and, in fact, it is restricted to finding \ncost savings only as a result of reducing the payments to providers. In \nfact, James Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center has done \nsome very good writing on this subject, and he notes that the board is \nstrictly limited to what it can recommend and implement and that the \nboard can only ``cut Medicare payment rates for those providing \nservices to beneficiaries.''\n  Well, that is a problem because it does not get to the real heart of \na lot of the waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. Secondly--and I will \nconclude my remarks with this main point--when we cut the payment rates \nfor the doctors, for example, who are taking care of Medicare patients, \nwhat happens? We get fewer doctors willing to take care of Medicare \npatients.\n  We are all familiar with the stories in our own States of more and \nmore physicians either not taking any Medicare patients or at least not \ntaking any new Medicare patients. As a result, there are far fewer \ndoctors available to treat folks, which means there is a much longer \nwaiting time for people to get the care they need. The end result of \nthat is, of course, care delayed is frequently care denied. That is the \nproblem that exists in other countries such as Great Britain, our \nneighbor to the north, Canada, and it is coming to your own community \npretty soon as a result of the fact that we are not paying the \nphysicians and other providers enough as it is. That is the only thing \nthat IPAP can do to further reduce the costs.\n  But I mentioned two procedural problems. The first is that this board \nis comprised of 15 unelected bureaucrats. The President makes the \nappointments. He does not have to balance them politically, so they can \nall be members of one political party. He can make recess appointments \nso the Senate may not even have an opportunity to pass on these \nindividuals.\n  The second procedural problem is, when they make their \nrecommendations it comes to the Congress in a take-it-or-leave-it \nprocedural posture; that is to say, either Congress adopts the \nrecommendations of the board or at a number equal to that, with what we \ndecide ourselves is the appropriate way to achieve that amount, or the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services must implement the board's \noriginal recommendations, period. That is it.\n  So we are ceding authority to an unelected board of people whose \npolitical views could reflect, for example, only those of the President \nof the United States, and whose recommendations almost automatically \nbecome law. Only if the Congress, within a specified period of time, is \nable to recommend an alternative that can get the votes, and it would \nhave to be a 60-vote majority, would the recommendations of the board \nbe overridden.\n  So for procedural reasons this was not the right way to tackle the \nproblem of costs of the Medicare Program that we do need to get a \nhandle on. It is a very undemocratic approach. But as I said, the \nprocedure is part of the problem. The real question is, how are we \ngoing to address costs in Medicare?\n  Now, we are going to see some very innovative ideas from the House of \nRepresentatives, from the Budget chairman, Paul Ryan, this week when \nthe House budget is released. He will tackle the tough problem of \nhelping to constrain the costs of Medicare. One of the ways I find very \nunappealing to control Medicare costs is putting a cap on how much we \ncan spend and reimbursing the providers, in particular physicians, with \nthat particular cap in mind.\n  As I said, the reason is because it is going to cost physicians a \ncertain amount of money to take care of each patient. If they cannot be \nreimbursed in an amount sufficient to cover their expenses and a little \nbit more, they are simply going to turn to other kinds of patients.\n  They have already turned away from Medicaid patients because Medicaid \ndoes not reimburse at a level that meets their requirements. As a \nresult, it is a dirty little secret in the medical profession that \nMedicaid is rationed health care. That is not right. These are the \npoorest in our society. They need support. They need help. But they \nhave to wait a long time. A lot of times, there just aren't the people \nto take care of them. Now we are going to convert the system that takes \ncare of senior citizens into the same kind of whatever-we-have-\navailable kind of service because when we begin reducing payments to \nproviders, we will get fewer providers, with the result that we will \nget less care. It is a simple matter of economics.\n  This is being recommended not by physicians, not by the patients \ngroups, and so on, but by people who are unelected bureaucrats \nappointed to this board. According to Mr. Capretta, under the law this \nis all the board can do. This is what it is restricted to doing. By \ncutting Medicare patients, the board will only delay and deny care. \nThat is the critical point.\n  I am painting this picture of physicians not being paid enough. The \nreality is that today Medicare already pays physicians 20 percent less \nthan private insurance companies do. Part of that is because private \ninsurance companies are cost shifters. When a physician can't make \nenough money serving government-paid-for patients--Medicare--then they \ncharge more to private sector-paid patients. We therefore are paying \nmore in the private sector for our insurance than it really would cost, \nbut that is in order to subsidize the payment of physicians who don't \nmake enough under Medicare today. What the IPAB would do is reduce \nthose payments even more. This, in turn, will lead to reduced access to \ncare for seniors, and reduced access to care means rationed care.\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\n  I quoted James Capretta before. He says:\n\n       In a very real sense, seniors will be the ones holding the \n     bag from these cuts when they can't access care due to a lack \n     of willing suppliers.\n\n  I will close this point by noting that there is another government \nhealth care program I am very familiar with because of the large number \nof Native Americans in Arizona who have access to health care from the \nFederal Government under the Indian Health Service. In Indian Country, \nthey have a saying that is not really facetious. They say it with a bit \nof a wry smile on their face, but they are not at all happy. They say: \nJust get sick before July. The reason is, there is a definite limit on \nhow much the program will pay out. They set a cap at the beginning of \nthe year, and when enough people have gotten sick enough to a certain \npoint in the year, that is the end of the coverage. So they wait until \nmoney is available the next year.\n  That is an oversimplification, but it is what a total single-payer \ngovernment system does. When we need to cut costs, we reduce the amount \nof money available. And who suffers? The people to whom we promised \ncare. We see it in the Indian Health Service. We are seeing it now in \nMedicaid. We are going to see it in Medicare if we are not careful.\n  That is why we need to repeal the IPAB, the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board established under ObamaCare. There is legislation \nintroduced to do this. Senator Cornyn and I cosponsored the Health Care \nBureaucrats Elimination Act, S. 668, which would eliminate the IPAB. I \nhope we will have an opportunity to bring that legislation to the floor \nso that my colleagues can join us in excising this piece of ObamaCare \nso that our seniors don't suffer from rationed health care. There is a \nlong group of organizations which joins us in our opposition to IPAB, \ngroups such as the American Health Care Association, the American \nCollege of Radiology, National Senior Citizens Law Center, National \nAssociation of Social Workers, Volunteers of America, and others.\n  I hope that when the time comes, we will have an opportunity to have \na debate about this aspect of ObamaCare. I know the supporters of the \nhealth care reform act did not intend this negative result. I am not \nsuggesting that colleagues who supported ObamaCare love seniors any \nless than I love my mother, and they love their parents and others. \nThat is not the point. Laws have unintended consequences. When we \ncreate a mechanism to save money such as this one and constrain it the \nway we have, I know what we will get, and we will not like it. We will \nhear from seniors. And before I hear from my mother, I would just as \nsoon get this problem fixed.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [From the Examiner, Mar. 31, 2011]\n\n             Uncovered: New $2 Billion Bailout in Obamacare\n\n                            (By Byron York)\n\n       Investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee \n     have discovered that a little-known provision in the national \n     health care law has allowed the federal government to pay \n     nearly $2 billion to unions, state public employee systems, \n     and big corporations to subsidize health coverage costs for \n     early retirees. At the current rate of payment, the $5 \n     billion appropriated for the program could be exhausted well \n     before it is set to expire.\n       The discovery came on the eve of an oversight hearing \n     focused on the workings of an obscure agency known as CCIO--\n     the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. \n     CCIO, which is part of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, oversees the implementation of Section 1102 of the \n     Affordable Care Act, which created something called the Early \n     Retiree Reinsurance Program. The legislation called for the \n     program to spend a total of $5 billion, beginning in June \n     2010--shortly after Obamacare was passed--and ending on \n     January 1, 2014, as the system of national health care \n     exchanges was scheduled to go into effect.\n       The idea was to subsidize unions, states, and companies \n     that had made commitments to provide health insurance for \n     workers who retired early--between the ages of 55 and 64, \n     before they were eligible for Medicare. According to a new \n     report prepared by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, ``People in the early retiree age group . . . often \n     face difficulties obtaining insurance in the individual \n     market because of age or chronic conditions that make \n     coverage unaffordable or inaccessible.'' As a result, fewer \n     and fewer organizations have been offering coverage to early \n     retirees; the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program was designed \n     to subsidize such coverage until the creation of Obamacare's \n     health-care exchanges.\n       The program began making payouts on June 1, 2010. Between \n     that date and the end of 2010, it paid out about $535 million \n     dollars. But according to the new report, the rate of \n     spending has since increased dramatically, to about $1.3 \n     billion just for the first two and a half months of this \n     year. At that rate, it could burn through the entire $5 \n     billion appropriation as early as 2012.\n       Where is the money going? According to the new report, the \n     biggest single recipient of an early-retiree bailout is the \n     United Auto Workers, which has so far received $206,798,086. \n     Other big recipients include AT, which received \n     $140,022,949, and Verizon, which received $91,702,538. \n     General Electric, in the news recently for not paying any \n     U.S. taxes last year, received $36,607,818. General Motors, \n     recipient of a massive government bailout, received \n     $19,002,669.\n       The program also paid large sums of money to state \n     governments. The Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio \n     received $70,557,764; the Teacher Retirement System of Texas \n     received $68,074,118; the California Public Employees \n     Retirement System, or CalPERS, received $57,834,267; the \n     Georgia Department of Community Health received $57,936,127; \n     and the state of New York received $47,869,044. Other states \n     received lesser but still substantial sums.\n       But payments to individual states were dwarfed by the \n     payout to the auto workers union, which received more than \n     the states of New York, California, and Texas combined. Other \n     unions also received government funds, including the United \n     Food and Commercial Workers, the United Mine Workers, and the \n     Teamsters.\n       Republican investigators count the early-retiree program \n     among those that would never have become law had Democrats \n     allowed more scrutiny of Obamacare at the time it was pushed \n     through the House and Senate. Since then, Republicans have \n     kept an eye on the program but were not able to pry any \n     information out of the administration until after the GOP won \n     control of the House last November. Now, finally, they are \n     learning what's going on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2068-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2068-S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET GAME-CHANGER\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, finally, I wish to have printed in the Record \nand discuss briefly an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal of today titled \n``Time for a Budget Game-Changer.'' This was written by Gary Becker, \nGeorge P. Shultz, and John Taylor. John Taylor and Gary Becker are both \neconomist professors, Becker at the University of Chicago, Taylor at \nStanford. Of course, George Shultz is a former Secretary of Labor, \nSecretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of State. All three are \naffiliated with the Hoover Institution. In this article, they present a \nreal answer to the two key problems that face us today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this piece be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. The two key problems are that we don't have enough jobs and \nwe have a very high unemployment rate. We need to get the economy \ngrowing, and we are having to borrow far too much money because of \ngovernment spending. What this piece points out is that there is a \ndirect relationship between the two. That is not too surprising. The \nbottom line is that government borrowing and spending distorts the \nmarket by making less money available for the private sector to invest. \nIf the private sector can invest, jobs can be created and we can grow \nthe economy.\n  What they do in this piece is create a credible strategy to reduce \nthe growth of Federal government spending, bring the deficit down, and \nincrease economic growth. Those goals are not only not inimical to each \nother, they actually fit together nicely.\n  As they point out, the essential first step is to reduce \ndiscretionary spending in the current fiscal year, 2011. That is the \nwork the Senate and House are engaged in right now. We will have to \npass a continuing resolution to fund the government through the end of \nSeptember. We can substantially reduce the spending, and they point out \nhow in this op-ed.\n  The second part is a longer term plan to get total spending as a \nshare of GDP down. They have a plan to do that in a relatively gradual \nway but that nevertheless provides real, substantial savings over the \nnext 10 years and longer to a point that is consistent with the \nhistorical relationship between the revenues the government has \ncollected and the spending the government makes.\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\n  Let me quote the first three sentences of their op-ed:\n\n       Wanted: A strategy for economic growth, full employment, \n     and deficit reduction--all without inflation. Experience \n     shows how to get there. Credible actions that reduce the \n     rapid growth of federal spending and debt will raise economic \n     growth and lower the unemployment rate. Higher private \n     investment, not more government purchases, is the surest way \n     to increase prosperity.\n\n  They go on to point out:\n\n       When private investment is high, unemployment is low. In \n     contrast, higher government spending is not associated with \n     lower unemployment.\n\n  It is a piece I recommend to all of my colleagues because it \nestablishes--and these are first-rate economists who have done the \nresearch and can demonstrate beyond peradventure the direct \nrelationship between reduced government spending and more employment \nand growth. The bottom line is, if we leave more money in the private \nsector to be invested by businesses in the private sector, the more \nthey will invest and hire people, and the more the economy will grow. \nIronically, the more the economy grows, the more revenues the Federal \nGovernment gets because we have more taxes and a higher tax basis.\n  Private economic growth is good for families and businesses and \npeople seeking jobs as well as for the Federal Government if we are \nlooking for more revenue. The wrong answer is to spend more money in \nthe government, 40-plus cents of which has to be borrowed. Every dollar \nwe spend we have to borrow 40 cents of, half of which is borrowed from \ncountries abroad. That borrowing and spending crowds out opportunities \nin the private market to do the same.\n  So there is a direct relationship in terms of how much we can reduce \nFederal spending on the one hand and how much we can grow the economy \non the other. That is what these economists point out--the way for us \nboth in the short term and the longer term to get a handle on both the \nFederal budget deficit and induce the private sector to invest more, \nthus reducing unemployment and increasing our economic growth.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 4, 2011]\n\n                     Time For a Budget Game-Changer\n\n        (By Gary S. Becker, George P. Shultz and John B. Taylor)\n\n       Wanted: A strategy for economic growth, full employment, \n     and deficit reduction--all without inflation. Experience \n     shows how to get there. Credible actions that reduce the \n     rapid growth of federal spending and debt will raise economic \n     growth and lower the unemployment rate. Higher private \n     investment, not more government purchases, is the surest way \n     to increase prosperity.\n       When private investment is high, unemployment is low. In \n     2006, investment--business fixed investment plus residential \n     investment--as a share of GDP was high, at 17%, and \n     unemployment was low, at 5%. By 2010 private investment as a \n     share of GDP was down to 12%, and unemployment was up to more \n     than 9%. In the year 2000, investment as a share of GDP was \n     17% while unemployment averaged around 4%. This is a regular \n     pattern.\n       In contrast, higher government spending is not associated \n     with lower unemployment. For example, when government \n     purchases of goods and services came down as a share of GDP \n     in the 1990s, unemployment didn't rise. In fact it fell, and \n     the higher level of government purchases as a share of GDP \n     since 2000 has clearly not been associated with lower \n     unemployment.\n       To the extent that government spending crowds out job-\n     creating private investment, it can actually worsen \n     unemployment. Indeed, extensive government efforts to \n     stimulate the economy and reduce joblessness by spending more \n     have failed to reduce joblessness.\n       Above all, the federal government needs a credible and \n     transparent budget strategy. It's time for a game-changer--a \n     budget action that will stop the recent discretionary \n     spending binge before it gets entrenched in government \n     agencies.\n       Second, we need to lay out a path for total federal \n     government spending growth for next year and later years that \n     will gradually bring spending into balance with the amount of \n     tax revenues generated in later years by the current tax \n     system. Assurance that the current tax system will remain in \n     place --pending genuine reform in corporate and personal \n     income taxes--will be an immediate stimulus.\n       All this must be accompanied by an accurate and simple \n     explanation of how the strategy will increase economic \n     growth, an explanation that will counteract scare stories and \n     also allow people outside of government to start making \n     plans, including business plans, to invest and hire. In this \n     respect the budget strategy should be seen in the context of \n     a larger pro-growth, pro-employment government reform \n     strategy.\n       We can see such a sensible budget strategy starting to \n     emerge. The first step of the strategy is largely being \n     addressed by the House budget plan for 2011, or HR1. Though \n     voted down in its entirety by the Senate, it is now being \n     split up into ``continuing'' resolutions that add up to the \n     same spending levels.\n       To see how HR1 works, note that discretionary \n     appropriations other than for defense and homeland security \n     were $460.1 billion in 2010, a sharp 22% increase over the \n     $378.4 billion a mere three years ago. HR1 reverses this \n     bulge by bringing these appropriations to $394.5 billion, \n     which is 4% higher than in 2008. Spending growth is greatly \n     reduced under HR1, but it is still enough to cover inflation \n     over those three years.\n       There is no reason why government agencies--from Treasury \n     and Commerce to the Executive Office of the President--cannot \n     get by with the same amount of funding they had in 2008 plus \n     increases for inflation. Anything less than HR1 would not \n     represent a credible first step. Changes in budget authority \n     convert to government outlays slowly. According to the \n     Congressional Budget Office, outlays will only be $19 billion \n     less in 2011 with HR1, meaning it would take spending to 24% \n     of GDP in 2011 from 24.1% today.\n       If HR1 is the first step of the strategy, then the second \n     step could come in the form of the budget resolution for 2012 \n     also coming out of the House. We do not know what this will \n     look like, but it is likely to entail a gradual reduction in \n     spending as a share of GDP that would, in a reasonable number \n     of years, lead to a balanced budget without tax rate \n     increases.\n       To make the path credible, the budget resolution should \n     include instructions to the appropriations subcommittees \n     elaborating changes in government programs that will make the \n     spending goals a reality. These instructions must include a \n     requirement for reforms of the Social Security and health-\n     care systems.\n       Health-care reform is particularly difficult politically, \n     although absolutely necessary to get long-term government \n     spending under control. This is not the place to go into \n     various ways to make the health-care delivery system cheaper \n     and at the same time much more effective in promoting health. \n     However, it is absolutely essential to make wholesale changes \n     in ObamaCare, and many of its approaches to health reform.\n       The nearby chart shows an example of a path that brings \n     total federal outlays relative to GDP back to the level of \n     2007--19.5%. One line shows outlays as a share of GDP under \n     the CEO baseline released on March 18. The other shows the \n     spending path starting with HR1 in 2011. With HR1 federal \n     outlays grow at 2.7% per year from 2010 to 2021 in nominal \n     terms, while nominal GDP is expected to grow by 4.6% per \n     year.\n       Faster GDP growth will bring a balanced budget more quickly \n     by increasing the growth of tax revenues. Critics will argue \n     that such a budget plan will decrease economic growth and job \n     creation. Some, such as economists at Goldman Sachs and \n     Moody's, have already said that HR1 will lower economic \n     growth by as much as 2% this quarter and the next and cost \n     hundreds of thousands of jobs. But this is highly implausible \n     given the small size of the change in outlays in 2011 under \n     HR1, as shown in the chart. The change in spending is not \n     abrupt, as they claim, but quite gradual.\n       Those who predict that a gradual and credible plan to lower \n     spending growth will reduce job creation disregard the \n     private investment benefits that come from reducing the \n     threats of higher taxes, higher interest rates and a fiscal \n     crisis. This is the same thinking used to claim that the \n     stimulus package worked. These economic models failed in the \n     1970s, failed in 2008, and they are still failing.\n       Control of federal spending and a strategy for ending the \n     deficit will provide assurance that tax rates will not rise--\n     pending tax reform--and that uncontrolled deficits will not \n     recur. This assurance must be the foundation of strategy for \n     a healthy economy.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here to essentially support the hard \nwork of a colleague, Senator Johanns, in bringing to the floor tomorrow \na vote to repeal the 1099 provisions in the current health care bill.\n  As I campaigned throughout the State of Indiana over this past year, \nmeeting with businesspeople and individuals running shops in a small \ntown\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nand large businesses on the outskirts of busy manufacturing centers, \nseveral themes were repeated over and over and over. One was that we \ncontinue to have problems in creating jobs because of the massive \namount of regulations that are flowing out of Washington that, at a \ntime of fiscal downturn in particular, are keeping our businesses from \ngoing forward and hiring people, being competitive. We spend time in \nthe back room with paperwork, filling out what seems to be unnecessary \nburdens imposed upon us by regulatory agencies.\n  Some of these regulations are necessary. We all know that for \npurposes of health and safety, there are regulations that are important \nin keeping companies' feet to the fire in terms of making sure their \nworkplace is a safe and healthy place to work. These are important, and \nthere are others. But clearly there is an excess. What I heard people \nsaying all across the State of Indiana was that our government has \ngrown too big, it spends too much money and it overregulates. In \nparticular, when it comes to business, that overregulation and \novertaxation is impeding our ability to compete on a worldwide basis to \nprovide the kinds of jobs and services America is used to providing in \nsuch a successful way.\n  Tomorrow, this vote will deal with an aspect of the health care bill \nthat was passed in the last Congress. Tucked away in that health care \nbill is a provision requiring every company, every church, every \ncharity to submit a separate IRS 1099 form for taxes detailing and \ndescribing the goods they purchase in order to run their church, run \ntheir hospital, run their business, run their charity.\n  I have talked to hospitals--small and rural, big and large--across \nthe State of Indiana, and they say: Do you realize how many separate \nitems we purchase every year of over $600? Do you understand how many \nhundreds, if not thousands, of prescription drugs we purchase in order \nto have them available here to perform our services in this hospital, \nhow many bandaids, how many cotton patches, how many sophisticated \ndrugs?\n  Hundreds of thousands of items are purchased by large companies every \nyear, and each one of those now has to be calculated as to whether the \npurchase price was more than $600 for the lot they buy, and it has to \nbe detailed and then sent to Washington. There are not enough \nbureaucrats in Washington to begin to process the paperwork that would \nflood into this city. There are not enough buildings in this city to \nhouse those bureaucrats processing those forms. There are not enough \nwarehouses in this city to store the forms that would flow in here. All \nfor what reason? Because supposedly this is a way to collect more taxes \non companies that have not submitted forms where they have actually \npurchased this particular material, even though they are required under \nthe tax laws to honestly--and I believe it is almost unanimous; maybe \n99 percent of the time--do just that. So it is a solution without a \nproblem.\n  Clearly, what Senator Johanns has been attempting to do over the past \nseveral months and even in the last Congress is bring forward a bill \nthat would repeal this onerous provision of the health care law.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said this about the 1099 reporting \nrequirement:\n\n       At a time when they can least afford it, entities will have \n     to institute new complex record-keeping, data collection and \n     reporting requirements to track every purchase by vendor and \n     payment method. This provision will dramatically increase \n     accounting costs and could expose businesses to costly and \n     unjustified audits by the IRS.\n\n  Even the IRS Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee has \nruled against this, deeming this mandate ``burdensome'' with ``no \nmeasurable purpose.''\n  Forcing businesses to spend time in the back room to fill out all \nthese forms and do all this record keeping--and particularly those \nsmall businesses that do not have the back room, where the owner and \nthe proprietor of the business is the one who has to fill out these \nforms instead of being out there selling his services or running his \nbusiness--they are particularly burdened by this unnecessary \nregulation.\n  Clearly, if we want to promote our businesses, help them hire more \npeople, and get more people back to work, we have to release them from \nthe burden of unnecessary regulation and, I would also add to that, \ntaxation. So tomorrow, when this vote comes up, let's adopt the Johanns \namendment to repeal this unnecessary and costly provision and send it \nto the White House for the President's signature.\n  While we are at it, let's also continue to take a look at the health \ncare bill because if this provision somehow survived scrutiny before \npassage, there must be many more of these in there. Let me just mention \none of them that directly impacts my State.\n  Medical device companies are a key industry in the State of Indiana. \nIn fact, we are one of the leading States, if not the leading State in \nthe country, for the number of people engaged in producing medical \ndevices. That industry was slapped with a 2.3-percent sales tax on \nmedical devices under the new health care law simply as a means to pay \nfor the new health care law.\n  This is an innovative industry, an industry which is at the cutting \nedge of technology, one of our best exporting industries. They sell all \nover the world. We talk about the loss of American capacity to \nmanufacture. We have a skilled workforce in place, with thousands of \npeople employed throughout the State of Indiana, with several hundred \ncompanies producing medical devices. They have developed the innovation \nand the skill to be the best in the world. Yet, just out of the blue, \nbecause we are looking for a pay-for in the health care bill--that had \nnothing to do with their production of that product or their business--\nthey were slapped with this $20 billion impact tax, a 2.3-percent sales \ntax, which turns out to be about $20 billion under the health care law.\n  I have given these statistics for just the one State of Indiana. I \nknow Minnesota and a number of other States also are engaged in the \nmedical device business. But singling out, though, the medical device \nmanufacturers to help pay for the massive costs of the health care law, \nhinders job growth and stifles innovation. This is a resource-rich, \nresearch-rich industry in America that needs to be encouraged, not \ndiscouraged, that needs to have incentives to go forward, not \ndisincentives, that does not need more regulation and higher taxes but \nneeds to be viewed as producing a product that is the best in the world \nand what the world wants to buy.\n  So as we look at the health care bill, I am sure there are many \nprovisions that need to be addressed. I, of course, am on record for \nrepealing and starting over for reasons I have stated before and will \nnot go into now. I think it is fatally flawed. I think starting over \nwould give us a far more cost-effective, incremental improvement in \nways to address our health care needs in this country without breaking \nthe bank.\n  Nevertheless, if we cannot do that, we need to keep looking at \nsituations such as what we are going to be addressing tomorrow, the \n1099 repeal, and situations such as I have just described with the \nmedical device tax.\n  Mr. President, with that, I will close by urging my colleagues to \ncome and vote for the repeal of the 1099 provision that has been \nbrought forward by Senator Johanns.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, maybe this should have occurred to me \nbefore I last spoke and I should have addressed this. But since no one \nelse is on the floor seeking to be recognized, it occurred to me that \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate represents the State of \nConnecticut, and I represent the State of Indiana. The two of us are \nthe only ones on the floor of the Senate at this particular time. The \nPresiding Officer and I have an event that is very much going to draw \nour attention this evening; that is, the final game of the NCAA \nbasketball tournament, Connecticut versus Butler.\n  I can extoll the virtues of Butler for a long time. I can also take \nsome advantage of the Presiding Officer because he is in the chair and \ncan't reply,\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\nbut I will not do that. I am just here to say we have a friendly bet on \nfor this. I have some good Indiana-produced goodies coming the way of \nthe Presiding Officer, should Connecticut prevail, and I think the \nPresiding Officer has some good Connecticut-produced goodies coming my \nway--by goodies I mean popcorn and a can of beans or whatever our \nStates are famous for producing. I don't want anybody getting the wrong \nimpression of what we possibly are exchanging.\n  Butler has been a dream and a joy for those of us from Indiana and, \nhopefully, from across the country, to watch this small school of 4,400 \nstudents in Indianapolis that produced a team that comes out of a \nmidmajor conference. These schools perhaps aren't familiar to very many \npeople, but yet they have knocked off the giants, with one more giant, \nI might say, to face this evening. But this little Midwestern school \nplays basketball the Hoosier way. They are a credible collection of \nplayers who were not recruited by the big schools but came together and \nworked together as a team under the inspired leadership of their young \ncoach. They have now found themselves as NCAA finalists 2 years in a \nrow, I think something no one would have predicted, particularly after \nthey lost their star player last year who left the school a year early \nto go to the NBA.\n  My best wishes to the Presiding Officer for his team. As much as I \ngive you those best wishes, I am looking forward tomorrow to receiving \nyour part of the bargain delivered to my office, but if not, I will be \nstanding at your front door. It is already assembled just in case. But \nwe are rooting for a great game tonight. I think probably one of the \nmost exciting events that happens in sports is the amateur basketball \ntournament that is played in by our NCAA colleges. It is a joy to watch \nthese young men.\n  Then, tomorrow, I might mention, the Notre Dame women's team will be \nplaying in the finals against Texas A So Indiana is certainly \nputting forth some of its best during these next two nights. I am \nlooking forward to seeing those games tonight. Our hopes are that we \nwill not be in session this evening in the Senate. I don't think we \nwill be. So you and I will be, unfortunately, not in Houston but in \nfront of a big screen TV cheering on our teams.\n  With that, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are in the middle of the budget \ndebate and, as the Ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, it is \nsomething which is very important to me, and, I believe, to America.\n  There are two aspects of it. One is, how will we finish this fiscal \nyear that ends September 30? The House Republicans have sent over \nlegislation that funds the government, but it is $61 billion less than \nwas expected or had been projected under last year's budget. I don't \nthink anyone would be surprised, after the last election and the big \nspenders took a pretty big hit, that there would be a reduction after \nthe continuing resolution of, I guess, 5 months expired. Since that \nexpired a few weeks ago and we have had some short-term continuing \nresolutions, we have reduced spending by about $10 billion. I truly \nbelieve we need to move it on down to a full $61 billion and, over 10 \nyears, that will reduce the baseline by $61 billion and, fairly \ncomputed, it will save, over a 10-year timeframe alone, $860 billion. \nThat is close to $1 trillion. It is real money. It is a significant \nstep we should take. I hope this Congress will take it.\n  The next matter that is before us is, what about next year's budget? \nWe should already be in that cycle. The President has submitted the \nbudget he is required by law to submit to the Congress. It does nothing \nabout the threat to our country economically and financially. It is a \ngreat disappointment, the most irresponsible budget ever submitted, I \nam confident, by any President in the history of the American Republic. \nI have said that before, and I truly believe it. It is irresponsible. \nWe cannot adopt it, we will not adopt it, and it will not become law. \nBut our Senate has indicated they are prepared to consider--Democrats, \ntoo--a better budget, perhaps, but we haven't seen it. It has not been \nbrought forth to the Budget Committee, as the law requires us to do, so \nfar, and we are behind schedule. But the House tomorrow will consider a \nhistoric budget that honestly and carefully confronts the challenges \nfacing us, long term and short term, dealing with entitlements, without \ngimmicks, and allows us to begin to focus on what the challenges are \nand why we have to take these steps.\n  Because who wants to talk about cutting spending? What politician \nlikes to do that? It is not something we like to do. Why are we talking \nabout this? Why? Can't it be put off? Is it just political squabbling \nbetween Republicans and Democrats? They are always bickering. Is this \nwhat it is all about? Is there anything real here? Do we have a problem \nthat can't be avoided? Is it something--can't we just continue like we \nare? Why do we have to worry about more reductions in spending?\n  That is the question: Do we have a real crisis? Are we facing a \nthreat to our economic well-being that could throw this country into \nanother recession, maybe even a depression--surely, hopefully, not--a \nfiscal, financial crisis; is that possible?\n  Let's talk about a couple things. Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, recently stated that our national debt is the \ngreatest threat to our national security. That is a pretty strong \nstatement. Secretary of State Clinton said something very similar. Is \nthat true? The American people pretty clearly agree with Admiral Mullen \nby a huge margin. They say we are on the wrong track. You are \nmismanaging Washington. There was a shellacking of the big spenders in \nthe last election. People know we are spending too much money. We have \nhad a 24-percent increase in spending since President Obama has been \nPresident--a 24-percent increase in discretionary nondefense spending. \nInflation has been 1 or 2 percent during this time, and we had a 24-\npercent increase.\n\n  Next year's budget by the President calls for an 11-percent increase \nin education, a 10.5-percent increase in the State Department, a 9.5-\npercent increase in the Energy Department, and a 61-percent increase in \ntransportation and high-speed rail. What? The inflation rate is 2 \npercent and we have 5 times--or 50 times, nearly, that amount in \nspending increases?\n  Alarmingly, it is not just the American people or just the tea party, \ngreat American people who are concerned about their country. It is not \njust tea party members who are expressing concern and calling for \naction. It is the Nation's top financial experts. This is what is \nimportant. They are calling for action sooner rather than later.\n  Erskine Bowles, President Obama's choice to head the deficit \ncommission, who was also President Clinton's Chief of Staff and is a \nvery successful businessman himself--he was chosen by President Obama \nto head the debt commission, along with Alan Simpson, a former \nRepublican Senator. In a written statement they submitted to the Budget \nCommittee just 2 weeks ago, this is what they said. This is a formal \nwritten statement from the debt commission cochairman to the Budget \nCommittee of the Senate:\n\n       This is the most predictable financial crisis this Nation \n     has ever faced.\n\n  Predictable crisis. In other words, we can see it coming. They spent \nmonths doing research. They heard from all kinds of witnesses. When \nasked when the crisis might occur, which could involve some sort of \ndouble-dip recession or even a longer recession or higher unemployment, \nMr. Bowles said it could be 2 years, maybe sooner, maybe later. Alan \nSimpson said it could be within a year. These are stark warnings, and \nthe same message is coming from a host of the world's top financial \nexperts.\n  I have to say the good news is our country has a strong work ethic \nand an entrepreneurial spirit still exists. The indications are that \ndespite the economic drag and our huge debt burden, the economy--far \nslower than normal recovering from this recession--is\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nstruggling to rebound. If we act decisively now to end our wasteful \nspending habits, we can be confident that progress in growth will \ncontinue.\n  When our Nation's leaders are aware that their country is facing a \ncrisis, they have no higher moral responsibility than to act to protect \nthe Nation from that danger. Today's Wall Street Journal has an op-ed \nby the Nobel Prize laureate, Gary Becker; a former Secretary of the \nTreasury, George Shultz; and an economic professor, John Taylor. The \narticle embraces the $61 billion in reduced spending passed by the \nHouse and debunks the critics unequivocally who call these cuts \nextreme. They directly and categorically rebut the assertion that these \nspending reductions will result in higher job losses and explain why \nthat is a false view.\n  Again, is the debate over spending just another Republican and \nDemocratic squabble? Is it just an attempt to gain political advantage? \nSound and fury signifying nothing?\n  The answer is a resounding no. We are spending money we don't have in \namounts dramatically greater than at any time in our history. When this \nfiscal year ends September 30, we will have spent $3.7 trillion and \ntaken in only $2.2 trillion. Forty cents of every dollar we spend this \nyear will be borrowed. We have to borrow the money we don't have. This \nwill be the largest of three consecutive deficits exceeding $1 \ntrillion.\n  President Bush was rightly condemned for his $450 billion deficit 1 \nyear--the highest he ever had. We have been over $1 trillion in the \nlast 3 years. Next year's budget deficit is expected to exceed $1 \ntrillion.\n  This money must be borrowed and interest paid. Nothing comes from \nnothing. Last year, the Nation's total interest payment was $200 \nbillion. That is how much we paid on the money we borrowed. For \nperspective, the Federal highway program--and Senator Inhofe knows \nabout this--is about $40 billion, and we spent $200 billion on the \ninterest. We would like to have spent more on highways. Federal \neducation programs cost about $70 billion. So already the interest on \nour debt is the fastest growing expense of our government, and it is \ncrowding out spending for other programs.\n  But hold your hat. Our current trajectory takes us at increasing \nspeed on a ``road,'' as the former head of the European Union said, \n``to financial hell.'' He said that about the United States.\n  According to the official score or analysis of the President's 10-\nyear budget, the total debt of America will more than double, from $13 \ntrillion to $27 trillion, over the 10-year period, and our annual \ninterest will increase from $200 billion last year to $940 billion. \nThat is how much interest we will be paying the tenth year under the \nbudget. It will cost more than education, highways, energy, and the \nState Department combined.\n  Indeed, our interest payment will surge past defense, Medicare, and \nMedicaid. That is why expert after expert, witness after witness, \nRepublicans and Democrats, say the United States is on an \n``unsustainable path.'' Yet President Obama's budget increases all \nspending every year, including discretionary spending, doubling the \ndebt of the United States again, all the while raising taxes by almost \n$2 trillion. He makes no proposals to put Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security on sound footing--nothing. It creates a debt path where \nhis lowest annual deficit in 10 years is $748 billion--that is the best \nyear--with his outyear deficits increasing, so that by the tenth year \nhis budget is scored as having a deficit of $1.2 trillion. Is that \nunsustainable or not?\n  Is it extreme to say we have to change that course, that we can't \ncontinue it? Well, let me quote a few experts--not just Jeff Sessions, \nthe Senator from Alabama. How about some people whose lives have been \nenmeshed in the debt of America? They seem to share the concerns, it \nseems to me, of the ``extremists''--the tea party people. What do the \nexperts say? How about Alan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal \nReserve? This is what he said:\n\n       I think that the type of budget agreement that was put \n     together by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles is the type of \n     budget that will be passed by Congress.\n\n  It doesn't look like that is so, unfortunately. He goes on to say:\n\n       The only question is, will it be before or after the bond \n     market crisis?\n\n  Is Alan Greenspan an extremist? He said, also, a few weeks ago that \nwe could have a debt crisis in our country in 2 to 3 years.\n  Bill Gross, who heads the world's largest bond fund at Pacific \nManagement, eliminated government-related debt from his flagship fund. \nThey no longer have any U.S. Treasury bonds. This is what he wrote \nrecently:\n\n       If the USA were a corporation, then it would probably have \n     a negative net worth of $35-$40 trillion once our ``assets'' \n     were properly accounted for. . . . No lender would lend to \n     such a corporation.\n\n  Is Bill Gross extreme?\n  Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson said:\n\n       We believe that if we do not take decisive action, our \n     Nation faces the most predictable economic crisis in its \n     history.\n\n  Mr. Bowles, before the Budget Committee, March 8, was asked how and \nwhen that might happen by Senator Conrad, our chairman. He said:\n\n       The problem is going to happen. It is a problem we are \n     going to have to face up to in maybe 2 years, maybe a little \n     less, maybe a little more.\n\n  Simpson said this:\n\n       I think it [the crisis] could come before 2 years.\n\n  Timothy Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury, when asked about the \nReinhart-Rogoff study--which said when debt reaches 90 percent of GDP, \nthe economy of a nation slows down noticeably--and I believe Rogoff and \nReinhart will be testifying before the committee tomorrow. When asked \nabout their analysis, that 90 percent--your debt equals 90 percent of \nyour gross domestic product, your economy is slowed and it pulls down; \nand we are already at 95 percent, heading to 100 percent by September \n30--Mr. Geithner said it was an excellent study. He didn't say this is \nan extreme study. He said this:\n\n       In some ways . . . it understates the risks, because it is \n     not just that countries that live with very high debt-to-GDP \n     ratios are consigned to weaker growth; they are consigned to \n     the damage that comes from periodic financial crises as well.\n\n  Is Secretary Geithner extreme? Is Admiral Mullen extreme? Senator \nConrad, our chairman, is very concerned about the trajectory we are on. \nOn March 15, at a Budget Committee hearing, this is what he said:\n\n       I believe our Nation is in peril. We are hurtling toward a \n     fiscal cliff. . . . We are clearly on an unsustainable \n     course.\n\n  Pete Domenici, who was part of the Rivlin-Domenici debt commission, \nwhich was similar to Bowles-Simpson, and was also the former chairman \nof the Budget Committee in the Senate, said this:\n\n       I have never been more worried for my country.\n\n  Are Senator Conrad and Senator Domenici extreme? I think not.\n  Only three bodies can propose spending plans. The White House budget \nhas been submitted. It would double our debt, surge our interest \nburden, increase spending at every level, and raise taxes \nsubstantially. Tomorrow we will have the House plan. It will be \nreleased by Budget Chairman Ryan. It is the most serious attempt ever \nmade to solve America's spending and debt problems while saving \ncritical programs, such as Medicare--saving those programs. They are \nbeginning to default now.\n  What does the Senate plan to do, the Democratic Senate? Doing nothing \nseems to be the plan. We have not seen a budget proposal and haven't \nhad a hearing set for the markup of a budget proposal. I doubt that the \nPresident's plan will be brought forward in its present form because it \nwould receive not many Democratic votes and, I suspect, no Republican \nvotes. I don't know.\n  The Senate has to do something. We have to propose a budget and be \nengaged in the process. We can't stick our heads in the sand. We cannot \nbe in denial. Is the President going to change? Is he going to all of a \nsudden take responsibility for the fact that we may be heading to a \nfiscal crisis that could surge unemployment, surge interest rates, and \nplace this Nation in financial risk? We have not seen it yet.\n\n  If he does not act, what will our Senate Democratic colleagues do? I \ncall on them to step up and represent their constituents, to do the \nright thing. We have to do the right thing. We cannot continue on this \ncourse.\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\n  In my view, American leaders have no higher duty, no greater moral \nresponsibility than to take all the appropriate steps to protect the \ngood people we serve from a clear and present danger--a danger that has \nbeen detailed to us with clarity and repetition by some of America's \nfinest leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let me say how refreshing it is to \nhear the Senator from Alabama, as scary as it is, to tell the truth \nabout the problem we have. When I tell people back in my State of \nOklahoma--I refresh their memories. I remember in 1996 standing at this \npodium--right here--when the Clinton budget came out for fiscal year \n1996. It was a $1.5 trillion budget. I said a $1.5 trillion budget is \nimpossible to sustain. And yet the budget the Senator from Alabama was \ntalking about was the budget of this President--and, of course, with a \nmajority in the House and the Senate--that actually has a deficit that \nis greater than the entire budgets around the entire United States of \nAmerica in 1996. That is the deficit. That is what my 20 kids and \ngrandkids are going to have to pay for.\n  When you use statements that are real and cannot be denied--and that \nis, that this President in the 2 years he has been here has increased \nthe debt more than all the Presidents before him, from George \nWashington to George W. Bush--it is not believable. That is what makes \nit so difficult because people think: How can this possibly be? And \nyet, it is. That is the reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2073-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2073-S2075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             COTE D'IVOIRE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a few minutes ago, I talked at some length \nabout a very significant amendment that is going to be coming up, and \nthat is to take jurisdiction away from the Environmental Protection \nAgency having to do with cap and trade, something they were unable to \ndo legislatively and they are going to try to do through regulations at \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. I already talked about that issue.\n  There is something that has not been mentioned on the floor of the \nSenate that I think is significant. Surprisingly enough, hardly anyone \nis even aware that it is going on. We are all concerned. We hear every \nday about the atrocities that are committed in Libya and about the \npeople who are being mowed down. What they do not realize is that is \nnot the only place that is going on.\n  I have to share, as much as I hate to do it because I am disagreeing \nwith our State Department when I say this, but I have to say it because \nsomebody has to say it. Right now, the potential of having large \nnumbers of people tortured and murdered in Cote d'Ivoire is taking \nplace. Let me set the stage so people will be aware of it.\n  I have had occasion to be in Cote d'Ivoire--some people call it the \nIvory Coast--in west Africa. It is an area where a lot of the slave \ntrade came from to this country. It is a place that has been led by a \nPresident named Laurent Gbagbo for the last 10 years. I first became \nacquainted with the country before he was President of Cote d'Ivoire. \nIn fact, his wife Simone--she is now his wife; she was not his wife at \nthat time--was a member of Parliament. I sat through what happened in \n2002 when there was a real effort primarily by one individual--his name \nis Alassane Ouattara from the northern part of Cote d'Ivoire--charging \nagainst him. It is kind of interesting because Cote d'Ivoire is one \ncountry, but in the north, they have primarily the Muslim area and in \nthe south and east primarily the Christian element. There has been a \nreal effort for quite some time for the chosen one up there, who is \nAlassane Ouattara, to defeat President Gbagbo.\n  Here is the problem. There is an election that took place a few \nmonths ago. It appeared that Ouattara actually beat the incumbent \nPresident, President Gbagbo. We were all concerned about whether this \nwas a straight election. I am going to tell you in a couple of minutes \nwhy it was not but also try to call this to the attention of the \nadministration.\n  In January after the election took place, I wrote a letter to \nSecretary Clinton, and I said: I wish to have you reevaluate--I am \ngoing to have that letter at the conclusion of my remarks printed in \nthe Record--to look at this and evaluate this as to what actually went \non in that election and how it was rigged.\n  Ouattara tried to deny involvement in a mass slaughter that took \nplace a couple days ago. That was in a town called Duekoue. Duekoue is \nin the southern part, an area that is very strongly in favor of \nPresident Gbagbo. Somewhere between 300 and 1,000 people in that \nwestern town of Duekoue were slaughtered with guns and machetes.\n  Mr. Ouattara and his people tried to deny their involvement in the \nmass slaughter, but his forces took the town days earlier and the \nGbagbo forces were not even near the town. They left a week before this \nhappened. Do not believe me, but the Guardian, which is a British \nnewspaper, reported last night--I am going to quote from the newspaper:\n\n       The U.N. mission said traditional hunters, known as Dozos, \n     fought alongside Ouattara's forces and took part in killing \n     330 people in the western town of Duekoue. The International \n     Committee of the Red Cross said at least 800 people were \n     killed in intercommunal violence in Duekoue last week.\n\n  What we do not know is that 800 plus the 330, so roughly it is 1,000.\n\n       Guillaume Ngefa, deputy head of the human rights division \n     of the UN mission in Ivory Coast, blamed 220 of the deaths on \n     the pro-Ouattara forces.\n\n  The full article goes into a lot of detail.\n  Also, a BBC reporter at Duekoue wrote in the last 24 hours:\n\n       I spot four pigs eating something dark in a charred \n     courtyard. Standing by a newly dug mass grave, a U.N. soldier \n     from Morocco is choking with rage and grief. I ask him if any \n     of the dead are children. He nods and begins to sob, quietly, \n     into his facemask.\n\n  I repeat, the massacre was not caused by the Gbagbo forces but by the \nOuattara forces who had taken over the town. President Gbagbo has \ncalled for a cease-fire repeatedly. I repeat that. He has called for a \ncease-fire but the Ouattara forces have rejected it. Why?\n  This massacre could have been avoided if Ouattara had accepted \nmediation through the African Union. On March 27, the African Union \nsent former Cape Verde Foreign Minister Jose Brito to mediate between \nOuattara and Gbagbo. Gbagbo accepted the mediation. Ouattara did not.\n  I have been following the events closely in Cote d'Ivoire since last \nfall, and after having spoken with various African dignitaries, I am \nconvinced there is a serious question as to whether Ouattara is the \nlegitimately elected President of Cote d'Ivoire.\n  I have received substantial evidence of massive voter fraud in the \nrebel-held north of Cote d'Ivoire. That is the area from which Ouattara \ncomes. I have sent the evidence to Secretary Clinton on two occasions \nspanning the last few months. One letter is where we actually have the \nevidence of the number of votes that were stolen. In one letter I \npointed out--the last letter, which I will have printed in the Record--\nthe evidence which shows that Ouattara received 94,873 votes that were \nlisted on a tally sheet for one of the five regions in the rebel-held \nnorth. Times this by four, and it comes very close to the margin of \nvotes that allegedly President Gbagbo lost. That is 400,000 votes.\n  If, indeed, a similar amount of voter fraud exists in these regions, \nGbagbo is the actual winner of the November 28 Presidential election. \nThat is too complicated. Look at it this way: In those five regions--\nthey do not call them precincts; some of the small ones they call \nprecincts, so it is a little confusing. In the first letter I sent, I \ncommented that Gbagbo, in what we would call a primary, had won \nthousands of votes in each one of those five precincts up north. \nHowever, in the primary runoff, he got zero. I suggest to you that is a \nstatistical impossibility. You cannot get zero after you had thousands \nof votes.\n  In my letter to Secretary Clinton, I called for the United States to \nsupport new elections there, but thus far those efforts have received \nan inadequate response. Based on the news Ouattara has murdered some \n1,000 people in Duekoue, I hope the United States will reconsider its \nposition and call for a new election.\n  This Wednesday, April 6, will mark the 17th anniversary of the 1994 \nRwanda genocide. I went back for the anniversary of that genocide. I \nhave been\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\nthere many times before. We know that the U.N. Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan and others knew the extent of this violence early on but did \nnothing about it. Now we know there can be another genocide occurring, \nand we do know in advance. That is why the United States is going to \nhave to call for an immediate cease-fire to prevent Ouattara and his \nrebel army from committing a mass slaughter of the Ivoirians, \nespecially the many youths with sticks and baseball bats who are \nprotecting President Gbagbo at the present time around the Presidential \npalace.\n  You have to get this mental picture: They have these young kids \nmarching around. They do not have weapons. They are carrying baseball \nbats and \n2 x 4s.\n  I have also been told in the last half hour that U.N. helicopters--\nU.N. peacekeeping helicopters--are firing on Gbagbo's military camp, \ncausing massive explosions. There could be some confusion on this \nbecause two of the articles that came out in the last half hour--one \nwas talking about the French, who are kind of behind and supporting, of \ncourse, Ouattara, that they are involved in this. The other says the \nUnited Nations. I am not sure. One of the two is.\n  Lastly, I sent Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John \nKerry--by the way, I talked with him personally about this situation. \nHe is very concerned about it. I requested he convene a hearing as soon \nas possible into the atrocities committed by forces loyal to rebel \nleader Ouattara, as well as into what I believe were flawed elections \nthat gave legitimacy to his claim of the Presidency.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the two letters \nsent to Secretary Clinton, along with the letter sent to Senator Kerry, \nand the miscalculation of the election that I honestly in my heart \nbelieve was stolen. This is the tabulation of the precincts. Add up the \nprecincts and in just one precinct, there was a mistake of over 85,000 \nvotes--just in one precinct.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: I write regarding my grave concerns \n     over the conduct of the second round of voting in the \n     presidential election held in Cote d'Ivoire last November 28, \n     2010.\n       As you know, the Independent Electoral Commission of Cote \n     d'Ivoire announced the results of their counting of ballots \n     and declared Alassane Ouattara the winner. It is my \n     understanding of the Constitution of Cote d'Ivoire, however, \n     that it is the Constitutional Council of Cote d'Ivoire and \n     not the Electoral Commission which certifies and declares the \n     winner of presidential elections. I also understand that the \n     Electoral Commission announced the final vote tallies almost \n     16 hours after its constitutionally mandated time to report \n     such results. It seems that this election was not carried out \n     in accordance with the constitution of this country.\n       A second and more troubling aspect of this second round of \n     voting is the credible allegations of massive voter fraud--\n     amounting to several hundred thousand votes--in the rebel-\n     held north of Cote d'Ivoire. I am in receipt of evidence of \n     these allegations, and I have enclosed it for your review.\n       An example of the kinds of voter fraud allegations that you \n     will find in these attached materials are the tallies of \n     precincts where, in the first round of voting, President \n     Laurent Gbagbo received several thousand votes, but in the \n     second round he received zero votes. This prima facia \n     evidence of large scale voter fraud is very troubling.\n       Although the Obama Administration has recognized Alassane \n     Ouattara as the winner of the election over President Gbagbo, \n     I ask that you investigate these credible allegations of \n     massive voter fraud and reassess whether the United States \n     should continue to recognize Alassane Ouattara as the winner. \n     Equatorial Guinean President and new African Union Chairman \n     Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has appointed a special panel \n     of five African country leaders to present recommendations to \n     the Union in a month's time on how to resolve this \n     presidential election crisis. This would be a good \n     opportunity for the U.S. to become involved in this \n     assessment and investigate these allegations. I would \n     recommend that serious thought be given to a recount of the \n     votes supervised by an internationally sanctioned \n     organization like the African Union, the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe or even the Organization \n     of American States. I would further suggest that experienced \n     U.S. electoral organizations become involved like the \n     International Republican Institute, the National Democratic \n     Institute and the International Foundation for Electoral \n     Systems. A fair and impartial recounting of the votes might \n     be one way to end this crisis peacefully.\n       I look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 2011.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: I write you again regarding my grave \n     concerns over the conduct of the second round of voting in \n     the presidential election held in Cote d'Ivoire last November \n     28, 2010. I also write to inform you that a new presidential \n     election should be held in Cote d'Ivoire. This is the only \n     way to prevent further bloodshed, stop a new civil war and \n     ensure a truly free and fair election.\n       As I stated in my letter of February 9, 2011, Cote \n     d'Ivoire's Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) announced \n     the results of their counting of presidential ballots and \n     declared Alassane Ouattara the winner. Under the Constitution \n     of Cote d'Ivoire, however, it is the Constitutional Council \n     of Cote d'Ivoire and not the Electoral Commission which \n     certifies and declares the winner of presidential elections. \n     In addition, the Electoral Commission announced the final \n     vote tallies almost 16 hours after its constitutionally \n     mandated time to report such results. This most important \n     election phase was not carried out in accordance with the \n     constitution of this country.\n       A second troubling aspect of this second round of voting is \n     the credible allegations of massive voter fraud--amounting to \n     several hundred thousand votes--in the rebel-held north of \n     Cote d'Ivoire. I received evidence of these allegations and \n     sent it to you in my earlier letter, but have yet to receive \n     a reply.\n       The evidence included tallies of precincts where, in the \n     first round of voting, President Laurent Gbagbo received \n     several thousand votes, but in the second round he received \n     zero votes. This prima facia evidence of large scale voter \n     fraud I found very troubling.\n       In the 57 days since my last letter, I have spoken with \n     numerous officials on the ground during last year's \n     presidential election. This includes African leaders I met \n     with during my trip to this region last month. I have also \n     obtained new evidence of massive voter fraud in the rebel-\n     held north. Specifically, one exhibit (enclosed) is a copy of \n     an official regional electoral return document from the \n     Electoral Commission. It shows Ouattara receiving a total \n     149,598 from five northern cities. But when the total is \n     officially reported in the amount column (``Totaux'' column), \n     Ouattara receives 244,471; a difference of 94,873 votes!\n       I have been a frequent traveler to Africa for the past 15 \n     years. I have visited Cote d'Ivoire nine times, the last \n     being June of 2010. I am probably the most knowledgeable \n     person about Africa in the U.S. Senate. From all the evidence \n     I now have gathered, I am convinced that it is mathematically \n     impossible for President Gbagbo to have lost the election by \n     several hundred thousand votes. And if a similar amount of \n     fraud exists in the other four regions of the rebel-held \n     north, Gbagbo is actually the winner of the presidential \n     election.\n       The hundreds of thousands of potential fraudulent ballots, \n     combined with the unconstitutional method in which the votes \n     were tallied and announced by the Independent Electoral \n     Commission, lead me to conclude that the election was not \n     free and fair. I also conclude that a new presidential \n     election should be held under international sanction and \n     supervision to ensure a free and fair election.\n       I am aware that my position is different from that of the \n     Obama Administration, which has recognized Alassane Ouattara \n     as the winner. I ask, however, that you change your position \n     in light of the evidence I have provided, and that you call \n     for a new election. Such a change would not be viewed as \n     inconsistent, but a wise reevaluation in light of new \n     evidence presented. It is also consistent with our American \n     dedication to the principle that democracy works best when it \n     works for all and not for some.\n       I recommend that the new election be supervised by \n     internationally sanctioned organizations like the African \n     Union or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe. I would further suggest that experienced U.S. \n     electoral organizations become involved like the \n     International Republican Institute, the National Democratic \n     Institute and the International Foundation for Electoral \n     Systems.\n       I am convinced that only though a new election will the \n     people of Cote d'Ivoire end the increasing bloodshed, stop \n     another civil war and ensure free and fair elections.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2011.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: It is now clear, based on United Nations \n     reports coming from Cote d'Ivoire that mass killings have \n     occurred in the western town of Duekoue at the hands of \n     forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara. This calls\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n     into question his legitimacy to lead that country. The \n     killing of innocent civilians must stop now before this \n     becomes another Rwanda.\n       In light of these facts, I request that you convene a \n     hearing as soon as possible into this atrocity committed by \n     forces loyal to rebel leader Ouattara, as well as into what I \n     believe were flawed elections that gave legitimacy to his \n     claim of the presidency.\n       Based on the evidence I have seen, and having spoken with \n     various African dignitaries, I brought this issue of \n     fraudulent elections in Cote d'Ivoire to the attention of \n     Secretary of State Clinton on two occasions spanning the past \n     few months. I called for the United States to support new \n     elections there, but thus far, these efforts have received an \n     inadequate response. Based on the news that Ouattara has \n     murdered 1,000 people in Duekoue, I hope the U.S. will \n     reconsider its position and that you will hold this hearing.\n       The United States must call for an immediate ceasefire to \n     prevent Ouattara and his rebel army from committing a mass \n     slaughter of Ivoirians, especially the hundreds of youth with \n     sticks and baseball bats, who have formed a human chain \n     around Gbagbo's residence and presidential palace.\n       I know your plate is full now regarding the situation in \n     Libya, but I know you are sensitive to this situation and \n     hope you will hold this hearing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M.

REYNA TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE \n                            FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to report the following nomination.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nomination of Jimmie V. Reyna, of \nMaryland, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there be will 1 hour \nof debate equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, however the \ntime is divided, the vote begin no later than 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for beginning \nanother work week by scheduling a confirmation vote on an important \njudicial nomination. The nomination of Jimmie V. Reyna to the Federal \ncircuit was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on March \n10. I expect his nomination to be confirmed with strong bipartisan \nsupport, likely unanimously.\n  That is also true of many of the other judicial nominations pending \non the Senate's Executive Calendar, including several for what have \nbeen designated judicial emergency vacancies in New York, California, \nFlorida and Tennessee. With nearly one out of every nine Federal \njudgeships vacant, we should act responsibly to address this vacancies \ncrisis by voting promptly on nominations favorably reported by the \nJudiciary Committee. After this confirmation today, the nominations of \nanother dozen judges and that of the Deputy Attorney General of the \nUnited States will remain pending and awaiting Senate consideration and \nfinal Senate action. Several of the judicial nominations and that of \nthe Deputy Attorney General have been waiting final Senate action since \nlast year.\n  At his confirmation hearing in February, Mr. Reyna was introduced to \nthe Judiciary Committee by both of his home State Senators, Senator \nMikulski and Senator Cardin of Maryland. Senator Cornyn of Texas, a \nRepublican, also joined Senator Cardin in recommending Mr. Reyna to \nPresident Obama. When he is confirmed, Mr. Reyna will become the first \nLatino to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A \npast president of the Hispanic National Bar Association, Mr. Reyna has \nexcelled in private practice for 30 years, specializing in \ninternational trade law. He was unanimously rated by the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary as well \nqualified to serve on this court, its highest possible rating.\n  The Judiciary Committee received letters of support for Mr. Reyna's \nnomination from the Customs and International Trade Bar Association, \nCITBA, and from the former Chairs of the ABA Section of International \nLaw. In its letter, CITBA described Mr. Reyna's temperament as \n``ideal'' and commented that ``[h]e is fair and focused and he has \ndedicated his life not just to practice in this field of law, but to \nscholarly writing in this field.'' The former Chairs of the ABA Section \nof International Law write that they ``believe he has the professional \ncredentials, the experience and skills, the appropriate temperament, \nand the fair and sound judgment that would enable him to serve on the \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with distinction and honor.''\n  Mr. Reyna's nomination demonstrates President Obama's commitment to \nworking with Senators to select well-qualified nominees, and his \ncommitment to increasing diversity on the Federal bench. It is \nappropriate that we are considering Mr. Reyna's nomination in a timely \nmanner. There is no reason it should take weeks and months for the \nSenate to consider nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee, \nparticularly those who are consensus nominees.\n  Mr. Renya's nomination is one of 13 judicial nominations currently \nawaiting a Senate vote after being favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Two of those nominations have twice been considered by the \nJudiciary Committee and twice reported with strong bipartisan support, \nfirst last year and again in February. They are Susan Carney of \nConnecticut to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Michael Simon to fill a \nvacancy on the District Court in Oregon. Another has been reported \nfavorably three times with bipartisan support, that of Jack McConnell \nto the District of Rhode Island. Another currently pending nomination \nhas been reported favorably four times, that of Judge Edward Chen to a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the Northern District of California. All \nof these nominations have long been ready for a Senate vote. So are \nnominations now pending to fill a judicial vacancy on the DC Circuit, a \nsecond judicial emergency vacancy in California, judicial emergency \nvacancies in New York, Tennessee, and Florida, two vacancies in \nVirginia, and a vacancy in New Jersey. I expect the Judiciary Committee \nwill consider and report additional judicial nominations this week, \nadding to the number of judicial nominations ready for final Senate \naction.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many, \nand they have persisted for too long. Nearly one out of every nine \nFederal judgeships remains vacant. Whereas the Democratic majority in \nthe Senate reduced vacancies from 110 to 60 in President Bush's first 2 \nyears, judicial vacancies still number 95 over 26 months into President \nObama's term. By now, judicial vacancies should have been cut in half, \nbut we have barely kept up with attrition.\n  Regrettably, rather than reduce vacancies dramatically as we did \nduring the Bush administration, the Senate has reversed course during \nthe Obama administration, with the slow pace of confirmations keeping \njudicial vacancies at crisis levels. Over the 8 years of the Bush \nadministration, from 2001 to 2009, we reduced judicial vacancies from \n110 to a low of 34. That has now been reversed, with vacancies first \ntopping 90 in August 2009 and staying above that level since. The \nvacancy rate which we already had reduced from 10 percent at the end of \nPresident Clinton's term to 6 percent by this date in President Bush's \nthird year, and ultimately to less than 4 percent in 2008, has now \nrisen back up to nearly 11 percent.\n  This high level of vacancies puts at serious risk the ability of all \nAmericans to have a fair hearing in court.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\nThe real price being paid for these unnecessary delays in filling \nvacancies is that the judges that remain are overburdened and the \nAmerican people who depend on them are being denied hearings and \njustice in a timely fashion.\n  A recent article in the Harrisburg, PA, Patriot News entitled \n``Senior judges ease `a very serious shortage,' '' illustrates the \nextent of this burden. The article focuses on Senior Judge Malcolm Muir \nof the Middle District of Pennsylvania who, ``[a]t age 96 . . . still \ncomes to work every day, minus the occasional holiday. Hearing problems \nkeep him out of the courtroom, but his workload hardly has decreased.'' \nJudge Muir could long since have entered his well-deserved retirement. \nBut it is good he has not because, according to the article, ``[i]n the \nMiddle District of Pennsylvania, eight of the 11 sitting judges are \nseniors,'' including one who joined the bench in 1962. This is not only \na local issue. I know courts in Michigan, Illinois, the District of \nColumbia, Arizona and elsewhere across the Nation have faced similar \nproblems. According to the Patriot News, ``nationwide, senior judges \nhandle 21 percent of the federal court's caseload.'' I ask that a copy \nof this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am grateful to the senior judges who are willing to step \nin and take large caseloads, and to the active judges who continue to \nwork hard to keep the courts functioning, but the Senate must do \nbetter. We must work together to ensure that the Federal judiciary has \nthe judges it needs to provide justice to Americans in courts \nthroughout the country. Judicial vacancies on courts throughout the \ncountry hinder the Federal judiciary's ability to fulfill its \nconstitutional role. They create a backlog of cases that prevents \npeople from having their day in court. This is unacceptable.That is why \nChief Justice Roberts, Attorney General Holder, White House Counsel Bob \nBauer and many others, including the President of the United States, \nhave spoken out and urged the Senate to act.\n  We should follow the model we are following today by considering and \nconfirming the President's nominations to the Federal bench in a timely \nmanner. President Obama has worked with Senators from both sides of the \naisle to identify superbly qualified nominees in districts with \nvacancies. All 13 of the nominations on the Executive Calendar have the \nsupport of their home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats. All \nhave a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated \nfaithfulness to the Constitution. All should have an up or down vote \nafter being considered by the Judiciary Committee, and without weeks of \nneedless delay.\n  I have thanked the Ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, for his cooperation this year. I see him taking \ncredit for what he calls ``our rapid pace.'' I am glad to see him echo \nmy call to turn the page and end the days of tit for tat on judicial \nnominations. That is what I did from the first days of the Bush \nadministration in spite of how President Clinton's nominees had been \ntreated. I hope he will work with me so that we can continue not only \nto report nominations, but to vote on them in the Senate.\n  We have a long way to go to do as well as we did during President \nBush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial nominations, \nbringing the vacancy rate down from 10 percent to just over 4 percent. \nWe confirmed 100 of those judicial nominations during the 17 months I \nwas chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. So far, \nwell into President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only \nbeen allowed to consider 75 of President Obama's Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees. We remain well short of the benchmarks we set \nduring the Bush administration.\n  I hope that it is a sign of progress that we are today proceeding to \nconfirm a judicial nominee considered and reported last month and hope \nthat we can continue to work to restore regular order in considering \njudicial nominations. I would hope that we could clear the calendar of \nnominees before the next recess and that at a minimum the Senate \nproceed to confirm those who will be confirmed unanimously. If we join \ntogether we can make real progress by considering all of the judicial \nnominations now on the Senate's Executive Calendar.\n  I congratulate Jimmie Renya and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n                   [From Pennlive.com, Mar. 23, 2011]\n\n              Senior Judges Ease `a Very Serious Shortage'\n\n                            (By Matt Miller)\n\n       Judge Malcolm Muir leads a group of new U.S. citizens in \n     the oath of allegiance during a naturalization ceremony at \n     the U.S. Courthouse and Federal Office Building in \n     Williamsport, Pa.\n       At age 96, long after his contemporaries have retired, U.S. \n     Middle District Senior Judge Malcolm Muir still comes to work \n     every day, minus the occasional holiday.\n       Hearing problems keep him out of the courtroom, but his \n     workload hardly has decreased.\n       Muir is inundated with Social Security appeals. He handles \n     most of those types of cases for the entire district, which \n     spans Pennsylvania's core.\n       ``Some of those files are large,'' Muir said. ``I just got \n     one last week that was 7 inches thick.''\n       It is likely that without Muir and other senior judges, the \n     federal court system would implode.\n       Those jurists have agreed to keep presiding with no extra \n     pay long after they could have stepped comfortably into \n     retirement.\n       Nationwide, senior judges handle 21 percent of the federal \n     court's caseload. In the Middle District of Pennsylvania, \n     eight of the 11 sitting judges are seniors. The longest-\n     serving senior judge in the district, William J. Nealon, \n     joined the bench in 1962.\n       Muir is the nation's fourth-oldest serving federal senior \n     judge.\n       Senior judges are particularly vital given that more than \n     90 federal judgeships across the nation--10 percent of \n     regular full-time posts--remain unfilled, often because of \n     political wrangling in Washington, D.C.\n       Judicial appointments are recommended by the president but \n     require congressional sanction.\n       In the Middle District, which serves 33 of the state's 67 \n     counties, there are three regular judge vacancies. President \n     Barack Obama has made a recommendation to fill only one of \n     them, with Scranton labor lawyer Robert David Mariani.\n       Senior Judge Richard P. Conaboy, who like Muir helps keep \n     the Middle District running, said he checked on the status of \n     Mariani's appointment recently and was told ``there is no \n     movement at all.''\n       ``It's frustrating,'' the 86-year-old Conaboy said. ``The \n     cases keep piling up. We have much more civil rights, \n     employment discrimination and immigration lawsuits.''\n       There is no question that the court is busier than when he \n     was appointed to the bench during the Carter administration \n     in 1979, he said.\n       He also noted there were no senior judges then.\n       Yvette Kane, chief judge of the Middle District, said ``the \n     wheels would stop turning'' for her court if the senior \n     judges abandoned their essentially volunteer service.\n       The district, which logs 2,500 new case filings each year, \n     is experiencing ``a very serious judicial shortage'' and \n     needs to have its three judicial vacancies filled, Kane said.\n       She said she is requesting that a seventh judgeship be \n     added to the court's roster. The 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals \n     has approved the proposal, Kane said, and if backed by the \n     U.S. Judicial Conference this year, it would go to Congress.\n       ``This district is already underserved'' in terms of \n     judges, she said, noting that her court ranks 12th in the \n     nation among federal courts in terms of trial activity.\n       The three regular judge vacancies on her court arose when \n     Judges James Munley and A. Richard Caputo in the Scranton \n     division took senior status in January and March 2009, \n     respectively, and Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie was elevated to \n     the 3rd Circuit Court last April.\n       Larry Smar, deputy chief of staff for U.S. Sen. Robert P. \n     Casey Jr., D-Pa., said his boss and former Sen. Arlen Specter \n     submitted three names of judicial candidates for the state's \n     Middle and Western District courts to the president last \n     year.\n       Smar said Casey and Specter's successor, Sen. Pat Toomey, \n     is ``currently working on establishing a process moving \n     forward'' to fill the remaining court vacancies.\n       Kane said her court received a major blow in December with \n     the death of 79-year-old Senior Judge James F. McClure Jr., \n     one of the district's younger senior judges.\n       ``He was a workhorse,'' she said.\n       Without McClure, Kane said, the court's regular judges have \n     had to travel more often among the district's offices to \n     cover the caseload.\n       Despite their obvious value, McClure's loss highlights the \n     tenuous nature of the reliance on senior judges, she said.\n       ``No one knows how long they're going to be able to do \n     this,'' Kane said.\n       Being short-staffed on regular judges has its effects, \n     especially because the senior judges often ``are not able to \n     travel or manage trial dockets as they once did, and should \n     not be expected to do so,'' she said.\n       ``Although we're going to get the work done, it's not ideal \n     for the litigants,'' Kane said. ``It results in delays.''\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\n       Three midstate attorneys who practice regularly in federal \n     court--John Abom, Dennis Boyle and Karl Rominger--said they \n     haven't experienced delays in the handling of cases.\n       ``Decisions are rendered in a quick period of time,'' said \n     Abom, who has appeared before federal judges since 1999.\n       Rominger said the experience of the seniors brings value. \n     ``The senior judges are the court's institutional memory,'' \n     he said.\n       Some might wonder why senior judges stay on when they could \n     retire and escape their often crushing caseloads.\n       They are paid $174,000 annually for the rest of their lives \n     regardless of whether they stay or go, so senior judges make \n     no extra money by continuing to work.\n       Conaboy said the need to fill the Middle District judge \n     vacancies is desperate.\n       ``It is a crisis here in our district,'' he said, noting \n     that senior judges do at least 80 percent of the work in the \n     Middle District's northern zone, which is centered on \n     Scranton.\n       Yet Conaboy said he wouldn't walk away even if all the \n     judge vacancies were filled.\n       ``I work every day. I'm not complaining because I've always \n     had an interest in the workings of the justice system,'' he \n     said. ``I want to see that the system works properly.''\n       That's one of his motivations for continuing to weigh \n     cases. The other, he said, is that ``there's no one else to \n     do the work.''\n       Still, senior judges are not a limitless resource, Conaboy \n     said.\n       ``When you're 86, how long can you go on?'' he asked. \n     ``We'd like to lighten our workloads. Trial work gets to be a \n     much greater burden as you get older.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see the distinguished Senator from Tennessee.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n               Remembering Former Governor Ned McWherter\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is my sad responsibility to announce \nthat former Gov. Ned McWherter of Tennessee has died this afternoon. \nNed had many friends here in Washington, but he had a lot more in \nTennessee.\n  What symbolized Ned McWherter to me was a story that occurred to me \nwhen I was elected Governor in 1978. I was a young Republican, about 37 \nyears old. There hadn't been many Republican Governors in Tennessee at \nthat time. The whole State was one party. It was very Democratic. Ned \nMcWherter was the speaker of the House. For those who knew Ned \nMcWherter, he was a big, burly, Hoss Cartwright sort of fellow. He and \nthe Lieutenant Governor, a Democrat, pretty well ran the capital.\n  Shortly after I came in, the Capitol Hill media came up to speaker \nNed McWherter and said: Well, Mr. Speaker, what are you going to do \nwith this new young Republican Governor?\n  Speaker McWherter said: I am going to help him, because if he \nsucceeds, our State succeeds.\n  For 8 years, as he was speaker and I was Governor, he did that. The \npeople of Tennessee apparently didn't mind it because after I left, \nthey elected him Governor. He served for 8 years. That sort of \nbipartisan cooperation was the way I learned about politics in \nTennessee. Ned was a pretty thoroughgoing Democrat. He was one of \nPresident Clinton's closest friends and early allies. Democrats all \naround the country came to him for his homespun advice. He had no \nproblem working hard during election time to put legislators who were \nDemocratic in place of Republicans who were already in their seats. \nThat was not a problem for him. But in between elections, he knew what \nto do. We would meet in the Governor's office every Tuesday morning, \nand we would go over the issues, the Republican Governor and the \nDemocratic leaders. Then we would decide what to do. If I came up with \na better schools program, the Democrats would come up with an even \nbetter ``better schools'' program. So when Tennessee became the first \nState to pay teachers more for teaching well on a Statewide basis in \n1984, I made the proposal, but it was the result of a bipartisan \neducation commission that Speaker McWherter and Lieutenant Governor \nWilder, both Democrats, and I jointly agreed on. When the legislature \nagreed to it, I may have proposed it as Governor, but it was amended by \nthe Weakley County amendment, which was the home county of Speaker \nMcWherter. In other words, it was his willingness to fashion a \nconsensus bill on a revolutionary idea at the time, to reward \noutstanding teachers by paying them more for teaching well.\n  He did the same thing with highways and roads. Tennessee had one of \nthe worst road systems in the country in the early 1980s. By the time \nwe were finished, we had what the truckers called the best. We had \nthree big road programs. We increased revenues to pay for it so we \ndidn't run up any debt. In every case, Speaker McWherter supported and \nmade sure legislation passed.\n  When we became a State that attracted Japanese industry, he knew the \ncommitments I made as a Republican Governor he would fulfill as a \nDemocratic leader of the House of Representatives and that he would \ncontinue as a Democratic Governor. It was a seamless transition. The \nsame was true with the automobile industry when it had begun to come to \nTennessee. People began to look around for a central location with a \nright-to-work law and good working people. Through a succession of \nGovernors--Republican, Democratic, Republican, Democratic--we worked \ntogether to do that.\n  Of special interest to Washington, DC, right now, through all those \nDemocratic and Republican Governors, we agreed our State would have \nalmost no debt. Under Governor McWherter and Speaker McWherter, our \nState had almost no debt. If we needed something, we paid for it. As a \nresult, we have low taxes.\n  Ned McWherter was one of the finest public servants I ever had a \nchance to work with. He became a close friend. He had an infectious \npersonality and great sense of humor. One of the last visits I had with \nhim included the inauguration of the new Governor, Bill Haslam. Ned \nMcWherter, who was 80 years old, and Jim Haslam, father of the new \nGovernor, were the same age and the best of friends. Their sons \ncompeted for the right to be the new Governor of Tennessee. Governor \nMcWherter and Jim Haslam, after the election, were the best of friends. \nThat is the kind of person Ned McWherter was.\n  There are a lot of people in our State who come in and out of \npolitics. Maybe they are appreciated, maybe they are not. Only a few \nleave a lasting impression. Ned McWherter will be among the very few \nwho leave the most impression. Part of it was his big, burly, \ninfectious, lovable personality. Part of it was his good sense of \npolitics and openness around the State capital. But a lot of it was his \nwillingness to say to people such as a new young Governor of the \nopposite party: I am going to help you succeed, because if you succeed, \nour State succeeds.\n  Governor McWherter and I talked many times. I talked with him most \nrecently about 1 week ago. He was going to see his doctor again to find \nout whether, as he said, he had a short fuse or a long fuse. \nApparently, he had a short fuse. He didn't have much life left in him, \nalthough he may not have known it. Perhaps he did. He used to joke and \nsay the size of the crowd at your funeral will depend a lot on the \nweather. I think all of us in Tennessee would say the size of the crowd \nat Ned McWherter's funeral will have nothing to do with the weather, \nbecause I imagine it will be standing room only, with people pouring \nout of the back doors.\n  We are sad he is gone. But it has been 80 remarkable years. The \nGovernor who never graduated from college is the Governor who had the \ncourage to put into State law the Sanders model for relating student \nachievement to teacher performance, helping our State win this \nadministration's Race to the Top Award some 15 or 20 years later. He \nmade a real contribution to our State. He has a big place in all our \nhearts. I am sad to report he is gone. But it is an important time to \ncelebrate the life of a public servant whose lessons of how to achieve \nconsensus and still be a good politician will be a good lesson for \neveryone in Washington, DC.\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided between the parties.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We continue to hold hearings every 2 weeks to examine \nthe nominees' records and to receive testimony. The committee meets \nevery week to report nominees to the floor. So far, the committee has \nreported 27 nominees, which is ahead of the 23 reported by this same \ntime in the 108th Congress.\n  This demonstrates my commitment and the commitment of Republicans on \nthe Judiciary Committee to cooperate with the chairman to move forward \non consensus nominees. Even as we do so, we continue to thoroughly \nexamine the records and the qualifications of all nominees, which is \nthe responsibility of the Senate.\n  I would note that a number of judicial nominations and at least one \nexecutive branch nomination which remain on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar are controversial in nature--in other words, not the consensus \napproach which I have spoken about concerning other nominees to the \njudiciary. I appreciate the efforts of our leadership to move in a \ntimely manner the nominations which are consensus nominees.\n  Today, we will vote on the nomination of Jimmie V. Reyna to be a U.S. \ncircuit judge for the Federal Circuit. Mr. Reyna received his B.A. from \nthe University of Rochester and his juris doctorate from the University \nof New Mexico School of Law.\n  After graduating from law school, the nominee served as law clerk for \na firm and as an associate at an insurance defense firm in New Mexico. \nIt was in 1981 that Mr. Reyna formed his own firm and practiced \nplaintiff injury, civil rights, and criminal law. He then moved to the \nWashington, DC, area in 1986 and worked at an international trade firm, \neventually making partner of that law firm. Mr. Reyna continues to \nspecialize in international trade matters with the firm of Williams \nMullen, where he directs the international trade and customs practice \ngroup and the Latin American Task Force.\n  The American Bar Association has rated this nominee unanimously \n``well qualified,'' and of course I am pleased to support that \nnomination.\n  The Federal Circuit is unique among the courts of appeal. It is not \ngeographical-based but has nationwide subject matter jurisdiction in \ndesignated areas of the law. In addition to international trade, the \ncourt hears cases on patents, trademarks, government contracts, certain \nmoney claims against the U.S. Government, veterans' benefits, and \npublic safety officers' benefits claims.\n  Of particular interest to me, this court has exclusive jurisdiction \nover cases related to Federal personnel matters. That includes \nexclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard, which hears whistleblower cases under the Whistleblower \nProtection Act. If anybody wonders why this Senator said that I have a \nparticular interest in this court and what it does on Federal personnel \nmatters, it is because I have been a longtime advocate for \nwhistleblower protection legislation and have been involved with my \ncolleagues in this body in passing some of that whistleblower \nprotection legislation.\n  I congratulate Mr. Reyna and his family on this important lifetime \nappointment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJimmie Reyna to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit. I had recommended that Mr. Reyna be \nnominated.\n  Mr. Reyna comes to the Senate with 23 years of experience in \ninternational trade law. Mr. Reyna currently is a partner in the \nWashington, DC, office of Williams Mullen. Mr. Reyna directs the firm's \nTrade and Customs Practice Group, as well as the firm's Latin America \nTask Force, and has also served for several years on his firm's board \nof directors, where he currently serves as vice president.\n  In his practice, Mr. Reyna handles matters before the various federal \nagencies, and represents clients before the Court of International \nTrade, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and foreign \ngovernmental, administrative, and judicial bodies. He also serves on \nthe roster of dispute settlement panelists for trade disputes under the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization \nDispute Settlement Mechanism.\n  Mr. Reyna has also authored several articles and two books on \ninternational trade issues, and his third book on the subject is due to \nbe published this spring. His experience in trade law would bring \nimportant expertise to the Federal circuit, a unique court with \nnationwide jurisdiction that deals with many trade law issues and yet \ncurrently lacks a trade specialist.\n  Mr. Reyna was admitted to the New Mexico Bar in 1979 and the District \nof Columbia bar in 1994. He received his J.D. from University of New \nMexico School of Law and his BA from University of Rochester. The \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nevaluated Mr. Reyna's nomination and rated him unanimously well \nqualified, the highest possible rating.\n  Mr. Reyna's personal history is compelling. Born in New Mexico to a \nmodest family, his missionary parents instilled in him a belief that \nall people are equal, a principle he has exemplified in his work to \nensure that all people are treated fairly in our legal system. After \nlaw school, he worked as a litigator at a firm in Albuquerque and later \nestablished his own practice dealing with domestic relations, civil \nrights, tort, and criminal defense matters. In his practice, he often \nrepresented clients pro bono, devoting a large portion of his time to \nproviding advice and representing individuals who could not afford \nlegal assistance.\n  A few years later, Mr. Reyna moved with his family to the Washington, \nDC metro area, where he built his well-regarded career in international \ntrade.\n  Mr. Reyna has continually proven that he is an outstanding and civic-\nminded person. Mr. Reyna is a well-known national leader in U.S. \nHispanic affairs. He has held various leadership positions in the \nHispanic National Bar Association, HNBA, including national president, \nvice president of regional affairs, regional president, and chair of \nthe International Law Committee. During his term as national president \nof HNBA, Mr. Reyna launched the association's first-ever community \noutreach program called ``The Promise in the Law,'' which was designed \nto instill trust and confidence in the U.S. legal system by the \nHispanic communities. Mr. Reyna also created ``The HNBA Journal of Law \nand Policy,'' the HNBA's first law journal, which addresses policy and \nlegal issues affecting the Hispanic community. Currently, he serves on \nthe board of directors of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, an \norganization that includes the country's 29 largest leading Hispanic \norganizations.\n  Mr. Reyna is also a founder and a member of the board of directors of \nthe U.S.-Mexico Law Institute. He has received multiple awards for his \nservice to the Hispanic community, including the 2009 Ohtli Medal \nAward, Mexico's highest award for a non-Mexican citizen. Through his \nwork, Mr. Reyna has strived to ensure that members of disadvantaged \ncommunities are informed about the law, that the legal community is \nprepared to handle the legal challenges facing the growing Latino \ncommunity, and that the judiciary remains strongly independent, \nimpartial, and accessible to all.\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\n  Mr. Reyna's civil service is not limited to his work for the Hispanic \ncommunity. He has been recognized by the Court of International Trade \nfor his extensive pro bono work before that court. He also serves on \nthe board of directors of the Community Services for Autistic Adults \nand Children Foundation.\n  Mr. Reyna's nomination would also bring much-needed diversity to the \nFederal circuit. Throughout his career, Mr. Reyna has shown a strong \ncommitment to diversity and racial equality, not only through his \nservice to the Hispanic community, but also through his service on the \nABA Presidential Commission on Diversity in the Legal Profession, and \nas chair of the Williams Mullen Diversity Committee. If Mr. Reyna is \nconfirmed, he would be the first Latino to serve on the Federal circuit \nin its history. With the nomination of Mr. Reyna, the Senate has \nanother opportunity to further increase the diversity of the Federal \nbench.\n  Because of his vast qualifications, Mr. Reyna's nomination has \nreceived support from various organizations and individuals, including \nthe HNBA and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Additionally, seven \nformer chairs of the American Bar Association Section on International \nLaw wrote a letter of endorsement for Mr. Reyna, affirming that Mr. \nReyna has ``the professional credentials, the experience and skills, \nthe appropriate temperament, and the fair and sound judgment'' to serve \non the Federal circuit.\n  And, last but certainly not least, Mr. Reyna is a resident of Silver \nSpring, MD, and a constituent of mine.\n  In conclusion I urge the Senate to confirm Mr. Reyna's nomination to \nbe a U.S. circuit judge for court of appeals for the Federal circuit.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Mr. President, I regret that a commitment in \nMinnesota has prevented me from being able to cast my vote in support \nof Mr. Jimmie V. Reyna's confirmation to be a judge on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit. I believe that Mr. Reyna has the \nstellar qualifications, intellectual capability, temperament and \nintegrity that are the hallmarks of our finest federal judges. Had I \nbeen present this evening, I would have cast my vote in support of Mr. \nReyna.\n  I had the pleasure of being introduced to Mr. Reyna last year by \nPeter Reyes, a constituent of mine who is an intellectual property \nlawyer and a leader in the Minnesota Hispanic Bar Association. Upon \nmeeting Mr. Reyna, it was easy to see what the American Bar Association \nlater confirmed when it unanimously gave him the highest possible \nrating for a judicial nominee: he is well qualified. I know that Mr. \nReyna's three decades of experience in private practice focusing on \ninternational trade issues will serve him well given the Federal \ncircuit's unique jurisdiction. I congratulate Mr. Reyna on his \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2079-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the rallies \nthat have occurred all over this country today, and to add my voice to \ntheirs. Today, Americans in all 50 States are gathering at hundreds of \nrallies and events to stand together in unity in defense of the \ncollective bargaining rights of public employees--rights I believe are \nnow under attack in Wisconsin, Ohio, and in other States across this \ncountry.\n  That those demonstrations have been held today is no mere \ncoincidence, for on this very day, 43 years ago, the Reverend Dr. \nMartin Luther King was killed in Memphis, TN, while standing up for the \nrights of 1,300 public sanitation workers.\n  Working men and women gathered early today in Wilmington to declare \n``We Are One,'' and within the hour of this speech, thousands more will \ngather in Madison, WI, to protest what in my view is the scandalous \nmove of Governor Walker to strip Wisconsin's longstanding collective \nbargaining rights from public-sector employees.\n  Before coming to this body, I served as the county executive of New \nCastle County, DE, for 6 years. And before becoming Governor of \nWisconsin, Governor Scott Walker was also the county executive of \nMilwaukee County for 8 years. I understand the difficult choices \nexecutives face when they must adopt a balanced budget, even in the \ntoughest of economic and fiscal times, for as county executive I too \nfaced extremely difficult budget challenges, as did the Presiding \nOfficer as the Governor of West Virginia.\n  But I rise today because I know from my experience in cutting \nspending and in balancing budgets that it can be done without stripping \nAmerican workers of their fundamental rights to organize and to \ncollectively bargain. I know it because I have done it through \ncollective bargaining and without resorting to blaming and draconian \nanti-union legislation.\n  New Castle County, DE, is a mid-sized county government serving just \nover \\1/2\\ million people and has a budget of about $230 million. As \nthe county executive, I confronted a real and growing budget problem. \nOur housing boom\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\nhad masked deepening spending deficits that were unsustainable even \nbefore the economic collapse in 2008. As our national and local \neconomies tumbled, our government's revenue did as well. I had already \nspent my first few years as county executive cutting spending each and \nevery year in simple cuts, and we had only fundamental cuts in front of \nus.\n  We had reduced library hours, ended popular public events, and made \nmany difficult choices that many local governments and many State \ngovernments face today. But that wasn't enough. As with many State and \nlocal governments, our budget was three-quarters personnel costs, and \nwe could not allow those costs to continue to grow as health care and \npension costs boomed. We needed to cut our people cost to get our \nbudget under control.\n  Now, in the case of the county I formerly served, more than 80 \npercent of the county workforce is represented by organized labor, \nmostly AFSCME, but also the FOP and IBEW as well--and we needed all \ngroups to come together and share the sacrifice that lay ahead.\n  It was just 2 years ago last week that I rose before our county \ncouncil and delivered the hardest budget address I had ever given, one \nin which I laid out that we had two paths forward; one path would \ninvolve having all the suffering focused on about 150 to 200 public \nemployees who would have to be laid off to balance our budget, and the \nother was sharing that sacrifice across our entire mostly unionized \nworkforce.\n  Ultimately, after many meetings, many negotiations, some very hard \ntalk and debate--and yes, even at one point some layoffs--every \nbargaining unit in our county government came to the table, worked \ncollaboratively, and helped us reach the goal of cutting 5 percent of \nour total personnel costs not just 1 year but, as the recession \ncontinued and deepened, a second year as well. Many of these great and \ndedicated public employees saw health care costs shift and benefit \npackages change as well. But together they were willing to share that \nsacrifice, to work in the best interests of our county and the public, \nand to acknowledge that we are one.\n  In some ways, seeking a legislative solution such as has been done in \nWisconsin, trying to simply strip away the right to be organized, to be \nat the bargaining table, might have seemed easier. Working together, as \nyou know, as labor and management is not an easy path. No one wants to \nhear they have to do more with less, especially when it comes to their \nown paychecks. And public employees--in Delaware and all across this \ncountry--are, in my view, not just the backbone of our community but \nthe backbone of our middle class. They are the policemen, the \nparamedics, the 911 call-takers, the emergency sewer repairmen, the \nlibrarians, the teachers, the health service workers, and the prison \nguards--the folks who keep our communities safe, healthy, and prepared \nfor the future day in and day out.\n  In my view, where public employees come together to organize and seek \ncollective representation on workplace issues, we ought to respect \nthose choices. Collective bargaining serves as a critical check on our \nsystem and its long and storied history is an important part of \nAmerican history and American values. It is that check that led to the \nend of child labor practices, that led to the 40-hour workweek and the \nweekend, to workplace safety rules, and ended legal sweatshops. It is a \ncritical check against excesses and overreach by management and by the \nmarketplace.\n  I stand here today to remind all of us that labor unions and the \nhundreds of thousands of public employees they represent in this \ncountry are not the enemy. We all know this country faces a \nsignificant, almost devastating national debt and annual budget \ndeficit, and we are going to have to make shared sacrifices and tough \nchoices to get through these next few years. But that does not require \nwe strip the collective bargaining rights of the hundreds of thousands \nof public employees who serve us in the Federal Government, and the \nhundreds of thousands, even millions of public employees who serve our \nNation at each and every level of government.\n  More often than not, these are the employees who do the difficult, \nthe dirty and the dangerous jobs that keep us safe and make our \ncommunities strong. They simply, in my view, do not deserve to be \ndemonized but, rather, to be listened to, respected, and partnered \nwith, as together we seek solutions to the challenges facing our \ncountry now and in the future. In my view, passing new laws to \neliminate their basic collective bargaining rights is wrong, and we can \ndo it better by working together.\n  So today, I join with all those who are standing up for these \nfundamental rights of the American worker and join them in declaring \n``We Are One.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion.\n  Mr. COONS. Yes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I came to the floor for the same \nreason Senator Coons did. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nDelaware in the beginning of his first term in office. He obviously \nunderstands the importance of worker rights and the importance of \ncollective bargaining.\n  In my State, collective bargaining passed 30 years ago. Because of \nthat, we no longer see the ``blue flu,'' where a police officer calls \nin sick. Because there was no ability to organize and bargain \ncollectively, they would call in sick the same day. They had no other \nway of expressing themselves. We have seen significant labor peace, \nwhen we didn't always have labor peace on a lot of these issues prior \nto the early 1980s in my State, where we now have collective \nbargaining.\n  My colleagues who have followed the news--I think people are very \naware of this in my State--know that Governor Kasich recently signed \nlegislation to take away those bargaining rights. That is why I have \ncome to the floor today, in part, to celebrate We Are One, an \norganization that represents people of faith, people who belong to \ntrade unions, people who care about economic justice, people who \nsupport strong community local services--the police, the firefighters, \nnurses, teachers--and who have come together to honor Dr. King.\n  As Senator Coons mentioned, Dr. King was assassinated 43 years ago \ntoday because he was standing with workers in Memphis, TN--sanitation \nworkers. Some of those workers had been crushed to death on the job by \nheavy machinery and had no ability to bargain collectively, no ability \nto fight for themselves. Most of them African American, most had no \nreal rights to job safety, decent wages, or benefits. Dr. King \nunderstood that worker rights is a human rights issue, and that is why \nhe stood up.\n  The debate in statehouses across America--Wisconsin, Ohio, and in \nother places--is about collective bargaining, but it is really about \nrights, opportunities, and the future of the middle class. The American \nmiddle class, as Senator Coons pointed out, didn't happen by chance. \nThose aspiring to the middle class had to work hard and play by the \nrules in order to enter it. The middle class was created after people \nworked together to demand a minimum wage, safe workplaces, pensions, \nSocial Security, and basic fairness. The middle class, in many ways in \nthis country, was a direct outgrowth of the passage in this body some \n70-plus years ago of collective bargaining--the right of both private-\nsector workers, then later public-sector workers, to organize and \nbargain collectively,\n  Last fall we heard many of the Republican winners of elections in my \nState, and I think across the country, talk about the loss of jobs--the \njob loss that began during the Bush administration. When President \nObama took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. We are now \nbeginning to gain jobs, and have done that the last 12 or 13 months, \nespecially in manufacturing. We know manufacturing jobs create a middle \nclass. But after winning these elections last fall in my State, instead \nof focusing on jobs, as they did during the election, too many \npoliticians are governing by ideology and seeking to settle old scores. \nAt a time when the middle class is struggling more than at any time in \nmy lifetime, when workers are seeing their productivity going up and up \nand up but seeing their wages flatten or even seeing their hours cut \nback, American\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\nfamilies are burdened by new attacks on their rights.\n  About a month and a half ago, at a roundtable held in an Episcopal \nchurch on the statehouse square in Columbus, I was listening to nurses, \nteachers, police officers, and other public employees. I had heard from \nconservative politicians who wanted to cut off collective bargaining \nrights, to take those rights away, and those people making accusations \nthat these firefighters and police officers and teachers were lazy, \noverpaid, had too much time off, had pensions that were too big, had \nhealth care benefits that were too generous. But as I was hearing all \nthat from critics, I was listening one on one to these public \nemployees.\n  A young teacher, who had been teaching only about 10 years, told me \nthat when she goes to the bargaining table, she doesn't just talk about \nwages and benefits but that she is negotiating for smaller class sizes \nas well. A police officer I talked to wasn't just talking about \npensions and pay, he was negotiating for a bulletproof vest for him and \nhis men and women colleagues who were also police officers.\n  So these negotiations are not just for more money, more public \ndollars spent on behalf of these police, firefighters, teachers, and \nnurses; they are also about helping society, improving society, \nexpanding on the middle class.\n  It is clear those attacking collective bargaining are more interested \nin taking rights away than creating jobs. It is clear in Ohio. The bill \nthat passed the House of Representatives would give Ohio the most \nrestrictive voter regulation laws in the Nation that they would seek to \nlimit our basic freedoms--restrict worker rights, restrict the right to \nvote, cut back on women's rights. Perhaps I am missing something, but \nhow does that have anything to do with creating jobs and strengthening \nour economy?\n  Let me, for a couple of moments, put a human face on all of this.\n  I have a friend who is a firefighter named George, in Willoughby, OH. \nHe wrote me this letter right after the Governor signed this \nlegislation taking away his rights, taking away bargaining rights for a \nhuge number of police officers and firefighters and teachers and health \ncare workers and nurses and others. He said:\n\n       I joined my proud profession knowing I would never be rich. \n     I truly joined knowing I would be helping people. I joined \n     knowing I would be able to raise a family. I joined knowing I \n     would have a pension in the end.\n       As a 21-year-old kid entering this profession, I weighed \n     heavily on the ``helping people'' and the pure excitement of \n     the job. Now, as a 41-year-old firefighter who has been \n     beaten down both physically and emotionally, I will admit my \n     pension now plays a role, is my driving force to go to work \n     every day.\n       I have always been the firefighter who the bosses look to \n     when a task needs doing.\n       I will soon be a 42-year-old firefighter in my 21st year of \n     service. I am virtually 6.5 years from being able to retire. \n     This job has torn up my knees, requiring surgery to one of \n     them.\n       This job has injured my back on several occasions, twice \n     requiring extensive time off to rehab. I am doing everything \n     possible to avoid surgery.\n       This job has caused memories that will stick with me for \n     the rest of my life, the kind of memories that make you go \n     home and hug your wife and kids and thank God that they are \n     safe.\n       I mention all this because, as you know, we as public \n     servants are being attacked in Ohio. We are being attacked in \n     our profession as well as our retirement. Our fundamental \n     rights and the foundation of our profession are being \n     attacked. Collective bargaining is the only way we have been \n     able to improve safety as well as maintain a quality of life \n     for our families. This system protects both the taxpayer and \n     the public servant from leaders on both sides who choose to \n     rule with an iron fist.\n       I am now one of our beat-up senior firefighters who is \n     rapidly approaching retirement age. Where do threats of \n     pension changes leave me or the many others like me if I am \n     unable to finish my years of service due to injury? Where do \n     those threats of pension changes leave me if my employer \n     decides it is ``fiscally responsible'' to lay off higher-paid \n     beat-up senior firefighters to keep lower-paid younger \n     fighters?\n\n  I will get back to the letter in a second, but my understanding is, \nunder the legislation that Governor Kasich signed, management, then, \nwould be able to say: This firefighter is more likely to get hurt. He \nis older and gets paid more, so we will lay off five of them in their \nforties and keep the younger ones. It is just too bad they are not \ngoing to have enough years to retire.\n  That is what taking away collective bargaining rights, that is what \nbusting the union for these firefighters or police officers or teachers \nor nurses can do.\n  Back to the letter:\n\n       In Willoughby, due to economic conditions, we have not \n     replaced firefighters who have died or retired. In 1990 we \n     ran 2,100 incidents per year. In 2010 we ran just under 5,000 \n     incidents.\n\n  In 20 years it went from 2,100 runs to 5,000 runs.\n\n       I am sure we are not the only city that continues to \n     operate understaffed with higher volumes.\n       I consider myself a moderate when it comes to politics. I \n     have always voted for those who support me as a public \n     servant. That is what true public servants do.\n\n  That was George, a firefighter in Lake County, OH, in Willoughby, \njust east of Cleveland.\n  Again, this is not just about collective bargaining. It is what we \nwant our country to be. Dr. King, whom we honor, who was assassinated \n43 years ago today--Dr. King delivered the 1965 commencement address at \nAntioch College, in Yellow Springs, OH, where Coretta Scott attended \nmany years before. On the moral question of confronting poverty, Dr. \nKing said:\n\n       There is no deficit in human resources. The deficit is in \n     human will.\n\n  Yes, we all care about budget deficits. We know we need to move \ntoward a balanced budget. We know our first focus needs to be creating \njobs. We want to invest smartly and cut wisely, but we also care about \nthe education deficit. We care about the infrastructure deficit. We \ncare about disparities in education and health care based on class and \nrace and gender. We care about the lack of economic mobility for \nmillions of Americans in underserved urban areas and underserved rural \nAppalachian areas, like much of the Presiding Officer's State which \nborders an underserved rural area in my State. We care about these \ndeficits in our Nation. But what is greater is our deficit in the lack \nof will to close them.\n  The question becomes, then, Do we have the will to do what is right? \nDo we have the will to fight back in Ohio when the Governor and \nlegislature have eliminated collective bargaining, now effective in 90 \ndays? Do we have the will to fight for the middle class? Do we have the \nwill to strengthen our country as we cut the budget to move toward a \nbalanced budget but not cut what matters for a productive, strong \nmiddle class, for middle-class Americans, and for all those people in \nOhio and West Virginia and around this country who aspire to join the \nmiddle class?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2081-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2081-S2082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ROCKCASTLE HIGH SCHOOL LADY ROCKETS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the remarkable \naccomplishments of one of Kentucky's most impressive athletic teams, \nthe Rockcastle High School Lady Rockets basketball team. This March 12, \nthe Lady Rockets triumphed over the DuPont Manual Lady Crimsons in \novertime, 62 to 60, to win the school's first Kentucky High School \nAthletic Association Sweet 16 girls basketball championship.\n  It has been an unforgettable season for the Lady Rockets, who \nfinished the year 36-1, on a 27-game winning streak, and undefeated by \nany fellow Kentucky team. They entered the final tournament game \nknowing they faced an experienced and competitive opponent, but that \ntheir raw talent and determination would show the people of the \nBluegrass State that they had something to prove. Well, prove something \nthey did: After clawing their way back from a nine-point deficit to tie \nit and send the game into overtime, the Lady Rockets never trailed \nduring the extra minutes.\n  Senior Sara Hammond, named the tournament's Most Valuable Player, the \nState's first McDonald's All American, and Kentucky's Miss Basketball \n2011, posted 26 points and 11 rebounds during the game. It all came \ndown to the final seconds of overtime when Lady Rockets head coach \nChrysti Noble decided not to call a time out and trusted her players to \nfinish the game with the right shot. Senior Angie Lawrence took a \nbuzzer-beating jumper to give the Lady Rockets the title.\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nStreamers and confetti hailed from the rafters, blanketing the team and \nthe record number of 5,122 screaming spectators at E.A. Diddle Arena in \nBowling Green, KY.\n  Their victory was the first championship title for coach Chrysti \nNoble in her 21 seasons at Rockcastle High School. It also made the \nLady Rockets the first team not from Lexington or Louisville to win the \ngirls' basketball State championship in more than a decade.\n  The students and faculty of Rockcastle High School, the community of \nMount Vernon and the entire Commonwealth couldn't be more proud of this \ntalented, winning team. The Sunday after winning the championship, the \nequivalent of one-fifth of the population of Mount Vernon turned out to \nwish the Lady Rockets well as the team members rode through town atop \nthree fire engines, a convoy of honking vehicles and jubilant fans \nfollowing behind. Their hard work, dedication and respect for one \nanother undoubtedly makes them a team that will be remembered for years \nto come.\n  Mr. President, the Louisville Courier-Journal recently published an \narticle about the Rockcastle High School Lady Rockets' history-making \nseason and what the championship meant to the team, the school and the \nCommonwealth. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Mar. 13, 2011]\n\nGirls' Sweet 16 Rockcastle County Beats Manual 62-60 for Title on Last-\n                              Second Shot\n\n                           (By Jason Frakes)\n\n       Bowling Green, KY--The knock all season on the Rockcastle \n     County High School girls' basketball team was that it's a \n     one-woman squad, led by McDonald's All American Sara Hammond.\n       The Lady Rockets now have a state championship trophy to \n     prove that never was the case.\n       Angie Lawrence nailed a jumper in the lane with 1 second \n     left in overtime to give Rockcastle County a 62-60 victory \n     over Manual in the final of the Houchens/KHSAA Sweet 16.\n       A state final-record crowd of 5,122 at E.A. Diddle Arena \n     saw Rockcastle County capture its first state championship \n     and end a 10-year reign of title winners from either \n     Louisville or Lexington. West Carter (2000) was the last \n     school not from either of Kentucky's largest cities to win \n     the crown.\n       ``This is the best feeling ever,'' said Hammond, a \n     University of Louisville signee who was named the Sweet 16 \n     MVP. ``I knew we were going to get it done tonight.''\n       The 6-foot-2 Hammond posted 26 points and 11 rebounds to \n     lead the Lady Rockets (36-1), who finished the season with a \n     27-game winning streak and lost only to Mount Juliet (Tenn.) \n     60-47 on Dec. 30.\n       Lawrence, a 5-5 senior who has signed with Georgetown \n     College, added 18 points.\n       LeAsia Wright had 19 points and Kara Wright 12 for Manual \n     (33-5), which was No. 1 in the state in The Courier-Journal's \n     Litkenhous Ratings all season.\n       ``Our best wasn't good enough to win the game, but it's \n     good enough for me,'' Lady Crimsons coach Stacy Pendleton \n     said. ``They just beat us. We played as hard as we could.''\n       Manual led 37-28 early in the third quarter, but Rockcastle \n     County charged back and eventually tied it at 47 on a \n     Lawrence three-pointer with 5:07 left in the fourth.\n       Hammond scored 19 points in the first half, but it was \n     Lawrence who carried the Lady Rockets late with 15 points \n     after the break.\n       ``Their other kids really stepped up in the second half,'' \n     Pendleton said. ``But if it wasn't for (Hammond) in the first \n     half, I think we could have blown them out.''\n       Lawrence sank two free throws with 27.5 seconds left for a \n     55-53 lead, but Kayla Styles' basket with 2 seconds left tied \n     it and forced overtime.\n       The Lady Rockets never trailed in the extra period and led \n     60-58 after Michaela Hunter's free throw with 1:22 left. Kara \n     Wright tied it at 60 on a jumper with 56 seconds left, and \n     Rockcastle County held for the final shot.\n       Lady Rockets coach Chrysti Noble chose not to call a \n     timeout.\n       ``They're experienced, and they've been here,'' she said. \n     ``I was like, `No, let them go. Let them determine the \n     outcome of the ballgame.' They did.''\n       Lawrence drove to the lane and nailed her jumper from the \n     right elbow.\n       ``I was feeling it,'' Lawrence said. ``It was a terrible-\n     looking shot, but I had faith in myself. I knew I would hit \n     it.''\n       Hammond said there was a bit of confusion in the final \n     minute.\n       ``I kept asking, `What offense are you running? What \n     offense are you running?' '' Hammond said. ``(Lawrence) had \n     that look in her eye that she was taking it to the hole. \n     She's done that over and over again. We knew it was in her \n     heart, and we trusted her for that shot.''\n       Manual called a timeout with 0.5 second left but couldn't \n     get a final shot.\n       Pendleton was left to wonder what might have been with \n     junior guard April Wilson out since the regional final with a \n     broken hand. He also had two seniors foul out in the final--\n     Raven Hester with 1:29 left in regulation and Mechael Guess \n     at the 2:49 mark of overtime.\n       ``To do all of this without April is amazing,'' Pendleton \n     said. ``That shows you how great this team is. . . . Mechael \n     fouling out was a huge problem, huge. You take away our No. 1 \n     scoring punch and rebounding. That was a huge blow.''\n       For Rockcastle County it was a huge win and gave the 12th \n     Region its first state champion since Laurel County in 1991.\n       Noble, in her 21st season at Rockcastle County, said the \n     victory was important for the school of 910 students and the \n     community of Mount Vernon.\n       ``It's so good to know there's something good from \n     Rockcastle County instead of hearing all the bad stuff,'' she \n     said. ``There are a lot of good things that happen in our \n     community. . . .\n       ``When you come through Rockcastle you'll get to see a sign \n     up, I hope, that says, `Welcome to Rockcastle County, 2011 \n     state champions of girls' basketball.'

Mr. President, on Friday, I spoke at the Ladies \nHermitage Association's Annual banquet in Nashville. This extraordinary \norganization, for 122 years, has preserved the home of President Andrew \nJackson. No former President's home has more historical objects from a \nPresident's life than does the Hermitage. I ask unanimous consent that \nmy remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am honored to accept the Lewis R. Donelson III award, but \n     in truth, the only appropriate person to receive the award is \n     Lewis R. Donelson himself. Lewie is a remarkable individual. \n     He will be 94 years of age in October. Two years ago, he shot \n     a hole in one and he regularly shoots his age in golf. His \n     doctor can find nothing physically wrong with him and he \n     takes no medicine. I am convinced the only appropriate next \n     step for Lewie is to put him into the Smithsonian.\n       No other family's thread runs so proudly through \n     Tennessee's history, from John Donelson's river trip to \n     Nashville in 1779 to Andrew Jackson's marriage to John's \n     daughter, Rachel, to Lewie's life of distinguished public \n     service. Thank you to the Ladies Hermitage Association for \n     your remarkable work preserving Andrew Jackson's home.\n       I was sworn in as Governor of Tennessee three days early, \n     on January 17, 1979. I did this at the request of the U.S. \n     Attorney in order to prevent the incumbent governor from \n     issuing pardons to prisoners whom the FBI believed had paid \n     cash for their release. Lewis Donelson offered the prayer at \n     that surprise inauguration ceremony. One of my first acts as \n     governor was to direct Lewie to take charge of, and secure, \n     the state capitol. Someone said, ``Lewie has been waiting his \n     whole life for someone to ask him to do that.''\n       Lewis Donelson was my first appointee because I knew that \n     if he agreed to be the chief operating officer of state \n     government, it would help to recruit others during a time of \n     a crisis in confidence.\n       Lewie's negotiating style became well known around the \n     Capitol. He would knock you to the floor with his first \n     offer. By the time you had gotten halfway back up you would \n     have agreed with him and considered that a success.\n       About the only thing I was ever able to tell Lewie to do \n     was to stop driving his car to the Capitol while reading a \n     newspaper, and he only stopped that after he ran into the \n     back of another car.\n       Alex Haley once told me, ``Lamar, if you would say, `let me \n     tell you a story' instead of making a speech, people might \n     actually listen to what you have to say.'' So, tonight, let \n     me tell you the story of Andrew Jackson and Sam Houston's \n     Walking Stick.\n       The setting for this story is the first half of the 19th \n     century. Tennessee was then the fifth most populous state. \n     This was the West. There were three Tennessee presidents--\n     Jackson, Polk and Johnson--and two who aspired to be \n     President: Davy Crockett and Sam Houston.\n       The political competition was intense. In 1834, Andrew \n     Jackson's forces defeated the young congressman from West \n     Tennessee, David Crockett, who then rode his horse to the \n     courthouse steps and said to the assembled crowd what \n     defeated politicians have always wanted to say to such \n     voters, ``I'm going to Texas and you can go to hell.''\n       The two-party competition of that era produced strong \n     leaders just as the reemergence of a two party system during \n     the last half-century has sent Tennesseans to national \n     positions from Vice President and Senate Majority Leader to \n     Cabinet membership. There have, as yet, been no more \n     presidents, although there have been regular attempts.\n       In 1807, when Thomas Jefferson was president, the widow \n     Elizabeth Paxson Houston, aged 50, loaded six sons and three \n     daughters into two wagons and moved from Virginia to\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n     a 419-acre farm near Maryville, Tennessee, that her husband \n     had purchased before his death. Of her fifth son Sam, who was \n     then 14 years old, the widow Houston said, ``I had no hope \n     for him. He was so wild.''\n       The Houston farm lay on the border of the Cherokee Nation. \n     Sam found the life of a young Indian man more appealing than \n     working in the family store, so at 16 he ran away from home \n     to live with the Indians and became known by a Cherokee name, \n     Raven.\n       By 1813, the War of 1812 was in full swing. In Maryville, \n     Sam took a silver dollar from the recruiter's drumhead and \n     enlisted. In February of 1814, his regiment received a call \n     to go to the aid of General Andrew Jackson at Horseshoe bend \n     in Alabama. For the next 31 years, Sam Houston was a friend \n     and protege of Andrew Jackson.\n       Jackson taught Houston how to fight a duel. In 1823, he \n     helped Houston be elected to the U.S. House of \n     Representatives. The next year Houston helped Jackson in his \n     unsuccessful bid for the presidency. With Jackson's help \n     Houston became governor of Tennessee in 1827.\n       With Houston's help, Jackson was elected president in 1828. \n     One biographer of Houston said that for Houston ``to be \n     governor of Tennessee with Old Hickory in the White House was \n     as close to being the Prince of Wales as American blood could \n     approach. Houston was the all-but-anointed heir of the most \n     popular president since Washington himself.''\n       A local judge wrote at the time ``Houston stood six-foot-\n     six in his socks, was of fine contour, a remarkable well-\n     proportioned man, and of commanding and gallant bearing. He \n     enjoyed unbounded popularity among the men and was a great \n     favorite with the ladies.''\n       As governor, Houston often visited the Hermitage, sometimes \n     picking flowers in Rachel Jackson's garden. He was chief \n     pallbearer when Rachel died on Christmas Eve of 1828, just \n     after Jackson's election to the Presidency. The next month \n     Governor Houston, then 36 years of age, married Eliza Allen \n     of Gallatin, who was 18. In March, Jackson became President. \n     A month later, on April 16, 1829, distraught over some still \n     unexplained trouble with Eliza, Houston resigned the \n     governorship and went to live with his old friends, the \n     Indians who by then had moved west. He married again and made \n     his way to Texas in 1832.\n       We all know that the great story of Sam Houston and Texas. \n     But the story I would like to complete here tonight is of Sam \n     Houston's walking stick and Andrew Jackson's death.\n       In March of 1845, President Tyler dispatched Andrew Jackson \n     Donelson to Texas to try to persuade Sam Houston to support \n     the annexation of Texas by the United States. Donelson was \n     the nephew of Rachel Donelson. He had served as President \n     Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 was nominated to run \n     for the vice presidency of the United States. He lived in the \n     plantation near the Hermitage, called Tulip Grove.\n       Upon reaching Texas, Andrew Jackson Donelson wrote, ``Tell \n     Uncle that Houston has disappointed me and not given the \n     annexation question the support I expected.'' Houston had \n     kept people guessing about whether he favored allowing Texas \n     to remain an independent country, as British emissaries were \n     arguing. According to one officer of the Texas Navy, ``When \n     [Houston] was sober he was for annexation but when he was \n     drunk he would express himself strongly against the \n     measure.''\n       The next month, in April of 1845, Houston, his wife \n     Margaret, and their two-year-old son Sam began a trip from \n     Texas to New Orleans and up the Mississippi River to see 78-\n     year-old Andrew Jackson, who was dying at the Hermitage. \n     According to one biographer, during those last hours Jackson \n     was talking of his farm, his business, his country, and of \n     the annexation of Texas, and especially of recent comments by \n     Houston which had convinced Jackson that annexation would \n     occur. In one of his last letters to Donelson, Andrew Jackson \n     wrote, ``I knew British gold could not buy Sam Houston.''\n       The Houstons' river passage was delayed when their \n     steamboat ran aground. Finally, at about 6 p.m. on Sunday, \n     June 8, 1845, the steamboat tied up at the Nashville landing \n     on the Cumberland River. The Houstons were told that Jackson \n     was near death. They hired a coach to race to the Hermitage. \n     A few miles outside Nashville their coach met the Jackson \n     family physician. He told them that Jackson had died at about \n     the same time the Houstons had arrived in Nashville. \n     Proceeding on to the Hermitage, Houston lifted his two-year-\n     old son and said, ``Try to remember that you have looked upon \n     the face of Andrew Jackson.'' Houston then put his head on \n     Jackson's chest and wept. At midnight he wrote to President \n     Polk, ``I have seen the corpse. The visage is much as it was \n     in life.''\n       The Houstons were guests at the Donelson plantation, Tulip \n     Grove, for several days after Jackson's death. Houston led \n     the funeral cortege as he had as governor when Rachel Jackson \n     died. When Houston left Nashville to travel to Texas, he left \n     his walking stick at Tulip Grove. It is made of mulberry wood \n     and has a solid gold cap. The stick is split and has been \n     glued together, which may have been the reason Houston left \n     it.\n       How do we know this stick was Houston's stick?\n       For one thing, the words ``Sam Houston'' and ``Texas'' and \n     a Lone Star are engraved on the gold cap.\n       For another, we know from photographs and historical \n     accounts that Houston carried walking sticks. We also know \n     that he knew how to use his stick. In March of 1832, while \n     visiting Washington, DC, Houston encountered Congressman \n     Stanberry from Ohio who had criticized the Jackson Indian \n     policy. Houston confronted Stanberry and said, ``You are a \n     damned rascal!'' and whacked him multiple times over the head \n     with his hickory cane, cut from the grounds of the Hermitage.\n       Fortunately, we know about the provenance of Sam Houston's \n     walking stick from Stanley Horn, the former Tennessee state \n     historian, and Dr. Ben Caldwell. Both Mr. Horn and Dr. \n     Caldwell once owned this stick. Dr. Caldwell is here tonight.\n       Here is what affidavits and letters from Mr. Horn and Dr. \n     Caldwell tell us: Andrew Jackson Donelson, the owner of Tulip \n     Grove, where Houston left his walking stick, had married a \n     widow of the grandson of Thomas Jefferson. Their son, William \n     Alexander Donelson, inherited many of their Jefferson and \n     Jackson items, including the stick. Some of these items, \n     including the stick, were exhibited at Tennessee's 1896 \n     centennial celebration. This exhibit was mentioned in a \n     Nashville newspaper article in 1927.\n       When William Alexander Donelson died these Jackson and \n     Jefferson relics were inherited by his widow, known as ``Miss \n     Bettie.'' In a letter to Ben Caldwell on June 15, 1976, Mr. \n     Horn wrote, ``I knew her several years before her death in \n     1940. [She] told me the details of how the cane was split, \n     etc. I bought the cane at the sale of her effects after her \n     death, and had the slight break repaired; and it remained in \n     my possession until I sold it to you.''\n       Mr. Horn sold the stick to Dr. Caldwell and Baker Duncan of \n     San Antonio in 1973.\n       In a letter to me in 1985 Dr. Caldwell said, ``Mr. Horn \n     proudly displayed the stick in his home. The only way that \n     Baker Duncan and I were able to purchase the walking stick \n     from Mr. Horn was a purchase-swap. He was collecting books \n     containing presidential notations that were in the \n     presidents' personal library. He had a book [of every \n     President] except that he did not have a book of John F. \n     Kennedy's library as he had opposed President Kennedy and he \n     did not want to pay a premium for one of his books . . . I \n     purchased a book that formerly belonged to John F. Kennedy . \n     . . and we were able to trade this with money to Mr. Horn for \n     his walking stick.''\n       Ben Caldwell also told me last year:\n       ``Mr. Horn had offered the stick to the San Jacinto Museum \n     in Texas but they gave him some rigamarole and he said `to \n     hell with it' and so Baker Duncan and I bought the stick from \n     him.''\n       In 1985, I bought Sam Houston's walking stick from Ben \n     Caldwell and Baker Duncan. Ben said it would be appropriate \n     for the second Tennessee governor from Blount County to own \n     the walking stick of the first. So he arranged a three-way \n     purchase swap that worked this way: I paid money to Mr. \n     Horn's daughter, Ruth Crownover, for a sword that belonged to \n     General Stonewall Jackson and then traded that sword to Baker \n     Duncan for his half of the Houston stick. I also paid Mrs. \n     Crownover for a bird bath sculpted by Will Edmondson and then \n     traded that to Ben for his half of the cane.\n       I then gave the stick to our youngest son, Will Houston \n     Alexander, who we named for Sam Houston. When Will was born \n     in 1979, Honey said that I was ``in my Sam Houston phase.'' \n     The lure of Texas also attracted Will. He spent seven years \n     at the University of Texas and its law school but now is \n     living in Nashville. We are glad that he is here tonight.\n       I have since displayed Sam Houston's walking stick in the \n     offices of Tennessee's governor, the president of the \n     University of Tennessee, and the U.S. Secretary of Education. \n     The story of the stick has always produced good conversation, \n     as well as several attempts by Texans to run off with it.\n       For the last eight years, Sam Houston's walking stick has \n     been displayed in my United States Senate office in \n     Washington, DC. It is beneath a photograph of Sam Houston \n     taken when he was United States Senator from Texas. In that \n     photograph Senator Houston is standing with a walking stick \n     much like the one he left in Nashville 166 years ago when \n     Andrew Jackson died.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2083-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2083-S2084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TIM CREAL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize and honor a South Dakotan who has been a tremendous advocate \nfor rural education and has shown selfless dedication to ensuring \nthousands of students in South Dakota achieved their highest academic \npotential.\n  At the close of this school year, Dr. Tim Creal will retire from the \nCuster School District, where he has served as superintendent for 10 \nyears. Tim began his career as an educator in the Faith School District \nin 1979. After teaching in Faith, SD, he spent nearly 20 years with the \nNew Underwood School District, working first as a high school math \nteacher and coach for 10 years. He then served as an elementary \nprincipal, special education director, and\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\nsuperintendent for the school district. In 2001, Tim moved to Custer, \nSD, to serve as the superintendent for the Custer School District.\n  Tim earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics education at Black \nHills State University, BHSU, a university known for its exceptional \neducation program. Last year, Tim was honored with the BHSU Excellence \nin Education Alumni Award, which is an award to honor an alumnus' \noutstanding contributions to the field of education.\n  Tim is a national leader and advocate for rural education. In 2001, \nSenator Tom Daschle appointed him to the Forest Counties Payments \nCommittee, where Tim served for 7 years and helped oversee the \nimplementation of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act. Tim currently is on the board of the National Forest \nCounties and Schools Coalition. Additionally, Tim is actively involved \nwith the Impact Aid Program and serves as secretary of the Section 8002 \nFederal property group for the National Association of Federally \nImpacted Schools, NAFIS. As a founder of the Senate Impact Aid Caucus, \nI have appreciated working with Tim to ensure children living in rural \nareas and enrolled in federally impacted schools receive a high-quality \neducation.\n  Over the years, I have enjoyed working closely with Tim on issues of \ngreat importance to education in South Dakota and have greatly valued \nTim's insight and expertise. I commend Tim for his stewardship and \ninvolvement with the Secure Rural Schools and Impact Aid programs. Tim \nis currently in Washington, DC, for the annual spring NAFIS conference, \nand I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his service \nto our State and Nation. As Tim prepares to retire from the Custer \nSchool District, I wish him, as well as his wife Darla, all the very \nbest. I am deeply appreciative of Tim's years of service to students in \nSouth Dakota and for helping prepare our State's next generation of \nleaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2084-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FRANK SEILER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I offer my \nheartfelt congratulations to a South Dakotan who has dedicated his life \nto educating students in my State.\n  At the close of this school year, Frank Seiler will retire as \nsuperintendent of the Timber Lake School District, concluding a nearly \n50-year career as an educator in South Dakota. Frank began teaching in \nNorth Dakota in 1964. In 1967, he moved to Kadoka, SD, to serve as the \nhigh school principal and coach before moving to McIntosh, where he \nserved as superintendent for 15 years. In 1991, Frank took over as \nsuperintendent of the Timber Lake School District, where he has worked \nfor 20 years.\n  Frank has been involved with the National Association of Federally \nImpacted Schools, NAFIS, since 1975. As one of the founders of the \nSenate Impact Aid Caucus, I am deeply appreciative of Frank's \nleadership in the Impact Aid community and for his responsible \nadministering of the Impact Aid Program in the school districts where \nhe has worked. In May 2010, I was pleased to announce that the Timber \nLake School District would receive a $5 million grant from the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, known to many as the economic stimulus \npackage, so that the community could replace its existing high school \nfacility. Frank has shown tremendous leadership in helping make the \ndream of a new school become a reality.\n  Over the years, Frank has served as a tremendous advocate for his \nschool district and for the importance of a strong education system. My \nstaff and I have greatly valued Frank's insight and expertise over the \nyears. It has been my pleasure working with him to ensure that the many \nchildren in South Dakota living in rural and federally impacted schools \nreceive a quality education.\n  On the occasion of his retirement from the Timber Lake School \nDistrict, I congratulate and thank Frank for his service as an educator \nand mentor to thousands of students in South Dakota. He has truly been \nan inspiration to many of his friends and colleagues. As Impact Aid \nleaders from across our country gather this week for the annual NAFIS \nconference, I want to take the time to recognize Frank for responsible \nmanagement of the Impact Aid Program. On behalf of all South Dakotans, \nI thank Frank for his years of tireless dedication to students in our \nState and for the lasting legacy he leaves. I also thank his wife Donna \nfor her continued support. I wish them both a happy and healthy \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2084-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 872.

A bill to strengthen and protect Medicare hospice programs; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this is far from the first time I have \nspoken in this Chamber about the importance of providing hospice \nbenefits and those workers who help provide them tirelessly every day. \nToday I'm pleased to introduce legislation to strengthen the hospice \nprogram so that these critical benefits will continue to be available \nfor those in the final stages of life.\n  Hospice care provides humane and comforting support for over 744,000 \nterminally ill patients and their families each year. These services \ninclude pain control, palliative medical care and social, emotional and \nspiritual services.\n  Hospice supports the basic human needs for feeling comfortable, in a \nfamiliar environment, surrounded by loving caregivers and family during \nthe later stages of life. Hospice care is an effective model for the \ninteraction of interdisciplinary teams of health professionals, family \nmembers and volunteers in providing care for those needing care in our \ncommunities.\n  Our country strives to provide exceptional support for the sick, \nelderly and terminally ill in home and hospice settings. These \nvulnerable individuals, as well as their family caregivers, are \nindebted to the many professionals and volunteers who have made it \ntheir life's work to serve those in greatest need. Nearly 83,000 \nhospice professionals, 46,000 hospice volunteers and 1 million home \nhealth providers, nationally, contribute significantly to our health \ncare system through their compassion and commitment.\n  It is because of these professionals and volunteers that seniors \ncontinue to have access to this vital service. And it is with these \ncommitted people in mind that Senator Roberts and I introduce \nlegislation that will help sustain the future of hospice care.\n  Specifically, The Hospice Evaluation and Legitimate Payment Act \ncreates a ``do no harm'' demonstration that evaluates proposed payment \nchanges to hospices at 15 different sites before going into effect. \nWith an estimated 66% of hospices looking down a road to negative \noperating margins by 2019, Congress must act to ensure hospice doors \nremain open. Testing payment changes can do that.\n  The HELP Act also allows nurse practitioners and physicians \nassistants to sign-off on the required face-to-face encounter. This \nexpansion ensures program integrity while also preserving access to \nservices, especially in rural areas where great distances can create \nunwanted impediments.\n  Finally, the HELP Act calls for increased accountability. Instead of \na hospice submitting a survey every eight years, this legislation \nimplements the recommendation of the OIG, and increases submission to \nonce every 3 years.\n  We need to support new ways to treat a very ill patient physically \nand emotionally, long before the last days of life. We need to make \nsure doctors are not afraid of using pain medications to make people \ncomfortable and, most of all, we need to make sure people start the \nconversations with their families and doctors about having a better \ndeath and using hospice as early as possible. None of these options for \nchanging the standards of end-of-life care delivery can occur if \nhospices cannot continue to operate. The HELP Act makes that more \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 722\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation introduced by Senator Wyden, of which I am an original \ncosponsor, the `Hospice Evaluation and Legitimate Payment Act.' The \nHELP Act.\n  The HELP Act does what the title says it does and takes initial steps \nin helping our hospices in Kansas and across the Nation continue to \ngive the valuable care that patients and families need.\n  It is impossible to describe the value of hospice services to the \npatients and families for whom they provide selfless and compassionate \ncare. Over the next 10 years hospice is facing drastic reductions in \ntheir reimbursements, negatively impacting at least 1.3 million \npatients and families, which is the number served by hospice programs \nin recent years.\n  The HELP Act sets realistic requirements for a face-to-face \nencounter. The Accountable Care Act included a requirement that a \nhospice physician or nurse practitioner should have a face-to-face \nencounter with hospice patients before their 180-day recertification \nand for each 60-day recertification period after that date, has caused \na significant burden on our hospice communities, especially those in \nrural areas. The limits on who can conduct the face-to-face encounter \nand the timeline for compliance do not reflect the operational \nrealities of hospice programs, especially for small and rural hospices. \nThe HELP Act would allow Nurse Practitioners, Clinical Nurse \nSpecialists and Physician's Assistants to conduct the face-to-face \nencounter, and that hospice programs be afforded 7 days after the \nelection of services to fulfill the requirement.\n  The HELP Act would require the Secretary to establish a payment \nreform demonstration program to test any prospective payment revisions \nto hospice, and would include an evaluation period for data analysis; \nincrease the frequency of hospice surveys to every 3 years; and would \namend the new face-to-face encounter statutory framework to reflect \noperational realities for hospice programs, and the needs of the \npatients and families they serve.\n  Under this legislation the new payment methodologies for hospice must \nfirst be piloted through a 2-year, 15-site demonstration program to \nallow for any recommended payment reform schemes to be tested across a \nrepresentative sample of the hospice community and to assess their \nimpact on beneficiary access to hospice services.\n  The HELP Act also requires more frequent hospice surveys. A recent \nOffice of the Inspector General's, OIG, report noted that CMS was \nremiss in its supervisory responsibilities by not regularly reviewing \nthe operational and clinical delivery processes of the hospice \ncommunity. OIG has recommended on numerous occasions that ``CMS should \nconduct more frequent certification surveys of hospices as a way to \nenforce the requirements.'' Accrediting organizations, such as the \nJoint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, \nJCAHO, have set an industry standard of certification every 3 years for \nhospices. The HELP Act requires an initial survey for those seeking \ncertification to be followed by a standard survey every 3 years.\n  While there is more work that needs to be done to address payment \nreductions for hospice providers, the HELP Act takes some initial steps \nto addressing these problems. I am grateful to my colleague Senator \nWyden for introducing this legislation and I am happy to lend my \nsupport. I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nreview and consider supporting this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2090-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2090-S2091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 127--DESIGNATING APRIL 2011 AS ``NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE \n                           PREVENTION MONTH''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas in 2009, approximately 702,000 children were \n     determined to be victims of abuse or neglect;\n       Whereas in 2009, an estimated 1,770 children died as a \n     result of abuse or neglect;\n       Whereas in 2009, an estimated 80.8 percent of the children \n     who died due to abuse or neglect were under the age of 4;\n       Whereas in 2009, of the children under the age of 4 who \n     died due to abuse or neglect, 46.2 percent were under the age \n     of 1;\n       Whereas abused or neglected children have a higher risk for \n     developing health problems in adulthood, including \n     alcoholism, depression, drug abuse, eating disorders, \n     obesity, suicide, and certain chronic diseases;\n       Whereas a National Institute of Justice study indicated \n     that abused or neglected children--\n       (1) are 11 times more likely to be arrested for criminal \n     behavior as juveniles; and\n       (2) are 2.7 times more likely to be arrested for violent \n     and criminal behavior as adults;\n       Whereas an estimated 1/3 of abused or neglected children \n     grow up to abuse or neglect their own children;\n       Whereas providing community-based services to families \n     impacted by child abuse or neglect may be far less costly \n     than--\n       (1) the emotional and physical damage inflicted on children \n     who have been abused or neglected;\n       (2) providing other services to abused or neglected \n     children, including child protective, law enforcement, court, \n     foster care, or health care services; or\n       (3) providing treatment to adults recovering from child \n     abuse; and\n       Whereas child abuse and neglect have long-term economic and \n     societal costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2011 as ``National Child Abuse \n     Prevention Month'';\n       (2) recognizes and applauds the national and community \n     organizations that work to promote awareness about child \n     abuse and neglect, including by identifying risk factors and \n     developing prevention strategies;\n       (3) supports the proclamation issued by President Obama \n     declaring April 2011 to be ``National Child Abuse Prevention \n     Month''; and\n       (4) should increase public awareness of prevention programs \n     relating to child abuse and neglect, and continue to work \n     with States to reduce the incidence of child abuse and \n     neglect in the United States.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to submit a resolution recognizing National Child Abuse \nPrevention Month. I\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\nam honored to be joined by an advocate for children, Senator Kerry, in \nturning a spotlight on the issue of child abuse and neglect in this \ncountry. Senator Kerry and I share a common belief that children should \nbe valued and nurtured by both their families and all of us.\n  The effort to address child abuse transcends ideological and partisan \nlines. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue--this is an \nAmerican issue--one that we can't wish away, but that we must face head \non and work to eradicate.\n  Abuse of children occurs in all segments of our society, in rural, \nsuburban, and urban areas and among all racial, ethnic, and income \ngroups. According to the 2009 Child Maltreatment Study compiled by the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, during 2009, an estimated \n702,000 children were determined to be victims of abuse or neglect, and \nan estimated 1,770 children died as a result.\n  Last year I became aware of yet another tragic case of child abuse. \nMaine was mourning the death of 15-month old Damien Lynn. Autopsy \nreports show that little Damien had broken bones and ribs, head and \nabdominal injuries, and a human bite mark on his right arm. This year \nthe former boyfriend of Damien's mother will face the consequences of \nhis actions, and I am proud to introduce this resolution again in \nDamien's memory.\n  The time has come for Americans to unite in an all-out effort to \neradicate child abuse. National Child Abuse Prevention Month is an \nopportunity for communities across the country to keep children safe, \nprovide the support families need to stay together, and raise children \nand youth to be happy, secure, and stable adults.\n  To paraphrase Mahatma Gandhi, ``You can judge a society by how they \ntreat their weakest members.'' This resolution is sad commentary that \nwe have to do more to protect those who are in the dawn of life, the \nmost vulnerable among us, our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/04/senate-section/article/S2091-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2091-S2092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 128--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT PUBLIC \nSERVANTS SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTINUED SERVICE \nTO THE NATION DURING PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK, MAY 1 THROUGH 7, \n                                  2011\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nCarper, and Mr. Lautenberg) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor America's public \nservants, who provide so many essential services that Americans rely on \nevery day. I am pleased to once again introduce a resolution \nrecognizing these employees during Public Service Recognition Week.\n  Public Service Recognition Week provides us with the opportunity to \nhonor and celebrate the works of federal, state and local public \nemployees--and also gives American's across the country a chance to \nlearn about the many possible careers in public service. As a former \nteacher and a life-long public servant, I have worked alongside so many \nhard-working, talented people who have dedicated their lives to serving \nothers. Public employees across the country use the week to educate \ntheir fellow citizens on how government serves them and makes life \nbetter for all of us. It is my hope that this week's events will \nencourage many people, especially students and young professionals, to \nconsider a career in public service.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia, I am proud to take this moment \nto highlight the importance of our public servants. This country is \nfacing so many challenges both here at home and abroad, and our public \nservants play an integral role in moving our country forward. It is \nessential that we do not lose sight of their importance and all that \nthey do to keep our country strong.\n  Our public servants are honorable men and women who provide vital \nservices to the American people, including teaching our children, \nkeeping our Nation safe, caring for our wounded warriors, guarding our \nprisons, and responding to natural disasters. Our way of life would not \nexist without the work of public employees.\n  This is the 27th year we have honored our public servants with Public \nService Recognition Week during the first week of May. Although we have \ndesignated a week to pay tribute to government employees, it is also \nimportant that we honor the invaluable service of public servants \nthroughout the year. America's public servants deserve our gratitude \nand respect and I thank them for their dedication.
