Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 250, \nS. 1940.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 250, S. 1940, a bill to \n     amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to restore \n     the financial solvency of the flood insurance fund, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate will continue debate on the farm \nbill today. At 5 p.m. the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider the nomination of Mary Lewis to be U.S. District Judge for the \nDistrict of South Carolina. At 5:30 this evening there will be a \nrollcall vote on confirmation of the Lewis nomination.\n\n\n                             Moving Forward\n\n  Mr. President, I have spoken to Senator Stabenow several times in the \nlast couple of days. In fact, I spoke to her today--what time did I get \nback? It is 3 o'clock--at 2 o'clock or thereabouts. She indicated to me \nthey are making progress on the bill. There was one amendment she was \nconcerned about. I worked that out and told her she could go ahead and \nhave that as part of the consent agreement. So I have worked very hard \nto try to make the lives of Senators Stabenow and Roberts easier, and I \nhave worked through some of the problems my people had.\n  But, Mr. President, the issues on this bill overwhelmingly are on the \nother side, and I hope we can work something out. They have worked so \nhard--Senators Stabenow and Roberts--and I hope we can find a path \nforward. It is important. I commend them for their dedication to this \nmeasure which cuts subsidies and protects 16 million American jobs.\n  We have spent so much precious time on this bill--precious time we do \nnot have--and we need to move forward on it. We are going to move \nforward or off of this bill. I hope we will be able to move forward \ntoday with this bill; otherwise, we are going to have to file cloture \non the bill because it is the third week of jockeying around on this \nbill.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. President, Astrid Silva is an average American 24-year-old from \nall outward appearances. She is a Las Vegas resident. She is fascinated \nwith Nevada history--whether it is Area 51 or about the time when it is \nalleged the mob ran the casinos. She is active in her community, school \npolitics, and local politics.\n  One day Astrid would like to come to Washington, DC, to see, as she \nsaid, the Declaration of Independence--see it herself. She recently \ncompleted her associate's degree at the College of Southern Nevada, and \nshe dreams of completing her bachelor's degree at UNLV.\n  But there is one issue standing in her way: Astrid is not an American \ncitizen. Twenty years ago this week this little girl, 3\\1/2\\ years \nold--a little baby girl--was brought to the United States by her \nparents. She has no knowledge of Mexico. America is her country. The \ncountry where she was born--Mexico--she knows nothing about. She speaks \nperfect English. She was an honor student in high school, and she has \nnever called anyplace but Nevada her home.\n  So, of course, I thought of this brave young woman when President \nObama announced last Friday he would suspend the deportation of young \npeople\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\nlike Astrid who were brought to this country illegally when they were \nonly children.\n\n  I had a difficult campaign, as everyone knows. During that campaign, \non occasion I would be given a little handwritten note. I would look at \nit later. One was from Astrid telling me of her dreams--her dreams that \nshe wanted fulfilled, that could not be because she was not a citizen \neven though this is her country.\n  She has been looking over her shoulder for many years now--since the \ntime she was old enough to understand--afraid of deportation. She \ndecided she was going to step out of the shadows and be no longer \nafraid and become an advocate for the DREAM Act. She is truly a \nDREAMer.\n  As we know, the DREAM Act would create a pathway to citizenship for \noutstanding young people who were brought to this country through no \nfault of their own and want to attend college or serve our Nation in \nthe Armed Services.\n  The DREAM Act is not amnesty. It rewards responsibility with \nopportunity.\n  Astrid's handwritten letters convinced me years ago of the importance \nof this issue. Unfortunately, Republican opposition has stalled this \nlegislation.\n  I was stunned listening to the Republican nominee for President say: \nWhy doesn't Congress do this?\n  Mr. President, we have tried. We cannot get Republican votes. We have \ntried.\n  Thanks to President Obama, Astrid and 800,000 other young people just \nlike her who are American in all but paperwork no longer need to live \nin fear of deportation. President Obama's directive to suspend \ndeportation of the DREAMers comes after a yearlong review. It will be \napplied on a case-by-case basis. It frees up law enforcement resources \nto focus on people who actually threaten public safety and national \nsecurity, and it removes the specter of deportation that has hovered \nover deserving young men and women.\n  For a long time the Presiding Officer was the chief attorney, the \nchief enforcer of the law in the State of Connecticut, and he had to \ndirect his resources where they could best be used. He wanted to focus \non people who were threatening public safety and national security.\n  What good would it do for us as a country to say to people such as \nAstrid: You cannot go to school. What you can do is go ahead and be \npart of a gang. Women become gang members too. Some of those violent \ngang members we have in America today are now women. Are we better off \npreventing these young men and women from going to school, from going \ninto the military, even though this is the only country they have ever \nknown as home?\n  Are we better off saying stay in the shadows or are we better off \nletting them get an education and serving our country in the military? \nThe answer to that is so easy.\n  It removes the specter of deportation that has hovered over deserving \nyoung men and women. That is what President Obama did. So I \ncongratulate him for this courageous decision--a decision that benefits \nboth the DREAMers and our Nation as a whole.\n  Like Astrid, these young people share our language, share our \nculture, share our love for America--the only country they know. They \nare talented, patriotic men and women who want to defend our Nation in \nthe military, get a college education, work hard, and contribute to \ntheir communities and this country.\n  When they pledge allegiance, it is to the United States of America. \nUnfortunately, President Obama's directive is temporary. The onus is \nnow on Congress to protect the DREAMers and fix our broken immigration \nsystem once and for all.\n  For all of these people who are saying: Why didn't you do it in \nCongress, we tried. We invite them here. If they want to make it \npermanent, it could be done very easily.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform should be tough, fair, and \npractical. It should continue efforts to secure our borders, hold \nunscrupulous employers accountable, and reform our Nation's legal \nimmigration system. It should require 11 million undocumented people to \nregister with the government, pay taxes and fines, work, and learn \nEnglish. Then they do not go to the front of the line, they go to the \nback of the line and work their way up.\n  Some Republicans have suggested a solution to the DREAMers' terrible \ndilemma should have come from Congress, not the President. I have \ntalked about that today already.\n  I repeat, it is Republican opposition that has prevented Congress \nfrom acting. In fact, Senate Republicans have blocked the DREAM Act \ntwice. Many Republicans who once said they favored a long-term fix for \nAmerica's broken immigration system are now abandoning efforts to find \ncommon ground.\n  It was interesting to note that on one of the Sunday shows yesterday, \nthe former Governor of Massachusetts refused to answer the question \nwhen asked four times by Bob Schieffer: What is your proposal? He would \nnot answer four times. We all know he said if the DREAM Act passed he \nwould veto it. But he is saying: Why don't you work it out in Congress? \nBut he is saying: If you do, I am going to veto it.\n  Obviously, efforts to find common ground have been abandoned. So the \nPresident took decisive action in offering this directive. But he can \nonly do so much by himself. So for Astrid's sake and for the sake of \nevery American, it is time for Congress to become part of the solution.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will finally join Democrats to find a \nbipartisan way to mend this Nation's flawed immigration system instead \nof just complaining about the system being broken. The pathway is \nthere. We know what needs to be done. We just need a little help from \nour Republican colleagues.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Responding to the President\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to respond today to some statements \nPresident Obama has been making on the campaign trail regarding debt, \nspending, and taxes during his administration.\n  Last week, the President said he should not be blamed for the massive \ndebt and spending in recent years because, in his words, it was all \n``baked into the cake'' when he took office. He also contended that his \nadministration has done the responsible thing in taking steps to fix \nour Nation's fiscal problems. Here is the totality of what the \nPresident said:\n\n       I love it when these guys talk about debt and deficits. I \n     inherited a trillion dollar deficit. We signed $2 trillion of \n     spending cuts into law. Spending under my administration has \n     grown more slowly than under any President in the last 60 \n     years. They baked all this stuff into the cake with the tax \n     cuts and the war.\n\n  I would like to respond to each of the President's comments. First, \non deficits and debt, President Obama is not the reformer he makes \nhimself out to be. Since he took office, the national debt has climbed \nby $5 trillion. It is now larger than the entire economy. If we take \nhis entire 4 years and all of the Presidents before him, he has \nincurred as much debt as all of the Presidents, from George Washington \nthrough George W. Bush, just in his time as President.\n  Yearly deficits, which is the gap between revenues and spending, have \ngrown substantially as well. Despite a promise to cut the deficit in \nhalf by the end of his first term, the President has run annual \ndeficits in excess of $1 trillion for 4 years in a row. None of this \nhas anything to do with what happened before he became President. So \nhow about after he became President?\n  According to the President's own budget numbers, in 2009, the first \nyear of his Presidency, the deficit was $1.4 trillion. In 2010 the \ndeficit was $1.3 trillion. In 2011 it, again, was $1.3 trillion.\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\nIf the President's policies are followed, the deficit this year is \nexpected to top $1.3 trillion. Those are all in the years when he was \nPresident.\n  The highest deficit under President Bush, his predecessor, was $458 \nbillion, and that was in 2008. Every deficit under President Obama has \nbeen more than double that figure. But President Obama says he is \nblameless when it comes to the debt problem? Not hardly. He never even \nsubmitted a plan to come close to balancing the budget, even with the \nmassive tax hike he supports.\n  As Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote last week:\n\n       Despite [the President's] claim that ``both parties have \n     laid out their policies on the table,'' President Obama has \n     made no serious proposal to fix the runaway entitlement \n     programs that threaten to swamp the government's finances.\n\n  Dana Milbank is not a conservative Republican.\n  Second, let's take a look at the President's claim that spending \nduring his Presidency has grown more slowly than during any Presidency \nin the last 60 years. That claim does not pass the smell test.\n  Keith Hennessey, former Director of the National Economic Council, is \none of many observers who has debunked this claim.\n  First, as Hennessey notes, the President's claim is based on a \ndiscredited article that suggests he isn't actually accountable for \nanything that happened before October 1, 2009. That is the start of the \nfiscal year. But, of course, he took office almost 9 months before that \ntime.\n\n  In other words, that timetable excludes the auto bailouts, the first \nyear of the stimulus bill--which, of course, was President Obama's \nlegislation--the bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and a lot of \nother things. As Hennessey writes, this date was ``cherry-picked . . . \nto make President Obama's record look good.''\n  I would ask: Does President Obama also disclaim anything to do with \nthe auto bailouts that occurred during that same period of time? No, \nlast time I heard, he was bragging about that. That is the height of \ncherry picking. The things that make you look good, you take; the \nthings that make you look bad, you reject. You can't have it both ways.\n  Second, the President actually proposed spending far higher than was \nenacted into law. For example, his latest budget request proposed \nspending of $3.72 trillion in fiscal year 2013. But the President is \ntaking credit for spending in the CBO baseline which is $3.58 trillion, \nwhich is somewhat less than the $3.72 trillion he proposed. So the \nPresident wanted to spend more but was restrained by the Republicans in \nthe House of Representatives in Congress.\n  Mr. Hennessey also explains how the President's spending claim \ncollapses once you take three basic errors into account. He writes:\n\n       If you instead do this calculation the right way and \n     measure the average annual growth rate from fiscal year 2008 \n     to CBO scoring of the President's budget proposal for fiscal \n     year 2013, you get an average annual growth rate of Federal \n     spending of 4.5 percent. That is a nominal growth rate, so \n     the real growth rate will be in the 2s.\n\n  Finally, on spending, it is inaccurate to measure a President's \nrecord without looking at the overall size and scope of government. \nPresident Obama's preference for big government is obvious to everyone. \nHe usually argues for it. He doesn't argue he is for a smaller or less \nactive government. Well, the historical average of spending to gross \ndomestic product before President Obama took office was roughly 20.6 \npercent.\n  So how does President Obama's record stack up? Here is the breakdown \nof spending to gross domestic product. These are the ratios during the \nObama years. Remember now, this is compared to the historical average \nof 20.6 percent. In 2009, his first year, 25.2 percent; next, 2010, \n24.1 percent; in 2011, 24.1 percent again; and an estimate for this \nyear, 2012, is 24.3 percent.\n  All of these figures are substantially higher than the historical \naverage of spending at 20 percent. So his spending every year he has \nbeen in office, including the projected spending this year, will be far \ngreater than the historical average.\n  And lastly, in the President's budget request for fiscal year 2013, \nwhich would be next year, the spending averages 22.5 percent--still \nabove the 20-percent historical figure.\n  So it is no wonder President Obama doesn't want to run on his real \nspending record, because it is not one of fiscal constraint.\n  Third, I want to address the President's claim that the tax relief \nCongress enacted in 2001 and 2003 somehow played an outsized role in \ndriving up the debt. We have heard him talk about this--if it weren't \nfor the Bush tax cuts, he said we would be closer to having a balanced \nbudget. Not true. The records for this come from the nonpartisan \nreferees at the Congressional Budget Office. These are not partisan \npeople--not on one side or the other--and they have shown what we have \nis a spending problem, not a revenue problem.\n  In May of 2011, CBO released an analysis showing that nearly 50 \npercent of the cumulative budget deficit since 2001 is due to increased \ngovernment spending, 28 percent of it is due to economic and technical \ncorrections, and 11 percent is due to temporary stimulus-like tax \nprovisions. The 2001 and 2003 tax relief to which President Obama \nrefers--which, by the way, is the same tax relief he extended for 2 \nyears about a year and a half ago--accounts for how much? Just 14 \npercent of the deficit since 2001 and 2003.\n  So, far from being the cause of the deficit, it only accounts for 14 \npercent of the deficit. It is inaccurate for the President to place the \nblame for his spending records on broad-based progrowth tax relief that \nhas helped to create jobs and economic growth in this country prior to \nthe last downturn--and that he himself supported extending.\n  Additionally, the recently released ``Long-Term Budget Outlook'' \nestimates that tax revenues will exceed the historical average in the \nnext 10 years if this same tax policy--the 2001 and 2003 tax relief--is \nextended, and if Congress prevents the alternative minimum tax from \nhitting millions of additional middle-class families. And that is what \nRepublicans have been supporting all along. So we will get back to the \nhistorical average of revenues raised.\n  We all know robust economic growth is the most effective way to \nreduce our debt and that raising taxes will not achieve that goal. \nFailure to stop this tax-driven fiscal cliff could push us into another \nrecession next year, again according to the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office. It would result in a $4.59 trillion tax hike on \nindividuals, families, businesses, and investors over the next decade. \nWe have said that is the largest tax increase in the history of our \ncountry--over $4.5 trillion. If we are serious about increasing tax \nrevenues through economic growth, avoiding a recession is a good place \nto start.\n  Republicans are happy to debate President Obama on the best way to \ncreate jobs and to get our country back on sound fiscal footing. But in \norder to do so, we need to get the facts straight first. President \nObama has not lived up to his promise to cut the deficit. He has not \nreduced spending in any meaningful way. And tax relief is not the main \nreason why we are in the red today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to talk \nabout the critically important piece of legislation currently before \nthe Senate, the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act. But first I \nwould like to thank Senators Stabenow and Roberts for the great work \nthey have done to get us to this point in the reauthorization process.\n  The bill as reported out of the Agriculture Committee saves taxpayers \nmore than $23 billion over the next 10 years and will support millions \nof jobs. With this bill, we are taking several important steps in \nmaking our farm support system more responsive to actual need rather \nthan sending payments to producers no matter what\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\nthey grow. We are long past due in eliminating direct payments. At the \nsame time, we are maintaining a strong crop insurance program and \ncreating a new system that makes assistance available to producers when \nthey actually experience a loss.\n  Another important area of reform in this bill is payment limitations \nand ensuring that actual farmers receive payments. Senator Grassley and \nI have worked for years to lower the caps on our farm program payments \nand to direct payments to family farmers. The new Agriculture Risk \nCoverage Program contains a cap of $50,000 and requires that program \npayment recipients contribute labor to the farm operation. Current law \nhas enabled multiple farm managers in an operation to qualify for \nseparate farm program payments with as little participation as one \nconference call a year. Not anymore under this bill. I am disappointed \nthat there have been amendments filed to weaken this language. I don't \nunderstand how anyone can stand before this body and justify sending \nFederal farm program payments to people who aren't engaged in \nagriculture. Our country faces serious fiscal challenges, and it seems \nto me that limiting farm payments to real farmers is a reasonable \nconcept. I urge my colleagues to oppose efforts to weaken this \nlanguage.\n  With this bill we are also taking important steps to combine and \nstreamline our conservation programs, while still allowing us to \ncontinue meeting the same land, water, and wildlife goals. \nAdditionally, this bill contains a sodsaver provision that will \ndiscourage the breaking of native sod for crop production.\n  One area of the bill with which I am disappointed is that it does not \ncontain a livestock title. However, I have joined with some of my \ncolleagues in filing amendments to give our independent livestock \nproducers a fair shake in the marketplace. Along with Senator Grassley \nand others, I have worked for more than a decade to prohibit the \nownership of livestock by the big meatpackers for more than 14 days \nprior to slaughter. Additionally, I have joined with Senator Enzi in \nfiling an amendment to require more transparency in the use of forward \ncontracts in the livestock markets. These are important provisions that \nI hope my colleagues will support.\n  I also applaud the committee's work on the energy and rural \ndevelopment titles, which strengthen our rural economies. The Rural \nDevelopment water and wastewater program has been a critical funding \nsource to help alleviate a severe water infrastructure need on the \nCheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation. I hope my colleagues will act \nfavorably on Senator Brown's amendment that I have cosponsored to \nbolster this and other Rural Development programs.\n  Finally, I would like to commend efforts to address the pine beetle \nepidemic in the forestry title of this bill. The underlying bill does \ngood work to increase flexibility, and I support the efforts of Senator \nMark Udall and others to increase the resources we are providing to the \nForest Service to address this threat to our forest health and public \nsafety.\n  I understand that the Agriculture Committee leaders and Senate \nleadership have been making progress in their negotiations toward an \nagreement on a path forward. I hope we can avoid letting a small \nminority of Senators hold up progress on this bill. It is time that we \nact and that we give our producers certainty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, Senate Republicans announced \nthey are going to shut down and block the confirmation process for \nqualified and consensus circuit nominees for the rest of the year. That \nis unfortunate, and it does nothing to help the American people or our \ncourts. The courts continue to be overburdened while consensus nominees \nfor vacancies that could be filled are being stalled. In some cases for \nnominees, we have two Republican Senators from the State supporting \nthem and others where we have a Democratic and Republican Senator \nsupporting them. They have gone through our committee--usually by voice \nvote--and they are noncontroversial. I have often spoken during the \nlast three years of the foot dragging and obstruction by Senate \nRepublicans with respect to this President's judicial nominations.\n  Just last week we saw the Majority Leader file the 28th cloture \npetition to end another filibuster against another qualified judicial \nnominee. Last week it was a nominee from Arizona supported by Senator \nKyl and Senator McCain. By their announcement, the Senate Republican \nleadership is saying that it will not agree to proceeding with debate \nand a vote on any of the four circuit court nominees voted on by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. They include a nominee from Maine strongly \nsupported by both Republican Senators from Maine, and a nominee from \nOklahoma supported by the Republican Senators from that state, as well \nas a nominee from New Jersey and one for the Federal Circuit who was \napproved by all of the Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee, \nexcept for an unrelated protest vote. This plan to shut down the \nconfirmation process is consistent with what the partisan Senate \nRepublican leadership did in 1996, when it would not allow any circuit \nnominees to be confirmed, and again at the end of President Clinton's \npresidency, and can be contrasted with how Democrats acted in 1992, \n2004 and 2008. This is really a challenge to the Senators who have said \nthat they will not support these filibusters and this kind of \nobstruction.\n  It is hard to see how this new application of the Thurmond rule is \nanything more than another name for the stalling tactics we have \nalready seen for months and years. I have yet to hear any good reason \nwhy we should not continue to vote on well-qualified consensus \nnominees, as we did up until September of the last two Presidential \nelection years when we had a Republican President. That was supported \nby both Democrats and Republicans--to vote up through September. I have \nyet to hear a good explanation why we can't work to solve the problems \nof high vacancies for the American people. I will continue to work with \nthe Senate leadership to try to confirm as many of President Obama's \nqualified judicial nominees as possible because I hear from judges all \nover the country\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nhow these judicial vacancies are burdening our courts, and American \ntaxpayers are unable to get a court to hear their cases.\n  I was heartened to see the senior Senator from Maine has said she \nwill continue to work with the bipartisan Senate leadership in an \neffort to bring the Maine nominee to the First Circuit before the \nSenate for a confirmation vote. I trust that many Republican Senators \nwho joined Senator Kyl and Senator McCain in opposing the filibuster of \nJustice Hurwitz will now join to oppose the filibusters of William \nKayatta of Maine, Judge Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma, Judge Shwartz of \nNew Jersey, and Richard Taranto for the Federal Circuit. I hope the \nSenators from South Carolina, whose State's nominee we consider today, \nwill aid this effort just as we worked with them throughout the process \nto ensure they were consulted by the President. In fact, I personally \nrequested the President consult with Republican Senators when they were \ngoing to have a nominee from their home State. I hope they are going to \nshow that same courtesy to other Senators.\n  Senate Republicans were talking about shutting down the confirmation \nprocess from the beginning of this year, as I chronicled in my \nstatement on February 7 on their obstruction and delay. They slow \nwalked nominees who should have been confirmed last year into May of \nthis year. And now, one month later, they announce that they are \nclosing the gates on progress. The article by John Stanton in Roll Call \non June 14 blew the whistle on their plan. The banner headline notes \nthe ``GOP . . . Judge Blockade'' but it is not just beginning. It began \nfrom the moment the President was elected.\n  I think this pattern of obstruction--and I say this more out of \nsadness than anything else--has been as transparent as the Senate \nRepublican leader's statement that ``the single most important thing \none-term President.'' Just as they obstruct his qualified judicial \nnominees, they have also rejected virtually every effort this President \nhas made to improve the economy and create jobs. They have become the \nparty of no--no help for the American people, no to jobs, no to \neconomic recovery, no to police, firefighters, and teachers, no to \nthose students who are seeking help to pay for education, no to \nconsumer protection, no to assisting State and local governments, no to \nthe highway bill, and no to any more judges.\n  Never mind that the American people rely on our courts for justice \nand that the courts are overburdened with vacancies and that we have 17 \njudicial nominees voted out of the Judiciary Committee waiting for \nSenate confirmation.\n  The idea that Senate Republicans would oppose a proposal, bill or \nnomination simply because it comes from this President is sadly no \nsurprise. Republicans objected to extending the payroll tax cut even \nthough they ultimately supported it. Republicans have also come to \nreject ideas and proposals that originated from their own party simply \nbecause this President supports them. This was the case with the \nindividual mandate for healthcare, which was a Republican idea. So it \nshould come as no surprise that Republicans have been obstructing \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees since the President first took \noffice.\n\n  Regrettably, the obstruction of judicial nominations is just one more \nexample of Republicans saying no or simply going slow. They are saying \nno to the police, firefighters, teachers, students, consumer \nprotection, and to those 50 States that want to go forward with highway \nbills.\n  I hear from Vermonters--Republicans and Democrats alike--and they \ncannot wait while politics trump sound policy efforts in Washington. It \nis time for a reality check.\n  While our economy is showing some signs of progress since the \neconomic collapse four years ago, there is no doubt domestic job growth \nhas not been as strong as we had hoped. Even though we have under 5 \npercent unemployment in Vermont, we still have too many Vermonters \nlooking for work. We have to continue looking for ways to spur job \ngrowth and economic investment in this country. Unfortunately, efforts \nin Congress to increase jobs, reduce unemployment, and support \nhardworking American families struggling to keep food on their tables \nand roofs over their heads meet with partisan obstruction too.\n  While Congress delays, the clock is ticking down for the millions of \nAmericans struggling to afford college and those struggling to pay back \nstudent loans once they have graduated. In less than two weeks, student \nloan interest rates will double, threatening to make student loan debt \nan almost insurmountable obstacle to accessing a college education. \nMeanwhile, Senate Republicans continue to filibuster commonsense \nlegislation to address this looming deadline.\n  In less than 2 weeks, millions of jobs will be put on hold when \ncritical transportation programs, including funding for the highway \ntrust fund, expire. Failing to pass a long-term transportation bill \njeopardizes thousands of construction and development projects, \nimpacting millions of jobs in every single State in this country. These \nprograms impact every one of our states--which means more jobs lost in \nan already weak economy. The Senate has passed a bill to bring \ncertainty to this fund for two years. We are still waiting for the \nHouse Republican leadership to act on that legislation.\n  In a little over 1 month, important legislation to extend the \nNational Flood Insurance Program will expire. The failure to \nreauthorize this important program puts at risk the sale of thousands \nof homes at a time when our housing market is still trying to recover. \nThe program expired in 2008, and subsists now on a series of short term \nextensions. A five-year extension is pending before Congress; Senate \nRepublicans have delayed consideration of that important legislation, \ntoo.\n  Meanwhile, in this election year, Republicans in Congress are more \nintent on extending the Bush-era tax cuts that contributed to the \nfinancial crisis facing us today than in working together to move \nforward with reasonable policies to bolster economic growth and \ndevelopment. Extending to the wealthiest Americans a lower tax rate \nwill not lead to job creation. These tax cuts have not led to job \ncreation. Meanwhile, businesses continue to shutter their doors, \ncosting communities jobs and economic development.\n  I know I raised the question at the time when Congress voted to go to \nwar in Iraq--a war I voted against--that they were going to do it by \nborrowing the money, the same in Afghanistan. Never before in this \nNation have we gone to war and borrowed the money. We have had a tax to \npay for it. So we lose $1 trillion in Iraq and at least $\\1/2\\ trillion \nso far in Afghanistan.\n  If we want to cast partisan politics aside and have a consensus on \nmeaningful jobs and job preservation legislation, we can do so. We have \nshown how to do it. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act is one of the \nbest examples of laws enacted in this Congress to promote our American \neconomy and create American jobs. The Republican chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee and I in the Senate brought together Republicans \nand Democrats in both bodies, and we passed the Leahy-Smith America \nInvents Act. Unfortunately, it was only one of the few job-creating \nbills enacted in this Congress.\n  The outlook this Congress need not be gloom and doom. Working \ntogether, we can enact meaningful legislation to close the loopholes \nthat incentivize companies to ship jobs overseas. We can bolster the \nmiddle class, rather than the wealthiest one percent of Americans, by \npromoting job creation through small business development. We can \nensure that students graduating from school are not saddled with \nstudent loans, the interest rates on which are simply too high to \nafford. We can do all this, today.\n  I am disheartened that the Republican leaders in Congress have said \nthey are simply done legislating for the year. The reality check is \nthat Vermonters and other Americans of all States cannot wait. \nPresident Obama has signaled his commitment to moving forward with job-\ncreating legislation to get Americans back to work and to protect \nAmerica's leadership in the global marketplace. We should move on that. \nLet the two candidates for President argue, let them state their \npositions, and let the voters decide which one they want to vote for. \nIn the meantime, when we have legislation to put Americans to work, \nlet's\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\nput politics aside and focus on the right policies, on the needs of the \nAmerican people. All of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--should act \non behalf of the people who sent us. It is past time for that work to \nbegin.\n  Shutting down judicial confirmations makes no sense when the judicial \nvacancy rate remains almost twice what it was at this point in the \nfirst term of President Bush. Senate Republicans were successful in \nkeeping it near or above 80 for three years. Nearly one out of every 11 \nFederal courts is currently vacant. As a current report from the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service confirms, not a single one \nof the last three presidents has had judicial vacancies increase after \ntheir first term. President Obama will likely be the first given \npartisan obstruction. The same recent CRS report notes that the median \ntime circuit nominees have had to wait before a Senate vote has \nskyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's nominees to 132 days for \nPresident Obama's. This is the result of Republican foot dragging and \nobstruction. Last year Senate Republicans again refused to act on 19 \njudicial nominees and delayed consideration of those nominations an \nextra year.\n  Three of the five circuit court judges finally confirmed this year \nafter months of unnecessary delays and a filibuster should have been \nconfirmed last year. The other two circuit court nominees confirmed \nthis year were both subjected to stalling and a partisan filibuster by \nSenate Republicans. So when I hear some Senate Republicans say they are \ninvoking the Thurmond Rule and have decided they are not going to allow \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees to be considered, I wonder how the \nAmerican people can tell the difference. There are longstanding \nvacancies with nominees ready to fill them that Republicans are \ndelaying unnecessarily for months. How do we tell the difference \nbetween the Republican obstruction--that was signaled when they \nfilibustered President Obama's very first circuit court nominee, a \nnomination supported by the longest-serving Republican in the Senate \nand the nominee's home state Senator--and this new application of the \nThurmond Rule?\n\n  Last week we needed to overcome a filibuster to confirm Justice \nAndrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit despite the strong \nsupport of his home state Senators, Republicans Jon Kyl and John \nMcCain. Last month the Majority Leader had to file cloture to secure an \nup-or-down vote on Paul Watford of California to the Ninth Circuit \ndespite his sterling credentials and bipartisan support. The year \nstarted with the Majority Leader having to file for cloture to get an \nup-or-down vote on Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh \nCircuit even though he was strongly supported by his Republican home \nstate Senator. Every single one of these nominees for whom the Majority \nLeader was forced to file cloture was rated unanimously well qualified \nby the nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the \nhighest possible rating. And every one of them was nominated to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy.\n  Did Republicans secretly invoke the Thurmond Rule before this year \neven started, when they departed from the Senate's traditional practice \nand would not consent to confirm 19 judicial nominees that were on the \ncalendar at the end of last year? Up until last month, we were \nconsidering nominees that could and should have been confirmed last \nyear. Given that we have only confirmed eight judicial nominees that \nwere reported by the Committee this year and only two of them circuit \ncourt nominees it seems oddly premature to declare an artificial cut-\noff of confirmations when our work this year has only just begun. Among \nthose now being blockaded are nominees waiting since March of this \nyear. So by delaying last year's nominees until May, Senate Republicans \neffectively prevented consideration of the Shwartz, Taranto and Kayatta \nnominations for months after being voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. The Senate Republican leadership is not shutting off circuit \nnominees just after June 12, they are blocking nominees ready for \nconsideration since early March of this year.\n  In 2004, a Presidential election year, the Senate confirmed five \ncircuit court nominees of a Republican President that had been reported \nby the Committee that year. This year we have confirmed only two \ncircuit court nominees that have been reported by the Committee this \nyear, and both were filibustered. By this date in 2004 the Senate had \nalready confirmed 32 of President Bush's circuit court nominees, and we \nconfirmed another three that year for a total of 35 circuit court \nnominees in his first term. So far, the Senate has only been allowed to \nconsider and confirm 30 of President Obama's circuit court nominees \nfive fewer, 17 percent fewer while higher numbers of vacancies remain, \nand yet the Senate Republican leadership wants to artificially shut off \nnominations with no good reason.\n  There is no reason that the Senate could not vote on consensus \ncircuit court nominees thoroughly vetted, considered and voted on by \nthe Judiciary Committee. There is no reason the Senate cannot vote on \nthe nomination of William Kayatta of Maine to the First Circuit, a \nnominee strongly supported by both of Maine's Republican Senators and \nreported nearly unanimously by the Committee two months ago. There is \nno reason the Senate cannot vote on the nomination of Judge Robert \nBacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, who was supported by \nSenator Coburn during Committee consideration. Senator Coburn said that \nJudge Bacharach would make a great nominee for a Republican president. \nSo why is the Republican leadership playing politics with his \nnomination?\n  There is also no reason the Senate cannot vote on Richard Taranto's \nnomination to the Federal Circuit. He was reported almost unanimously \nby voice vote nearly three months ago, and was supported by \nconservatives such as Robert Bork and Paul Clement. The Federal Circuit \nhas never been controversial before. The one circuit court nominee who \nwas reported out of Committee with a split roll call vote Judge Shwartz \nof New Jersey should not have been controversial, as seen by the \nbipartisan support she has received from New Jersey's Republican \nGovernor Chris Christie.\n  Every circuit court nominee that Senate Republicans currently refuse \nto consent to vote on have been rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by \nthe nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the \nhighest possible rating. These are not controversial nominees. They are \nqualified and should be considered as consensus nominees and confirmed. \nBy invoking the Thurmond Rule, Senate Republicans are blocking consent \nto vote on superbly qualified circuit court nominees with strong \nbipartisan support. This is a new and damaging application of the \nThurmond Rule.\n  Senate tradition has been that in Presidential election years, \nnominees receive a vote unless they do not have bipartisan support. In \nthe past five presidential election years, Senate Democrats have never \ndenied an up or down vote to any circuit court nominee of a Republican \npresident who received bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. \nIn fact, during the last 20 years, only four circuit nominees reported \nwith bipartisan support have been denied an up-or-down vote by the \nSenate and all four were nominated by President Clinton and blocked by \nSenate Republicans. While Senate Democrats have been willing to work \nwith Republican presidents to confirm circuit court nominees with \nbipartisan support, Senate Republicans have repeatedly obstructed the \nnominees of Democratic presidents. In the previous five presidential \nelection years, a total of 13 circuit court nominees have been \nconfirmed after June 1. Not surprisingly, 12 of the 13 were Republican \nnominees. Clearly, this is not tit-for-tat as some contend but, rather, \na one way street in favor of Republican presidents' nominees.\n  The precedent for this decision by Senate Republican Leadership to \nshutdown the confirmation process for well-qualified consensus nominees \nis their prior actions obstructing President Clinton's nominees. \nSenator Schumer held a Judiciary Committee hearing in May 2002 to shed \nlight on the harmful and damaging practice of stalling and obstructing \nqualified, consensus nominees that had occurred during the last years \nof the Clinton administration. Of course, there was the nomination of \nBonnie Campbell of Iowa to the Eighth\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\nCircuit. Ms. Campbell was the first woman ever elected to be Attorney \nGeneral of Iowa. She was also once named by Time Magazine as one of the \n25 most influential people in America. She served as President \nClinton's head of the Office on Violence Against Women. Despite having \nthe support of her home state Senators, Senator Grassley and Senator \nHarkin, she never received a Committee vote after her hearing.\n  How ironic that last week the junior Senator from Utah tried to claim \ncredit for progress this year by comparing confirmations to the 1996 \nsession. The Senate Republican majority that year stalled most of \nPresident Clinton's nominees and would not allow the confirmation of \nany circuit court nominees. That is not a record to be proud of but a \nrecord that led to Chief Justice Rehnquist criticizing the Senate \nRepublicans for their obstruction. This should not be a race to the \nbottom but that seems to be the intent of Senate Republicans.\n  By contrast, if we look at the last two presidential election years, \nwe will see we were able to bring the number of judicial vacancies down \nto the lowest levels in the past 20 years. In 2004 at end of President \nBush's first term, vacancies were reduced to 28 not the 75 at which \nthey are today. In 2008, in the last year of President Bush's second \nterm, we again worked to fill vacancies and got them down to 34, less \nthan half of what they are today. In 2004, 25 nominees were confirmed \nbetween June and the presidential election, and in 2008, 22 nominees \nwere confirmed between June and the presidential election.\n\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service recently released a \nreport confirming that judicial nominees continue to be confirmed in \npresidential election years, except it seems when there is a Democratic \nPresident. In five of the last eight presidential election years, the \nSenate has confirmed at least 22 circuit and district court nominees \nafter May 31. The notable exceptions were during the last years of \nPresident Clinton's two terms in 1996 and 2000 when Senate Republicans \nwould not allow confirmations to continue. Otherwise, it has been the \nrule rather than the exception. So, for example, the Senate confirmed \n32 in 1980; 28 in 1984; 31 in 1992; 28 in 2004 at the end of President \nGeorge W. Bush's first term; and 22 after May 31 in 2008 at the end of \nPresident Bush's second term.\n  We have heard lots of excuses from Senate Republicans, who have tried \nto shift the blame for the judicial vacancy crisis to the President--\nmuch as they try to blame him for the debt of European countries and \nother matters. They claim that the President has not made enough \nnominations. With last week's announcement that Senate Republicans \nrefuse to confirm any more circuit court nominees, that excuse melts \naway. There are nominees ready to be confirmed and the reason they are \nnot being considered is Republican obstruction. This is wrong. I wish \nthey would not put politics ahead of the needs of the American people.\n  The across-the-board obstruction of President Obama's nominees is not \nthe product of a Thurmond Rule to limit confirmations at the end of \npresidential election years to nominees with bipartisan support. Rather \nthis is a continuation of obstruction that began as soon as this \nPresident was elected. Senate Republicans insisted that filibusters of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees were unconstitutional, yet they \nreversed course and filibustered President Obama's very first judicial \nnomination, that of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana, a widely-respected \n15-year veteran of the Federal bench nominated to the Seventh Circuit \nand who had the support of his home state Senator, the longest-serving \nRepublican in the Senate. Senate Republicans filibustered the \nnomination of Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit \nbefore she was confirmed 99 0, and the nomination of Judge Denny Chin \nof New York to the Second Circuit was filibustered before he was \nconfirmed 98 0 after four months of needless delays.\n  At a time when judicial vacancies remained historically high for \nthree years, with 30 more vacancies and 30 fewer confirmations than at \nthis point in President Bush's first term, I would hope the Senate \nRepublican leadership would reconsider and work with us on filling \nthese longstanding judicial vacancies to help the American people. We \nhave well-qualified, consensus nominees with bipartisan support who can \nfill these vacancies. It is only partisan politics and continued \ntactics of obstruction that stand in the way.\n  Is it any wonder why Congress is so unpopular? I take no comfort in \nthe rise in the congressional approval rating--it is from 9 percent to \n17 percent. This is this kind of obstruction that turns off the \nAmerican people. Stop the senseless obstruction--whether you call it \nthe Thurmond Rule or not--and start helping the American people by \neasing the burden on them and the courts around the country.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Mary Geiger Lewis to \nfill a judicial vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nSouth Carolina. Ms. Lewis has the support of her Republican home state \nSenator Lindsey Graham. Her nomination was voted on and received \nbipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee over three months ago. I \nthank the Majority Leader for his work in securing a vote on this \nnomination.\n  Mary Lewis has worked in private practice for over 25 years at the \nlaw firm Lewis & Babcock LLP, and has tried approximately 15 cases to \nverdict or final judgment. Born in Columbia, South Carolina, she earned \nher J.D. from the University of South Carolina and served as a law \nclerk to Judge Owens Taylor Cobb in the South Carolina Judicial \nDepartment. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated Ms. Lewis ``qualified'' to serve on the district \ncourt. I support Ms. Lewis and hope she will be confirmed.\n  I also hope that Senate Republicans will reconsider their wrongheaded \nmove to shut down the confirmation of consensus, well-qualified circuit \ncourt nominees. Given our overburdened Federal courts and the need to \nprovide all Americans with prompt justice, we should all be working in \na bipartisan fashion to confirm these nominees.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate turns to another \njudicial nomination, that of Mary Geiger Lewis, to be U.S. district \njudge for the District of South Carolina. Once again, for the third \ntime this month, we have a nonconsensus nominee brought before the \nSenate. I oppose this nomination and urge all Senators to do likewise.\n  We continue to confirm the President's nominees at a brisk pace. We \nalready confirmed 149 nominees of this President to the district and \ncircuit courts. We also have confirmed two Supreme Court nominees \nduring President Obama's term.\n  For those who claim this President is being treated differently, let \nme put that in perspective for my colleagues, with an apples-to-apples \ncomparison. The last time the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court \nnominees was during President Bush's second term. During President \nBush's entire second term, the Senate confirmed a total of only 119 \ndistrict and circuit court nominees. If Ms. Lewis is confirmed today, \nwe will have confirmed 31 more district and circuit nominees for \nPresident Obama than we did for President Bush, in similar \ncircumstances.\n  During the last Presidential election year, 2008, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. With a \nconfirmation today, we will match that number. We have already \nconfirmed five circuit nominees, and this will be the 23rd district \njudge confirmed this year.\n  Some have complained about the length of time to confirm these \njudges, focusing only on one phase of the confirmation process.\n  In reality, the timeframes are comparable for nomination to \nconfirmation. For President Bush, that time frame was around 211 days; \nfor President Obama, it is 222 days.\n  We take this time for review because our inquiry of the \nqualifications of nominees must be rigorous. At the beginning of this \nCongress, I articulated my standards for judicial nominees. I want to \nensure that the men and women who are appointed to a lifetime position \nin the Federal judiciary are qualified to serve. Factors I consider \nimportant include intellectual ability, respect for the Constitution, \nfidelity to the law, personal integrity, appropriate judicial \ntemperament, and professional competence.\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\n  Last year, I became increasingly concerned about some of the judicial \nnominations being sent to the Senate. In a few individual cases, it was \nvery troublesome. The nomination of Ms. Lewis was one of those that \ngave me concern. When applying the standards I have articulated, it is \nmy judgment that Ms. Lewis falls short and should not be confirmed.\n  The Senate process for reviewing the professional qualifications, \ntemperament, background, and character is a long and thorough process. \nThese issues need to be fully examined; nominations are not just \nrubberstamped.\n  At the conclusion of that lengthy process, a substantial majority of \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee determined that this nomination \nshould not be reported to the Senate.\n  Nevertheless, we now have the nomination before us. Even so, there \nare reasons sufficient to oppose this nominee. Ms. Lewis has limited \ncourtroom experience and little criminal law experience. Her responses \nin her questionnaire and hearing regarding her legal experience \nindicated her significant cases were handled more than 10 years ago and \nwas more of a team effort than individual experience. At her hearing \nshe was not prepared to discuss the legal principles involved in a case \nher firm took to the Supreme Court. For these reasons and others, I \nwill vote nay on this nomination and urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask that all time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Mary Geiger Lewis, of South Carolina, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of South Carolina?\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I rise today to speak \nabout the Electronic Systems Center at Hanscom Air Force Base in \nMassachusetts and its role in our Nation's cybersecurity.\n  I want to clarify a situation we face as a nation. First, the \nSecretary of Defense has said loudly and clearly that the threat of \ncyber attacks on our country and the need for America to develop strong \nmilitary capabilities keeps him up at night, and it keeps me and many \nother people up as well. We read about the cyber attacks by the \nChinese, and we read about Iran. The Secretary has described it as an \nevolving and urgent threat in our future. Our Nation's security depends \non winning the battle in cyberspace.\n  Unfortunately, the Air Force is in the midst of a four-structure \nchange that ignores the crucial facts I have just stated. At a time \nwhen cyber threats are growing more important each day, the Air Force \nis making questionable decisions that, in my opinion, create an \nunnecessary risk to our Nation's cyber defenses and our ability to deal \nwith those very threats. It makes absolutely no sense at this point in \ntime.\n  That is why just a few weeks ago the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittee took strong action to prevent what the entire Massachusetts \ndelegation believed was a premature proposal by the Air Force to reduce \nHanscom's leadership from a three-star general to a two-star general.\n  The elimination of the ESC commander position at Hanscom will \ndiminish our cyber capabilities and focus across the entire force, and \nthat is not good at this point in time. That is the last thing we need \nin the midst of a cyber attack.\n  In response, Representative Tsongas of Massachusetts inserted a \nprovision in this year's National Defense Authorization Act that was \npassed by the full House of Representatives which required the \nSecretary of the Air Force to remain and retain core functions at \nHanscom as they existed on November 1, 2011. Her language was aimed at \nretaining Hanscom's three-star leadership.\n  Similarly, I worked with Senator Lieberman and our Senate Armed \nServices Committee to include language in the Senate Armed Services \nmarkup reported version of the Defense authorization bill that directs \nthe Air Force to keep in place the current leadership rank structure \nuntil the two defense committees have had an opportunity to review the \nrecommendations of the National Commission on the Structure of the Air \nForce.\n  Given Secretary Panetta's warning, I believe we must pay particular \nattention to any changes that relate to cybersecurity. The \nMassachusetts delegation has been united in declaring that both \nHanscom's mission and the senior leadership should be preserved in \norder to bring forth the best cyber capabilities our country has to \noffer.\n  Both defense committees have spoken with one voice to the Air Force: \nStand down with this change until both committees receive more \ninformation about how the proposed force structure changes will impact \nour cybersecurity.\n  I also wish to explain why the delegation feels so strongly about \nthis. Massachusetts has been a national security and information \ntechnology leader for many decades. Groundbreaking innovation in \ncybersecurity is taking place in\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\nMassachusetts as we speak--perhaps more than any other State in our \nentire Nation. That innovation is happening at Hanscom, at universities \nsuch as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in our defense \nsector. Our capabilities are second to none.\n  The Electronic Systems Center at Hanscom has unlimited potential to \ntake on future missions and future threats in the realm of \ncybersecurity. The Air Force and the MIT Lincoln Lab are now upgrading \ntheir partnership to enhance our Nation's ability to meet key and \ngrowing cyber requirements. The Department of Defense and the Air Force \ncontinue to depend on Hanscom's unmatched cyber expertise.\n  To ensure our Nation's crucial cyber defense, I say again very firmly \ntoday that the Air Force must preserve the senior three-star leadership \nin Massachusetts. Doesn't it make sense for our military's cyber \nleadership, expertise, and talent to be based in a location where some \nof the world's most leading research and technological development is \nactually taking place? Placing Hanscom's cyber team under a chain of \ncommand with a 3-star general in another State with a number of other \nAir Force responsibilities diminishes our Nation's ability to deliver \ncritical cyber tools and resources and impacts our ability to respond \nto the ever-growing cyber threat.\n  Congress has spoken in a bipartisan and bicameral way. We have stated \nour position clearly. The Air Force should not move forward with any \nforce structure changes at Hanscom until Congress has had an \nopportunity to review what our appropriate force structure mix should \nbe, particularly as it relates to cybersecurity. We absolutely, \npositively must be ready to meet this next-generation threat--the one \nthat keeps Secretary Panetta up at night. I will continue to fight to \nmake sure we are prepared.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nas in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise today in support of a \nresolution I am cosponsoring to commemorate Juneteenth Independence \nDay.\n  In just 2 weeks, Americans will gather, of course, as we know, to \ncelebrate the Fourth of July, but it is important to remember that when \nour Nation gained its independence, there were some 450,000 enslaved \npeople in the 13 States. It wasn't until June 19, 1865, more than 2 \nyears after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, \nwhich liberated a limited number of people, that enslaved people in the \nSouthwestern States finally learned of their freedom.\n  Months after the 13th amendment was ratified, Army MG Gordon Granger \nand Federal troops arrived in Galveston, TX, to enforce emancipation. \nSince then, Americans in Texas and throughout the United States have \ncelebrated Juneteenth, which is the oldest known celebration of the end \nof slavery in our country.\n  To celebrate that day, people from all backgrounds--not only African \nAmericans and not only descendants of slaves but people of all \nbackgrounds and ethnicities--will gather in special places all over \nOhio. They will gather at Franklin Park in Columbus, our State capital. \nThey will gather at ``The Coming of Emancipation'' memorial service in \nOberlin, just a few miles from my house, the site of visits from Martin \nLuther King and the site of the Underground Railroad where those \nescaping slavery were housed on their way to Canada. Ohioans will \nreflect in Westwood Cemetery in Oberlin, where former slaves and famous \nabolitionists are buried. At Cincinnati's Juneteenth Festival in Eden \nPark, families and visitors will gather on one of the hilltops \noverlooking the Ohio River, which slaves saw while coming from Kentucky \ninto freedom as they crossed the river into the North. They will \nremember the perilous journey to freedom that many made at the banks of \nthat river. In Wilberforce, an African-American school--a university in \nsouthwest Ohio--and Zanesville, in Newcomerstown and Cleveland, Ohioans \nwill hold ceremonies of remembrance and celebration.\n  On Juneteenth Independence Day, especially, we have yet another \nopportunity to celebrate our great Democratic traditions--our American \ningenuity, innovation, and imagination. We celebrate the rich heritage \nand vibrant culture of all Americans who are descendants of enslaved \npeople on American soil. We celebrate the ingenuity of Ohioans such as \nColumbus native Granville T. Woods, who invented the telegraph device \nthat sent messages from moving trains and train stations. We celebrate \nthe innovation of Ohioans such as Garrett Morgan, a Clevelander who \ninvented the traffic light. We celebrate the imagination and wisdom of \nOhioans such as Nobel Prize-winning and recent Presidential Medal of \nFreedom honoree Toni Morrison of Lorain, OH.\n  In America, progress is never promised, but through the work of \ndedicated citizens, we move closer to being the Nation our Framers \nenvisioned. We can work together toward achieving a more perfect union, \nwhere justice isn't limited to the powerful but is also accessible to \nthe people.\n  Today I am proud to commemorate Juneteenth Independence Day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Utility MACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, as we know, the Senate will take a vote \nthis week on the CRA that I have offered concerning Utility MACT. \nUtility MACT is a requirement. MACT, of course--M A C T--means maximum \nachievable controlled technology. One of the problems with the \noverregulation we have with a lot of these emissions is that there is \nno technology to accommodate this. In the case of Utility MACT, I think \neveryone understands now that this is an effort to kill coal. I know \nthere are a lot of reasons people have, but recently some things have \nhappened, and I thought I would mention them as we look toward this \nbill. It looks as though it is going to be on Wednesday. It looks as if \nthere will be some speaking time on Tuesday, and on Wednesday we will \nactually have the vote.\n  As we all know, a CRA is an effort for elected officials to reflect \nupon overregulation and to stop a regulation. After all, we are the \nones who are accountable to the people and not the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  The breaking news is that President Obama just issued a statement \nthis afternoon that he will veto my resolution if it passes. Just \nbefore that announcement from the White House this afternoon, \nRepresentatives Ed Markey and Henry Waxman came out fighting with a new \nreport detailing what Representative Waxman has called the most anti-\nenvironmental House of Representatives in history. I wish to remind my \nDemocratic friends that 19 House Democrats supported the companion \nlegislation in the House--the same thing we will be voting on here. \nDemocrats and many of the labor unions have sent letters in support of \nmy resolution, so it is not just Republicans whose constituents are \nfeeling the pain of the EPA's regulations.\n\n  To my Democratic friends in the House, I beg to differ--it is not \nthat this Congress is anti-environmental; it is that the EPA is the \nmost radical EPA in history, aggressive to the point that even the \nleft-leaning Washington Post has called out the Agency for ``earning a \nreputation for abuse.'' Of course, this is the same EPA whose top \nofficials have told us they are out to crucify the American energy \nproducers.\n  We all remember the sixth area of the EPA, when Mr. Armendariz came \nout and made this statement to some of his supporters: We need to do \nthe same thing the Romans did. We remember back in the old days when \nthey were going around the Mediterranean and they would go into the \ntowns in Turkey and they would crucify the first five people they would \nsee. That gets them under their control.\n  He said: That is what we have to do.\n  He said: That is going to be our operation.\n  Well, we went through that, and of course he is no longer there.\n  Over the course of President Obama's Presidency, whatever they could \nnot\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\nachieve through legislation they have tried to achieve through \naggressive, onerous EPA regulations. They tried first of all to do it \nthrough legislation. Remember the cap-and-trade legislation--they tried \nfor 10 years to get that done. Finally, each year they brought it up, \nmore and more people in this body, the U.S. Senate, were opposed to a \ncap-and-trade system to do away with greenhouse gases and to put \nregulations on them. Well, every time a vote comes up, there is a \nlarger majority opposed to it because the people of this country are \nconcerned about the economy and the fact that this would be very \ncostly. It was President Obama who said that with the cap-and-trade \nregulations, it would be very expensive.\n  Now, when they couldn't pass the Clean Water Restoration Act, the \nsame thing happened. Remember, that was introduced by Senator Feingold \nfrom Wisconsin and by Representative Oberstar in the House. And not \nonly did they defeat overwhelmingly the Clean Water Restoration Act, \nbut the two individuals who were the sponsors in the House and the \nSenate were both defeated in the next election.\n  So just how radical is President Obama on environmental issues? By \nimposing these backdoor global warming cap-and-trade regulations \nthrough the EPA, President Obama is fulfilling his campaign promise \nthat energy prices would necessarily skyrocket--his words. By vetoing \nthe Keystone Pipeline, he gave the far left what one of his supporters \ncalled the biggest global warming victory in years. By finalizing the \nmost expensive EPA rule in history, he is making good on his campaign \npromise that if anybody wants to build a coal-fired powerplant, they \ncan; it is just that it will bankrupt them. And he succeeded in \nthrowing hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars out the window on \ncompanies such as Solyndra, which he said would lead us to a brighter \nand more prosperous future.\n  But President Obama is not running on this record of accomplishments. \nWhy? Because Americans are worse off, not better off, for it. They are \nout of work, and they are struggling to make ends meet under the pain \nof regulations that cause their energy prices to skyrocket. So he is \nrunning as far away from that radical record as possible.\n  So what are we trying to do in the Senate by stopping Utility MACT? \nWe are trying to prevent the President from achieving another aspect of \nhis radical global warming agenda and hopefully restore some sanity and \nbalance to this out-of-control regulatory regime.\n  I think everyone in this body can agree that we all share a \ncommitment to improving air quality, that it should be done in a way \nthat doesn't harm jobs and the economy and cause electricity prices to \nskyrocket on every American or do away with one of the most reliable, \nabundant, affordable energy resources--coal. We have to keep in mind \nthat right now, in order to run this machine called America, 50 percent \nof it is actually being done on coal.\n  I wish to address the public health debate which has long been the \nexcuse for those in this administration who simply want to kill coal. \nIt was certainly the excuse President Obama used today to defend his \ndecision to veto my resolution. Let's be clear about one thing from the \noutset: If the effort behind Utility MACT were really about public \nhealth, then my Democratic colleagues would have joined our efforts way \nback in 2005 and passed the Clear Skies bill--a bill that would have \nput a plan in place to achieve a 70-percent reduction in mercury \nemissions--but they didn't. We all remember why. We wanted to include \nin this bill SoX, NoX, and mercury--the real \npollutants--a mandatory 70-percent reduction, and they said we can't do \nit because we don't also have CO2 anthropogenic gases that \nare covered by this bill. So it was held hostage, and consequently we \nweren't able to get it passed.\n  I can remember President Obama said:\n\n       I voted against the Clear Skies bill. In fact, I was the \n     deciding vote despite the fact that I'm a coal State and that \n     half of my State thought I'd thoroughly betrayed them because \n     I thought clean air was critical and global warming was \n     critical.\n\n  At an Environment and Public Works hearing in April of this year, \nSenator Barrasso asked Brenda Archambo from the National Wildlife \nFederation if the American people would have been better off if the \nSenate had passed the Clear Skies bill back in 2005, and her answer was \n``absolutely.'' Of course, the National Wildlife Federation was not \nhappy that we were calling attention to Ms. Archambo's admission, so \nover the weekend they accused my staff of twisting her words. My staff \ndid nothing of the sort. Not only did Ms. Archambo say that mercury \nreductions in 2005 would absolutely have made Americans better off, she \nreiterated that same point later when Senator Barrasso asked her again, \n``It would have been better if they had done it in 2005?'' Ms. Archambo \nreplied, ``Sure.'' The entire exchange from the hearing has been posted \non our EPW Web site for anyone who wants to see exactly what was said.\n  I do not think it gets any clearer than that. Commonsense reductions \nearlier would have made us better off. That was 2005 when we would have \nhad these reductions, mandatory reductions, in a very short period of \ntime; and that time is more than 50 percent expired at this time.\n  In a National Wildlife Federation blog accusing me of twisting Ms. \nArchambo's words, the author says:\n\n       An odd part of Sen. Inhofe's attack: He's essentially \n     saying a 70% reduction in mercury emissions would've been \n     just dandy, but the 91% reduction proposed by the EPA would \n     destroy the economy. Is that really such a huge difference? \n     Or is he just playing politics with public health?\n\n  That is a good question: What is the difference between Clear Skies \nand Utility MACT? It is very simple. Clear Skies would have reduced \nemissions dramatically--by 70 percent--now we are talking about \nreducing emissions on SOX, NOX, and mercury--but \nit would have done it without threatening to kill coal and the millions \nof jobs that coal sustains.\n  On the other hand, Utility MACT is specifically designed to kill \ncoal. It makes no effort whatsoever to balance environmental protection \nand economic growth.\n  Now who is playing politics with public health? If public health were \nthe priority, why did President Obama and his fellow Democrats vote \nagainst a 70-percent reduction way back in 2005?\n  What is this effort about? It is about one thing: killing coal. And \nkilling coal is the centerpiece of their radical global warming agenda. \nRemember then-Senator Obama said that he voted against the health \nbenefits in Clear Skies because he thought ``global warming was \ncritical.'' In other words, global warming was more important than any \nof the considerations regarding health. And these are real pollutants: \nSOX, NOX, and mercury.\n  Importantly, the Senate will take this vote on my resolution just as \nthe world leaders are gathering in Rio de Janeiro. Right now they are \ndown there gathering at the Rio + 20 Sustainable Development \nConference.\n  Let's remember what happened 20 years ago. In 1992, that was the \nconference in Rio where they all got together, and they were going to \nbe doing all these things on anthropogenic gases and all of that. \nPresident Obama, who is now busy pretending to be a fossil fuel \nPresident to garner votes, will not be attending. But he is sending his \n``green team'' to negotiate on his behalf.\n  What is this conference about? As Fox News reported back in April:\n\n       The main goal of the much-touted, Rio + 20 United Nations \n     Conference on Sustainable Development . . . is to make \n     dramatic and enormously expensive changes in the way that the \n     world does nearly everything--or, as one of the documents \n     puts it, ``a fundamental shift in the way we think and act.''\n\n  Utility MACT is a huge part of this effort to change the way we live \nand to spread the wealth around, and that is what they are talking \nabout down there. We have started invoking a new tax system.\n  U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon proposes how sustainable \ndevelopment challenges ``can and must be addressed.'' He included--now \nI am quoting him--more than $2.1 trillion a year in wealth transfers \nfrom rich countries to poorer countries, in the name of fostering \n``green infrastructure,'' ``climate adaptation,'' and other ``green \neconomy'' measures.\n  He is advocating for new carbon taxes--that is on us--for \nindustrialized\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\ncountries that could cost about $250 billion a year or 0.6 percent of \ngross domestic product by 2020. Other environmental taxes are mentioned \nbut not specified.\n  Also included are further unspecified price hikes that extend beyond \nfossil fuels to anything derived from agriculture, fisheries, forestry, \nor other kinds of land and water use, all of which would be radically \nreorganized. These cost changes would ``contribute to a more level \nplaying field between the established, `brown' technologies and newer, \ngreener ones.''\n  He has advocated for major global social spending programs, including \na ``social protection floor'' and ``social safety nets'' for the \nworld's most vulnerable social groups for reasons of ``equity.''\n  It is all talking about more higher taxes on the developed world to \ngo to the benefit of the underdeveloped world. This is the same thing \nthey were talking about 20 years ago.\n  I think it is very timely that this is happening today. It is \nhappening at the very moment we will be voting on Wednesday as to \nwhether to kill coal. By the way, this is the only vote that will be \ntaken this year or probably ever to ultimately kill coal. Once this is \npassed, then, of course, the contracts are all broken and we have to \nfigure out: What are we going to do in this country? If you kill coal, \nhow do we run this machine called America? The answer to that question \nis, you cannot do it.\n  So it is very important, and I do not think there is any doubt in \nanyone's mind that the real purpose of the vote that will take place on \nWednesday is to kill coal in America. And America cannot provide the \nnecessary energy to run its machine and be competitive without coal. So \nit is a critical vote, and it is one that I think people are aware of \nthat is going to be taking place.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, more than two centuries ago, in the \nDeclaration of Independence, our Founding Fathers wrote that ``all men \nare created equal.'' America has sometimes fallen short of that ideal, \nbut the history of our country has been a slow march toward equality \nfor all.\n  We have seen Presidents play a key role in expanding freedom and \nequality. Who can forget Harry Truman's desegregation of the military, \nwhich set the stage for a Supreme Court decision and a civil rights era \nthat has literally changed the face of America?\n  Last Friday was another case in point. President Barack Obama \ndeclared that his administration will no longer deport immigrant \nstudents who grew up in America. This action will give these young \nimmigrants the chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the \nonly country they have ever called home. With that decisive executive \ndecision, America took another step toward fulfilling the Founders' \npromise of justice for all.\n  It has been 11 years--11 years--since I first introduced the DREAM \nAct--legislation that would allow a select group of immigrant students \nwith real potential to contribute more fully to America.\n  The DREAM Act would give these students a chance to earn citizenship \nif they came to the United States as children, they have been long-term \nU.S. residents, they have good moral character, graduate from high \nschool, and either complete 2 years of military service or 2 years of \ncollege.\n  The DREAM Act has a history of broad bipartisan support. When I first \nintroduced it, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican from Utah, was my lead \ncosponsor. In fact, we had kind of a head to head--who was going to be \nthe first name: Hatch or Durbin? Since the Republicans were in the \nmajority, I bowed toward Senator Hatch.\n  In 2006--when Republicans last controlled this Congress--the DREAM \nAct passed the Senate as part of comprehensive immigration reform on a \n62-to-36 vote, with 23 Republicans voting for the DREAM Act. \nUnfortunately, the Republican leaders in the House refused to even \nconsider the bill.\n  Republican support for the DREAM Act, unfortunately, has been \ndiminishing over the years. The last time the DREAM Act was considered \nin Congress, the bill passed the House under the leadership of \nCongressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and received a strong majority \nvote in the Senate. But only eight Republican House Members and three \nRepublican Senators voted for the bill. What a change in such a short \nperiod of time.\n  Let's be clear: The only reason the DREAM Act is not the law of the \nland of America is because we consistently face a Republican filibuster \nwhenever we bring up this bill.\n  The vast majority of Democrats continue to support the DREAM Act, but \nthe reality is it cannot pass without support from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. That is why I have always said I am open to \nsitting down with anyone, Republican or Democrat, who is interested in \nworking in good faith to solve this problem.\n  I am personally committed to passing the DREAM Act, no matter how \nlong it takes. But the young people who would be eligible for the DREAM \nAct cannot wait any longer for Congress to act. Many have been deported \nfrom the only country they have ever known: America. They have been \nsent off to countries they do not remember with languages they do not \nspeak.\n  Those who are still here are growing older. And when they graduate \nfrom college, they are stuck, unable to work, unable to contribute to \nthe only country they know.\n  That is why President Obama, using his Presidential authority, did \nsuch an important thing to help these immigrant students. The President \ngranted them a form of relief known as ``deferred action,'' which puts \na hold on their deportation and allows them, on a temporary, renewable \nbasis, to live and work legally in America.\n  That was the right thing to do. These students grew up here pledging \nallegiance to our flag and singing the only national anthem they know. \nThey are Americans in their heart and in their mind. They did not make \nthe decision to come to this country; their parents did.\n  As Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said last Friday, \nimmigrants who were brought here illegally as children ``lacked [any] \nintent to violate the law.'' And it is not the American way to punish \nchildren for their parents' actions. We do not do that in any aspect of \nthe law in this country. Why would we do it here?\n  There will always be critics when the President uses his power, as he \ndid last Friday. In fact, some Members of Congress attacked President \nTruman when he ordered the desegregation of America's military. They \nsaid Truman's order would hurt the military. Many even claimed Truman \nhad performed an illegal act as President.\n  Today, many of the naysayers in this generation claim that halting \nthe deportation of DREAM Act students will hurt the economy and that it \ntoo may be illegal. President Truman's critics were wrong, and so are \nPresident Obama's.\n  President Obama's new deportation policy will make America a stronger \nnation by giving these talented immigrants the chance to contribute \nmore fully to our economy.\n  Studies show these young people could contribute literally trillions \nof dollars to the American economy during their working lives. They are \nthe doctors, engineers, teachers, and soldiers who will make us a \nstronger nation. Why would we waste that talent? They have been \neducated and trained in the United States. We have invested in these \npeople. Let us at least see the fruits of this investment, the benefits \nthat can come to America.\n  Let's be clear. What the Obama administration has done in \nestablishing this new process for prioritizing deportations is \nperfectly appropriate and legal. Throughout our history, the government \nhas decided whom to prosecute, and whom not to prosecute based on law \nenforcement priorities and available resources.\n  The Supreme Court has held this:\n\n       An agency's decision not to prosecute . . . is a decision \n     generally committed to an agency's absolute discretion.\n\n  President Obama granted deferred action--to use the technical term--\nto\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nDREAM Act students. Past administrations, both Democratic and \nRepublican, have used deferred action to stop deportation of low-\npriority cases.\n  Last month, 90 immigration law professors sent a letter to the \nPresident arguing that the executive branch has ``clear executive \nauthority'' to grant deferred action to DREAM Act students. The letter \nexplains that the executive branch has granted deferred action since at \nleast 1971 and that Federal courts have recognized this authority since \nat least the mid-1970s. These immigration experts have also noted there \nare a number of precedents for granting deferred action to groups of \nindividuals such as DREAM Act students.\n  The President's action is not just legal, it is also a smart and \nrealistic approach to enforcing our immigration laws. Today, there are \nmillions of undocumented immigrants in the United States, and it would \nliterally take billions of dollars to deport them.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has to set priorities about which \npeople to deport and which not to deport.\n  The Obama administration has established a deportation policy that \nmakes it a high priority to deport those who have committed serious \ncrimes or are a threat to public safety. I totally support that \napproach. President Obama has said we will not use our limited \nresources to deport DREAM Act students.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues have claimed this is a sort of \nbackdoor amnesty. That isn't even close to being true. This is simply a \ndecision to focus limited government resources on serious criminals and \nother public safety threats. DREAM Act students will not receive \npermanent legal status or citizenship under the President's order.\n  This policy has strong bipartisan support in Congress. I wish to say \na special word about a colleague. Two years ago, Indiana Republican \nSenator Richard Lugar joined me--crossing the aisle--to ask the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to grant this deferred action. I called \nhim on Friday and said: Dick, I just want to tell you how much I \nrespect you. It took us 2 years, but we got it done.\n  He was the only Senator from the other side of the aisle with the \ncourage to step up and join me in that letter. He may have paid a price \nfor it, though he denied it in the phone conversation. I cannot tell \nyou how much I respect that man for his courage in asking for this.\n  It took 2 years, but those students who are appreciative of the \nPresident's action should not forget the singular courage of the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Last year, when Senator Lugar and I sent a renewed request, 21 \nSenators joined us, including majority leader Harry Reid, Judiciary \nCommittee chairman Patrick Leahy, and, of course, Senator Bob Menendez, \nwho heads up the Hispanic Caucus in the Senate.\n  It is easy to criticize the President's new deportation policy when \nit is an abstract debate and we are talking about constitutional legal \nauthority and deferred action and so forth.\n  I think what has brought this debate to where it stands today are the \nreal stories, the stories of these young people. I have tried almost \nevery week to come to the floor to tell a DREAM Act story. Today, I \nwish to tell one more.\n  This is a photo of Manny Bartsch, who was born in Germany. He was \nabused and neglected by his parents, so his grandmother became his \nguardian. After Manny's grandfather passed away, his grandmother \nmarried an American soldier. When Manny was 7 years old, sadly, his \ngrandmother was tragically killed by a drunk driver. His step-\ngrandfather decided to return to America, and he brought Manny with \nhim. They moved to Gilboa, a small town in northwestern Ohio.\n  Unfortunately, Manny's step-grandfather, wanting to protect him, \nfailed to file any papers for Manny to become a U.S. citizen. But Manny \ngrew up in Ohio, where he went to elementary school and high school. \nWhen Manny was preparing to apply for college, he learned he didn't \nhave any legal status in America.\n  Manny wanted to do the right thing, so he made an appointment with \nImmigration Services to clear up things. When he showed up for his \nappointment, Manny was arrested and detained. He was 17 years old.\n  Here is what Manny said about the prospect of being deported to \nGermany, a country he left as a little boy:\n\n       I don't know anybody over there. This is my home. This is \n     where everybody I know lives, and to have to think about \n     leaving, I just wouldn't be able to imagine it.\n\n  Manny's friends and family rallied behind him, asking for his \ndeportation to be at least temporarily suspended. Thanks to the \ncommunity support, he was ultimately allowed to stay. He went on to \ncollege at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, OH.\n  Last month, Manny graduated with a major in political science and a \nminor in history. He was president of his fraternity and has been \nactive in community service. For instance, for the last 4 years, he has \norganized a fundraiser to purchase Christmas presents for children with \ncancer at the Cleveland Clinic.\n  Here is what Manny says about his future:\n\n       I would go through any channel I have to to correct this \n     situation. I'm not asking for citizenship [but] I would love \n     to earn it if that possibility would arise. . . . I would \nlove to contribute to this country, give back to it. I just don't \nunderstand why they would educate people in my situation and deport \nthem back and let countries reap the benefits of the education system \nhere.\n\n  David Hogan is the chairman of the History Department at Heidelberg \nUniversity. He says this about Manny:\n\n       We want good people in this country. We want honest, hard-\n     working people, and that's Manny pure and simple. [He is] in \n     the top two percent [of students] in terms of brilliance, \n     work ethic, personal qualities.\n\n  Thanks to President Obama's executive order last Friday, Manny \nBartsch and other DREAM Act students will continue to be able to live \nand work legally in America.\n  I ask the critics of that policy this: Would we be better off if we \ndeported Manny back to Germany, a country he left when he was a little \nboy? Of course not.\n  Manny grew up in America. He doesn't have any criminal background. He \nis no threat to our country. He will make America stronger if we just \ngive him a chance.\n  Manny isn't just one example. There are a lot more--literally \nhundreds, if not thousands, of others just like him.\n  When the history of civil rights in this century--the 21st century--\nis written, President Obama's decision to grant deferred action to \nDREAM Act students will be a key chapter.\n  But It is also clear this is only a temporary solution. It doesn't \nabsolve Congress--the Senate and the House--from tackling this \ndifficult but critically important issue. It is a matter of justice as \nwell as for the future of our economy. This is still our burden and \nresponsibility. It was 2 years ago when I sent this letter with Senator \nLugar. I am grateful there was a President who read it and listened and \nhad the courage to act. His courage in standing for these young people \nwill make us a better nation, and, equally important, it will bend that \narc toward justice again.\n  At the end of the day, these young people will make the case for why \nthis was the right thing to do. I have no doubt in my mind that when \nthe balance sheet comes in on these DREAM Act students, we are going to \nsay thank goodness we did this. I personally salute the President for \nhis leadership. This was a historic and humanitarian moment. It has \nchanged the debate in America about immigration and has given these \nyoung people a chance.\n  I called one of those students on Friday, Gabby Pacheco. She is the \nbest. She walked from Florida to Washington to dramatize the DREAM Act. \nShe came out publicly and said: I am undocumented, and I will stand for \nthose in a similar situation. She was crying on the phone. She just \nheard about it. She said: I am afraid these students will come forward \nand admit they are undocumented and someday some Congress and some \nPresident will use it against them and deport them. I said: Gabby, I \ndon't think so. Once they stand and say we are going to follow the law \nand do what we are told to do and put our names down and tell you who \nwe are, anybody who tries to use that against them is going to cause a \nterrific backlash across America. People in America will respect these \nyoung people and realize we will be a better nation because of it.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as we are waiting for wrap-up this \nevening, I wish to take a moment to thank all our colleagues for the \nextraordinary effort to get to this point where we are going to be able \nto come together, debate a number of different issues related to the \nfarm bill and other issues as well, and be able to come to a final vote \nand passage of the farm bill.\n  I wish to thank, first of all, Senator Reid for his extraordinary \npatience and talent in working with Senator Roberts and me and all the \nstaff, all the leadership staff, who have worked with us on this.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Roberts for being a tremendous partner \nwith me, and both our staffs who are doing yeoman's work.\n  There is a lot more work to do. We have a lot of amendments we will \nbegin tomorrow, I believe tomorrow afternoon, and then we will work on \nthrough the week to get this done.\n  But this really is an example of the Senate coming together to agree \nto get things done--people of different backgrounds, ideas, and \ndifferent regions of the country. This is an opportunity for us to show \nthat the Senate can work together--which is what we are doing right \nnow, on a bipartisan basis--and be able to move forward on a very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  This bill is a jobs bill. This bill represents 16 million people in \nthe country who work because of agriculture in some way. We have had a \nlot of jobs bills in front of us. I am not sure there has been one that \nhas directly affected 16 million jobs like this does.\n  We also have an opportunity in this bill to come together and clearly \nstate that we are serious about deficit reduction. We are the only \nauthorizing committee that has come forward in a bipartisan way with a \nbill that cuts the spending within our jurisdiction--$23 billion in \ndeficit reduction. We have gone through every part of this bill, and we \nhave literally analyzed every page and determined that there were some \nprograms that were duplications or not effective or didn't make any \nsense anymore, and we ended up with about 100 different programs and \nauthorizations that we eliminated from those items under USDA's \njurisdiction. So this really is a reform bill.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is a real champion of reform and of \nagriculture. We have worked together, certainly, on fruits and \nvegetables and organic farming and local food systems and a whole range \nof things that we have improved upon in this bill. I thank the Chair \nfor his continued leadership on those issues.\n  This really is an opportunity to come together around deficit \nreduction, around reform, to focus on jobs and give our farmers and \nranchers predictability in terms of knowing what will happen going \nforward as they make business decisions for themselves.\n  It is a huge opportunity around conservation. I think most people \nwouldn't realize at first blush that the farm bill is actually the \nlargest investment we as Americans make in land and water conservation, \nair quality, related to working lands. Seventy percent of our lands are \nprivately held lands in some way--farmers and others, landholders--and \nthe conservation title affects how we work with them to be able to \nconserve our land and water and address the air quality issues. We have \nhad two successes there. So this is a real opportunity to build on that \ncertainly for many regions in the country, such as my own Great Lakes \nregion. It is critical in working with our farmers who have a number of \ndifferent environmental issues to address. On behalf of all of us, this \ngives us an opportunity to partner with them and deal with soil erosion \nand water quality issues and runoff into our lakes and streams and \nGreat Lakes and deal with open spaces, protecting wildlife habitat and \nwetlands, and creating a new easement program that will address urban \nsprawl so that we are protecting our lands.\n  I am very proud of what we have done in conservation. We have taken \nit from 23 programs down to 13 and divided it into 4 topics--a lot of \nflexibility, locally led, with farmers and ranchers working with local \ncommunities. We have saved money, but at the same time we are actually \nstrengthening conservation, which is why we have I think 643 different \nconservation and environmental groups\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\nsupporting what we are doing in terms of our approach on conservation. \nI am pleased with that.\n  The rural development provisions of this bill affect every community \noutside of our urban areas. The majority of Michigan--we see support \nthrough financing for water and sewer projects, small businesses, \nhousing, working with local law enforcement, police and firefighters, \nlocal mayors and city council people, counties all across Michigan and \nthe country, certainly in Oregon, where rural development funding and \nsupport for quality of life and jobs and rural communities is very much \na part of the bill.\n  We think of the bill in terms of production agriculture. Obviously, \nit is critical. I don't know any business that has more risk than a \nfarmer or rancher--nobody. So we all have a stake. We have the safest, \nmost affordable, dependable food supply in the world. We wanted to make \nsure no farmer loses a farm because of a few days of bad weather. What \nwe do in production agriculture is very important.\n  We also have a broad role, together with rural communities, with \nranchers and farmers, to support our land and our water and our habitat \nand our air. We do that through conservation. We have rural \ndevelopment. We have an energy title that allows us to take what we \ndo--the byproducts from agriculture, whether that be food or animal \nwaste or biomass from forests or corn or wheat or soybean oil--whatever \nit is--to be able to create jobs through bio-based manufacturing, \nadvanced biofuels, going beyond corn to other kinds of advanced \ncellulosic biofuels, which is very much a part of the bill, all of \nwhich creates jobs.\n  We are creating jobs in a multitude of ways in the bill. We are also \nsupporting families who, because of no fault of their own in this \nrecession, have been hit so hard and need temporary food help. That is \nalso a very big and important part of the bill. For the people in my \nState who have been hit very hard in the last number of years, it is \nimportant that we be there. They have paid taxes all their lives and \nsupported their neighbors. They have been there for other people. Now, \nif they need some temporary help, we need to make sure it is there for \nthem as well. That is a very important part of the bill also.\n\n  In addition, we see a whole range of efforts around local food \nsystems that also create jobs--farmers markets, children's schools \nbeing able to get fresh fruits and vegetables, schools being able to \npurchase locally, things that we can do to support families to put \nhealthy food on the table for their children or make sure it is \navailable in school--very important efforts going on there. We make \nsure that all of agriculture is included in our local food systems. \nThat is a very important part of the bill.\n  This is a large effort. We do it every 5 years. It takes a tremendous \namount of work. Every region of the country has a different view and \ndifferent crops that they grow and different perspectives, so it is a \nlot of hard work to bring it all together.\n  This evening we have been able to come together on a path to final \npassage, agreeing to the list of amendments. This is a democracy. I \ndon't agree or support all of those amendments. I know other colleagues \ndon't as well. We will talk about them and debate, and we will vote. \nThat is the Senate at its best. That is what we are doing here by \nagreeing to a process or list of amendments from every part of the \ncountry.\n  Members on both sides have very strongly held beliefs. We respect \nthat. We respect their right to be able to debate those amendments, and \nI also thank those for the amendments that will not be brought up, \nwhich were not in the unanimous consent agreement. I think we had about \n300 amendments when we started. We knew it was not possible to be able \nto vote on every one of those. So colleagues' willingness to work with \nus was important, and I am grateful to the people who worked with us on \nboth sides of the aisle and those whom we will continue to work with.\n  This is another step in the process, as we have put together a bill \nthat we reported out of committee with a strong bipartisan vote. Now we \nhave brought it to the floor with a large majority. Ninety out of 100 \ncolleagues came together to say: Yes, we should debate and discuss and \nwork on this Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act.\n  Now, with the agreement we have, Members are saying: Yes, we should \ngo forward and work on these amendments and have a final vote. In the \ndemocratic process, people of good will are willing to come together \nand have the opportunity to debate and vote. That is what it is about. \nI am grateful that colleagues were willing to work with us to be able \nto do that.\n  We are waiting for the final wrap-up comments. At this moment, I \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Agreement--S.J. Res. 37\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, Chris Bern retires on July 14 as \npresident of the Iowa State Education Association after completing his \nsecond two-year term in that position. Chris is a longtime advocate for \nquality education within ISEA and is an important voice for teachers at \nthe local, State, and national levels. I have valued Chris's views on a \nvariety of education issues.\n  I am especially grateful to Chris for his leadership on anti-\nharassment and anti-bullying issues within the Iowa State Education \nAssociation and the National Education Association. Chris understood \nthe importance of anti-bullying efforts before recent events drew \nnational attention to the topic. Chris is a certified trainer for the \nNEA's program on school safety and anti-harassment issues. One of his \nleadership priorities at ISEA has been to promote anti-bullying \nawareness in our schools, traveling to locals around the State to talk \nabout how to protect students from mistreatment by their peers.\n  After graduation from Buena Vista College, Chris started his teaching \ncareer as a junior high school math teacher in Woodbine, IA and then \nmoved to Knoxville, IA, where he taught high school math. He soon \nbecame involved in the Iowa State Education Association, serving in a \nvariety of local, State and national roles. Chris spent 11 years on \nvarious committees, including the ISEA Resolutions and\n\n[[Page S4237]]\n\nNew Business Committee.

Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the town of \nHosmer, SD. Located in Edmunds County, Hosmer is a close-knit community \nwith a rich cultural heritage and a strong tradition of farming.\n  Named after Stella Hosmer, the railroad agent's wife, the town was \nfounded in 1887 and officially incorporated in 1904. Early settlers \narrived in Hosmer shortly after the town's founding. Most were German-\nRussians, who persevered despite drought, poor land, and grasshopper \ninfestations. Thanks in part to its location along the Chicago, \nMilwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, by the 1920s Hosmer was a \nflourishing community. Local businesses popped up, including general \nstores, cream stations, churches, a drug store, meat market, and a \nhotel.\n  Today in Hosmer they still honor the traditions of their German-\nRussian ancestors. Kuchen, German-style noodles, and German-style \nsausage are just a few of their culinary specialties, available in \nlocal establishments. Many residents proudly make their own sausage, \nmuch like the intrepid settlers who founded Hosmer 125 years ago.\n  The people of Hosmer will be celebrating their quasquicentennial June \n29 to July 1 with a complete schedule of events. There will be \nentertainment for children in the park, a free meal, car show, parade, \ndances, music, and performances. It promises to be a weekend full of \nfamily fun.\n  Mr. President, 125 years after its founding, Hosmer continues to be a \nsmall town that represents the best South Dakota has to offer. I am \nhonored to congratulate the people of Hosmer on this memorable \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/18/senate-section/article/S4237-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALECK SHILAOS\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nexemplary service of Chief Aleck Shilaos, who has served in law \nenforcement for 43 years and as the chief of police for the city of \nPrice, UT for 25 years.\n  Shilaos began his career in 1969 as the first parking officer ever \nhired by the University of Utah. When the university's security force \nbecame an official police department, Aleck joined the police force. \nThe school's biggest need for police stemmed from theft at the \nUniversity Hospital, where felons from Utah's prison system would \nreceive medical treatment. The crime wave was quickly stopped, saving \nthe hospital untold long-term costs.\n  In 1972, Shilaos accepted a position with the Lakewood, CO Police \nDepartment, where he served for a decade and continued to improve his \nmerits as a nationally ranked pistol shooter. Those skills helped him \nto gain immediate respect from fellow officers when he joined the \npolice force in his hometown of Price a decade later. Five years later, \nhe was named chief of police in Price, a position he would hold for the \nnext quarter of a century.\n  Under Shilaos's leadership, the Price Police Department advanced into \nthe information age. With Shilaos at the helm, Price began implementing \ntechnologies that increased efficiency and paved the way for the next \ngeneration of police officers.\n  Shilaos graduated from the FBI National Academy in 1995, created his \ndepartment's first detective division, and a new field training \nprogram. Additionally, Shilaos looked beyond his own department and \nhelped to found a regional drug strike force and SWAT team, and \nimplemented the DARE anti-drug program in local schools.\n  Shilaos also fought a brave personal battle against non-Hodgkin's \nlymphoma. Diagnosed in 2010, the disease is now in remission. Shilaos \nrecently commented that the good days now outnumber the bad ones.\n  Aleck Shilaos has been an outstanding public servant for the city of \nPrice, UT and will surely be missed. His career is an example of \nleadership, dedication, and commitment. I wish he and his wife Shirley \na long and enjoyable retirement, and thank him for his dedicated \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/18/senate-section/article/S4237-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING INDIANA PRAIRIE FARMER MAGAZINE\n\n Mr. LUGAR, Mr. President, today I would like to recognize a \npublication in the State of Indiana that is not only making sure to \nsupply useful information that will help Hoosier farm families thrive \nbut is also taking the time to honor exceptional families through the \nMaster Farmer award program.\n  As one of 18 State and regional subsidiaries of Farm Progress, \nIndiana Prairie Farmer is constantly striving to ensure that our \nfarmers are equipped with the information and support necessary to \nhandle the difficult tasks facing agriculturalists. At the helm of this \ninitiative is editor Tom Bechman who not only brings experience from a \nsmall tenant dairy farm but is also nationally known for his coverage \nof Midwest agronomy, conservation, no-till farming, farm management, \nfarm safety, high-tech farming and personal property tax relief.\n  Considered one of the top honors an Indiana farmer can receive, the \nfirst Master Farmer was presented in December 1925 in Chicago. The \nfirst 21 Indiana farmers to receive the award had an average farm size \nof 202 acres. The program was discontinued in 1935 due to the Great \nDepression and reinstated by James C. Thompson, then-managing editor of \nthe Prairie Farmer, in 1968. More than 200 Indiana farmers have been \nrecognized since the program was reborn. In addition, roughly a dozen \npeople who are not farmers but who made great contributions to Indiana \nagriculture have been recognized as Honorary Master Farmers. In 2006, \nPurdue University's College of Agriculture joined Indiana Prairie \nFarmer as co-sponsor of the award and has since been supported by two \nGlenn W. Sample dean's of the College of Agriculture, making sure that \nit maintained its reputation as a top award.\n  As a farmer myself, I am honored as both a Hoosier and member of the \nagriculture industry to have the great work of my fellow \nagriculturalists recognized by Mr. Bechman and the Indiana Prairie \nFarmer. Their tireless efforts to identify and reward Indiana farmers \nfor their work to provide the safest, most abundant and least expensive \nfood supply in the world is humbling and deserves the utmost \nrecognition.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Indiana Prairie Farmer for \ntheir work on behalf of Indiana farmers and the Master Farmer award \nprogram. I am privileged to represent a State so dedicated to this \nvital industry and its participants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/18/senate-section/article/S4237-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4237-S4238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING INNOVATIVE LIVESTOCK SERVICES\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, you have heard me recount numerous \nstories on the importance of agriculture in my home State of Kansas. \nMany of these stories center around the fact that cattle outnumber \npeople by more than two to one, and I often joke that cattle are \nusually in a better mood. In recent years, the Kansas livestock \nindustry has accounted for nearly 50 percent of all agricultural cash \nreceipts within the State.\n  Mr. Lee Borck, chairman, and Mr. Andrew Murphy, president and chief \nexecutive officer, of Innovative Livestock Services have played a key \nrole within the livestock industry. I want to take this opportunity to \nrecognize part of the Innovative Livestock Services operation, Ward \nFeed Yard, on celebrating 50 years of feeding cattle. Great Bend \nFeeding and Ward Feed Yard, both part of the Innovative Livestock \nServices operation, have now been in business for more than 50 years. \nThere is no doubt in the strong heritage, optimistic outlook and \npositive economic development this cattle feeding company has created \nin Kansas. Just as the beef industry is a leading segment of the \nagriculture industry in Kansas, with the leadership of Mr. Borck and \nMr. Murphy, Innovative\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nLivestock Services is a true champion within the beef industry.\n  Today I wish to say congratulations to all of those who have helped \nover the past 50 years and to wish Ward Feed Yard nothing but the best \nfor the next 50 years.

A bill to establish a United States Boxing Commission to \nadminister the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nReid of Nevada, our distinguished majority leader, to introduce the \nProfessional Boxing Amendments Act of 2012. This legislation is \nvirtually identical to a measure reported by the Commerce Committee \nduring the 111th Congress, after being approved unanimously by the \nSenate in 2005. Simply put, this legislation would better protect \nprofessional boxing from the fraud, corruption, and ineffective \nregulation that has plagued the sport for too many years, and that has \ndevastated physically and financially many of our Nation's professional \nboxers.\n  My involvement with boxing goes back a long way, first as a fan in my \nyouth--in what many view as the golden age of boxing in America: in the \ndays of Joe Louis and Billy Conn and Floyd Patterson and Sugar Ray \nRobinson--probably the greatest boxer in history--and Kid Gavilan and \nJoey Giardello, the names I still remember because of the incredible \nacts of sportsmanship and courage and tenacity in the ring that they \ndisplayed, which made boxing one of the most popular sports in all of \nthe United States, then with my undistinguished record as a boxer at \nthe U.S. Naval Academy, and then over my time here in Congress, where I \nhave been involved in legislation related to boxing since the mid-\n1990s.\n  The 19th century sportswriter Pierce Egan called the sport of boxing \nthe ``sweet science.'' Long-time boxing reporter Jimmy Cannon called it \nthe ``red light district of sports.'' In truth, it is both. I have \nalways believed that at its best, professional boxing is a riveting and \nhonorable contest of courageous and highly skilled athletes. \nUnfortunately, the last few decades of boxing history have--through \ncountless examples of conflicts of interest, improper financial \narrangements, and inadequate or nonexistent oversight--led most to \nbelieve that Cannon's words--that boxing is the ``red light district of \nsports''--were more appropriate than that of Pierce Egan's words, who \ncalled it the ``sweet science.''\n  The most recent controversy surrounding the Pacquiao-Bradley fight is \nthe latest example of the legitimate distrust boxing fans have for the \nintegrity of the sport. After the Pacquiao-Bradley decision was \nannounced, understandably fans were clearly apoplectic and many \ncommentators found the decision astonishing.\n  Bob Arum, the promoter of the fight--and he represented both Pacquiao \nand Bradley--said:\n\n       What the hell were these people watching?. . . . How can \n     you watch a sport where you don't see any motive for any \n     malfeasance and yet come up with a result like we came up \n     with tonight? How do you explain it to anybody?. . . . \n     Something like this is so outlandish, it's a death knell for \n     the sport.\n\n  Those words came from the promoter of the fight, long-time promoter \nBob Arum.\n  ESPN boxing analyst Dan Rafael--who scored the fight 119 to 109 for \nPacquiao--called the decision an ``absolute absurdity.'' And he said:\n\n       I could watch the fight 1,000 times and not find seven \n     rounds to give to Timothy Bradley.\n\n  Additionally, following the fight, HBO's Max Kellerman--a guy I have \nalways enjoyed--was ringside, where he said:\n\n       This is baffling, punch stat had Pacquiao landing many more \n     punches, landing at a higher connect percentage, landing more \n     power punches. Ringside, virtually every reporter had \n     Pacquiao winning by a wide margin. . . . I can't understand \n     how Bradley gets this decision. There were times in that \n     fight where I felt a little bit embarrassed for Bradley.\n\n  Clearly, the conspiracy theories and speculation surrounding the \nfight are given life because there are so many questions surrounding \nthe integrity of the sport and how it is managed in multiple \njurisdictions. Professional boxing remains the only major sport in the \nUnited States that does not have a strong centralized association, \nleague, or other regulatory body to establish and enforce uniform rules \nand practices. Because a powerful few benefit\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\ngreatly from the current system of patchwork compliance and enforcement \nof Federal boxing law, a national self-regulating organization--though \npreferable to government oversight--is not a realistic option.\n  What has happened to the meaning of the word champion? There is an \nalphabet soup of organizations today, some of them--or many of them--\nbased outside of the United States of America, that clearly manipulates \nthe rankings in order to set up a fight which has a ``championship'' \nassociated with it.\n  Ineffective oversight of professional boxing will continue to result \nin scandals, controversies, unethical practices, a lack of trust in the \nintegrity of judged outcomes and, most tragic of all, unnecessary \ndeaths in the sport. These problems have led many in professional \nboxing to conclude that the only solution is an effective \nand accountable Federal boxing commission.\n\n  The legislation that Senator Reid and I are introducing would \nestablish the United States Boxing Commission--the USBC or Commission--\nproviding the much-needed oversight to ensure integrity within this \nprofession through better reporting and disclosure, requiring that the \nsport avoid the conflicts of interest which cause fans to question the \noutcome of bouts, which hurts the sport.\n  If enacted, the commission would administer Federal boxing law and \ncoordinate with other Federal regulatory agencies to ensure that this \nlaw is enforced, oversee all professional boxing matches in the United \nStates, and work with the boxing industry and local commissions to \nimprove the safety, integrity, and professionalism of professional \nboxing in the United States.\n  More specifically, this legislation would require that all referees \nand judges participating in a championship or a professional bout \nlasting 10 rounds or more be fully registered and licensed by the \ncommission. Further, while a sanctioning organization could provide a \nlist of judges and referees deemed qualified, only the boxing \ncommission will appoint the judges and referees participating in these \nmatches.\n  Additionally, the commission would license boxers, promoters, \nmanagers, and sanctioning organizations. The commission would have the \nauthority to revoke such a license for violations of Federal boxing \nlaw, to stop unethical or illegal conduct, to protect the health and \nsafety of a boxer or if the revocation is otherwise in the public \ninterest.\n  The Professional Boxing Amendments Act would strengthen existing \nFederal boxing law by improving the basic health and safety standards \nfor professional boxers, establishing a centralized medical registry to \nbe used by local commissions to protect boxers, reducing the arbitrary \npractices of sanctioning organizations, and enhancing the uniformity \nand basic standards for professional boxing contracts. Most \nimportantly, this legislation would establish a Federal regulatory \nentity to oversee professional boxing and set basic uniform standards \nfor certain aspects of the sport.\n  Thankfully, current law--which we passed in the 1990s--has already \nimproved some aspects of the state of professional boxing. However, \nlike me, many others remain concerned the sport continues to be at \nserious risk. In 2003, the Government Accountability Office spent more \nthan 6 months studying 10 of the country's busiest State and tribal \nboxing commissions. Government auditors found that many of these \ncommissions do not comply with Federal boxing law, and that there is a \ndisturbing lack of enforcement by both Federal and State officials.\n  It is important to state clearly and plainly for the record that the \npurpose of the commission created by this bill is not to interfere with \nthe daily operations of State and tribal boxing commissions. Instead, \nit would work in consultation with local commissions, and it would only \nexercise its authority when reasonable grounds exist for such \nintervention. In fact, this bill states explicitly that it would not \nprohibit any boxing commission from exercising any of its powers, \nduties, or functions with respect to the regulation or supervision of \nprofessional boxing to the extent consistent with the provisions of \nFederal boxing law.\n  With respect to costs associated with this legislation, the pricetag \nfor this legislation should not fall on the shoulders of the American \ntaxpayer, especially during a time of crushing debt and deficits. As \nsuch, to recover the costs, the bill authorizes the commission to \nassess fees on promoters, sanctioning organizations, and boxers, \nensuring that boxers pay the smallest portion of what is, in fact, \ncollected.\n  Let there be no doubt, however, of the very basic and pressing need \nin professional boxing for a Federal boxing commission. The \nestablishment of the USBC would address that need. The problems that \nhave plagued the sport of professional boxing for many years continue \nto undermine the credibility of this sport in the eyes of the public \nand, more importantly, compromise the safety of boxers. This bill \nprovides an effective approach to curbing these problems.\n  I take a back seat to no one in my desire for smaller government and \nless regulation. It is a crying need today, not only for the integrity \nof the sport but the health of boxers. We are finding more and more, \nespecially in the sport of professional football lately, the effect of \nblows to the head. Anyone who has had the honor of knowing Muhammad \nAli, as I have over the years, recognizes that this is a very brutal \nsport. There is no doubt that if in professional football blows to the \nhead can be damaging to one's health, clearly it can be in the sport of \nboxing. I regret to tell my colleagues that there are not sufficient \nprotections for the safety of the boxers engaged in the sport today.\n  The Pacquiao-Bradley fight is only the latest example, and its \noutrage is spread because of the size of the fight. Unfortunately, over \nthe years, there have been a series of fights--some of them I will add \nfor the Record at the appropriate time--where the wrong decision has \nbeen announced.\n  This is a great sport. It has given an opportunity, for young men \nparticularly, to rise from the depths of poverty to pinnacles of \ngreatness in the sport--and wealth beyond their imagining at the time \nthey entered the sport. So we need to protect these people. We need to \ngive them a fair and legitimate playing field in which to compete.\n  I urge the support of my colleagues and again thank my friend the \nmajority leader, Senator Harry Reid, who was a boxer of great skill and \nability himself in his younger days. Some of those traits he has \ndisplayed very prominently here on the floor of the Senate, and I \nrespect him greatly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 3309. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nassistance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to homeless \nveterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to introduce the Homeless \nVeterans Assistance Improvement Act of 2012. No one who has made \nsacrifices to serve our Nation should ever be homeless, and this \nproblem should never be ignored. The bill I am introducing today would \nallow the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to continue the important \nwork of ending veteran homelessness.\n  The administration reported that on any given night in January 2011, \nan estimated 67,500 veterans were homeless. I want to commend the VA \nfor its efforts to reduce the number of veterans sleeping in the \nstreets. Between 2010 and 2011 the number of homeless veterans \ndecreased by 12 percent, but the number of homeless women veterans has \ncontinued to increase. We are making great progress, in large part due \nto interagency collaborations, but there is still more work to be done.\n  In light of recent reports from VA's Office of Inspector General and \nthe Government Accountability Office, VA must do more to make its \nhomeless veterans programs more welcoming to women and veterans with \nfamilies. The reports highlighted limitations in available housing \noptions for women veterans with children. Additionally, infrastructure \nneeds such as private and secure rooms and showering facilities are \noften lacking placing women veterans in uncomfortable and potentially \nunsafe situations. We can and should do better.\n  The Homeless Veterans Assistance Improvement Act of 2012 helps \nachieve this goal by allowing VA to provide\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\ntransitional housing services to the children of homeless veterans, \nwhere it is appropriate to do so. It also requires grantees who receive \nfunding for transitional housing to meet the privacy, safety, and \nsecurity needs of women veterans and veterans with families. No veteran \nshould have to choose between housing and their safety or between \nhousing and remaining with their family.\n  Other provisions in this legislation help VA to meet the self-\nidentified, unmet needs of homeless veterans. VA conducts an annual \nassessment of homeless veterans, homeless programs staff, and grantees \nthat ranks the top ten unmet needs of homeless veterans. The most \nrecent report, which was from fiscal year 2010, highlights the fact \nthat many homeless veterans ranked legal assistance among their top ten \nunmet needs for the last several years. Among the top-ranked needs for \nthe last several years have been legal services and dental care. My \nlegislation makes veterans in the HUD-VASH program eligible to \nparticipate in the Homeless Veterans Dental Program. It also ensures \nthat a percentage of the funding available for homelessness prevention \nand rapid re-housing will be used for legal services to remove some of \nthe barriers to obtaining or maintaining stable housing for homeless \nveterans.\n  This is not a full summary of all the provisions within this \nlegislation. However, I hope that I have provided an appropriate \noverview of the major benefits this legislation would provide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 470\n\n       Whereas pioneering men and women, recognized as \n     ``cowboys'', helped establish the American West;\n       Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, integrity, courage, \n     compassion, respect, a strong work ethic, and patriotism;\n       Whereas the cowboy spirit exemplifies strength of \n     character, sound family values, and good common sense;\n       Whereas the cowboy archetype transcends ethnicity, gender, \n     geographic boundaries, and political affiliations;\n       Whereas the cowboy is an excellent steward of the land and \n     its creatures, who lives off the land and works to protect \n     and enhance the environment;\n       Whereas cowboy traditions have been a part of American \n     culture for generations;\n       Whereas the cowboy continues to be an important part of the \n     economy through the work of many thousands of ranchers across \n     the United States who contribute to the economic well-being \n     of every State;\n       Whereas millions of fans watch professional and working \n     ranch rodeo events annually, making rodeo one of the most-\n     watched sports in the United States;\n       Whereas membership and participation in rodeo and other \n     organizations that promote and encompass the livelihood of \n     cowboys span every generation and transcend race and gender;\n       Whereas the cowboy is a central figure in literature, film, \n     and music and occupies a central place in the public \n     imagination;\n       Whereas the cowboy is an American icon; and\n       Whereas the ongoing contributions made by cowboys and \n     cowgirls to their communities should be recognized and \n     encouraged: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates July 28, 2012, as ``National Day of the \n     American Cowboy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/18/senate-section/article/S4250-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 495, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 495) designating the period beginning \n     on June 17, 2012, and ending on June 23, 2012, as \n     ``Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week,'' and raising \n     awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney disease and \n     the impact such disease has on patients.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator Hatch and I submitted a resolution \nto increase awareness of Polycystic Kidney Disease, PKD, a life-\nthreatening genetic illness.\n  PKD is the most common genetic illness, and over 600,000 people have \nbeen diagnosed with PKD nationwide. There is no treatment or cure for \nthis devastating disease. Families and friends provide unwavering \nsupport to their suffering loved ones.\n  But there is hope. The PKD Foundation has reported the discovery of \nspecific genes involved in the development of PKD, allowing for the \ndevelopment of clinical trials.\n  While scientists continue researching to find new treatments and \ncures for PKD, others are working to bring awareness. Every year, the \nPKD Foundation holds an annual fundraising walk for PKD. In Wisconsin, \nwhere over 11,000 patients are living with the disease, residents \ngather across the state to take part in this very special walk.\n  To support these efforts, I propose that Congress increase public \nawareness of the disease by designating the week of June 17 to 23 of \nthis year as ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week.'' We \nwill be taking a positive step toward finding a cure for this disease \nby increasing awareness.\n  I trust that my colleagues will see how designating a week to this \ndisease will help those afflicted by polycystic kidney disease, and I \nhope for my colleagues' full support of this important resolution.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements be \nprinted in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 495) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 495\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, known as ``PKD'', is a \n     life-threatening genetic disease, affecting newborns, \n     children, and adults regardless of sex, age, race, geography, \n     income, or ethnicity;\n       Whereas there are 2 forms of polycystic kidney disease, \n     autosomal dominant (ADPKD), and autosomal recessive (ARPKD), \n     a rare form frequently leading to early death;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease causes multiple cysts to \n     form on both kidneys (ranging in size from a pinhead to a \n     grapefruit), leading to an increase in kidney size and \n     weight;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidneys and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems;\n       Whereas patients with polycystic kidney disease often \n     experience no symptoms early in the disease, and many \n     patients do not realize they have polycystic kidney disease \n     until other organs are affected;\n       Whereas symptoms of polycystic kidney disease may include \n     high blood pressure, chronic pain in the back, sides or \n     abdomen, blood in the urine, urinary tract infection, heart \n     disease, and kidney stones;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is the number 1 genetic \n     cause of kidney failure in the United States;\n       Whereas more than half of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients will reach kidney failure and require dialysis or a \n     kidney transplant to survive, thus placing an extra strain on \n     dialysis and kidney transplantation resources;\n       Whereas there is no treatment or cure for polycystic kidney \n     disease; and\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide \n     dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering public \n     awareness and understanding, educating patients and their \n     families about polycystic kidney disease to improve treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the period beginning on June 17, 2012, and \n     ending on June 23, 2012, as ``Polycystic Kidney Disease \n     Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Polycystic Kidney \n     Disease Awareness Week, to raise public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research to find \n     treatments and a cure for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support Polycystic Kidney Disease \n     Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities, \n     to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease, and \n     to foster understanding of the impact of such disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/18/senate-section/article/S4250-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4250-S4251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 19, 2012\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.
