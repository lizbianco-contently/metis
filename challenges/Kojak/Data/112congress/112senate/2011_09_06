Following leader remarks, the Senate will proceed to a \nperiod of morning business until 5 p.m. During that period of time, \nSenators will be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  At 5 p.m., the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider \nthe nomination of Bernice Bouie Donald of Tennessee to be U.S. circuit \njudge for the Sixth Circuit. There will be 30 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to the vote on confirmation of the nomination.\n  Upon disposition of the Donald nomination, the Senate will resume \nconsideration and vote on the motion to proceed to invoke cloture on \nthe patent reform bill. Senators should expect two rollcall votes this \nevening about 5:30 p.m.\n\n\n                              JOBS AGENDA\n\n  Mr. President, first of all, I welcome the Presiding Officer and \neveryone back to the Senate after the August recess, as well as my good \nfriend, the Republican leader.\n  I look forward to the No. 1 priority we have; that is, job creation. \nThis isn't just a conversation among those of us in the Senate. The \nAmerican people agree that is the No. 1 priority we should have.\n  I am sorry to say Republicans have distracted Congress from its most \nimportant responsibility--getting our economy back to work and back on \ntrack. That means jobs. We have been distracted time and time again. \nThey have filed endless amendments on legislation that should engender \nbipartisan support. They have killed good bills with obstructionism and \nstall tactics. They have dragged out votes to continue funding the \ngovernment. They did that on the CR we worked on for weeks and weeks, \nand all we were trying to do was to fund the government until October 1 \nand to avert a default crisis. Votes that normally had been routine \nunder Democratic and Republican administrations were not with this \nRepublican obstructionism we have had.\n  President Reagan asked Congress to extend the debt ceiling 18 times, \nand it was done 18 times. But this year--not like the era of President \nReagan, when the debt was increasing significantly as a result of his \nagenda--our jobs agenda was held up and set aside for months. The work \nof Congress and our ability to do something about the economy was being \nheld hostage. Rather than working with Democrats to pass job-creating \nlegislation, Republicans insisted on reckless cuts that hurt our \neconomic recovery.\n  Economists--take, for example, Mark Zandi, certainly a person who has \nshown some bipartisanship, worked for John McCain as his economic \nadviser and who is now in the private sector--have said we have to cut \nspending, and we have all acknowledged that. We agree with Mark Zandi. \nBut we also agree with economist Mark Zandi in saying we have to be \nvery careful about how we cut now because of the difficult times we are \ngoing through. We cut significantly in programs that create jobs, but \nwe did it because we have to get this debt under control.\n  As my friend said, his No. 1 goal is to defeat President Obama--my \nfriend the Republican leader. With that as the No. 1 goal, it makes it \nvery difficult to get things done around here.\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\n  The August employment report, released last week, should be a wake-up \ncall to every Member of Congress--Democrats and Republicans. We cannot \nwaste any more time, as has been wasted over the last 8 months. The \nprivate sector added less than 20,000 jobs last month, and that was \noffset by the further unemployment that came in the ranks of \ngovernment. So the net job increase was basically zero. Although August \nmarked the 18th straight month of private sector job growth, a stagnant \nunemployment rate is simply not good enough. Congress must act very \nquickly to jump-start the economy, and in doing that it will help the \nrecovery.\n  We have to bring the unemployment rate down. It is time for us to get \ndown to work, as we should have been doing all along, and we look \nforward to working with the Republicans who have delayed our ability to \nwork together for some 8 months. That is going to take cooperation, \nwhich has been in short supply, it seems, in Washington in the last 8 \nmonths. I am hopeful we can begin a new work period, where our \nconstituents' voices will be fresh in our minds.\n  I just returned from Nevada--as we all have returned from our \nStates--and I had the time to talk with my friends in Nevada, people \nwhom I have known for many years. I was talking to one of my friends in \nReno today, and I said to him: Pete, it is very hard to look as you \ndrive by these strip malls and see the for lease signs all over, in \nReno and in Las Vegas. It is not good. They are struggling. Nevada \nleads the Nation in unemployment. That is not something of which we are \nproud.\n  People are having trouble finding steady work not only in Nevada but \naround the country and in all segments of our economy. Public radio had \na piece on law schools, where enrollments have been cut way back. As I \nunderstood the piece they had on the radio, 16 percent of law school \ngraduates can't find work--not in the legal profession or anyplace. So \nit is not only Nevada, it is all over the country. People are having \ntrouble finding steady work--people with education and people without \neducation. People are having trouble making their mortgage payments and \neven putting food on the table. So our constituents are going to be \nwatching very closely this fall to see whether we have heard their \nmessage: We need some jobs.\n  We must set aside partisanship and we must do it for the sake of \nAmerica and jobs. The American people are not going to be satisfied \nwith the same obstructionism and gridlock they saw in the spring and \nsummer. They know, as I do, that the Nation's economy depends on \ndedicated men and women--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--\nworking together to put bipartisan bills together and get America back \nto work.\n  We are going to waste no time in the Senate getting down to business. \nToday, we will hold a vote on legislation to streamline the patent \nsystem, which will help entrepreneurs start new businesses. The America \nInvents Act--which passed the beginning of this Congress--will \nsignificantly reform the patent system for the first time in some 60 \nyears. It passed the House with more than 300 votes, and it passed the \nSenate with 95 votes. This is exactly the kind of job-creating \nlegislation our country needs to get our economic recovery back in \nmotion. This bill will promote innovation, create American jobs, and \ngrow our economy without adding a penny to the deficit.\n  I have to say, the patent bill was not held up by Republicans in the \nSenate; it was held up by Republicans in the House who held that bill \nfor months and months. It is here now, and I am going to do everything \nI can--I think we all feel this way--to move this legislation along. \nToday, there are 700,000 patent applications--3 years' worth, at \nleast--waiting to be reviewed. Who knows what is in that pile of \npatents. Could it be another Google? Could it be another software \nsystem that will revolutionize different parts of our society? Of \ncourse, there could be and likely is. We need to get through that \nbacklog, and we need to unlock the job-creating potential of each \npatent.\n  This bill will also lower fees for small business applicants by up to \n75 percent, helping put more people to work.\n  It is time our patent system became a tool to spark innovation, which \nis important, and so we need to move forward. The American Invents Act \nis the kind of bipartisan effort Americans have demanded and deserve \nfrom Congress, though I acknowledge it is only a beginning, a \ndownpayment on the aggressive jobs agenda we understand is necessary.\n  We will hold a cloture vote on this legislation tonight, which I hope \nwill allow us to get on the bill. I hope we will not have to file \ncloture on the bill itself. I have told my Republican colleagues, if \nthere are amendments that need to be offered--a reasonable number of \namendments--let's get them done. We have too much to do to waste weeks \non this piece of legislation. We have already done that. So I hope we \nwill have final passage in the next few days. This is important \nlegislation, and we have had plenty of time to debate this in Congress. \nIt is time to move on to other job-creating measures.\n  This work period is 3 weeks long. I hope we don't have to extend it \ninto the following week. We have a holiday on the Wednesday following \nthe Friday we intend to leave here. I hope we don't have to work into \nthat work period, so we are going to do everything we can to avoid \nthat. But during this work period we must extend the authorization of \nthe Federal Aviation Administration. This is important.\n  As we know from what happened last month, 80,000 Americans were put \nout of work. I think it was certainly something which had some impact \non the safety of what was going on around the country. We had safety \ninspectors who were paying their own way to go around the country. They \nwere buying their own tickets and their own meals. We can't afford \nanother FAA shutdown. It would put air travelers at risk and, as I \nindicated, immediately lay off 80,000 workers--thousands of them \nconstruction workers and 4,000 of them permanent employees.\n  This bill was held up for one reason and one reason only, to protect \none airline company--one airline company--that is all. All the other \nexcuses are only excuses. We need to move forward with this legislation \nand make this legislation pass on a permanent basis. We have had 20-\nplus temporary extensions of this legislation. We have to move on, but \nwe certainly have to get an extension until after the first of the \nyear. We can no longer be wanting to protect one airline--one airline \nof all the airlines in America. Only one airline company is \ncomplaining. Neither can we afford a disruption in the collection of \nthe gasoline taxes or delay highway and mass transit construction \nprojects that employ--I believe Senator Boxer indicated--1.7 million \npeople. She is the chairman of that committee.\n  So before the end of the month, we must authorize Federal spending \nfor the Nation's highways. Even Grover Norquist, the person who goes \naround telling everybody which bills are good to vote for and which \naren't, has said advancing the highway bill is not a tax increase. And \nhe, as I understand, is clearly one who won't oppose this crucial \nlegislation which extends the highway bill we hope until the first of \nFebruary or thereabouts.\n  During this work period, Congress also must make sure that FEMA, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, has the resources it needs to help \nAmerican families rebuild their lives after some of the most deadly \ndisasters in the history of this country. No. 1 was Hurricane Irene. We \ndon't know for sure, but it will be in the top 5 or 10 of the most \ncostly disasters in American history. We have to free this money. Right \nnow, because of FEMA running out of money because of these disasters--\njust this past month, we had an earthquake here in the East, which \nsurprised everyone. It was in the Presiding Officer's State but had \nimpact in a lot of other places. The National Cathedral was damaged \nsignificantly, the Washington Monument was closed. FEMA has frozen \nlong-term aid to Joplin, MO. We had almost 30 people killed, Mr. \nPresident. FEMA is there to lend a helping hand, and that hand has been \ndrawing back because they are running out of money. So we need to fund \nFEMA and help the victims of Hurricane Irene and to make sure, with \nthose other disasters taking place, we can also complete that work. We \nplan for these disasters as best we can. We put money in our budgets \nfor what we anticipate will be disasters. But no one\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\ncan have a crystal ball and determine all these disasters are going to \ntake place. So we need to understand these are emergency monies. If \nthere ever were an emergency--it is these people who have been hurt by \nthese devastating storms and emergencies.\n  On Thursday, I look forward to hearing President Obama's speech. It \nis a joint session of Congress. He is going to talk about job creation. \nIt will be crucial for Congress to work together with the President to \njump-start our flagging economy. It won't be easy for Congress to \ntackle all the things this fall--and I am only talking about things we \nneed to do this work period--but it has never been more important than \nnow to put our jobs agenda ahead of either party's political agenda.\n  I look forward to a productive work period during which colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will work together for the good of our economy \nand the good of this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5317-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is good to see my friend the \nmajority leader. I agree with him that I think we can make some \nsignificant progress in the next few weeks on some issues on which both \nsides have largely agreed. However, there are other things where \nclearly there remains differences among us.\n  As lawmakers return to Washington this week, every one of us, I am \nsure, is aware of the fact that many Americans are not only frustrated \nwith the state of our economy but also with the state of their \ngovernment. I don't think any one of us is under any illusion that the \nAmerican people were particularly eager to see us come back. And who \ncould blame them? After 2\\1/2\\ years of being told that Washington had \nthe answer to everything from the high cost of health care to high \nunemployment, people have every reason to be skeptical. For more than \n2\\1/2\\ years under the administration, Americans have been hearing \nabout the wonders government spending would do for our economy and \nabout the dangerous consequences of failing to apply bold solutions to \nbig problems. And what has it gotten them? As Washington has grown \nbigger and bigger, Americans have continued to lose jobs. The national \ndebt has exploded literally out of sight. And for the first time in our \nhistory, America's once pristine credit rating has been downgraded by a \nmajor rating agency. The average length of unemployment recently \nsurpassed 40 weeks for the first time ever, and just last week we \nlearned that in the month of August not a single new job was created in \nthis country--not one. But here is the bottom line. In the 2\\1/2\\ years \nsince President Obama signed his signature jobs bill--the so-called \nstimulus--there are 1.7 million fewer jobs in our country.\n  Statistics such as these help us to understand the dimensions of the \neconomic challenges so many Americans continue to face. But most people \ndon't need to read the morning papers or wait for the monthly jobs \nreport to know they are struggling. And no amount of speeches, however \ncarefully crafted to appeal to the anxieties of the moment, will \nconvince them that some politician here in Washington, from the \nPresident on down, has the solution. The truth is, President Obama did \nmore for jobs last week by reversing himself on a single government-\nimposed regulation than he has done in all the speeches he has given \nput together.\n  At this point, I think most people have safely concluded that the \nproblem with our economy isn't that Washington is doing too little but \nthat Washington is doing too much already. That is why in the coming \nweeks and months many of us will continue to press for an entirely new \napproach, one that puts individuals and businesses at the center of our \nrecovery instead of Washington, one that clears away the redtape and \nthe regulatory overreach, one that lifts the cloud of uncertainty that \nhas been holding job creators back and enables the American people to \nmove our economy in the direction they want instead of having it \ndictated to them from above by the President.\n  It is time for an approach that is based on the simple principle that \nif the American people are going to have control of their own destiny, \nthey need to have more control of their economy. They have seen where \nconsolidating every economic decision in Washington has gotten us. They \nsee that folks in Washington seem to be doing just fine. Millions of \nAmericans may have lost their homes over the past few years, millions \nmore may owe more on their homes than those homes are worth, but home \nvalues here in Washington are going up--going up. Countless Americans \noutside of Washington may have seen their savings dry up or have been \nforced to decide between making a car repair or a tuition payment, but \nyou would never know that here. As countless economic tragedies \nunfolded in homes across the country over the past few years, the \nWashington metropolitan area was working on a new distinction: the \nhighest median income in America--the highest median income in America \nright here in Washington. I assure you, these folks aren't getting rich \noff of farming. While most of the rest of the country continues to \nstruggle, Washington is booming. And that is not the kind of change \npeople voted for 3 years ago.\n  So before we get into the details about what many of us believe will \nsucceed in reigniting the economy outside of Washington, we need to be \nclear about what hasn't because while I have no doubt that the \nPresident will propose many things on Thursday night that when looked \nat individually sound pretty good or that he will call them all \nbipartisan, I am equally certain that, taken as a whole, they will \nrepresent more of the same failed approach that has only made things \nworse over the past few years and resulted in fewer jobs than when we \nstarted.\n  Over the weekend, the President tested a few of the lines I expect we \nwill hear on Thursday. His central message, evidently, is that anyone \nwho doesn't rubberstamp his economic agenda is putting politics above \ncountry.\n  Well, with all due respect, Mr. President, there is a much simpler \nreason for opposing your economic proposals that has nothing whatsoever \nto do with politics, and it is this: They don't work.\n  We can trace these failures to the President's very first days in \noffice. One of the first things he did upon assuming office was to \ndirect Congress to send him the stimulus. Here was one of the single \nmost expensive pieces of legislation Congress has ever approved. The \ninterest payments alone were projected to cost an average of $100 \nmillion a day. This was the President's way of jump-starting an agenda \nthat, in his words, ``began with jobs.'' The agenda, he said, began \nwith jobs, and he knew some of us were skeptical it would work. That is \nwhy shortly after it became law he asked if he could come up to Capitol \nHill and use his very first speech to a joint session of Congress to \nexplain exactly what it would achieve. Here is what the President told \nus. The stimulus, he said, would save or create 3.5 million jobs--3.5 \nmillion jobs, he said--and ultimately that is how he will measure its \nsuccess, on whether it created jobs. To reassure those of us who \nthought government couldn't be counted on to spend this kind of money \nwisely, he insisted that anyone who received it would be held strictly \naccountable.\n  Then he said something some people may have forgotten: He said the \nstimulus was just a first step. The primary purpose of the stimulus, he \nsaid, was to help the economy in the short term. But the only way to \nfully restore America's economic strength, he told us then, was through \na 10-year budget that would reach into all areas of the economy that \nthe stimulus did not.\n  Just like the stimulus, the unifying theme of the President's budget \nwas more government. And once again, he felt in selling it that he \nneeded to speak to the skeptics first. Here is what he said about that. \nThe goal of the budget, he said, wasn't to replace private enterprise \nbut to catalyze it, not to stifle business but to create the conditions \nfor entrepreneurs and businesses to adapt and thrive. Well, how did \nthat work out? As government continued to grow, the economy sputtered, \nand it is still sputtering. Yet the President wants to know why the \npeople are\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\nresistant to his economic proposals. He says they must be motivated by \npolitics.\n  A stimulus bill aimed at creating jobs was followed by a period where \nwe lost 1.7 million jobs. The inspector general who was appointed to \noversee distribution of the stimulus funds reports that he received \nmore than 7,000 complaints of wrongdoing. More than 1,500 of those \ncomplaints have triggered investigations. Just last week, one of the \ncompanies the President personally vouched for as a shining example of \nhow stimulus dollars would work announced it was laying off more than \n1,000 workers and filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. And it wasn't the \nfirst. But still, according to the President, anyone who opposes this \nagenda is playing partisan games.\n  Well, the President can attempt to blame our economic problems all he \nwants on his political adversaries or his predecessors or natural \ndisasters. But at the end of the day, he is the one, as he himself \nsaid, who is responsible for what happens on his watch, and that \nincludes the epic failure of a bill he himself touted as the key to our \nrecovery.\n  By any measure, including his own, the stimulus and the economic \nprinciples it was built on have been a failure, and that is the reason \nso many people are skeptical of the President's economic proposals. \nThey don't work as advertised. Now, the President, of course, doesn't \nwant to acknowledge it, and I understand that. It is hard to admit when \nyou have been wrong. But in other, more subtle ways, the administration \nhas acknowledged the fundamental flaws in its approach to the economy. \nThe only reason the President agreed to keep taxes from going up last \nDecember, for instance, was that he knew it would lead to even more job \nloss. The only problem with this proposal and others like it, of \ncourse, is they are temporary, which only perpetuates the uncertainty \nthat has kept so many businesses, large and small, from making \ninvestments in new products and new workers over the past few years. \nBusinesses actually do not want shots in the arm or quick fixes. They \nwant to know what the landscape will look like a few years down the \nroad. And, until now, that is not something the President has been \nwilling to do. He has not been able to bring himself to let go of \ngovernment's grip--which brings me back to a different approach which \nsome of us have been proposing for some time now, and which the White \nHouse continues to resist. Simply put, we think Washington should take \na little break from the massive spending programs the President likes \nto refer to as ``bold'' solutions. Quite frankly, we are not very good \nat them, and anyone who thinks otherwise has not been paying very much \nattention to Washington over the past few years.\n\n  No one believes government doesn't have a role to play. Of course it \ndoes. But it is not the center of the universe and it should stop \npretending to be the center of the universe. What we need is a shift in \nthinking when it comes to thinking about how government's role in the \neconomy should work. We need to shift the center of gravity away from \nWashington and back to the innovators and entrepreneurs, the engineers \nand the shop floor managers who will be at the heart of our recovery. \nWe need to be serious about it.\n  The President is forever eager to embrace big proposals whenever \ngovernment is at the helm, but when it comes to doing the kinds of \nthings job creators want, he is suddenly quite timid. He will agree to \na tax cut as long as it is temporary. He will agree to reverse a job-\nkilling regulation, but only if he knows he has gotten dozens of other \ndoozies in the pipeline right behind it. We need to do a lot better \nthan that. We need the President to be as bold about liberating job \ncreators as he has been about shackling them. I mean, you do not lift a \nsingle regulation and suddenly claim to be Margaret Thatcher. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency alone has dozens of other new rules in \nprogress. The Labor Department has dozens of rules of its own in \nprogress. The administration's proposed utility standards would \nincrease costs for every family and business in America. One of these \nnew standards, for boiler emissions, would endanger literally tens of \nthousands of jobs. New rules for cement plants would strike a blow \nright at the heart of our manufacturing and building sectors. New rules \nregulating coal ash would endanger thousands of jobs.\n  Then there is the ObamaCare bill, which has to be counted as one of \nthe most far-reaching and comprehensive single sources of government \nregulation ever devised. Though this bill has still not yet taken \neffect, the myriad of rules that will be imposed on every American have \nbeen written as we speak, and so far those regulations already run to \nnearly 10,000 pages.\n  Republicans will spend the next weeks and months arguing in favor of \na robust legislative agenda aimed at blocking or repealing some of the \nmost pernicious rules and regulations so business can breathe again and \nbegin to hire, and the American worker, not Washington, can help this \neconomy get moving again.\n  Putting the American people back in charge of our economy also means \nreforming the Tax Code and that is why, over the next weeks and months, \nRepublicans will continue to make the case that Washington should get \nout of the business of picking winners and losers. We should strive to \nbecome more competitive by lowering the tax rate on American job \ncreators that right now ranks as the second highest in the developed \nworld, and we should level the playing field with America's competitors \noverseas by approving the three free trade agreements with Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea that have been languishing on the President's \ndesk for nearly 3 years. The President himself acknowledges that these \ntrade pacts will help create tens of thousands of jobs right here at \nhome by vastly expanding the market for U.S. goods. He should send them \nto Congress today so we can finally ratify them.\n  Another thing we can do is reform the budget process. There is no \ngood reason that nearly three-fourths of government spending is on auto \npilot and that last year's spending levels should automatically carry \nover into the next, regardless of whether they are effective or \naffordable.\n  We need to continue to make the case for a balanced budget amendment. \nBudget reform is an essential part of getting Washington to live within \nits means. It needs to be a top priority.\n  None of these ideas are groundbreaking and they certainly should not \nbe controversial. They are just common sense. Most importantly, they \nare rooted in a respect for the independence, the wisdom, and the \npower, as another U.S. President once put it, ``of a free people and \nthe efficiency of free institutions.''\n  The President who spoke those words did so during another period of \nsluggish growth and high unemployment and the solution he proposed, not \nonly for the sake of the domestic economy but also for the preservation \nof America's influence in the wider world, focused not unlike the one I \nhave outlined here on alleviating the heavy burdens government had \nimposed on both individuals and businesses.\n  This is what he further said: ``The final and best means of \nstrengthening demand among consumers and businesses is to reduce the \nburden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which \nare imposed by [the] . . . tax system.''\n  ``Such an approach,'' he continued, ``would lead to a new interest in \ntaking risks, increasing productivity, and the creation of new jobs and \nnew products for long-term economic growth.'' I would only add that the \nsame approach President Kennedy outlined with these words in 1962 is \nworth trying again today.\n  We have tried President Obama's approach. It has failed. It is time \nfor something new. The new approach we are suggesting is not aimed at \npleasing any party or constituency. It is aimed at nothing more than \ngiving back to the American people the tools they need to do the work \nWashington has not been able to do on its own. Once we do that, once we \ncome together and agree to turn the keys of this economy back to the \nAmerican men and women who actually drive it, I have no doubt that much \nof the acrimony that has marked our dealings here over the past several \nmonths will fade away.\n  Even more importantly, though, we will have done something good for \nthe country and for the millions of Americans who are looking for \nWashington\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\nnot so much to do more but for the first time in a long time to do less \nso they can finally do what it takes to get this economy moving again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5319-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support \nH.R. 1249, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. Some other \nresponsibilities may take me from the Senate floor during this coming \nweek when we will be debating the act and therefore I wanted to lay out \nmy views at this time, strongly urging my colleagues to support the \nbill.\n  Although the present bill originates in the House of Representatives, \nit is actually based on and is substantially identical to the bill that \npassed the Senate in March by a vote of 95 to 5. Also, before Chairman \nSmith brought his bill to the House floor, he negotiated final changes \nto the bill with the lead supporters of the measure in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. The House and Senate have now been working on \npatent reform for 6 years. The present bill is a good bill. It reflects \na genuine compromise between the House and the Senate. It is a bill \nthat will provide substantial benefits to the U.S. economy in the \ncoming years, so I hope that, as I said, the Senate will adopt this \nlegislation and be able to pass it on directly to the President for his \nsignature.\n  The overarching purpose and effect of the present bill is to create a \npatent system that is clearer, fairer, more transparent, and more \nobjective. It is a system that will ultimately reduce litigation costs \nand reduce the need to hire patent lawyers. The bill will make it \nsimpler and easier to obtain valid patents and to enforce those \npatents, and it will cure some very clear litigation abuses that have \narisen under the current rules, abuses that have done serious harm to \nAmerican businesses.\n  By adopting the first-to-file system, for example, the bill creates a \nrule that is clear and easy to comply with and that avoids the need for \nexpensive discovery and litigation over what a patent's priority date \nis. By adopting a simple definition of the term ``prior art,'' the bill \nwill make it easier to assess whether a patent is valid and cheaper for \nan inventor to enforce his patent. By recognizing a limited prior user \nright, the bill creates a powerful incentive for manufacturers to build \nfactories and create jobs in this country. By allowing post-grant \nreview of patents, especially low quality, business method patents, the \nbill creates an inexpensive substitute for district court litigation \nand allows key issues to be addressed by experts in the field. By \neliminating the recent surge of false-marking litigation, the bill \neffectively repeals what amounts to a litigation tax on American \nmanufacturing.\n  Let me take a few moments to describe how the provisions of this bill \nwill provide concrete benefits to American inventors, both large and \nsmall, and to the American manufacturing economy. First, prior \ncommercial use defense.\n  A new provision of the present bill that was added by the House of \nRepresentatives will provide important advantages to U.S. \nmanufacturers. Section 5 of the bill creates a new defense to patent \ninfringement of prior commercial use. This new defense will ensure that \nthe first inventor of a new process, or of a product used in a \nmanufacturing process, can continue to use the invention in a \ncommercial process even if a subsequent inventor later patents the \nidea. For many manufacturing processes the patent system presents a \nCatch-22. If the manufacturer patents the process, he effectively \ndiscloses it to the world. But patents for processes that are used in \nclosed factories are difficult to police. It is all but impossible to \nknow if someone in a factory in China, for example, is infringing such \na patent. As a result, unscrupulous foreign and domestic inventors will \nsimply use the invention in secret without paying licensing fees. \nPatenting such manufacturing processes effectively amounts to giving \naway the invention to foreign manufacturers.\n  On the other hand, if the U.S. manufacturer does not patent the \nprocess, a subsequent party may obtain a patent on it and the U.S. \nmanufacturer will be forced to stop using a process that he was the \nfirst to invent and which he has been using for years.\n  The prior commercial use defense provides relief to U.S. \nmanufacturers from this Catch-22, allowing them to continue to use a \nmanufacturing process without having to give it away to competitors or \nrunning the risk that it will be patented out from under them. To \nestablish a right to this defense, however, the America Invents Act \nrequires the manufacturer to use the process in the United States. As a \nresult, the AIA creates a powerful incentive for manufacturers to build \ntheir factories and plants in the United States. Currently, most \nforeign countries recognize some prior user rights that encourage \nmanufacturers to build facilities in those countries. This bill \ncorrects this imbalance and creates a strong incentive for businesses \nto create manufacturing jobs in this country.\n  Second, something called supplemental examination. A provision of \nthis bill that will particularly benefit small and startup investors is \nsection 12, which authorizes supplemental examination of patents. It is \none of the reasons the bill has such strong support in the small \nbusiness community. Currently, even minor and inadvertent errors in the \npatent application process can lead to expensive and very unpredictable \nand very inequitable conduct litigation. It is often the case that \nstartup companies or university researchers cannot afford to hire the \nvery best patent lawyers. Their patents are prosecuted by an in-house \nattorney who does a good enough job but who is unfamiliar with all of \nthe sharp corners and pitfalls of the inequitable conduct doctrine, \nsuch as the need to present cumulative studies and prior art. Later, \nwhen more legally sophisticated investors evaluate the patent for \npotential investment or purchase, these minor flaws in prosecution can \ndeter the investor from purchasing or funding the development of the \ninvention. An investor would not risk spending hundreds of millions of \ndollars to develop a product if a potential inequitable conduct attack \nmay wipe out the whole investment.\n\n  Parties on both sides of these exchanges report that investors \nroutinely walk away from inventions because of their inability under \ncurrent law to resolve uncertainties whether a flaw in prosecution was, \nin fact, inequitable conduct. These decisions not to invest in a new \ninvention represent important new cures never tested and brought to \nmarket and other important inventions that are never developed.\n  The America Invents Act provides a solution to this problem by \nauthorizing supplemental examination of patents. This new proceeding \nwill allow inventors or patent purchasers to return to the Patent \nOffice with additional material and have the Patent Office reevaluate \nthe patent in light of that material. If the patent is invalid in light \nof the new material, the Patent Office will cancel the claims. But if \nthe office finds that the patent is valid, the parties will have a \npatent that they can be legally certain will be upheld and enforced. \nThe authorization of supplemental examination will result in path-\nbreaking inventions being developed and brought to market that \notherwise would have lingered on the shelf because of legal uncertainty \nover the patent. It will ensure that small and startup companies with \nimportant and valid patents will not be denied investment capital \nbecause of legal technicalities.\n  Let me talk about what I think is undoubtedly the most important \namong\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\nthe bill's changes to current law, and that is its transition to the \nfirst-to-file system. This long overdue reform will create a system for \nestablishing a patent's priority date that is official, simple, \ntransparent, and fair. Priority dates not only establish priorities \nbetween competing patent applications for the same invention but are \nalso used to measure a patent against potentially invalidating prior \nart.\n  Currently, establishing a priority date requires expensive litigation \nand discovery into what the inventor's notebooks show and when they \nshow it and whether the inventor diligently perfected his invention \nafter he conceived of it.\n  Also, for businesses seeking legal certainty, our current system can \nbe a nightmare. A company hoping to bring a new product to market in a \nparticular field of technology has no way of knowing whether a \ncompetitor that belatedly sought the patent on its new product will \nsucceed in securing a valid patent on the product. It all depends on \nthe invention date the competitor will be able to prove relative to the \ncompany that the company developing the product can prove.\n  Given that both the product developer and competitor can rely on \ntheir own secret documents that the other side will not see until \nlitigation over the patent commences, neither of these two parties can \ngain a clear picture of whether a patent is valid without years of \nlitigation and millions of dollars of discovery and other litigation \ncosts. Under first to file, by contrast, inventors will file informal \nand inexpensive provisional applications. These applications need only \ndisclose what the invention is and how to make it, information the \ninventor already needs to have in his possession anyway in order to \nestablish a priority date under the current system. Under first to \nfile, once the inventor files this information with the Patent Office, \nhe has a priority date that is both secure and public. The application \nis a government document. There is no need to litigate over its \npriority date. We know that.\n  Other industry participants will be able to easily determine the \npatent's priority date, allowing them to measure the patent against \nprior art and determine if it is valid. There will be no opportunity to \nfraudulently backdate the priority date. That date will depend on a \ngovernment document, not privately held files.\n  Most U.S. businesses already effectively operate under the first-to-\nfile system. They file applications promptly because it is difficult \nand risky to rely on proof of invention dates to defeat a competing \napplication that was filed earlier. Also, because the rest of the world \nuses first to file, U.S. investors need to secure first-to-file \npriority if they want their patents to be valid anywhere outside of \nthis country.\n  For many U.S. businesses the America Invents Act does not change the \nsystem under which they operate. Rather, it simply allows American \nbusinesses to comply with just one set of rules rather than being \nforced to operate under two different systems.\n  Another one of the bill's clear improvements over current law is its \nstreamlined definition of the term ``prior art.'' Public uses and sales \nof an invention will remain prior art, but only if they make the \ninvention available to the public. An inventor's confidential sale of \nhis invention, his demonstration of its use to a private group, or a \nthird party's unrestricted but private use of the invention will no \nlonger constitute private art. Only the sale or offer for sale of the \ninvention to the relevant public or its use in a way that makes it \npublicly accessible will constitute prior art.\n  The main benefit of the AIA public availability standard of prior art \nis that it is relatively inexpensive to establish the existence of \nevents that make an invention available to the public. Under current \nlaw, depositions and litigation discovery are required in order to \nidentify all of the inventor's private dealings with third parties and \ndetermine whether those dealings constitute a secret offer for sale or \nthird party use that invalidates the patent under the current law's \nforfeiture doctrines. The need for such discovery is eliminated once \nthe definition of ``prior art'' is limited to those activities that \nmake the intention accessible to the public. This will greatly reduce \nthe time and cost of patent litigation and allow the courts and the PTO \nto operate much more efficiently.\n  Both of these last two changes--the first to file and the new \ndefinition of ``prior art''--will also protect American inventors \nagainst theft of their invention both at home and abroad. Under current \nlaw, if an American inventor sells or otherwise discloses his \ninvention, there is a risk that an unscrupulous third party will steal \nthe idea and file a U.S. patent for it. If the thief claims he himself \nmade the invention before the U.S. inventor, then the U.S. inventor \nwill need to prove the invention was stolen from him. Current law even \nallows activities that occur in a foreign country to establish a \npriority date for a U.S. patent. Thus, if a U.S. inventor who has been \na victim of theft is unable to prove that activities alleged to have \noccurred in China or India, say, never actually took place, he not only \nloses his patent but the foreign thief can obtain a U.S. patent and \nblock the U.S. inventor from practicing his own invention.\n  Finally, under current law, even if the U.S. inventor files a patent \napplication right away, his rights still are not secure. Under current \nlaw, an early filing date can be defeated by another applicant's claim \nthat he conceived of the invention earlier. Thus a foreign thief can \nclaim he came up with the idea in his overseas laboratory, and the U.S. \ninventor would bear the burden of proving that a fraud had been \nperpetrated in a foreign country.\n  Under the America Invents Act, by contrast it will be much harder for \nthieves, both foreign and domestic, to steal a U.S. inventor's \ninvention. Under this bill, if a U.S. inventor publicly discloses his \ninvention, no third party's application filed after that date can be \nvalid because the filing date is what will determine priority, not a \npurported date of conception. Nor can a third party easily \ncontrive fake prior art to defeat the patent. Under the AIA, only those \nactions that made the invention publicly available will constitute \nprior art, and these are much harder to fake than are claims of having \nsecretly made the invention in a private laboratory, again, say, in \nChina. Under new section 102(b)(1)(B), once the U.S. inventor discloses \nhis invention, no subsequent prior art can defeat the invention. The \nU.S. inventor does not need to prove that the third party disclosures \nfollowing his own disclosures are derived from him. He can thus take \nfull advantage of the grace period and disclose his invention in \nacademic papers and at trade shows without worrying that such \ndisclosures will lead to theft or fraudulent invalidation of his \npatent.\n\n  Similarly, under the America Invents Act, once the U.S. inventor \nfiles even a provisional application, his rights will be secured. Under \nthis bill, no one can file a later application but claim an earlier \npriority date because the priority date is set by the filing date. The \nprovisional application also constitutes section 103 prior art as of \nits filing date. As a result, a third party's patent for a trivial or \nobvious variation of the patent will be invalid and will not crowd out \nthe original inventor's patent rights.\n  Finally, validating prior art will depend on publicly accessible \ninformation, not private activities that take place, for example, in a \nforeign land. As a result, it will be impossible for a third party who \nderived the invention from a U.S. inventor's public disclosure or \npatent application to steal the invention or sabotage the U.S. \ninventor's patent. The only way to obtain priority or invalidate the \ninvention would be to file or publicly disclose the invention before \nthe U.S. inventor has done so--something that will obviously be \nimpossible for the deriver to do.\n  Finally, I would like to talk about false marking for a moment. I \nwould like to describe the bill's important reforms to the false \nmarking statute. The America Invents Act reins in abuses that are \nreflected in a recent surge in false marking litigation. It allows such \nsuits to be brought only by those parties who have actually suffered a \ncompetitive injury as a result of false marking.\n  Currently, such suits are often brought by parties asserting no \nactual competitive injury from the marking--or who do not even patent \nor manufacture anything in a relevant industry. Many cases have been \nbrought by patent lawyers themselves claiming the right to enforce a \nfine of $500 for every marked product. One manufacturer of plastic cups \nwho stamped his patent number on his cups was recently sued by a lawyer \nfor $500 for each disposable\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\ncup that was sold, for a gargantuan total of $9 trillion.\n  In reality, the bulk of these suits settle for their nuisance value, \nthe costs of continuing to litigate. They represent a tax that patent \nlawyers are imposing on domestic manufacturing--a shift in wealth to \nlawyers that comes at the expense of manufacturing jobs. Well, this \nbill prevents such abuses by repealing the statute's qui tam action \nwhile still allowing parties who have separate actual injury from false \nmarking to sue and allowing the United States to enforce a $500-per-\nproduct fine where appropriate. Qui tam statues are a relic of the 19th \ncentury and generally produce far more litigation than is in the public \ninterest. Almost all of these statutes have been repealed.\n  The America Invents Act continues this trend. By repealing the false \nmarking qui tam statute, the AIA will allow American companies to spend \nmoney hiring new workers rather than fighting off frivolous false \nmarking suits.\n  In conclusion, the America Invents Act will provide important \nbenefits to U.S. inventors of all sizes, to startup companies, to \ndomestic manufacturing, and to the U.S. economy generally. I look \nforward to its passage by the Senate and its enactment into law.\n  As the majority leader stated in his remarks in leader time, I hope \nthose who may have amendments will immediately file those amendments so \nthe Senate can take them up in good order, have plenty of time to \ndebate them, and dispose of them in the appropriate way. It would be my \nhope the Senate will end up passing the bill adopted by the House of \nRepresentatives so our action can result in sending the bill directly \nto the President for his signature. That is an accomplishment that \ncould be achieved with cooperation between the House and the Senate, \nbetween Democrats and Republicans, between the legislative and \nexecutive branches, and I think it would certainly begin to mark the \ntime when the American people could see their legislative \nrepresentatives begin to work together on their behalf.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as I suspect you know, Vermont has been \nhit very hard by Hurricane Irene. The storm caused widespread flooding, \nresulting in a number of deaths, the loss of many homes and businesses, \nand hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to property and \ninfrastructure.\n  I have visited many of the most hard-hit towns in the past week, \nincluding Ludlow, Wilmington, Brattleboro, Berlin, Moretown, and \nWaterbury. I was shocked and moved by the extent of the damage I \nsaw. Many towns still have very limited access because the roads and \nbridges that link them to the world have been destroyed. This disaster \nwill go down in history as one of the very worst natural disasters in \nthe history of the State of Vermont.\n\n  Let me take this opportunity to personally thank the emergency rescue \nteams and all those aiding the victims of the floods for their \noutstanding work. Local crews, along with the Vermont National Guard, \nand Guard units from other States, such as New Hampshire, Maine, and \nIllinois, have airline-lifted food, water, blankets, and medicine to \nthe worst hit towns. Police, fire, and local officials have also done \nan extraordinary job.\n  We still don't know the cost of this disaster--it probably will not \nbe tabulated for a while--but let me share a few figures in terms of \nwhat we have experienced. Just days after the declaration of a major \ndisaster by the President, more than 2,000 Vermonters had already \nregistered with FEMA--2,000. To date, there have been more than 700 \nhomes confirmed as severely damaged or destroyed.\n  I had the opportunity to go to some trailer parks in Berlin, in \ncentral Vermont, and I was down in the southern part of the State in \nBrattleboro and it is an incredibly sad sight to see. Mobile homes, \nwhere senior citizens were living, have been destroyed. They are now \nforced to relocate. It was a very tragic circumstance.\n  Further, the storm has knocked out 135 segments of the State highway \nsystem, as well as 35 State bridges, completely isolating 13 \ncommunities for several days. An unknown number of farms and businesses \nhave been destroyed.\n  I was down in Wilmington, a beautiful town in the southern part of \nthe State on Route 9. Virtually their entire downtown business \ncommunity has been severely damaged, and that is clearly undermining \nthe fabric not only of the economy of that town but of towns throughout \nthe State.\n  Our Amtrak and freight rail services were completely suspended as \ntracks literally washed into rivers. So we had tracks underwater. The \nState's largest office complex is located in Waterbury, VT, a few miles \nfrom our capital, Montpelier, and I visited that facility. It had been \ncompletely flooded. There are 1,700 people who work there. For a small \nState, that is a lot of people--1,700 people--who work in our major \noffice complex in Waterbury. That has now been shut down for an \nindefinite period of time. That impacts, obviously, the State's ability \nto provide services to the people of Vermont.\n  At least 65 public schools were impacted and could not open on time. \nSchool is just beginning, with 65 public schools not able to open on \ntime. This is just a short list of some of the devastation that is \ngoing on in the State.\n  I also want to call to the attention of the Senate another \nextraordinary tragedy in our State, and that is the death of a \ngentleman named Michael Garafano. Mr. Garafano was an employee of the \ncity of Rutland, and Rutland was very hard hit by this disaster. He and \nhis son went up to a local dam to inspect the condition of the dam. \nThey were hit by a flash flood and both of them lost their lives. So \nhere we have an extraordinary public servant, trying to protect the \nwell-being of the people of Rutland, and he gave his life in that \neffort. Mr. Garafano's effort will never be forgotten.\n  As we go forward--not just for Vermont but for New Jersey, for North \nCarolina, and we know upstate New York was also hard hit--I have every \nconfidence the Senate and the House will do for Hurricane Irene as we \nhave done for other natural disasters that have impacted different \nparts of our country, and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto make sure, as Americans, we rebuild the communities in Vermont and \nin other sections of the country that were devastated by this terrible \nflood.\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, later today the Senate will consider \nthe nomination by the President of Judge Bernice Donald for the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Judge Donald is from Memphis, TN. I know her \nwell. I am here today to introduce her to my colleagues and to \nencourage them to support her confirmation.\n  Judge Donald has been before the Senate before. She has been a \nFederal district judge since 1995. Our Judiciary Committee in the \nSenate has looked over her qualifications again and has recommended her \nto us without dissent. The American Bar Association has reviewed her \ncredentials and said she is either qualified or well qualified.\n  I think there is not much doubt about her fitness to serve on the \ncourt of appeals, so in my remarks I would like to talk more about \nJudge Donald's role in the community and her role as a pioneer in our \ncountry during her lifetime. She is the sixth of 10 children. Her \nparents were a domestic worker and a self-taught mechanic in DeSoto \nCounty, MS, which is just south of Memphis. As a young person, she was \namong the first African Americans to integrate in her high school \nduring the period of desegregation. She obtained a bachelor's degree \nfrom the University of Memphis and graduated from its law school. She \nfocused her career at the beginning working among the most vulnerable \ncitizens in Memphis in the Office of Legal Defender.\n  Here is where the pioneer story continues, not just in desegregating \nher high school or working with vulnerable citizens, but only 3 years \nafter she left law school, she began a judicial career that has spanned \nnearly three decades. She became the first African-American female \njudge in the history of our State in 1982. Six years later, the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, upon which she has been nominated to serve by \nthe President, appointed her to serve as U.S. bankruptcy judge for the \nWestern District of Tennessee. Again she made history--an African-\nAmerican female judge had been appointed as a bankruptcy judge in the \nUnited States. Then, in 1995, as I mentioned earlier, President Clinton \nnominated her to be a Federal district judge. On December 22 of that \nyear the Senate confirmed her by unanimous voice vote, and she became \nthe first African-American female district court judge in the history \nof Tennessee. She served in that capacity for 15 years.\n\n  She has flourished in her career, not just on the court but in her \nprofession. She has just concluded a 3-year term as Secretary of the \nAmerican Bar Association, and she has previously served on its \nCommittee on Governance and on its Board of Governors. She has been \nequally active in the local and Tennessee bar associations. She gives a \ngood deal of her time to community organizations: the Memphis Literacy \nCouncil, the University of Memphis alumni board, Big Brothers, Big \nSisters, Calvary Street Ministry, the YWCA, and others.\n  It is coincidental, but I think it is fitting that Judge Bernice \nDonald, a pioneer in so many ways in our State's history, will be the \nfirst nomination for the Federal bench that this body will consider \nafter the opening of the Martin Luther King Memorial in the Nation's \nCapital. Her life, which is full of education and service and \nachievement, is a testimonial to the success of Dr. King's movement and \nthe kind of leadership he inspired.\n  I commend her on all that she has accomplished both in her profession \nand in our State and in her community. I know Memphis is proud of her. \nI look forward to voting in favor of her confirmation this afternoon, \nand I hope my colleagues will do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, is there a nominee to report?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5322-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Bernice Bouie Donald, of \nTennessee, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the \nnomination of Bernice Bouie Donald as a U.S. Circuit Judge for the \nSixth Circuit. With today's vote, we will have confirmed 34 article III \njudicial nominees during this Congress.\n  We continue to make great progress in processing President Obama's \njudicial nominees. We have taken positive action on 78 percent of the \njudicial nominations submitted during this Congress. The Senate has \nconfirmed 63 percent of President Obama's nominees since the beginning \nof his Presidency, including two Supreme Court Justices, which everyone \nmay recall was a lengthy process.\n  Despite our productive efforts, we continue to hear unsubstantiated \nand unfounded charges of delays and obstruction on the part of the \nminority party of the Senate. Over the August recess, opinion writers \nand bloggers parroted one another in churning out this message of \nobstruction on the part of the Republicans. I am not surprised to see \nthis from outside groups. However, I was very disappointed the White \nHouse joined in publishing a distorted record on judicial nominations. \nI had a meeting this year with the White House Counsel's Office, and at \nthat meeting I expressed my intent to move forward as the Republican \nleader of the Judiciary Committee Republicans on consensus nominees. I \nthought we had cooperative and productive conversations with the White \nHouse. Furthermore, I have demonstrated a record, on the part of the \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee, of cooperation and action \nregarding judicial nominees.\n  But in a White House blog that was titled ``Record Judicial \nDiversity, Record Judicial Delays'' the White House characterized ``the \ndelays these nominees are encountering'' as unprecedented. The White \nHouse has a short memory or a very limited definition to characterize \nthe nominations process as ``unprecedented.''\n  To illustrate, the blog cites a statistic on the average wait time \nbetween the Judiciary Committee reporting out a nominee and \nconfirmation on the Senate floor as evidence of an unprecedented delay. \nFor example, it indicates circuit nominees of President Bush only \nwaited 29 days, while President Obama's circuit nominees waited 151 \ndays.\n  The nominations process, as everyone knows but maybe the White House \nneeds to be informed about, is more than Senate floor action. It starts \nwith the President actually nominating somebody. I have previously \ncommented on the White House delay in sending nominations and have \ncriticized some of the qualities of the nominees the White House has \nsubmitted. I will not elaborate on that today. But after a nomination \nis received, there is a process for hearing, for questions, and for \ncommittee debate prior to our committee vote. For whatever reason,\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\nthe White House blog fact sheet ignored the bulk of the process.\n  The record shows, then, that we are moving nominees through committee \nmuch faster than President Bush's nominees. For instance, President \nObama's circuit court nominees have only waited, on average, 68 days \nfor a hearing. President Bush's circuit court nominees were forced to \nwait over 247 days. President Obama's district court nominees have been \nafforded a hearing in just 78 days. President Bush's district court \nnominees, on the other hand, had to wait close to 120 days. So we can \nsee how wrong the White House blog is when they just cite the waiting \nperiod between the committee reporting out and actually voting on it.\n  Not only are President Obama's judicial nominees receiving hearings \nquicker than those of President Bush, they are also being reported out \nof committee more quickly. Circuit court nominees have been reported to \nthe Senate floor in just 118 days, while President Bush's circuit court \nnominees were held for 369 days before they saw a vote in committee. \nThe same is true for district court nominees. President Obama's \nnominees have been reported in just 129 days, while President Bush's \ndistrict court nominees waited 148 days. Despite the so-called \nobstruction, we are confirming President Obama's circuit court nominees \nfaster than those nominated by President Bush. That is the cooperation \nI promised. Thus far, circuit court nominees have been confirmed, on \naverage, in 259 days. President Bush's circuit court nominees waited, \non average, 350 days.\n  The White House blog also stated that 21 months is the ``[l]ongest \nwait for one of President Obama's judicial confirmations.'' This is \nneither unprecedented nor uncommon. The Democrats should know; they \nheld President Bush's circuit court nominee Raymond Kethledge for 23 \nmonths before he was confirmed by the Senate, and then when he was \nconfirmed, he was confirmed on a consensus voice vote basis. In \naddition, the record will show district nominees who waited well over 1 \nyear for confirmation, one of them as long as 441 days.\n  After today's vote, there will be 19 judicial nominees on the \nExecutive Calendar. If you listened to my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, you would conclude that this, too, is ``unprecedented.'' \nBut again, the record demonstrates otherwise.\n  Colleagues may recall a period in the 108th Congress when the \nDemocrats--in the minority at that time--completely shut down the \njudicial nominations process. Not only were there numerous filibusters \nconducted by my friends on the other side of the aisle, but they would \nallow no votes on judicial nominees. As a result, in April and May of \n2004, when George W. Bush was President, 32 highly qualified judicial \nnominees awaited final votes while on the Executive Calendar. Only \nafter a compromise was reached did judicial nomination votes resume on \nthose who were on the Executive Calendar.\n  I could continue to rebut this outrageous assertion that Senate \nRepublicans are somehow paving new ground, according to the White House \nblog. The facts demonstrate that the current status of nominations is \nnot--not--unprecedented. It is unfortunate that the media, the \nbloggers, and even this administration continue to distort the facts. I \nwould rather use my time to speak on positive actions, such as the \nnominee we are about to confirm. But if my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle wish to continue to live in the past, then I feel, as \nleader of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, the need to \ncorrect the record.\n  I support the nomination before us today, and I congratulate Judge \nDonald. I wish to say a few words about her before we vote.\n  Bernice Donald is nominated to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth \nCircuit. Judge Donald received her undergraduate degree and law degree \nfrom the University of Memphis. After graduating from law school, Judge \nDonald worked for a few months as a sole practitioner. In April of \n1980, she began work as a staff attorney for the Memphis Area Legal \nServices Clinic. In November of 1980, she began working as an assistant \npublic defender at the Shelby County Public Defender's Office.\n  In 1982, Judge Donald was elected to serve as a judge on the Court of \nGeneral Sessions in Shelby County. As a general sessions judge, Judge \nDonald presided over trials of State misdemeanor offenses, and the \npreliminary hearings of State felony cases involving alleged crimes \nagainst persons as well as property.\n  In 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit appointed \nJudge Donald to a 14-year term on the Bankruptcy Court.\n  In 1996, Judge Donald was confirmed by the Senate and appointed by \nPresident Clinton as United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Tennessee. She has served as a Federal judge for the past \n15 years.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has given Judge Donald a rating of substantial majority \n``well-qualified''; minority ``qualified.''\n  Mr. President, if I could, I wish to take 2 minutes to speak about \nthe second vote we are having today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                    Leahy-Smith America Invents Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support cloture \non the motion to proceed to H.R. 1249, the Leahy-Smith America Invents \nAct. This bipartisan legislation will make our patent system more \neffective and more efficient. It will enhance transparency and patent \nquality and improve certainty in the patent process. It will also \nenhance the ability of the Patent and Trademark Office to cut its \nbacklog and process patent applications in a more expeditious manner. \nUltimately, this bill will help promote innovation and technological \nadvancements and will provide a stimulus for American businesses and, \nobviously, will help generate new jobs.\n  My colleagues will recall the Senate passed the bill we entitled the \nAmerica Invents Act earlier this year by a margin of 95 to 5. The House \nbill is very similar to our Senate bill, so Senators should not have a \nproblem supporting it. In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act \nenjoys the widespread support of a large number of industries and other \nstakeholders from within the United States patent community.\n  I am pleased to support the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed so we \ncan get this bill done as soon as possible.\n\n\n                      Natural Disaster in Vermont\n\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield the floor, but before I do, I wish \nto say to Senator Leahy we are all sorry for the natural disasters that \nhave happened in his State, wish him well and his State well, and, \nobviously, there will be some congressional action to help not only \nthat natural disaster but the rest of the natural disaster that \noccurred as a result of Irene.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield on that point, I \nwould tell my good friend from Iowa how touched I was when I received \nhis e-mail saying how the people of Iowa have stood with the people of \nVermont, as we did with the people of Iowa when they faced a disaster. \nWhen I received the e-mail, the Governor of our State, Governor \nShumlin, and I and the head of our Vermont National Guard, General \nDubie, had just helicoptered into one of our prettiest towns, but it \nwas totally cut off. The only way we could reach it was by helicopter. \nI saw people working together. Nobody knew whether they were \nRepublicans or Democrats or cared. They were all working together to \nhelp each other.\n  I will tell my friend from Iowa, I took the liberty of showing his \nvery meaningful, very heartfelt e-mail--similar, also, to ones I got \nfrom other Senators--and I thought how much that meant. If I might \naddress the Senator from Iowa directly, I will tell you, the people of \nVermont appreciate it because I know how heartfelt it was. It meant a \ngreat deal.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are on the question of the flooding in \nVermont. I was born in Vermont. I have lived there all of my life. We \nlive on a dirt road in a small town, Middlesex, up about 1,000 feet, in \nan 1850s farmhouse. It means a lot to us. It is a place my wife \nMarcelle and I spent part of our honeymoon 49 years ago. But I saw \nsomething I had never seen before in Vermont. Ten days ago, Vermont \nbore the full brunt of then-Tropical\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nStorm Irene as it dumped more than 6 inches of rain across the State in \njust a few hours. You have to understand, in our small State--with the \nGreen Mountains running down the spine of it, north to south--the \nnarrow valleys of the Green Mountains, where towns, roads, and rivers \nare historically intertwined, were particularly hard hit as gentle \nrivers and streams became rushing torrents of destruction. Whole towns \nwere cut off from the outside world for days. You would fly over, and \nyou could see a town completely marooned--every road going into it, \nevery bridge going into it gone. Homes, businesses, water systems, and \nmiles of roads were swept away. Even worse, some Vermonters lost their \nlives in these devastating floods.\n  In our State, we have had an unprecedented wave of flooding this \nyear. We had two spring events previously declared as major disasters. \nVermonters have shouldered these great burdens. We have pulled together \nfrom all parts of the State, all walks of life. We are meeting this new \ncrisis with the same courage, cooperation, and resilience we Vermonters \nhave always shown.\n  I applaud the brave first responders--the police departments, the \nfire departments, the EMS, and others--the National Guard members who \nhave worked around the clock. Our National Guard in Vermont has been \njoined by the National Guard from Illinois and Maine, and we have had \noffers from our other adjoining States. I also applaud the power crews \nand road crews. I remember how impressed I was looking down there from \nthe helicopter and seeing this long line of power trucks coming down \nthe road and knowing they are going to be working around the clock. I \nalso applaud the many others who have helped in the recovery and \nrebuilding process--our local Red Cross and other service \norganizations.\n\n  But our small State--it is only 660,000 people--is stretched to the \nlimit right now, and we need both immediate and ongoing assistance in \nrecovering from these enormous setbacks. Winter is fast approaching. In \nVermont, snow will be flying in a matter of weeks, certainly in a \nmatter of a couple months. We must move quickly to secure our homes and \nbusinesses, restore our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our \nschools, and our medical facilities. With just weeks to accomplish so \nmuch, we need the full and immediate support of FEMA and so many of our \nFederal agencies.\n  I appreciate President Obama's swift approval of Governor Shumlin's \nrequest to declare most of Vermont a Federal disaster area--something \nall of us in the Vermont delegation joined him in. But I am greatly \nconcerned FEMA may not have adequate resources to meet the immediate \nassistance needs of the Irene victims in Vermont and all the other \nStates. We do not consider ourselves an island here. We know a whole \nlot of other States were badly hurt by Irene. FEMA has less than $600 \nmillion in its disaster account for the rest of fiscal year 2011. OMB \nsaid today that FEMA needs at least $1.5 billion for recovery \nassistance in States affected by Hurricane Irene.\n  We need to act quickly to find a solution to this pressing problem. I \ndo not think any of us wants to get into a situation where we underfund \nFEMA at this critical juncture, and then have FEMA run out of resources \nnext spring, just as rebuilding efforts get going on the East Coast.\n  Given the breadth and depth of Irene's destruction, on top of the \nongoing disasters already declared in all 50 States, I am going to \ncontinue to work with the Democratic leader, the Republican leader, the \nAppropriations Committee, and all of my colleagues to ensure that FEMA \nhas the resources they need to help all of our citizens at this time of \ndisaster--not just in Vermont but in all of our States.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. President, as many Members know, I opposed the war in Iraq, \nbelieving it had nothing to do with 9/11. It turned out it had nothing \nto do with 9/11. I thought there were no weapons of mass destruction. \nIt turned out there were no weapons of mass destruction. Iraq is a \ncountry that bore no threat to the United States. It did to Iran but \nnot to the United States.\n  We have spent hundreds of billions, ultimately well over a trillion \ndollars, in Iraq. Year after year that money is just sent--no offset; \nit is put on the credit card. It is time to get out of Iraq and start \nthinking about people in America. It is time to take care of Americans. \nThe needs of Americans are not just in a disaster but in the needs of \nAmericans in their education, their medical care, our scientific \nresearch to find cures for cancer and Alzheimer's, to take care of the \nhousing needs of America, to take care of our rivers and bridges. It is \ntime to start worrying about this great country of ours. It is time to \nstart paying for that which can give benefits immediately to Americans \nand make sure we have enough to care for the families and our returning \nsoldiers who so bravely answered the call. Let's start thinking about \nthe needs of 325 million Americans. Let's come home to the things we \nneed. Because if we do that, we can then still be the force for good \nthroughout the world. We can still fulfill commitments, legitimate \ncommitments we have around the world. We can still be the humanitarian \nnation we have always been when there have been disasters in Haiti, in \nIndonesia, in Africa, or elsewhere. But we have neglected America too \nlong.\n  Mr. President, I understand I have some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I was disappointed that before the August recess, the \nSenate was not allowed to take greater steps to address the serious \njudicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country. As we \nresume consideration of pending judicial nominations, there are 20 \nnominees fully considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee and ready \nfor final Senate action. Of those, 16 were approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously, without a single Republican or Democratic \nSenator in opposition.\n  The nomination of Judge Bernice Donald of Tennessee is one such \nnomination. This is a nomination that has been waiting for Senate \nconsideration, despite the support of her Republican home State \nSenators, since May 9. Nearly 4 months ago, the Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported her nomination without opposition. This is \nreminiscent of the nomination of Jane Stranch of Tennessee. She, too, \nhad the support of her Republican home State Senators, but her \nconfirmation was nonetheless stalled--inexplicably--by Senate \nRepublicans. Judge Stranch was finally confirmed in September 2010, \nafter an extended and unnecessary 10-month delay. These Tennessee \nnominations were the subject of a column by Professor Carl Tobias in \nearly August, which I inserted in the Record on August 2. I, too, had \nhoped the Senate would be allowed to vote on this nomination last \nmonth. I am glad that we finally have agreement for a vote tonight.\n  At this point in the Presidency of George W. Bush, 144 Federal \ncircuit and district court judges had been confirmed. On September 6 of \nthe third year of President Clinton's administration, 162 Federal \ncircuit and district court judges had been confirmed. By comparison, \nalthough there are 20 judicial nominees stalled and awaiting final \nconsideration by the Senate--many of them stalled since May and June--\neven after the confirmation of Judge Donald, the total confirmations of \nFederal circuit and district court judges confirmed during the first 3 \nyears of the Obama administration will only be 96.\n  In the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during President \nBush's first term, the Senate confirmed 100 Federal circuit and \ndistrict judges. By contrast, President Obama is approaching his 32nd \nmonth in office and we have yet to reach that total. The Senate has a \nlong way to go before the end of next year to match the 205 \nconfirmations of President Bush's judicial nominees during his first \nterm.\n  To understand the strain on the Federal judiciary and the American \npeople, it is important to note another set of comparisons. The number \nof judicial vacancies was reduced during the first years of the Bush \nand Clinton administration. The vacancies in early September in the \nthird year of the Bush administration had been reduced to 54. The \nvacancies in early September in\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\nthe third year of the Clinton administration had been reduced to 55. By \ncontrast, the judicial vacancies now in September of the third year of \nthe Obama administration stand at 93. As the Congressional Research \nService confirmed in a recent report, this is a historically high level \nof vacancies and this is now the longest period of historically high \nvacancy rates on the Federal judiciary in the last 35 years.\n  Even though Federal judicial vacancies have remained near or above 90 \nfor more than 2 years, the Senate's Republican leadership continues to \ndelay votes on many qualified, consensus nominations. After tonight, \nthere will remain 15 unanimously reported nominees stalled on the \ncalendar. This is not the way to make real progress. In the past, we \nwere able to confirm consensus nominees more promptly, often within \ndays of being reported to the full Senate. They were not forced to \nlanguish for months. The American people should not have to wait more \nweeks and months for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and \nensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to \nAmericans around the country.\n  It is not accurate to pretend that real progress is being made in \nthese circumstances. Vacancies are being kept high, consensus nominees \nare being delayed, and it is the American people and the Federal courts \nthat are being made to suffer. This is another area in which we must \ncome together for the American people. There is no reason Senators \ncannot join together to finally bring down the excessive number of \nvacancies that have persisted on Federal courts throughout the Nation \nfor far too long.\n  At a time when judicial vacancies remain near or above 90, these \nneedless delays perpetuate the judicial vacancies crisis that Chief \nJustice Roberts wrote of last December and that the President, the \nAttorney General, bar associations, and chief judges around the country \nhave urged us to join together to end. The Senate can and should be \ndoing a better job working to ensure the ability of our Federal courts \nto provide justice to Americans across the country.\n  We were able to lower vacancies dramatically during President Bush's \nyears in office, cutting them in half during his first term. The Senate \nhas reversed course during the Obama administration, and with \nRepublican objections slowing the pace of confirmations, judicial \nvacancies have been at crisis levels for over 2 years. As a recent \nreport by the Constitutional Accountability Center noted, ``Never \nbefore has the number of vacancies risen so sharply and remained so \nhigh for so long during a President's term.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat an August 5 letter to the editor of the Washington Post from Wade \nHenderson, entitled ``Remiss in confirming judges,'' and an August 4 \narticle in Politico from Andrew Blotky and Doug Kendall entitled ``It's \nSenate's duty to confirm judges,'' be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (see \nExhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Over the 8 years of the Bush administration, from 2001 to \n2009, we reduced judicial vacancies from 110 to a low of 34. The \nvacancy rate--which we reduced from 10 percent to 6 percent by this \ndate in President Bush's third year, and ultimately to less than 4 \npercent in 2008--is back above 10 percent. Federal judicial vacancies \nnow stand at 93.\n  Time and time again over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I have urged the \nSenate to come together and work to address this crisis. At the \nbeginning of this year, I called for a return to regular order in the \nconsideration of nominations. We have seen that approach work on the \nJudiciary Committee. I have thanked the Judiciary Committee's ranking \nmember, Senator Grassley, many times for his cooperation with me to \nmake sure that the committee continues to make progress in the \nconsideration of nominations. His approach has been the right approach. \nRegrettably, it has not been matched on the floor, where the refusal by \nRepublican leadership to come to regular time agreements to consider \nnominations has put our progress--our positive action--at risk.\n  I expect the committee in the weeks ahead to continue to make \nprogress and favorably report superbly qualified, consensus judicial \nnominations to fill vacancies in States throughout the country, in \nStates with Democratic and Republican Senators. Most of these \nnominations will, I expect, join the 15 on the calendar after tonight's \nvote that were reported unanimously. I hope that the Americans in those \ndistricts will not have to wait for months for the Senate to act to \nfill the vacancies and ensure that the Federal courts in their States \nhave the judges they need.\n  Republican obstruction has led to a backlog of dozens of judicial \nnominations pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. Half of the \njudicial nominations on the calendar would fill judicial emergency \nvacancies. Many were ready for final consideration and confirmation in \nMay and June.\n  Republican leadership should explain to the people and Senators from \nSouth Carolina, Missouri, Louisiana, Maine, New York, Texas, \nConnecticut, Pennsylvania, and Florida why there continue to be \nvacancies on the Federal courts in their States that could easily be \nfilled if the Senate would vote on the President's qualified, consensus \nnominees. Yet those nominees still wait for months on the Senate's \ncalendar. These damaging delays leave the people of these States to \nbear the brunt of having too few judges available to do the work of the \nFederal courts.\n  All 20 of the judicial nominations on the calendar today have been \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary Committee after a fair but thorough \nprocess. We review extensive background material on each nominee. All \nSenators on the committee, Democratic and Republican, have the \nopportunity to ask the nominees questions at a live hearing. Senators \nalso have the opportunity to ask questions in writing following the \nhearing and to meet with the nominees. All of these nominees have a \nstrong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to \nthe Constitution. They should not be delayed for weeks and months \nneedlessly after being so thoroughly and fairly considered by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I continue to urge the Senate to join together to end the judicial \nvacancies crisis that concerns Chief Justice Roberts, the President, \nthe Attorney General, bar associations, and chief judges around the \ncountry. I hope that this month Senators will finally join together to \nbegin to bring down the excessive number of vacancies that have \npersisted on Federal courts throughout the Nation for far too long. We \ncan and must do better. Vacancies are being kept high, consensus \nnominees are being delayed, and it is the American people and the \nFederal courts that are being made to suffer.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 5, 2011]\n\n                      Remiss in Confirming Judges\n\n                          (By Wade Henderson)\n\n       In Ben Pershing's close-to-complete Aug. 2 Fed Page roundup \n     of the most important stories overshadowed by the debt-\n     ceiling debate [``Debt debate isn't only story on Capitol \n     Hill,'' In Session], one story that failed to make the cut \n     was how the Senate's refusal to vote on 20 judicial nominees \n     before recess has led to almost as many vacancies on the \n     federal bench--111--as there were in January.\n       During the past two months, the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     has steadily processed nominations, yet the Senate has voted \n     on a mere nine judges. There is no reason to delay confirming \n     every one of the nominees pending before the full Senate. All \n     but one enjoyed strong bipartisan support in committee. In \n     fact, 17 of the 20 were approved without recorded opposition.\n       Many of these seats have been designated as ``judicial \n     emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \n     Courts, meaning there are simply not enough judges to get the \n     work done. More and more people seeking to protect their \n     rights in a court of law are forced to wait, and justice \n     delayed is all too often justice denied.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Politico, Aug. 3, 2011]\n\n                  It's Senate's Duty To Confirm Judges\n\n                  (By Andrew Blotky and Doug Kendall)\n\n       While Washington has been consumed by the debt ceiling \n     crisis, another serious crisis demands the attention of \n     President Barack Obama and the Senate: the threat to justice \n     by our overworked federal judiciary.\n       There aren't enough judges to hear the cases piling up in \n     federal courtrooms across the country--which for countless \n     Americans means justice significantly delayed and denied.\n       Our federal courts, which hear cases brought by ordinary \n     Americans to vindicate rights guaranteed by the Constitution, \n     are overworked and understaffed. Today's federal judiciary \n     resembles our armed forces--\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\n     stretched thin and deployed on multiple tours of duty.\n       There are now almost 90 empty seats on the federal bench, \n     with 22 more retirements on the way.\n       Make no mistake, judges now on the bench are doing their \n     part--and then some. Last month, federal Judge Malcolm Muir \n     died in his chambers at age 96, while working on Social \n     Security appeals. Muir had continued to work literally until \n     his last breath, to reduce the case backlog caused by a judge \n     shortage. He was the fourth oldest judge on the federal bench \n     when he died. Last December, U.S. District Judge James F. \n     McClure Jr. died at age 79--also while working at the \n     courthouse.\n       With fewer new judges being confirmed, the third branch of \n     government is increasingly run by judges working well into \n     their 80s, 90s and even 100s.\n       ``The way we are going,'' 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \n     Judge Richard Cudahy, age 84, said, ``it looks to me as if \n     most of the judicial work is going to be done by 80- and 90-\n     year-olds like me . . . since they will be the only ones left \n     to do anything.''\n       There have been at least 80 vacancies on the federal courts \n     for the past 760 straight days and counting, according to a \n     recent Constitutional Accountability Center study. At the \n     same time, only 35 new permanent judgeships have been \n     authorized by Congress in the past 20 years--even as the \n     overall federal caseload has expanded by fully a third.\n       The third branch is deteriorating largely because of \n     unprecedented Republican obstruction. Senate Republicans \n     refuse to agree to votes for well-qualified nominees, who \n     enjoy the unanimous support of their Republican and \n     Democratic colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n     Today, 16 such nominees are waiting for a vote by the Senate, \n     with four more qualified nominees approved by the Judiciary \n     Committee, and new nominations being added regularly to the \n     Senate calendar.\n       Some Republican senators are blocking--or placing holds--on \n     judicial nominations for reasons unrelated to justice, to \n     serve their own political interests. Republican senators are \n     also delaying or blocking nominees who would fill seats in \n     courtrooms so overwhelmed with cases that they are deemed by \n     the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to be \n     ``judicial emergencies.'' It is a level of obstruction not \n     seen under any previous president in U.S. history.\n       Again, numbers tell the story. The glacial pace of judicial \n     confirmations has seen the number of judicial vacancies \n     explode from 55, when Obama took office, to 88 today. By this \n     time in the Bush administration, the Senate had confirmed 40 \n     percent more judges than it has during the Obama \n     administration.\n       Astonishingly, in the past two months, the Senate has voted \n     on just 11 nominations. The chamber could have easily \n     confirmed judges while awaiting a final debt ceiling deal. \n     Instead Republicans blocked, stalled and delayed.\n       The Senate has now recessed for a month, yet the work of \n     the courts continues.\n       When judicial vacancies remain at such record levels, \n     needless delays create a crisis that has drawn concern from \n     all corners--including Chief Justice John Roberts, Attorney \n     General Eric Holder, federal judges around the country and \n     bar associations.\n       The Senate is failing in one of its key constitutional \n     duties. It is preventing the third branch of government from \n     doing its job--and making it impossible for Americans to have \n     their cases heard in a timely fashion.\n       The solution is simple. With no Supreme Court nomination \n     battle consuming Washington this fall, there are no excuses. \n     The Senate should vote on these waiting nominees at the \n     earliest possible moment when it returns from its August \n     recess.\n       It is time for the Senate to do what the Constitution \n     commands--advise and consent to the nomination of qualified \n     judges. The long-term health of the third branch of \n     government depends on it--and so do the American people.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have outlined where we stand in comparison to the \nprogress we made when the Senate moved to confirm 205 Federal circuit \nand district judges during President Bush's first term. Three years \ninto President Obama's administration, we have yet to confirm 100 \njudges. We are going to have to move pretty quickly to catch up, \nespecially to what a Democratic-controlled Senate did for President \nBush. I wish to be able to do the same for President Obama.\n\n\n                          America Invents Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I use my \nremaining time to speak as in morning business about the America \nInvents Act and the cloture vote that will be taken tonight on \nproceeding to that important measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate is today turning its attention back to the \nAmerica Invents Act--a measure that will help create jobs, energize the \neconomy and promote innovation without adding a penny to the deficit. \nThis legislation is a key component of both Democratic and Republican \njobs agendas, and is a priority of the Obama administration.\n  Too often in recent years, good legislation has failed in the Senate \nbecause bills have become politicized. That should not be the case with \npatent reform. Innovation and economic development are not uniquely \nDemocratic or Republican objectives--they are American goals. That is \nwhy so many Democratic and Republican Senators have worked closely on \nthis legislation for years, along with a similar bipartisan coalition \nof House Members.\n  And that is why a Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee can stand on the floor of the Senate and advocate, as I do \ntoday, that the Senate pass a House bill, H.R. 1249, sponsored by the \nRepublican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Lamar Smith of \nTexas. As Chairman Smith and I wrote earlier this year in a joint \neditorial, ``Patent reform unleashes American innovation, allowing \npatent holders to capitalize on their inventions and create products \nand jobs.''\n  This bill, which passed the House with more than 300 votes, will make \ncrucial improvements to our outdated patent system. These improvements \ncan be divided into three important categories that are particularly \nnoteworthy.\n  First, the bill will speed the time it takes for applications on true \ninventions to issue as high quality patents, which can then be \ncommercialized and used to create jobs. There are nearly 700,000 \napplications pending at the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) that have \nyet to receive any action by the PTO. The Director of the PTO often \nsays that the next great invention that will drive our economic growth \nis likely sitting in that backlog of applications.\n  The America Invents Act will ensure that the PTO has the resources it \nneeds to work through its backlog of applications more quickly. The \nbill accomplishes this objective by authorizing the PTO to set its fees \nand creates a PTO reserve fund for any fees collected above the \nappropriated amounts in a given year--so that only the PTO will have \naccess to these fees.\n  Importantly, the bill also provides immediate tools the PTO needs to \nfast track applications, and continues discounts for fast tracked \napplications requested by small business, as well as for applications \ninvolving technologies important to the Nation's economy or national \ncompetitiveness, thanks to amendments offered in the Senate by Senators \nBennet and Menendez.\n  Second, the America Invents Act will improve the quality of both new \npatents issued by the PTO, as well as existing patents. High quality \npatents incentivize inventors and entrepreneurs by providing a limited \nmonopoly over the invention. Low quality patents, conversely, can \nimpede innovation if the product or process already exists.\n  The bill makes commonsense improvements to the system by allowing, \nfor example, third parties to comment on pending applications so that \npatent examiners will have more and better information readily \navailable. The bill also implements a National Academy of Sciences \nrecommendation by creating a postgrant review process to weed out \nrecently issued patents that should not have been issued in the first \nplace.\n  The bill will also improve upon the current system for challenging \nthe validity of a patent at the PTO. The current inter partes \nreexamination process has been criticized for being too easy to \ninitiate and used to harass legitimate patent owners, while being too \nlengthy and unwieldy to actually serve as an alternative to litigation \nwhen users are confronted with patents of dubious validity.\n  Third, the America Invents Act will transition our patent filing \nsystem from a first-to-invent system to the more objective first-\ninventor-to-file system, used throughout the rest of the world, while \nretaining the important grace period that will protect universities and \nsmall inventors, in particular. As business competition has gone \nglobal, and inventors are increasingly filing applications in the \nUnited States and other countries for protection of their inventions, \nour current system puts American inventors and businesses at a \ndisadvantage.\n  The differences cause confusion and inefficiencies for American \ncompanies\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\nand innovators. These problems exist both in the application process \nand in determining what counts as ``prior art'' in litigation. We \ndebated this change at some length in connection with the Feinstein \namendment in March. That amendment was rejected by the Senate by a vote \nof 87 to 13. The Senate has come down firmly and decisively in favor or \nmodernizing and harmonizing the American patent system with the rest of \nthe world.\n  The House, to its credit, improved on the Senate bill in this area by \nincluding an expanded prior user right with the transition to a first-\ninventor-to-file system. Prior user rights are important for American \nmanufacturing, in particular.\n  There is widespread support for the America Invents Act, and with \ngood reason. In March, just before the Senate voted 95-5 to pass the \nAmerica Invents Act, The New York Times editorialized that the America \nInvents Act will move America ``toward a more effective and transparent \npatent protection system'' that will ``encourage investment in \ninventions'' and ``should benefit the little guy'' by transitioning to \na first-inventor-to-file system.\n  A few weeks ago, the Washington Post editorial board added that \n``[i]n the six decades since its last overhaul, the patent system has \nbecome creaky,'' but the patent bill ``poised for final approval in the \nSenate would go a long way toward curing [the] problems.''\n  The Obama administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy \nin connection with the House bill, in which it argued that ``[t]he \nbill's much-needed reforms to the Nation's patent system will speed \ndeployment of innovative products to market and promote job creation, \neconomic growth, and U.S. economic competitiveness all at no cost to \nAmerican taxpayers.''\n  The House bill is not the exact bill I would have written. It \ncontains provisions that were not in the Senate bill, and it omits or \nchanges other provisions from the Senate bill that I supported. But \nthat is the legislative process, and the core elements of the House \nbill are identical or nearly identical to the core elements of the \nSenate bill. In addition, the House bill retains amendments adopted \nduring Senate consideration of S. 23, including amendments offered by \nSenator Bennet, Senator Menendez, Senator Kirk, Senator Stabenow, \nSenator Bingaman, and Senator Reid, among others.\n  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, will not only \nimplement an improved patent system that will grow the economy and \ncreate jobs, but it is the product of a process of which we should all \nbe proud. Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate have worked \ntogether with the administration and all interested stakeholders large \nand small to craft legislation that has near unanimous support.\n  I thank Senator Kyl, the minority whip, for his comments early today. \nI agree with him that sending this House-passed bill directly to the \nPresident will begin the process of demonstrating to the American \npeople that we can work together, Democrats and Republicans, House and \nSenate, on their behalf.\n  Those now advocating for enactment of the America Invents Act without \nfurther amendment include the United States Chamber of Commerce, the \nUnited Steelworkers, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nAssociation of American Universities, BIO and PhRMA, Community Bankers, \nthe Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, the Coalition for Patent \nFairness, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, and businesses \nrepresenting virtually every sector of our economy.\n  In a recent letter from Louis Foreman, a well known independent \ninventor, he wrote of his support for the America Invents Act saying:\n\n       The independent inventor has been well represented \n     throughout this process and we are in a unique situation \n     where there is overwhelming support for this legislation. . . \n     . H.R. 1249 is the catalyst necessary to incentivize \n     inventors and entrepreneurs to create the companies that will \n     get our country back on the right path and generate the jobs \n     we sorely need.\n\n  American ingenuity and innovation have been a cornerstone of the \nAmerican economy from the time Thomas Jefferson examined the first \npatent application to today. A recent Department of Commerce report \nattributes three-quarters of America's post-World War II economic \ngrowth to innovation. It is the patent system that incentivizes that \ninnovation when it holds true to the constitutional imperative to \n``promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for \nlimited times to . . . inventors the exclusive right to their \nrespective . . . discoveries.''\n  The Founders recognized the importance of promoting innovation. A \nnumber were themselves inventors. The Constitution explicitly grants \nCongress the power to ``promote the progress of science and useful \narts, by securing for limited times to . . . inventors the exclusive \nright to their respective . . . discoveries.'' The time for Congress to \nundertake this responsibility and enact patent reform legislation into \nlaw is now.\n  The discoveries made by American inventors and research institutions, \ncommercialized by American companies, and protected and promoted by \nAmerican patent laws have made our system the envy of the world. But we \ncannot stand on a 1950s patent system and expect our innovators to \nflourish in a 21st century world.\n  The America Invents Act will keep America in its longstanding \nposition at the pinnacle of innovation. This bill will establish a more \nefficient and streamlined patent system that will improve patent \nquality and limit unnecessary and counterproductive litigation costs, \nwhile making sure no party's access to court is denied.\n  The President recently called on Congress to pass patent reform as \nsoon as it returned from recess because it will create jobs and improve \nthe economy without adding to the deficit. This bill is bipartisan, it \nis the product of years of thoughtful bicameral discussions, and it \nshould be sent to the President's desk this week. There is no reason \nfor delay.\n  When we proceeded to the Senate version of this legislation last \nFebruary, we did so by unanimous consent. The Senate proceeded to \napprove patent reform legislation with 95 votes. It is disappointing \nthat we are being delayed from completing this important legislation. \nFurther delay does nothing for American inventors, the American economy \nor the creation of American jobs. It is time, time to take final action \non the America Invents Act.\n  I see the time has arrived. Is the rollcall automatic?\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I was in Cincinnati, OH. \nTerralift has the largest Labor Day gathering in the United States of \nAmerica by 15,000, 20,000, around Coney Island and just southeast of \nCincinnati, not far from the Ohio River. They have a picnic every year \ncelebrating workers, not just organized workers but workers generally.\n  I met a woman there by the name of Lillian Brayhound, and Ms. \nBrayhound was wearing a t-shirt that said ``Service Employees \nInternational Union.'' I asked her where she works, and she said she is \na custodian in downtown Cincinnati. And I remember that 3 or 4 years \nago I was at a dinner, and there was a group of workers, all middle-\naged women, mostly minorities, mostly African American, a couple Latino \nwomen, and they had just signed their first union contract to represent \nthe custodians in downtown Cincinnati office buildings.\n  I sat down at this table, and I said: What does this new union \ncontract mean to you, to the workers there?\n  A 50-year-old woman turned to me and she said: This is the first time \nin my life I have ever had a paid week vacation.\n  Think about that: This is the first time in my life I have ever had a \npaid week vacation. That was because those workers, each of them \nworking separately before for a building owner in a downtown Cincinnati \noffice building, had gotten together, had voted to join a union, had \nthe right to organize and bargain collectively. They still weren't \ngetting rich. They still weren't making more than, I believe, if I \nrecall, $10 or $11 an hour. But now they had a bit of a pension, now \nthey had health care, and now they had a chance to actually earn a 1-\nweek vacation, something many, many workers in America don't have the \nopportunity for. And when I hear people say: Well, unions meant \nsomething in the past, but they have outlived their usefulness, that \nreally tells you what that is all about.\n  We celebrate that on Labor Day, but we also know the union movement \nis under attack. We look at what has happened in the Ohio Statehouse, \nwhere legislators in Columbus, most of whom were elected by talking \nabout lost jobs in large part because of what happened in the Bush \nadministration and the 8 years previously, but people who were very \nunhappy, as they have a right to be, as they should be, because of lost \njobs, but what they have done is, after getting elected, they have gone \nafter collective bargaining rights, worker rights. They have attacked \nvoter rights. They have attacked in far too many cases women's rights.\n  Let's be clear. It is not teachers and firefighters and police \nofficers who caused Ohio's budget deficit. It is not teachers and \nfirefighters and police officers who caused this financial implosion \nour Nation has. Look at the history. It has been tax cuts for the \nwealthy; it has been reckless spending, overspending on corporate \nwelfare, overspending on all kinds of things; it has been regulatory \nsleepwalking that has left our economy in ruins. As a result, we have a \nwidening income gap, with wages generally stagnant for the last decade \nfor middle-class and working-class voter citizens, wages stagnating or \ndeclining for most of the workforce but salaries and bonuses going up \nfor people who are the most privileged, the bankers and wealthy \nexecutives and CEOs.\n  Robert Reich recently pointed out that the 5 percent of Americans \nwith the highest incomes now account for 37 percent of all consumption. \nReich points out that when income is concentrated at the top, the \nmiddle class doesn't have enough purchasing power to pull themselves \nout of this recession our economy suffers. The wealthiest people can \nonly spend so much. If the middle class has their wages stagnant or \nactually decline, there simply isn't the purchasing power we need to \ncreate the demand to grow our economy. Our economy has been most \nprosperous when the middle class is thriving rather than when we have \nthese huge gaps in income.\n  Today we have lost the consensus that our Nation's prosperity was \ntied to a thriving middle class, where opportunity was afforded to \nthose seeking to join it.\n  We used to see that consensus on manufacturing, where an economy \nbuilt wealth and built strong communities for millions of Americans \naround production. You only create wealth by mining, by agriculture--\ngrowing something--and by manufacturing. Yet we\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\nhave seen what has happened to manufacturing jobs in Ohio. Ohio is \nstill the largest manufacturing State in the country, below only Texas, \ntwice our size, and California, three times our size. We still put out \na lot of production. There is a lot of productive capacity in Ohio and \na lot of production. But 30 years ago, 26, 27 percent of our GDP was \nmanufacturing and about 10 percent was financial services. Those \nmanufacturing jobs created wealth for a lot of middle-class families. \nKids could go to college, they could buy a home or a car or two in so \nmany cases. Today what used to be more than a quarter of our GDP in \nmanufacturing and only 10 percent in financial services has flipped so \ntoday only about 10 percent of our GDP is manufacturing.\n  We know what that has done. Yet some of my Senate colleagues do not \nwant to extend the payroll tax. In many ways, it seems they will \nessentially will go on strike to prevent the wealthiest in America from \npaying a penny more. I hope that changes now that we are back from the \nAugust break and we are listening to what voters, what citizens at home \nare talking about.\n  Mr. President, let me share a couple of letters from people in Ohio, \na couple of stories. Then I know Senator Durbin wants to address the \nSenate.\n  Last April, I met with workers at Navistar in Springfield, OH, who \nare building next-generation military and commercial vehicles. The \nplant's production is up because a company and a community came \ntogether, forging compromise between the union and employer to keep \njobs and increase production. We see it across Ohio. At the other end \nof our State, at Arcelor Mittal's plant--a big steel maker near \nCleveland--for every 1 person-hour, 1 ton of steel is produced. To my \nunderstanding, we have never seen that kind of productivity anywhere \nelse in the world. They are the most productive steelworkers in the \nworld, able to produce 1 ton of steel for 1 man-hour, 1 woman-hour \ninvested. We see it at the Lima Tank Plant and at the GE Aviation Plant \nin Evendale. It is a story we see down in Piketon. We see it in towns \nacross Ohio, where the ``Made in Ohio'' or ``Made in America'' is \nstamped on everything from airplanes to auto parts.\n  I got a letter from David from Akron. He said:\n\n       I am a firefighter/paramedic for the city of Akron. For 11 \n     years I have put the safety and well-being of my community \n     above mine.\n       I am a proud member of my local union, I am married to a \n     high school English teacher. When I took the job I was told \n     my life expectancy would be 10 years less than that of the \n     average man. As a paramedic I do my job all hours of the \n     night, all days of the week, 24 hours at a time. I miss \n     birthdays, holidays, celebrations and much more. I have never \n     complained until now.\n       As our country tries to recover from very hard times, I \n     understand there is a need for reform. It is easy to think \n     about what someone else has and how it is not fair. My wife \n     and I worked hard to get where we are. No one has handed it \n     to us. That is what I love about our country, if you are \n     willing to work for something then you can be successful.\n\n  Public employees are once again asked to make sacrifices.\n  He is not arguing he will not make sacrifices. But to attack public \nemployees with all that has happened in Ohio, to imply that they are \nnot doing their jobs, they are all slackers, is too much for people who \nhave given so much of their lives serving the public.\n  This last letter I will read is from Anestis from Canton, OH, a \nteacher.\n\n       My father was a teacher in Canton City schools from 1953 to \n     1989. He and my mother raised 6 children, of whom I am the \n     youngest. He taught and coached three sports from the time he \n     received his job until he retired. He went to school on the \n     GI bill after World War II. He could have earned a degree in \n     anything, but he chose teaching because he sincerely wanted \n     to earn a living through the hard, honest work of teaching \n     and helping children.\n       Both of my grandparents were Greek immigrants who came to \n     this country in 1913 and 1920 through Ellis Island to escape \n     the suppression in their counties and better their lives. My \n     grandfathers worked in the factories in Canton so their \n     children could have an education and better their lives.\n       I have been teaching for 17 years. My father went on strike \n     in the 1970's so we can now have collective bargaining, and I \n     wouldn't be here today [if it were not for that]. Their work \n     ethic and values of fair play helped my parents raise their \n     children on a teacher's salary. If our rights are taken away, \n     I cannot raise my own family--or educate our children.\n\n  Going the next step, a number of teachers and a number of college \nstudents have told me they are watching some young teachers, they are \nwatching some of their classmates who planned to become teachers or \njust started their careers in the classroom and they are having second \nthoughts when they see conservative elected officials attack their \nprofession of public schoolteachers or attack the profession of \nfirefighters or police officers, all because they have a radical \npolitical agenda that wants to end the practice of organizing and \nbargaining collectively. It is a disservice to our country. We know we \nhave a middle class because large numbers of workers--mostly private \nsector, some public sector--have had the ability under law to organize \nand bargain collectively. That is what built the middle class. It is \nnot something we should give up lightly.\n  That is what I heard all over Ohio in the last couple of months. I \nassume I will hear it for the next couple of months. It is so important \nto our country that the focus here be on jobs, the focus here be on \nliving-wage jobs, the focus here be on giving opportunities so \nAmericans can stay in the middle class or have the opportunity to join \nthe middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5329-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5329-S5331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NO POLITICS ZONE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for \nhighlighting what has to be our focal point as we return to the Senate, \nand that is the unemployment picture across America and the desperate \nsituation many families are facing. As I visited my home State of \nIllinois, I found what the Senator did in Ohio, that many people have \nbeen desperately trying to find jobs for a long time and it is becoming \nincreasingly difficult. The longer it goes on, the more difficult it \nbecomes. It turns out the national statistics, which I read over the \nweekend, suggest that it is primarily males who are out of work--not \nexclusively, but 60 percent males, 40 percent females--and more and \nmore not in minority populations. They are having a difficult time. I \nam glad the Senator from Ohio focused on getting us back on track as we \nshould be on this issue.\n  I read with interest when Republican Leader McConnell wrote an \nopinion article in the Washington Post yesterday. One line in that \narticle struck me particularly and I wish to read it. Senator McConnell \nsaid, ``Job creation should be a no-politics zone.''\n  I would like that to become our slogan for the month of September. I \nhope both parties will live by it. If we do, I think we can achieve \nsome things and surprise the American people who have just about given \nup on us. Take a look at the numbers across the board. They say 12 or \n13 percent of the American people think favorably of Congress. As I \nsaid on the ``Jon Stewart Daily Show,'' I don't think we have that many \nrelatives so I question the number. I think it has reached the point \nthat most people do not have a positive view of what we are doing here, \nand we need to change it. The only people who can change it are those \nof us who serve in this Chamber.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Republican leader came to the floor of the Senate \ntoday and said a little different thing, which I hope I am not \noverreading, but he said:\n\n       Mr. President, there is a much simpler reason for opposing \n     your economic proposals that has nothing whatsoever to do \n     with politics, and it's this: They don't work.\n\n  I think that could be read to suggest that whatever the President has \nto say, he is going to run into opposition. I hope the joint session of \nCongress is productive. I spoke to the President this afternoon. He \ncalled a number of Members. He didn't give me any inside story on what \nhe is about to say, but my guess is he is going to make proposals and \nthen say to the Republicans: Now come up with your proposals and let's \nsit down together and work them out between us. That is the right way \nto do it in a divided government and that is the way we should approach \nit.\n  I recall when President George W. Bush in 2008 felt we needed an \neconomic stimulus. At that time unemployment was 4.8 percent. Senator \nMcConnell supported an economic stimulus by President George W. Bush \nwhen our unemployment rate was 4.8 percent. He actually said on the \nfloor\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\ntoday that, ``Businesses actually don't want shots in the arm or quick \nfixes.'' But when he was supporting President Bush's economic stimulus \nin 2008, it was called ``a booster shot for our economy.'' I think \nsometimes that kind of booster shot can make a difference.\n  I think there are two vital elements in our economy that challenge \nus. I don't know how much we can change them or how quickly we change \nthem. As I visited in my home State with community bankers who actually \nloan mortgages in their communities, time and again they said to me the \nbiggest single problem is we don't know where the bottom is. We don't \nknow where fair market value is on real estate so as a result it is \nvery tough to close a deal and very tough to get agencies such as \nFannie and Freddie to go along with it because of disputes over \nappraisals.\n  The second issue was one highlighted this morning in today's Chicago \nSun-Times and that is the spending and saving habits of the American \nfamily, and they are changing pretty substantially. The rate of savings \nis up from 1 percent to 5 percent. People have decided putting some \nmoney in the bank is not a bad idea and they are borrowing less on \ntheir credit cards and other things and making fewer purchases. That is \nthe right thing for a family to do in an uncertain economy. It is not \nthe best thing for an economic recession. In fact, just the opposite is \ntrue. But you can understand, people were burned in 2007; burned again \nin the stock market a few weeks ago. They don't want to see it happen \nagain and they don't want to be victimized by it, so those two things \nhaunt us.\n  More than anything, I hope in the month of September this does not \nbecome a month of confrontation on the floor of the Senate and the \nHouse. The American people are fed up with it. If we have a \nconfrontation over extending the Federal Aviation Administration or \nextending the Federal highway bill, they will rightly be angry that we \nare back to our old tricks of staring one another down and not \naccomplishing what needs to be done for this Nation and this economy.\n  I urge my colleagues, I hope I can join in this, to look for what the \nRepublican leader called job creation as a ``no-politics zone'' in the \nweeks ahead.\n  In August, the American economy added zero net new jobs. That was \npainful. The private sector added just 17,000 jobs. Unemployment is at \n9.1 percent. Fourteen million Americans are unemployed and millions \nmore are underemployed. GDP growth was just 1 percent in the second \nquarter of this year.\n  Year-over-year real GDP growth is now at 1.5 percent. Since 1948, \nevery time the four-quarter change in GDP has fallen below 2 percent, \nthe economy has entered a recession. These figures are stunning and \nworrying. Now is not the time for us to shrink from our \nresponsibilities on a bipartisan basis. The President is going to lay \nout a job creation proposal this week. He will offer a plan that should \nhave broad bipartisan support, as these initiatives have had in the \npast when suggested by other Presidents. I hope this President will \ncall for investments in America, in physical, human, and intellectual \ncapital to provide the seed money for long-term growth. Among other \nthings, that means investing in our infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, you know what is going on in China today. We have seen \nit. The infrastructure construction in China is mind boggling. They are \npreparing for the 21st century. America is not, and we need to change \nthat. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates our country's \ninfrastructure needs at least $1 trillion. Our infrastructure is \nrapidly aging, whether bridges falling down in Minnesota or planes \nbeing diverted from airports because they are not up to where they \nought to be. This is what ought to challenge all of us. Dozens of \nbipartisan commissions have told us to invest in infrastructure. We \nalso need to invest in human and intellectual capital. That means jobs \nfor teachers and job trainers, and research jobs which will create good \njobs across the whole economy.\n  Congress must invest now because the private sector remains skittish. \nHere is what Bill Gross, a Republican and chief investment officer of \nthe giant bond fund PIMCO, said:\n\n       Capitalism in its raw form can't pull us out of this hole.\n\n  That is an important message from a man in the private sector, in the \nfinancial community. In the near term, the private sector is not uneasy \nbecause of high taxes or government debt or the Environmental \nProtection Agency or even health care reform or Wall Street reform. \nThese things all exist. But corporations are doing better than ever. A \nrecent report found that of the last year's 100 highest paid corporate \nexecutives in the United States, 25 of the 100 highest paid CEOs in \nAmerica earned more in income than their company paid in taxes to the \nFederal Government. Corporate profits grew 8.3 percent year over year \nin the second quarter. That growth is far better than the overall \ngrowth of our economy in the same timeframe.\n  As of March 31, the blue-chip companies and Standard and Poor's 500 \nindex are sitting on nearly $1 trillion in cash. It is not government \ndebt, it is not the EPA, it is not health care reform, it is not Wall \nStreet reform. No, the private sector in America is still on the \nsidelines because it is still recovering from the wounds of the deepest \nglobal crisis in over 75 years. While the private sector is licking its \nwounds, the government can promote job creation and reduce uncertainty. \nIt is a false choice to say government can either create jobs or reduce \ndebt. The truth is, creating jobs will reduce debt, and the argument \ncan be made with 14 million Americans out of work you will never \nbalance the budget. Creating jobs will bring more people into the tax \nbase, increasing our revenues and take people off of the safety net \nprograms such as unemployment insurance and food stamps. We need more \njobs and less debt. One begets the other. It is possible. I know many \npundits listening now will say: Impossible. We can't get bipartisan \nagreement on job measures now. But short-term spending coupled with \nlong-term spending had bipartisan support less than a year ago. That is \nwhen I was a member of the Simpson-Bowles Commission, voted for their \nfindings, and that is what they recommended. The Commission said: Don't \ncut back on spending for 2 years, until we get out of the recession, \nand then make a serious commitment to deficit reduction. I think they \nhad it right then. They still do.\n\n  The Commission explicitly called for near-term spending, a payroll \ntax credit in concert with long-term deficit reduction. Mr. President, \n11 of the 18 members of that Commission, myself included, voted for it: \n5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, 1 Independent. By supporting progrowth \npolicies and locking in deficit reduction in the outyears, we can turn \nthis economy around, provide certainty in the marketplace, and create \ngood-paying jobs right here in America.\n  One last point I would like to make. Illinois was largely spared from \nthe disasters of the last several weeks. We had our problems with \nflooding earlier this year. But 2011 is shaping up to be a record year \nwith regard to disasters. Hurricane Irene could cost us at least $1 \nbillion, maybe $1.5 billion. People in Illinois have been recovering \nfrom two federally declared disasters over the long term--one, a \nblizzard in February, and the other, major flooding in the spring.\n  Out of the $130 billion provided in FEMA disaster funds in the past \ndecade, some $110 billion has been provided as emergency funding. We \ncannot budget for these disasters.\n  At a hearing before we left--and I knew government experts would be \nsuspect to some, so I brought in experts from the insurance industry, \nthe people who write property and casualty insurance. They said: Be \nprepared--more disasters and higher costs in loss than ever before. \nThat was before Hurricane Irene.\n  According to NOAA's National Climate Data Center, the United States \nhas already experienced 10 natural disasters with damages totaling more \nthan $1 billion. The previous record for weather-related disasters of \nthis magnitude was nine in 1 year. We have already broken it, and there \nare more hurricanes to follow, I am afraid to say. The United States \nhas sustained 109 weather-related disasters over the past 31 years in \nwhich overall damage or costs exceeded $1 billion. The total normalized \nlosses for the 109 events exceeded $750 billion.\n  In 2011 alone, over $35 billion in damages has been caused by \ncatastrophic\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\nevents. I make that point because some Members of Congress--one, a \nCongressman from Virginia--suggest we can take the need for disaster \nfunds out of the regular budget of the United States. I will tell you, \nit is virtually impossible, and we don't know what the final cost will \nbe. At this point we expect it to be much more. We have to deal with \nthese disasters and come to the aid of families and businesses, \ncommunities and States, as our State has been aided and almost every \nState has in the past.\n  A provision in the Budget Control Act allows Congress several billion \ndollars in emergency spending for additional FEMA aid without budget \ncuts elsewhere. We are going to have to get together on a bipartisan \nbasis to deal with this. FEMA estimates that the request leaves the \ndisaster fund short by $2 billion to $4.8 billion in the upcoming year. \nThese figures do not take into account the most recent damage from \nHurricane Irene, particularly in the State of Vermont and many other \nplaces. We need to work on a bipartisan basis to meet these needs for \nthe disaster assistance all across America and put America back to \nwork.\n  At this point I would like to yield the floor to my former remarks \nand engage in the closing script.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5331-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Tumilson who gave his life for his country along with 29 other \nAmerican heroes as the result of a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on \nAugust 6. He worked hard to get where he did and was extremely proud to \nhave become a Navy SEAL. The people of the State of Iowa, and \nparticularly his hometown of Rockford, are extremely proud to call him \na native son.\n  Petty Officer Tumilson is described as someone who committed fully to \neverything he did and he applied that intense dedication to serving his \ncountry. We as a nation must be grateful that we have brave and \nselfless Americans like Jon Tumilson who are willing to undertake the \nincredible training necessary to become a Navy SEAL so that they can \nthen put their lives on the line repeatedly in some of the most \ndangerous missions imaginable. Our country has lost a powerful force \nfor good, and his fellow sailors have lost a brother in arms. Of \ncourse, his loss will be felt particularly deeply by his family, \nfriends, and neighbors. My prayers go out to Jon's parents, George and \nKathy, and all those who are grieving. Nothing can compensate for his \nloss, but I hope they can take comfort in knowing that he died a true \nAmerican hero. Jon Tumilson's memory will now join the honored ranks of \nthose patriots who, since the Revolutionary War, have fought to defend \nAmerican liberty.\n\n\n                   Chief Petty Officer Robert Reeves\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true American \nhero. On August 5, 2011, our State and Nation lost a great patriot when \nNavy SEAL CPO Robert Reeves, aged 32, died in Afghanistan during combat \noperations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Chief Reeves was raised in Louisiana by his loving parents Jo and \nJames Reeves, and he graduated from Caddo Magnet High School in \nShreveport, LA, where he played both soccer and lacrosse.\n  After 1 year at LSU, Chief Reeves enlisted in the U.S. Navy and \njoined the SEALs in 1999. Since that time, he has been assigned to \nvarious SEAL teams where he made several combat deployments in support \nof the global war on terror, distinguishing himself in combat \noperations during 13 years of service in the U.S. Navy.\n  A decorated soldier, he served as a member of the Naval Special \nWarfare Development Group, or SEAL Team Six as it is more commonly \nknown, and was the recipient of four Bronze Stars--earned for his \nbravery and meritorious service. He carried out his duties with pride \nand without reservation and each of us owes him our gratitude for his \nselfless sacrifice.\n  There is no doubt that this tragic loss will not only be felt within \nthe Reeves family but also the Navy and the entire Nation. My deepest \nthoughts and prayers are with his family during this extraordinarily \ndifficult time. Our Nation is safer and stronger because of brave \nheroes like Chief Reeves. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me as we \nhonor the life of Navy SEAL CPO Robert Reeves and his legacy, as well \nas all the other brave men and women in our Armed Forces who have given \nthe ultimate sacrifice in service to our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5331-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CORDRAY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of Rich \nCordray's nomination as Director of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau and to urge a vote on his nomination.\n  The enactment of the Dodd-Frank law last Congress is a triumph for \nconsumers. This landmark law reins in the abusive and predatory \npractices of bad actors in the financial industry and protects \nconsumers through the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau.\n  The CFPB will empower consumers by giving them the knowledge and \ntools they need to make responsible financial decisions and will level \nthe playing field by policing and curtailing the unfair practices of \nsome unscrupulous banks and financial institutions. I applauded the \ncreation of the CFPB and have heard from Connecticut residents who want \nthe consumer protections that the CFPB will provide.\n  Last month, President Obama nominated former Ohio attorney general \nRich Cordray to serve as the Director of the CFPB. This is an inspired \nchoice. Rich has dedicated his career to protecting and educating \nconsumers: he has vigorously pursued lenders that employed abusive and \nfraudulent foreclosure practices like robo-signing and he has \nrepeatedly gone after financial institutions that weakened employees' \npension funds by concealing material information from investors.\n  Recognizing that informed consumers are empowered consumers, Rich has \nalso sought to improve financial literacy among Ohio residents by \nworking to include personal finance education in Ohio schools.\n  Rich's nomination has been widely praised, even by those he has \nclashed with. Former Senator Mike DeWine, who ran against Rich for \nState attorney general last year, called Rich ``very well-qualified for \nthis job.''\n  As Connecticut's attorney general, I worked alongside Rich, and I \nknow he is a true consumer advocate and an outstanding nominee to lead \nthis critical new agency.\n  Despite Rich's impressive background and qualifications, some of my \ncolleagues are refusing to allow a confirmation vote on his nomination. \nThey do this not because they doubt Rich's qualifications, but because \nthey resent the agency he has been nominated to lead. Earlier this \nyear, 44 Senators wrote President Obama and threatened to block any \nnominee for the CFPB until the agency's structure and authority was \ngutted. Now, they are following through on that threat.\n  This is a bad precedent. The CFPB was created by the Dodd-Frank law \npassed by the previous Congress and signed by President Obama. This \nlegislation was not rushed through; it was debated for months and \nmonths, with members given plenty of time to criticize the bill, offer \namendments, or vote no on the legislation. Eventually, the bill passed. \nSixty Senators voted for it, including several who are now seeking to \nblock the nominee for an agency they voted to create.\n  Some of my colleagues may not like the law or the CFPB. I respect \nthat. But their course of action should be to introduce legislation to \nchange the law, not to shirk their constitutional duty by refusing to \nallow a confirmation vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5331-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5331-S5332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING DR.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the achievements and legacy of Peter Douglas, executive \ndirector of the California Coastal Commission, who will be retiring \nthis November. Peter is truly a giant among California \nconservationists, and our State is a much better and more beautiful \nplace as a result of his life's work.\n  Established by voter initiative in 1972, the Coastal Commission was \ncreated by the people of California and is sustained by their support \nand active participation. For nearly four decades, the California \nCoastal Commission has worked to protect, conserve, restore, and \nenhance the resources of the California coast and ocean for current and \nfuture generations.\n  Peter Douglas was there at the creation of the commission, and he has \nshaped and guided its work every step of the way. As a legislative aide \nin the early 1970s, he helped draft the 1972 Coastal Initiative and the \nCalifornia Coastal Act of 1976, which made the commission a permanent \npublic institution. After 7 years as the commission's chief deputy \ndirector, he was named executive director in 1985 and has served ever \nsince.\n  Along with its stewardship of responsible development along the \ncoast, the Coastal Commission has led the way in preserving public \naccess to our State's coastline and beaches. From the beginning, Peter \nDouglas believed that protecting public access went hand in hand with \nprotecting California's natural heritage, because the public would work \nto protect a resource that they could enjoy. Under Peter's leadership, \nthe commission worked to create public parks in some key areas that \nmight otherwise have been developed, including Crystal Cove, Malibu \nBluffs, and Tomales Bay State Park.\n  Here is what Peter Douglas himself says about coastal conservation: \n``The coast is what it is because a lot of people worked really hard \nand sacrificed to protect it. And if we want it to be there for our \nchildren, we have to keep fighting to protect it. In that way, the \ncoast is never saved--it is always being saved.''\n  When asked if he had any idea when he started out 40 years ago what \nhis legacy would be, Peter Douglas replied, ``Absolutely not. I never \nthought about it. I just thought it was noble work, and I wanted to \nmake a difference.''\n  Peter Douglas has made a tremendous difference. From the bottom of my \nheart, I offer him my profound thanks and best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5332-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JEREMY HENWOOD\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

On August 6, 2011, Officer Henwood was \nshot by a suspect who pulled alongside his patrol car. He passed away \nseveral hours later.\n  In his 4-year career with the San Diego Police Department's Mid-City \nDivision, Officer Henwood earned a reputation as a caring, dedicated \nofficer, and committed leader. Everyday, he selflessly put his life on \nthe line to protect the city he loved.\n  A strong believer in public service, Jeremy Henwood served in the \nU.S. Marine Corps for 15 years, first on active duty and later as \nReservist. Major Henwood did two tours of duty in Iraq and one in \nAfghanistan. He recently returned from deployment in Helmand Province, \nAfghanistan, where he commanded a Marine logistics company.\n  Police Chief William Lansdowne has stated that Officer Henwood \n``believed he was a protector and his job was to save others.'' One of \nhis colleagues called him ``a true hero who not only served this \ncountry, but served this city.'' A generous and courageous man in life, \nOfficer Henwood's organs were donated to save other lives.\n  Officer Henwood is survived by his mother Beverly, his father Robbie, \nand younger siblings Robbie Junior and Emily.

I also send my deepest \ncondolences to Officer Henwood's colleagues in the San Diego Police \nDepartment, who continue to serve our community and protect our \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5332-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NEW HOPE MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, the \noldest African American church in San Bernardino, CA.\n  In 1911, New Hope Missionary Baptist Church opened its doors under \nthe leadership of Minister James Hart.\n  It all began in response to African-American migrants who wanted a \nplace of worship. In 100 years, New Hope Missionary Baptist Church \nnever lost sight of its responsibility to creatively meet the ever-\nchanging needs of the community it serves.\n  During the pastorate of Dr. David E. Campbell from 1950-1978, New \nHope built a new building and became the first Black Baptist \ncongregation in southern California to elect women to the board of \ntrustees. Under Dr. LeMar Foster from 1984-1997, the congregation \nestablished numerous organizations, fellowships, and outreach programs. \nThe church's current pastor, Dr. Robert E. Fairley who has served from \n1978-1983 and from 1997-present, has introduced worship services to \naccommodate overflow crowds, added a van to support the new \ntransportation ministry, and established new programs for hospitality, \npremarital, and marital counseling.\n  The year 2011 marks a significant milestone in the life of New Hope \nMissionary Baptist Church, which was ``Founded on Hope, Built in Love, \nand Sustained by Faith.'' I congratulate New Hope Missionary Baptist \nChurch on this significant anniversary and 100 years of extraordinary \nservice to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5332-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5332-S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OCEAN VIEW LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD CHAMPIONS\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

On August 28, this team of 11- and 12-year-olds \ndefeated Japan to win the Little League World Series championship in \nWilliamsport, PA.\n  It was a dramatic victory. With two outs and the bases loaded in the \nbottom of the sixth and final inning, first baseman Nick Pratto \ndelivered a sharp single to center to score the winning run for Ocean \nView.\n  Nothing could stop this team. Not their friendly rivals from \nBillings, MT, who pushed Ocean View to the brink of elimination by \nwinning an extra-inning thriller earlier in the Little League World \nSeries. And not Hurricane Irene, which brought rain to Williamsport and \npushed back the final game by more than 3 hours.

Mr. President, today I celebrate the 225th \nanniversary of the incorporation of the city of Charles Town, WV. \nCharles Town has a rich history and heritage of great significance not \nonly to West Virginia but to the entire nation.\n  Charles Town was originally founded in 1786 in what was then \nVirginia. The city was named after Charles Washington, the brother of \nour first President, George Washington. Charles Washington moved to the \nlower Shenandoah Valley in 1780 and there he began building his home \nknown as ``Happy Retreat.'' In 1786, he asked the Virginia State \nLegislature for permission to incorporate a town there, which he named \n``Charles Town.'' After Charles Washington's death, Charles Town became \nthe county seat of newly formed Jefferson County.\n  Our Nation's focus turned to Charles Town in 1859 with the trial and \nexecution of abolitionist John Brown and his followers after their \nhistoric raid on Harper's Ferry. The trial proceedings, and the words \nuttered by John Brown in Charles Town on the institution that held \nmillions of Americans in bondage, helped shape our Nation's debate on \nissues surrounding the Civil War. When Virginia seceded from the Union, \nCharles Town became part of the newly created State known as West \nVirginia. Today, visitors come to Charles Town from all over to view an \narea steeped in the history of our Nation.\n  Charles Town has undergone many changes over 225 years. And those \nmany changes are evident in its abundance of historic sites, including \nits architectural landmarks and museums, and transitions over time in \nits local economy. The residents of Charles Town have always met these \nchanges with courage and vision, and have confronted challenges with \nresilience and strength of spirit. They are proud and hard-working, and \nwill undoubtedly help carry the city into a promising future.\n  The city's local leaders--both past and present--also deserve credit \nfor the city's success. Their leadership and inspiration have guided \nCharles Town as it has developed and grown, while remaining true to its \nheritage and our West Virginia values. I join Mayor Peggy Smith and the \ncity council in celebrating this momentous occasion.\n  Two hundred twenty-five years ago, Charles Washington had a vision \nfor the city of Charles Town and the people of the lower Shenandoah \nValley who would establish their lives there. And, as the citizens and \nleaders of Charles Town look ahead, I believe strongly that the city \ncontinues to hold great promise for a prosperous future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5333-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BILLINGS BIG SKY ALL-STARS\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to share some exciting news \nfrom my home State of Montana. As many already know, the Little League \nWorld Series reached its thrilling completion last month. Montana's \nteam, the Big Sky All-Stars from Billings, played in the U.S. \nChampionship Game after a breathtaking, extra-inning victory over \nCalifornia in its previous game.\n  This Billings team was the first team from Montana to reach the \nLittle League World Series. Only eight teams from the thousands of \nLittle Leagues across the country make it to the World Series held in \nSouth Williamsport, PA, each year. One of our boys, Ian Leatherberry, \noriginally said that the team was just hoping to play in the regional \ntournament. Instead, they played so long that they had a good excuse \nfor missing the first week of school.\n  Behind the leadership of manager Gene Carlson and his coaches, these \nTreasure State champs became the talk of the tournament and the Nation. \nWith great pitching, outstanding defense, and timely hitting, they \nquickly proved they belonged by defeating South Dakota and Louisiana, \nwinning each game by a thrilling two-run margin.\n  Despite our State not even having a million people, Montana's All-\nStars didn't blink when taking on the team from Huntington Beach, CA, \nfor the right to reach the U.S. championship game. Montana's starting \npitcher Cole McKenzie battled California's hitters, holding them \nscoreless. Then Ben Askelson hit a dramatic walk-off home run to give \nour boys an amazing 1-0 win in extra innings.\n  It is honestly no surprise to me that the Big Sky All-Stars punched \nabove their class. Whether competing in Little League baseball or \nshowing the rest of the world true sportsmanship, Montana knows how to \ncompete.\n  Despite their loss in the national championship game, Gene and his \nplayers earned the respect of all of Montana. These 12 boys--Ben \nAskelson, Jet Campbell, Sean Jones, Connor Kieckbusch, Pearce Kurth, \nIan Leatherberry, Brock MacDonald, Andy Maehl, Cole McKenzie, Dawson \nSmith, Gabe Sulser and Patrick Zimmer--played with great skill and \ndetermination, making everyone from the Big Sky State proud of their \nimmense accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5333-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING RAYMOND MEDER\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I honor Raymond Meder and his \nservice to the Army of the United States during World War Two.\n  Raymond arrived in Normandy 6 days after D-day and went on to fight \nin the frigid Battle of the Bulge. After that defining battle, Raymond \nMeder and his commanding officer were ordered to take a jeep full of \nammunition to the front line--in German territory.\n  A mortar exploded in front of Raymond's jeep, flipping it over. The \ncrash shattered Raymond's wrist and he suffered from shrapnel in his \nleg. Still under heavy fire, Raymond Meder crawled to the side of the \nroad and covered his commanding officer with his own body. Sadly, that \nofficer never made it. But Raymond returned fire through the night and \ninto the morning with a machine gun until reinforcements arrived.\n  In a hospital in France, Raymond Meder was visited by an Army captain \nwho told him, ``You'll earn medals for this.''\n  Yes, he earned them. But he never received them.\n  Three weeks later, Raymond returned to the battlefield. His wrist was \ndeformed for the rest of his life. He never complained. And his \nmilitary records were destroyed by a 1973 fire in St. Louis.\n  Raymond Meder passed away just a few months ago, on March 30. His son \nRay and daughter-in-law Corine started asking questions about Raymond's \nservice. Last month I had the honor of presenting to his family Raymond \nMeder's Bronze Star, Combat Infantryman Badge 1st Award, World War Two \nVictory Medal and Honorable Service Lapel Button.\n  These may be small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of true \nheroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5333-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5333-S5334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH CETNAR\n\n Mr. TESTER.

He was born to Polish-Ukrainian immigrants who wanted to give \ntheir children the American dream. He had to work for the American \ndream. And he did.\n  Joe worked hard his whole life from a very early age, when he sold \nhot dogs on the streets of New York. In 1941, Joe enlisted in the Army \nAir Corps. And he parachuted into France during the invasion of \nNormandy.\n  Like many veterans who returned from war, Joe didn't speak much about \nhis experience in the European theater.\n  His military records were destroyed by a fire in 1973. And in 2009, \nJoe passed away, leaving behind his wife of 65 years.\n  Joe Cetnar never received the recognition he deserved. His sister \nDotty and his niece Aleksy started asking questions about Joe's \nservice.

In Normandy, on June 11, 1944, Raymond was \nshot and severely wounded by German forces. His recovery took 7 months \nat a hospital in England and further hospital stays at home.\n  Through the long trauma and his long recovery from enemy fire, \nRaymond Deutscher never received the medals he earned as a hero of \nWorld War II.\n  His military records were destroyed by a 1973 fire in St. Louis. And \nhe passed away on January 10, 2001.\n  His family reached out to me and started asking questions about \nRaymond's service and the due recognition he never received.\n  Last month I had the honor of presenting to his family Raymond \nDeutscher's Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Good Conduct Medal, American \nCampaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, Combat \nInfantryman Badge First Award with Rifle Bar, World War Two Victory \nMedal, and Honorable Service Lapel Button\n  These eight medals may be small tokens, but they are powerful symbols \nof true heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.

Mr. President, today I honor CPL Peter Schneider \nand his service to the U.S. Army during World War II.\n  At the age of 17, Corporal Schneider's parents passed away and he was \nleft to raise two younger siblings. Although he didn't have to go to \nwar, he believed it was his calling. And his older brother agreed to \ntake care of the children.\n  On July 3, 1944, Corporal Schneider was severely wounded by German \ntroops in Livry, France. His wounds were so severe he spent 4 years \nrecovering in a hospital. The attack left Mr. Schneider 100 percent \ndisabled. But that didn't stop him from working the rest of his life \nafter the war.\n  Corporal Schneider received a Purple Heart for his sacrifice. His \ndaughter Marlene keeps the medal in her home as a memorial. But after \nsome research, Marlene discovered her father never received all the \nrecognition he earned for his service in World War II.\n  A full year before he was wounded, Corporal Schneider served in the \n41st Armored Infantry Division under General Patton. And in July of \n1943, he was part of the first wave of Allied Forces--the tip of the \nspear--to storm Sicily and liberate Palermo.\n  After reaching out to me, we discovered that for his heroism in that \nsignificant part of the war, Corporal Schneider earned two more \nimportant medals.\n  Last month I had the honor of presenting to his family CPL Peter \nSchneider's Bronze Star and European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign \nMedal.\n  These may be small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of true \nheroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n  Peter Schneider passed away in 1999 having never seen these medals. \nBut they will be part of his family's history forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5334-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5334-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/06/senate-section/article/S5334-5", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on August 5, 2011, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives, \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2715.

A bill to extend the participation term for small business \nconcerns affected by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita in certain \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to my home State of Louisiana: \ndisaster recovery. As you know, along the Gulf Coast, we keep an eye \ntrained on the Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. This is \nfollowing the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nof 2005; Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008; and more recently the \nDeepwater Horizon disaster. Our communities and businesses are still \nrecovering from these disasters--some from a disaster that devastated \nthe Gulf Coast over 6 years ago. For this reason, as Chair of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship disaster \npreparedness is one of my top priorities. While the Gulf Coast is prone \nto hurricanes, other parts of the country are no strangers to disaster \nas we have seen recently. For example, we just saw an earthquake strike \nWashington, DC, and Hurricane Irene work its way up the East Coast. In \ngeneral though, the Midwest also has annual tornadoes, California \nexperiences earthquakes and wildfires, and the Northeast sees crippling \nsnowstorms. So no part of our country is spared from disasters--\ndisasters which can and will strike at any moment. With this in mind, \nwe must ensure that the Federal Government is better prepared and \nassist those businesses impacted by natural disasters.\n  As I mentioned, everyone around the country is familiar with the \nimpact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the New Orleans area and the \nsoutheast part of our State. Images from the devastation following \nthese storms, and the subsequent Federal levee breaks, were transmitted \naround the country and around the world. This is because Katrina was \nthe deadliest natural disaster in United States history, with 1,800 \npeople killed--1,500 alone in Louisiana. Katrina was also the costliest \nnatural disaster in United States history with over $81.2 billion in \ndamage. In Louisiana, we had 18,000 businesses catastrophically \ndestroyed and 81,000 businesses economically impacted. I believe that, \nacross the entire Gulf Coast, some estimates ran as high as 125,000 \nbusinesses impacted by Katrina and Rita. While we have made significant \nprogress in rebuilding infrastructure, housing, and our economy, I \ncontinue to hear from individual business owners who are struggling to \nfully recover. These business owners tell me that they have not been \nhit by one disaster but three: Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane \nGustav in 2008, and the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.\n  In order to help ongoing recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast, I am \nintroducing today the Gulf Coast Disadvantaged Business Relief Act of \n2011. This legislation is the Senate companion bill to H.R. 2808 \nintroduced by my colleague Representative Cedric Richmond last month. I \nnote that his legislation also had two original cosponsors from Alabama \nand Mississippi: Representative Terri Sewell and Representative Bennie \nThompson.\n  This bill focuses on assisting minority businesses in the Gulf Coast \nthat were impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Everyone is familiar \nwith the images and the cost of these storms,\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\nbut they may not be too familiar with the impact on individual \nbusinesses. In particular, I am speaking about the affects of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita on minority firms in the Gulf Coast. As a \nresult of these storms, many minority firms in the Gulf Coast were \ndisrupted and thus lost valuable time for participating in the 8(a) \nprogram. The 8(a) business development initiative, created under the \nSmall Business Administration, helps minority entrepreneurs access \nFederal contracts and allows companies to be certified for increments \nof 3 years. These contracts are vital to the revival of these impacted \nareas. However, as currently structured the program allows businesses \nto participate for a limited length of time, 9 years, after which they \ncan never re-apply nor get back into the program. It is imperative that \nwe provide contracting assistance to our local minority businesses.\n  The bill includes a provision which would tackle this problem in \nthree important ways. First, the bill extends 8(a) eligibility for \nprogram participants in Katrina/Rita-impacted areas in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama by 24 months. The bill would also apply to any \nareas in the state of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama that have been \ndesignated by the administrator of the Small Business Administration as \na disaster area as a result of Hurricanes Katrina or Rita. Lastly, the \nbill would require the administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to ensure that every small business participating in the \n8(a) program before the date of enactment of the Act is reviewed and \nbrought into compliance with this act. This requirement would ensure \nthat any eligible previous 8(a) participants will be allowed back into \nthe program. As such, these key provisions would ensure that these \nbusinesses continue to play a vital role in rebuilding their \ncommunities. I note that I introduced a similar provision as part of S. \n3285, the disadvantaged Business Disaster Eligibility Act during the \n110th Congress and as part of S. 2731 last Congress. During the 109th \nCongress, this proposal passed the House of Representatives but we were \nunable to pass the legislation here in the Senate before we adjourned \nfor the year. I look forward to renewing my fight this Congress as I \nbelieve that this is a commonsense proposal which would not cost a \ngreat deal. It would, however, make a huge difference for these \nbusinesses impacted by Katrina and Rita.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1511\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
