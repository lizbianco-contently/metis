It is a simple \nmajority vote to move to this most important piece of legislation.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 3637\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am told that S. 3637 is due for its second \nreading and is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3637) to temporarily extend the transaction \n     account guarantee program, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to this bill at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is one of the must-do pieces of \nlegislation we have to do before this calendar year ends.\n\n\n                         Finding Common Ground\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, too often it is a challenge to find common \nground here in Washington. But as we negotiate a path back from the \nfiscal cliff, we should also recognize when Democrats and Republicans \nagree. We agree taxes should not go up for anyone making less than \n$250,000 a year. Now, 97 percent of small businesses and 98 percent of \nmiddle-class families would benefit from that.\n  With common ground in sight, we should be able to act today to avert \nthe fiscal cliff for millions of families and businesses. Even if we \ndisagree on whether to extend tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent \nof Americans, we should agree to hold the middle class harmless and do \nit today, do it now. A single vote in the House of Representatives \nwould get the job done now. Unfortunately, there is one obstacle \nstanding between Congress and compromise: Grover Norquist. For years \nNorquist has bullied lawmakers willing to put their oath of office or \ntheir promise to serve constituents ahead of their pledge to this \nantitax zealot. His brand of ideological extremism has been bad for \nCongress and even worse for the country. So I was pleased to see \nRepublicans in Congress distance themselves from Norquist this week. I \nappreciate that very much. So do the American people. I am sure their \nconstituents do. Several Republican lawmakers have said revenue should \nbe on\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\nthe table during the fiscal cliff negotiations. How common sense is \nthat? Absolutely. It is so clear to everyone except Grover Norquist. It \nis time now for the Republicans to turn this happy talk into action.\n  President Obama and Senate Democrats ran on a promise to end the Bush \ntax breaks for the wealthy. President Obama did not hide that in the \nlast year of his campaign. Every place he went, that is what he talked \nabout. Americans, when they voted, raised their voices and supported \nour pledge. Congress must act in accordance with the will of the \nAmerican people.\n\n  An agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff must give economic certainty \nto middle-class families and must protect important tax deductions for \nfamilies and businesses still struggling to recover from this great \nrecession. It must take a balanced approach to reduce spending. But it \nmust also ask the richest of the rich to pay a little bit extra to \nreduce the huge deficit we have.\n  Any balanced agreement will require difficult concessions from both \nsides--I said both sides. Clinging to the kind of ideological purity \nGrover Norquist peddles, saying he will never bend or compromise, is \neasy. Cooperating with those with whom you disagree is hard. Doing what \nis right for the country despite personal cost is hard. Legislating is \nhard. As we approach the fiscal cliff, Democrats are ready to make \nthose tough choices. I hope my Republican friends, especially those who \nclaim they put no pledge before their pledge to serve their \nconstituents, can say the same.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor to \ndiscuss what is known as the fiscal cliff, a mix of automatic tax hikes \nand defense cuts that are set to hit at the end of the year, \njeopardizing our security as well as our economy. My message was pretty \nsimple: A solution is possible.\n  Republicans have been reasonable, and the President needs to lead. He \nis the only one who can get us to a solution. If that is what he wants, \nwe will succeed. So it was with some concern that I read this morning \nthat the President plans to hit the road next week to drum up support \nfor his own personal approach to the short- and long-term fiscal \nchallenges we face. In other words, rather than sitting down with \nlawmakers of both parties and working out an agreement, he is back on \nthe campaign trail, presumably with the same old talking points with \nwhich we are all quite familiar.\n  Look, we already know the President is a very good campaigner. We \ncongratulate him on his reelection. What we do not know is whether he \nhas the leadership qualities necessary to lead his party to a \nbipartisan agreement on big issues such as we currently face. So let me \nsuggest that if the President wants a solution to the challenges of the \nmoment, the people he needs to be talking to are the members of his own \nparty so he can convince them of the need to act. We are not going to \nsolve this problem by creating villains and drumming up outrage. We \nwill solve the problem by doing the hard work of sitting down and \nfiguring out a solution that involves tough choices on all sides.\n  That gets at another point I made yesterday. In the past, Democrats \nhave demanded tax hikes now for spending cuts that never actually \nhappen. Not this time. A balanced approach means real spending \nreductions now. And I am not saying this because it is the Republicans' \nposition, although it is. I am not saying this because I have anything \nagainst the government, which I do not. I am saying this because it is \nthe only approach that has any chance of working. No credible deficit \nreduction plan we have seen over the past few years excludes real cuts. \nIf we want to prevent this crisis, Democrats need to be as serious \nabout cutting spending as they are about spending. It is that simple.\n  By the way, this is an approach Americans overwhelmingly support. \nAccording to a recent AP poll, voters prefer spending cuts to tax hikes \n62 percent to 29 percent--a more than 2-to-1 margin. Now, there is a \nreason for this. The American people are not stupid. They know the \nproblem with Washington is not that it taxes too little but that it \nspends too much. They also know the only reason we are even talking \nabout a looming fiscal crisis right now is because the Democrats have \nspent the last 4 years creating it.\n  That is what I would like to focus on this morning--how we got into \nthis mess in the first place--because amidst all of the talk about \nplans and proposals, it is easy to forget that we did not get here by \naccident; we got here because Washington Democrats, from the President \non down, have done two things exceedingly well over the past 4 years: \nspent other people's money and kicked the can down the road--spend \nother people's money and kick the can down the road. For 4 years, \nDemocrats spent money we did not have in the misguided hope that it \nwould help the economy. They have borrowed trillions of dollars to keep \nunemployment pretty much right where it was when they started. And here \nis what we have 4 years later: a mountain of debt and a looming \nnational budgetary crisis.\n  Republicans are happy to talk about how to solve this mess, but make \nno mistake, we will also talk about how we got here. The reason we are \nhaving these negotiations is because Washington Democrats have spent \nmoney without any care for the cost or the future and refuse to do \nanything to protect long-term spending programs, such as Medicare, a \nfailure that is among the biggest single drivers of our debt.\n  All this reflects a very clear philosophy: For Washington Democrats, \nevery dollar that has ever been secured for anything is sacred--every \ndollar that has ever been secured for anything is sacred--and they will \ndefend it to the death regardless of what it means for jobs or the \neconomy. But those days are over because you do not eliminate trillion-\ndollar deficits by taxing the rich--not even close. It may be an \neffective talking point, but as a matter of policy it is a minor deal, \nand the Democrats know it. So, as we move into the final stretch, it is \ntime, as I have said, to put the talking points away and get serious \nabout striking a deal.\n  The first step to recovery is to admit you have a problem. If \nborrowing more than 40 cents for every dollar you spend does not \nconvince you you have a spending problem, frankly, I do not know what \nwill. If Democrats cannot admit we have a spending problem, they need \nto talk to their constituents more. They need to get real. That means \nchanging the way things have been done around here for the past few \nyears.\n  Independent budget experts have been telling us for ages that our \nlong-term budget deficits are driven by the unsustainable health care \nentitlements. What was the administration's response to that? Their \nresponse was to add trillions more by creating an entirely new health \ncare entitlement program. We were promised that the President's health \ncare law would reduce health care costs. What did it do? We are now \ntold health care costs will rise as a share of our economy and the \ntaxpayer's liability. By one estimate, those costs will go up by more \nthan $\\1/2\\ trillion over the next 10 years.\n  We know the number of Americans 65 or older will increase by one-\nthird over the next 10 years. According to the Census Bureau, there \nwere 40 million older Americans in 2010. There will be 54 million of \nthem a decade after that, and more than 72 million older Americans a \ndecade after that. What are the Democrats doing to ensure the programs \nthey rely upon will actually be there? We cannot ignore the facts. We \nneed to prepare for the demographic changes we know are coming. \nMedicare is simply too important for millions of seniors to let it \ncontinue down the road to insolvency. We must preserve it for today's \nseniors and strengthen it for those who will retire in the years ahead.\n  As Congress looks for savings, we need to look at the new health care \nentitlements too. While Democrats and Republicans may disagree on \nObamaCare, it is ridiculous to suggest that we make changes to Medicare \nand Medicaid while leaving $1.6 trillion in new ObamaCare spending \nuntouched.\n  For 4 years Democrats have been completely unbalanced in the way they \nhave spent paper dollars. Yet now that the crisis is upon us, they \nsolemnly advise us that we need to be balanced in\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\nour solution. This is how you ensure the expansion of government. This \nis how you end up with $16 trillion of debt, but it is not how you get \nout of it. It is not how you solve the problem. You solve the problem \nby taking tough medicine and tough votes. You solve it by doing \nsomething different than what you have been doing all along. You solve \nit with the help of a President who is willing to lead his party. You \ndon't just change your rhetoric and your talking points while telling \nyour base behind closed doors you aren't going to give any ground. You \nchange your behavior. For Democrats in Washington, as I have said, that \nmeans getting serious for a change about cuts. The time for campaigning \nis over. It is time to act.\n\n\n                             Nuclear Option\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday the majority leader and I had a rather \nspirited discussion about his intention to change the Senate rules \noutside the process provided in those rules.\n  When he was in the minority, my friend from Nevada objected \nstrenuously to the very procedure he now wants to employ. He called \nusing a simple majority maneuver to change Senate procedure the \n``nuclear option'' and described it as breaking the rules to change the \nrules. Now that he is in the majority, he says the ends justify the \nmeans. He says we have to make the Senate more efficient and we have to \nviolate the Senate rules to do that so he and his colleagues in the \nmajority can implement more easily their vision for America. According \nto him, these minor changes won't affect anyone who has the thought of \nmaking America better.\n  Let me say that again. The majority leader said these minor changes \nwon't affect anyone who has the thought of making America better. Of \ncourse, in the majority leader's world, it will be just he and his \ncolleagues who determine what makes America better.\n  In short, according to my friend from Nevada, the means by which he \nwants to achieve his ends don't matter, only his ends matter. That is \npretty convenient if you happen to be in the majority at the moment. I \nsay again, at the moment. But convenience or efficiency, as my friend \nhas described it, is not what the Senate has been about.\n  My friend the majority leader may have put it best in 2006 when he \nmade the first of his commitments to respect the rights of the \nminority. This is what the majority leader said:\n\n       As majority leader, I intend to run the Senate with respect \n     for the rules and for the minority rights the rules protect. \n     The Senate was not established to be efficient. Sometimes the \n     rules get in the way of efficiency. The Senate was \n     established to make sure that minorities are protected. \n     Majorities can always protect themselves, but minorities \n     cannot. That is what the Senate is all about.\n\n  My friend from Nevada then committed that he was going to ``treat my \nRepublican colleagues the way I expect to be treated'' and that he \nwould do everything he could to ``preserve the rules and traditions of \nthe institution that I love.''\n  Inaccurately describing the essence and wise purpose of the Senate, \nthe majority leader sounded a lot like our former colleague Robert C. \nByrd. So I was quite surprised to hear our friend from Nevada assert \nthat Senator Byrd would actually support the heavy-handed tactic he \nintends to employ.\n  I am not going to correct all the inaccuracies my friend made \nyesterday, such as saying four times that it takes 10 days to get out a \nbill. I don't know what version of Riddick's my friend has been \nreading, but if it actually took 10 days to get on a bill I might \nactually support some rule changes myself.\n  But I must disabuse my friend from Nevada about how Senator Byrd \nwould view the heavy-handed tactic he intends to employ. Unlike the \nmajority leader, I recall when our late colleague spoke on this topic \nat a Rules Committee hearing the last time the majority leader \nentertained ``breaking the rules to change the rules.'' Senator Byrd \nwas unequivocally against violating Senate rules to change the rules \nthe way the current majority leader is proposing.\n  Senator Byrd began by noting that ``Our Founding Fathers intended the \nSenate to be a continuing body that allows for open and unlimited \ndebate and the protection of minority rights. Senators have understood \nthat,'' he stated, ``since the Senate first convened.'' That is Senator \nByrd on the history of the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd also noted that at the Constitutional Convention, James \nMadison reported that the Senate was to be ``a necessary fence'' in \norder to ``protect the people against their rulers,'' and ``to protect \nthe people against the transient impressions into which they themselves \nmight be led.''\n  How did Senator Byrd view the filibuster in the role of the Senate? \nHow did it relate to the Senate as a ``necessary fence''? Senator Byrd \nsaid, ``The right to filibuster anchors this necessary fence.''\n  Senator Byrd acknowledged that this right should not be abused, and \nthat ``there are many suggestions as to what we should do'' if it is \nabused. He recounted procedures that currently exist under the rules--I \nsay again, procedures that currently exist under the rules--to address \nit if it is.\n  As I suggested yesterday, Senator Byrd also indicated that simply \nworking a full week such as most people do--I mean, most people in \nAmerica have a 5-day work week--by simply working a full week we could \naddress some of these concerns. Senator Byrd bemoaned the fact that \n``the Senate often works 3-day weeks.'' In other words, if you want the \nSenate to be more productive, start working more. It is not rocket \nscience here. That is what Senator Byrd was saying.\n  But Senator Byrd was clear about what we should never do. He said, \n``We must never, ever tear down the only wall--the necessary fence--\nthis Nation has against the excesses of the executive branch and the \nresult of haste and tyranny of the majority.''\n  Senator Byrd, as we know, was a historian. He was a skillful majority \nleader who understood the unique importance of the Senate and the need \nof a majority leader to keep his commitment. But he was also a \npolitical realist who had been around enough to understand that \npolitical majorities are fleeting, and if you break the rules to suit \nyour political purposes of the moment, you may regret having done so \nwhen you find yourself in the minority. Senator Byrd specifically said:\n\n       I strongly caution my colleagues as some propose to alter \n     the rules to severely limit the ability of a minority to \n     conduct a filibuster. I know what it is to be majority \n     leader, and wake up on a Wednesday morning in November and \n     find yourself a minority leader.\n\n  To make sure there was no doubt as to his views on the subject, \nSenator Byrd concluded by unequivocally objecting to the use of the \nnuclear option that the Senator from Nevada is now proposing. He said:\n\n       The Rules Committee must, however, jealously guard against \n     efforts to change or reinterpret the Senate rules by a simple \n     majority, circumventing rule XXII where a two-thirds majority \n     is required.\n\n  My friend the majority leader is no more correct about Senator Byrd's \nviews on the nuclear option, on the idea of breaking the rules to \nchange the rules, than he is about taking 10 days to get on a bill.\n  I will conclude by reading what are likely the last words Senator \nByrd spoke on the subject of the nuclear option, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to reflect on his wise counsel. This is what he said:\n\n       As I have said before, the Senate has been the last \n     fortress of minority rights and freedom of speech in the \n     Republic for more than two centuries. I pray that Senators \n     will pause and reflect before ignoring that history and \n     tradition in favor of the political party of the moment.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                             Rules Changes\n\n  Mr. REID. To paraphrase Shakespeare, which I don't do too often, I \nthink the Republican leader protests far too much. Now he has gone back \nto quoting Senator Byrd.\n  The situation we had when the Republicans were trying to change the \nrules regarding judges was totally different than what has happened on \nthe floor the last few years. You see, what Democrats were proposing to \ndo, help repair the Senate, is pretty much what Senator McConnell said \nwas necessary in 2005.\n  For example, Senator McConnell has said that the Senate has \nrepeatedly adjusted its rules as circumstances dictate. Let me quote. \nIn remarks on the\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\nSenate floor in May of 2005, Senator McConnell said:\n\n       Despite the incredulous protestations of our Democratic \n     colleagues, the Senate has repeatedly adjusted its rules as \n     circumstances dictate. The first Senate adopted its rules by \n     majority vote, rules, I might add, which specifically \n     provided a means to end debate instantly by simple majority \n     vote. That was the first Senate way back at the beginning of \n     our country. That was Senate Rule 8, the ability to move the \n     previous question and end debate.\n\n  Let me repeat some of the things he said:\n\n       Despite the incredulous protestations of our Democratic \n     colleagues, the Senate has repeatedly adjusted its rules as \n     circumstances dictate.\n\n  The same day, Senator McConnell also reported that the Senate has \n``often reformed Senate procedure by a simple majority vote.''\n  When Republicans were in the majority, Senator McConnell said this:\n\n       This is not the first time a minority of senators has upset \n     a Senate tradition or practice, and the current Senate \n     majority intends to do what the majority in the Senate has \n     often done--use its constitutional authority under article I, \n     section 5, to reform Senate procedure by a simple majority \n     vote.\n\n  On March 27, 2005, Senator McConnell told Fox News that the Senate \ncan change the rules with 51 votes. McConnell said:\n\n       Well, obviously you would need 51 votes to do it. I'm \n     confident that we would have 51 votes if the majority leader \n     decides to do it. I believe it should be done if we cannot \n     get accommodations from the Democrats.\n\n  So what has changed in the last few years since those statements were \nmade? Well, for one thing under Leader McConnell Republican Senators \nhave mounted filibusters so much more on a regular basis.\n  We talked here yesterday about the motions to proceed. I had a \nmeeting this morning with one Senator who has been in the Senate for 30 \nyears. He said, Why are you only changing the rules this much?\n  Look how simple the rule changes are that we are making, motions to \nproceed. Let us talk about that. I have a piece of legislation on the \nfloor, as we have on a number of occasions. That has to sit for a \ncouple of days. Once that happens and they won't let us on the bill, \nthey won't let us on anything, I have to file cloture. Let us say I may \ndo that on a Wednesday after a bill lays there for a couple of days, so \nwe can have a Friday cloture vote.\n  But, Mr. President, having been here not very long, you know that is \nnot the end of it. We have got cloture when we really haven't because \nthere is 30 hours of idle time to do zero, nothing. Then after the 30 \nhours, you are on the bill, and to get off the bill you have to go \nthrough the same process again.\n  I talked to three Republican Senators yesterday and they said, \nExplain that to me. I said, Well, for the approximately 9 or 10 days \nthat we waste on getting on a bill, we could, if you guys let us on a \nbill, we could be offering amendments for 4 or 5 days instead of \nwaiting for 30 hours to expire and all of that.\n  Also, we have this crazy idea that if you are going to have a \nfilibuster, you have to stand and say something, not hide in your \noffice someplace or go to a wedding that you are having in your State. \nThen we also are doing the incredulous thing of saying if we want to go \nto conference on a bill, rather than having three filibusters necessary \nto overcome with cloture, we would do it once.\n  Those are the simple changes we are making, and Senator McConnell was \nright when he said that despite the incredulous protestations of our \nDemocratic colleagues, the Senate has repeatedly adjusted its rules as \ncircumstances dictated. We are making simple changes. We are not \nchanging the Constitution, we are not getting rid of the filibuster. We \nare making three simple rules changes. As my friend the Democratic \nSenator from New Mexico, who is retiring, my friend who has been here \n30 years, said Why is that all you are doing?\n  Under Leader McConnell, Republicans have mounted filibusters on \nthings that don't matter. The motion to proceed, he said, well, that \nallows us to get--I am paraphrasing--that allows us to get set and have \nan idea what will happen on the bill itself.\n  That is nonsense. It is only as the leader indicated at the beginning \nof this Congress, his No. 1 goal is to defeat President Obama. We have \nbeen able to get nothing done because of that. The American people are \nsick of it.\n  In the 109th Congress, from 2005 to 2006, when the Republicans were \nin the majority, there were very few filibusters. In the next Congress, \nwhen the roles were reversed, Republicans, they have done--I give this \nexample, which is so understandable to everybody. Lyndon Johnson, \nmajority leader for 6 years--I will have 6 years at the end of this \nyear--had one cloture motion. Me? I think we are up to about 386 now. \nIn this Congress we have had 110 filibusters and we have weeks to go. \nIt is even in the New York Times. They say: Oh, he has filled the \nlegislative tree. The New York Times reported I did that 19 times--out \nof 110 filibusters. Had they let us get on a bill, there wouldn't be \nany need to fill the tree. We could have spent that time having \namendments.\n\n  Republicans have increased the number of filibusters so out of \nproportion to any changes that have been in the Senate it is hard to \ncomprehend. The Senate is not working as it should. Everyone in \nAmerica--and that is kind of an exaggeration, I acknowledge that--maybe \nnot everyone, but as I travel around the country trying to help my \ncandidates get elected and raise money, people say: What are you going \nto do to change the filibuster? This is awful. What is going on?\n  That is what they say. They expect Washington, the Senate, to work \nlike ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' not idle time with quorum calls \nand waiting for 30 hours to expire on meaningless 30-hour postcloture \ntime. We are not getting rid of that with regular filibusters, but we \nare getting rid of it on a motion to proceed.\n  The Senate isn't working. Apart from Senator McConnell and his \ntroops, basically everybody in America agrees the Senate is not \nworking.\n  In the Senate, as in any human institution, there will always be \nplenty of blame to go around, but let's call it like it is. Two long-\ntime Senate watchers, Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein--one representing a \nprogressive think tank, the other a conservative think tank--wrote \nthis:\n\n       We have been studying Washington politics and Congress for \n     more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this \n     dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both \n     parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we \n     have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the \n     problem lies with the Republican Party.\n\n  I didn't make that up. They wrote it; two of the foremost Congress \nwatchers this country has ever had. That is what they wrote. Objective \noutside observers are calling it like it is. The current Republican \nminority is abusing the Senate rules. So, in response, to quote Senator \nMcConnell:\n\n       The current Senate majority intends to do what the majority \n     in the Senate has often done--use its constitutional \n     authority under article I, Section 5, to reform Senate \n     procedure.\n\n  We plan to do so to help repair the Senate. I am sorry there are \nthose who are criticizing me that we are not doing more, but we are \ndoing this. We get rid of the motion to proceed and have people come \nand present their faces--as Senator Durbin said in a more explicit way, \nput their rear ends here in the Senate--rather than someplace outside \nCapitol Hill.\n  This is the right thing to do. We need to repair the Senate. It is \nnot working, and at the start of the next Congress we intend to do our \nutmost to take some modest steps to make it work better.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I certainly agree the Senate isn't \nworking. We get a few days in between recesses, rarely work at night, \nand almost never do anything on Thursday. That is entirely within the \npurview of the majority leader.\n  It is true that a few years back, when my party was in the majority, \nwe contemplated changing the rules, but cooler heads prevailed and we \ndidn't. The fundamental issue, as my friend lays out, is that he wants \nto break the rules to change the rules. In other words, he and I are \nnot negotiating on these issues. He is deciding what will be the rule \nin the Senate. He will break the rules in order to change the rules. \nThat is all anybody listening to this debate needs to understand. What \nthe majority leader is going to do is he is going\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\nto break the rules to change the rules--one party only.\n  We ought to be negotiating rule changes. Rule changes ought to be \nproposed by the majority leader and the minority leader together that \nwould surpass the 67-vote threshold, if it is designed to protect the \nSenate from the whims of new majorities. There is always a temptation \nwhen a party is in the majority to want to change the rules to benefit \nthemselves at the expense of others. It is particularly absurd to do it \nright now because anything Senate Democrats would gain out of that \nwould go nowhere in the House. So there is no practical purpose served \nby this. All it does is put on record that Senate Democrats are willing \nto break the rules to change the rules. That is the fundamental issue. \nRules changes ought to be negotiated by the two leaders, as they have \nbeen down through the years, and then proposed together.\n  As I have indicated on several occasions--and I will say again--I \nthink the frustrations the majority leader has had could have been \neasily solved by putting some of his young Members in the Chair and \nbreaking down some--one person--trying to make it difficult to get on \nto a bill. All this could have been fixed. Rather than complaining \nabout it, just do something about it. That is what I would have done, \nif I had been in his shoes. He has chosen not to do that.\n  Rather than point fingers and continue to campaign--look, the \ncampaign is over. You guys had a pretty good day. You are in the \nmajority. But you can't seem to turn the campaign off. You just keep \nrunning it forever. So here we are with this explosive nuclear option \nbeing thrown into the Chamber at a time when we ought to be turning the \nelection off and trying to come together to solve the biggest problem, \nwhich I talked about first, which is the fiscal cliff and the Nation's \nseemingly hopeless debt and deficit situation. That is what we ought to \nbe doing. Instead, my friends on the other side just can't keep from \ncontinuing to celebrate the election. You won. Now, why don't we \ngovern. The way to govern is to try to bring this body together.\n  The Senate has been built over the years on collegiality. We have \nalways had some personalities on both sides who made it a challenge for \nwhoever the majority leader was. I can remember back when we were in \nthe majority and Howard Metzenbaum from Ohio would sit out here on the \nfloor and read every bill. He was a royal pain in the you know what to \nwhoever the majority leader was at the time. The Senate survived all \nthat. We didn't engage in a rules change dictated by whoever was in the \nmajority at the moment.\n\n  This is exactly the wrong way to start off on a new year and to end \nan old year with a ton of problems that we have to deal with. Here we \nare, as a result of this suggestion that we employ the nuclear option, \narguing about arcane rules changes when we ought to be sitting down \ntogether and trying to solve the Nation's huge deficit and debt \nproblems.\n  But the fundamental issue is this: Is the majority going to break the \nrules to change the rules? That is the issue before the Senate. Are we \ngoing to break the rules to change the rules--employ the nuclear \noption, fundamentally change the body, not have a negotiation between \nthe two leaders about what adjustments might be appropriate to make the \nSenate work better. Oh, no, we are going to do it on our own.\n  I think it is a huge mistake not only for the Senate, but it will \nimpact obviously our short-term ability to come together and to work on \nthe big problems the country sent us to solve.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader is entitled to his own \nopinion but not his own facts, and we seem to have a revision of facts \nthat simply are not accurate. I served with Senator Metzenbaum. He \nunderstood the rules. We always worked through them. There was not a \nbig deal with that. He slowed things down a little bit, but that is \nwhat Senators do.\n  Also, remember who said that a simple majority would do it? Mitch \nMcConnell. I am not breaking the rules to change the rules. Here again \nis what Senator McConnell said:\n\n       The first Senate adopted its rules by majority vote, rules, \n     I might add, which specifically provided a means to end \n     debate instantly by simple majority vote. That was the first \n     Senate way back at the beginning of our country.\n\n  That is true. I would also say----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield on that point?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did the Senate majority at that time, made up of \nRepublicans, choose to go forward and do that? We did not do it. We did \nnot use the nuclear option. There was a lot of discussion about it \nwhich related to judicial appointments, but in the end the majority \nchose not to do it.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, the point is that rules have been \nchanged by simple majority for a long time. That is what Senator \nMcConnell said in 2005 and that is accurate.\n  I would also say this, and I say this as respectfully as I can about \nthe deceased Senator Byrd. I think people will recall, those who served \nin the Senate when Senator Byrd was around, that I was referred to as \nhis pet. OK. He took very good care of me. We had a relationship that \nwas very unique. I cared a great deal about this man. But don't \nmisquote him.\n  Leader Byrd made clear he was willing to force a majority vote if he \nneeded to. Here is what Senator Robert Byrd said:\n\n       The time has come to changes the rules. I want to change \n     them in an orderly fashion. I want a time agreement. But \n     barring that, if I have to be forced into a corner to try for \n     a majority vote, I will do it because I am going to do my \n     duty as I see my duty, whether I win or lose.\n\n  I can see that man with his white hair, standing straight and tall, \nsaying that. That is a direct quote from Robert Byrd. I am in the same \nposition he was. The Republicans have made the Senate dysfunctional, \nand I have asked my caucus to support me for some simple changes--\nsimple changes. I went over them. The vexatious motion to proceed that \nwas never abused until this Congress by these Republicans we are going \nto change, and that is the way it should be.\n  Talk about all the time we are wasting not talking about the fiscal \ncliff is poppycock. The Republican leader is the one who is coming to \nthe floor engaging in these conversations, not me. There are going to \nbe no rules changes until the next Congress. This isn't taking away \nfrom the fiscal cliff arguments at all that either side might have.\n  I would also say this. Before coming here, I was a trial lawyer, and \nI am proud of the fact that I was. I tried lots of cases. I had many \njury trials--over 100. But I also settled hundreds and hundreds of \ncases. One never felt comfortable going to trial because what we always \nwanted to do was to settle the case before that. Even in the cases we \nwere forced to go to trial, with rare exception, the other side--either \nplaintiff or defendant, whichever side you weren't on--would come to \nsay, why don't we try to work something out, and here is my idea.\n  But here we have a unique deal. I have a Republican leader saying why \ndoesn't he negotiate with us. Our proposal is there, which is to simply \nchange the motion to proceed, have a talking filibuster, and do \nsomething about the way we go to conference. If the Republican leader \ndoesn't like that and has some other suggestion about how rules should \nbe changed, I will be happy to talk to him. If he thinks things are \nhunky-dory right now, he is in a distinct minority, as are the \nRepublicans in the Senate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We keep quoting Senator Byrd back and forth, but I \nthink it is appropriate to look at what he said in 2010. He said:\n\n       I believe that efforts to change or reinterpret the rules \n     in order to facilitate expeditious action by a simple \n     majority are grossly misguided. The Senate is the only place \n     in government where the rights of the numerical minority are \n     so protected.\n\n  I said in my prepared statement earlier what Senator Byrd said before \nthe Rules Committee:\n\n       The [Rules] Committee must, however, jealously guard \n     against efforts to change or reinterpret the Senate rules by \n     a simple majority, circumventing rule XXII where a two-thirds \n     majority is required.\n\n  I keep coming back to this because it has to do with the way any rule \nchange is implemented. That is the point. The majority leader has \nsuggested, and I think it is appropriate, that we talk\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\nabout rule changes together. But that is not what he is suggesting he \nis going to do. He says he is going to break the rules to change the \nrules and employ the nuclear option.\n  That is not a negotiation with the minority over rules changes. What \nwe ought to be doing is talking to each other about what adjustments in \nthe rules we could advocate together, and not one party with a majority \ntoday--that might be in the minority 2 years from now--breaking the \nrules to change the rules for some kind of misguided short-term \nadvantage. That is the problem.\n  So I would be happy to talk to the majority leader about these \nissues, but I vigorously oppose--and I know Senator Byrd would \nvigorously oppose--breaking the rules to change the rules. He was very \nclear about that in 2010. I know he would object to it.\n  I hope somehow this nuclear option can be avoided. It seems to me to \nbe an absolutely unnecessary distraction away from much larger issues \nconfronting the future of our Nation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd served in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate for almost 60 years. He gave lots of \nspeeches. I have quoted what he said. I will quote again part of what \nhe said.\n\n       The Constitution in Article I, Section 5 says that, Each \n     House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\n       Now we are at the beginning of the Congress. This Congress \n     is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past.\n\n  So this debate is not going to be solved by the deceased. It is going \nto be solved by us. We are in the Senate today and the Senate has not \nbeen working. No matter how many times the Republican leader says he \nlikes how things are today, it doesn't make it so that the majority of \nthe Senate likes how it is today. The facts are the facts. We can't \nmake them up. The Senate is not working, and we need to do something to \nfix it.\n  I close, then, as I began. I would be happy to work with Leader \nMcConnell about rules changes. I have made clear what we seek. I await \nhis suggestions. As I repeat again what I said earlier, a man who has \nserved with distinction in the Senate, Jeff Bingaman--quite a legal \nscholar, having been attorney general before he came here--asked: Why \nare we asking for such modest changes? So if the Republican leader has \nsome ideas as to what he thinks should be done, I will come to his \noffice. We can do it privately or publicly. I am happy to work with \nhim. As I indicated, that is how I used to do things when I tried \ncases. This is the same, just that we have a bigger jury.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6914-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to continue the conversation \nthat our two leaders were engaged in earlier and also on yesterday. \nThis is going to be a very important issue for the Senate.\n  To put it into perspective for the American people, let me just say \nthat a rules change in the Senate is not a small or an inconsequential \nmatter. It is even more important if it is attempted to be done without \ngoing through the normal process of changing the rules, which requires \na two-thirds majority. This is important because the Senate has always \nconsidered itself a continuing body. It does not end and then begin \nagain as the House of Representatives does because the House has an \nelection every 2 years. In this body, Members are elected for 6-year \nterms. As a result, every 2 years we have some turnover in the body, \nbut two-thirds of the body has already been here and continues forward.\n  So the rules of the Senate have always been continuing rules of the \ncontinuing body, amendable by a two-thirds majority of the body. To \nsuggest a nuclear option by which a mere majority of the body can amend \nthe rules is itself a violation of the rules. It is an assertion of \npower. But as the old saying goes: Might does not make right. And the \nfact that the majority may have the power to overrule a ruling of the \nChair, thus establishing a new precedent and a new rule of the Senate, \ndoes not make it right. That is why it hasn't been done.\n  In point of fact, there was a time a few years ago, as has been \ndiscussed, when some members of the Senate Republican majority were \nconsidering the use of the same parliamentary tactic to ensure a vote \non nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court and also for the Court of \nAppeals. The feeling was that the Democratic minority had filibustered \nover and over and over and had prevented votes, I think, on Miguel \nEstrada, who was being nominated for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nthink he was filibustered seven separate times.\n\n  The Republican leadership was investigating the possibility of \nensuring that we could get a vote. The only way that seemed possible \nwas to assert this power of overruling the Parliamentarian's ruling \nthrough the Chair and thus establishing by 51 votes--or a mere \nmajority--a new rule of the Senate.\n  That was deemed to be such a change that it was called the nuclear \noption because it hadn't been done, and we could say that it was \ncomparable to the use of a nuclear weapon in a war. It was such a game-\nchanging proposition, to say the least, that Members on both sides of \nthe aisle got together in what they called the Gang of 14. I think \nalmost everyone in this body is glad that cooler heads prevailed; that \nthose 14 Members decided they would reach an agreement amongst \nthemselves that would make it impossible for either the Democratic \nParty to automatically filibuster nominees or for the Republican Party \nto have this right to change the rules just because they had 51 votes. \nTherefore, they reached the compromise which, for judicial nominees, \nwas that there would be no filibuster except in extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  Both sides deemed that a sufficient way of resolving the issue that \ncame before us at that time. Everybody stood down. The war did not \noccur. The nuclear weapon was not used, and that was for the best of \nthe country and certainly for the best of the Senate. We avoided a \ncrisis and, certainly, there would have been a crisis. I can't imagine \nthat my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle would not have \nreacted very badly to the use of that nuclear option had it been done \nby the Republican majority.\n  Well, today the shoe is on the other foot. The Democratic majority \nnow has reason to believe that it would like to move forward with more \nalacrity on legislation. Therefore, it believes that by this same \nnuclear option procedure it should change the rules so that the ability \nto filibuster at the beginning of the consideration of the bill is \neliminated.\n  The Republican minority naturally has said: Wait a minute. That is \nwrong for two reasons. First of all, just as you accused us of doing, \nyou are changing the rules without going through the rules process \nchange. This is your own version of the nuclear option. If it was wrong \nthen, it is still wrong now. And most of us agreed after the fact that \nit was wrong then. But, secondly, what you would do, if you eliminate \nthe requirement for cloture and a cloture vote if there is an objection \nto a unanimous consent request to take up the bill or motion to proceed \nto a bill, what you are doing is putting all of the power into the \nhands of the majority leader--in this case, the Democratic leader--to \ndecide whether there will be any amendments at all from the Republican \nside or even from the Democratic side. The only leverage that the \nminority has to ensure that it will be able to offer amendments is to \nnegotiate with the majority leader and ensure that right exists. And \nthe only leverage it has is to deny cloture on the\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nmotion to proceed in order to instigate that negotiation. It is \npolitical leverage. Let's call it by its true name. But without that \npolitical leverage, that check and balance, the majority leader in the \nSenate takes a very giant step toward becoming exactly what the Speaker \nof the House is, in effect, a dictator.\n  Now, I use that term in a very kind sense because the Speakers of the \nHouse under whom I served as a Member of the House of Representatives, \nand certainly the current Speaker of the House, are fine people who \ncare a lot about the institution of the House of Representatives and, \nin some cases, care for some degree of minority rights. But they all \nhave one thing in common: They run the House. If they decide, through \nthe Rules Committee, there aren't going to be any amendments offered by \nthe other side, there aren't any amendments offered. Frequently the \nminority is in the position of complaining about the fact that the \nSpeaker, through the Rules Committee, denies them the right to offer \namendments or controls which amendments they can offer, controls the \ntime.\n  So if you are a Member of the House of Representatives and you want \nto offer an amendment, you can't automatically do that, as has been the \ncase in the Senate. You have to go to the Rules Committee--which is \nhand-picked by the Speaker--and you have to ask them for permission to \noffer an amendment and how long you will have to talk about that \namendment and the wording of the amendment and all of the other \nconditions that the Rules Committee establishes for debate of the \nmatter on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n  When the Constitution was originally written, the Founders' idea was \nthat we would have two different legislative bodies that would provide \na check and a balance on each other. One would represent the immediate \npassions of the people, the House of Representatives, the people's \nbody. If the people were emotionally invested in a particular issue, \nthe House was elected, and they would hurry up and pass that \nlegislation. They could do it with a majority because the power of the \nSpeaker was able to run over any minority rights. The minority wouldn't \nbe able to get in the way.\n  But when it came to the Senate the idea was, slow it down, think it \nover. Let's make sure we want to do this. That is why we have the 6-\nyear terms, the continuing body, and the minority rights to offer \namendments.\n  That right to offer amendments is perhaps the most important way in \nwhich the Senate is distinguished from other legislative bodies around \nthe world and from the House of Representatives because it does \nguarantee minority rights. And not just party minority.\n  If you are a member of the majority party from a State that has a \nvery distinct and serious interest in a bill, the majority leader can \nsimply say: I don't want to consider your amendment. You are out of \nluck under this proposal, whether you are a member of the minority or \nthe majority.\n  It is not just minority rights in the sense of political minority, \nbut also, let's say, you are from a small State rather than a big \nState, and there is a bill on the floor that helps the big States, and \nyou want to offer amendments from a little State. It will be up to the \nmajority leader to decide whether you can even offer that amendment if \nthis rule change is adopted. So there are two very important reasons \nthe Senate should be very careful about proceeding down this path. That \nis what the Republican leader has been talking about the last couple of \ndays here on the floor.\n\n  It is important for the Senate to reflect in a longer view not only \nthe views of the majority--political or otherwise--but also those who \nmight have some disagreement with the majority, the theory being that \nthe majority isn't always 100 percent right. In any event, people \naround the country have a right to be represented through their Senator \nto get their points of view argued and discussed and perhaps considered \nfor a vote here in the Senate. That has always been the way it is. It \nis a tradition that has served this country well. To eliminate that \nwith this so-called rules change would do great disservice to the \nAmerican people, to the legislative process, to our Constitution, and \nto the great ability of this body to perform its function in the way \nthat has been deemed so important for over 200 years now.\n  There is a reason this is called the greatest deliberative body in \nthe history of mankind--because we deliberate. We think about things. \nWe debate them. We have all kinds of points of view offered or \npotentially offered through the amendment process, and if that is \ndenied, this will no longer be the body it has always been.\n  People before us have cautioned both Democratic and Republican \nmajorities not to take advantage of their sheer majority, Democratic \nand Republican leaders. In fact, there is a very interesting new book \nout by I believe the former chief of staff of the great Democratic \nleader George Mitchell--I think joined in by a Parliamentarian at a \ntime when Republicans were in control, so it is a bipartisan-written \nbook--that talks about the necessity of maintaining the rules the way \nthey are and not using this nuclear option to change the rule, denying \nminority rights. It is a book worth reading, and it is a book I commend \nto my colleagues before we embark on what might be a very fateful step \nin this body.\n  Let me make a couple of other points. Under Senate rule V--not to be \ntoo in the weeds on this, but I think it is important for us to \nactually know what we are talking about here. Here is the Senate rule \nspeaking to the amendment process. I am quoting now:\n\n       The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to \n     the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in \n     these rules.\n\n  And then Senate rule XXII says that to end debate on a motion to \namend or change the Senate rules:\n\n       . . . the necessary affirmative vote shall be two-thirds of \n     the Senators present and voting.\n\n  What I said earlier, that it takes a two-thirds vote to change the \nrules of the Senate, is very clear in our rules. They are continuing \nrules. So the notion that somehow this can be done with just a 51-vote \nmajority is explicitly rejected by the rules themselves. As I said, \nwhen this issue has previously been raised, we have been very careful \nnot to use the mere power of the majority to change the rules but have \nabided by the requirement of our own rules to do it according to those \nrules with a two-thirds majority.\n  I spoke before about the rights of the political minority. I think it \nis worth noting again that each Senator represents a lot of people in a \nseparate State, two of us per State. Our constituents deserve the right \nto be heard in this body. It is one of the great opportunities that as \na matter of comity we have always accorded to each other. We are \ncourteous to each other on the floor because we understand it is the \nbest way for all of us to be heard. If a colleague wishes to raise a \nmatter while I am speaking and says, ``Will you just give me 2 minutes \nso that I can raise this matter on the floor, and then I will be \ndone,'' of course we grant that request because we understand how \nimportant it is for our constituents to be represented, to have a \nvoice. If another Senator needs to raise a point on behalf of the \nvoters in his State, we acknowledge that as necessary and important.\n  That is why we think it is virtually sacred that all Senators should \nhave the right to represent their people, their State. No State should \nbe disenfranchised, whether it voted Democratic or it voted Republican. \nThere are a lot of Democrats and Republicans in every State and a lot \nof folks who do not belong to either party. They need a voice in the \nSenate, and each of us represents those people. It is not right that \nthe voice of some Senators, and therefore their constituents, be \nsilenced because of, in effect, a power grab here through what has been \nreferred to as the nuclear option.\n  As my leader Senator McConnell noted yesterday, what is potentially \nbeing proposed here would undermine the very purpose of the Senate as \nthe one place in our system where minority views, whether they are a \npolitical minority or any other kind of minority, and opinions have \nalways been respected and in most cases incorporated into law. That \nwould be lost to the U.S. Senate.\n  Here is what the late Senator Robert Byrd, who all acknowledge was an \nexpert on the Constitution and the Senate rules, once said:\n\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\n\n       The Senate is the only place in government where the rights \n     of a numerical minority are so protected. The Senate is a \n     forum of the states where, regardless of size or population, \n     all states have an equal voice. . . .\n\n  The Presiding Officer and I can appreciate that because we don't come \nfrom one of the bigger States.\n  Senator Byrd goes on:\n\n       Without the protection of unlimited debate, small States \n     like West Virginia might be trampled. Extended deliberation \n     and debate--when employed judiciously--protect every Senator, \n     and the interests of their constituency, and are essential to \n     the protection of the liberties of a free people.\n\n  He was specifically speaking to the point I made there: to ``the \ninterests of their constituency.'' It is not a Senator's right that we \nare arguing about here; we are the voice of the people we represent. It \nis our constituents' rights that would be denied by this process. They \ndeserve a voice. They have been guaranteed a voice through us, the \ntemporary stewards of their voice. To deny that voice, especially \nthrough the procedure that has been suggested here, as the late Senator \nByrd said, would be a denial of something essential to the protection \nof the liberties of a free people.\n  The current Democratic leader was one of the staunchest defenders of \nthe Senate's protection of minority rights for all of the reasons I \nmentioned. He spoke eloquently about this on earlier occasions. He \nbelieves and he has said that he is frustrated by the process that he \nsees not working as quickly as he would like to see it work and, as a \nresult, has apparently changed his mind as to the process for changing \nthe rules as well as the rules themselves. But I think the whole \nquestion of the filibuster needs to be properly understood here as \nreally meaning different things to different people. It is essentially \na tool that brings the Senate to the center because it requires \ncompromise. It requires people to get together and talk.\n\n  As I said, the right the minority has to filibuster the motion to \nproceed is to say: Mr. Leader, unless you are willing to guarantee us \nthat we can have some amendments on this bill and that we get to pick \nour own amendments, then we are going to force you to get 60 votes \nlined up in order to proceed to the bill. That is the only leverage we \nhave. So you are not really filibustering. You are not trying to talk \nthe bill to death. You don't have any intention of taking a lot of \ntime. You just want to be heard. You want to have your amendment up. A \nlot of times we say it will take just 10 minutes a side to debate it \nand have a vote, but if the majority leader can say, ``Nope, you are \nnot going to be able to do that,'' then he can say Republicans have \nengaged in a filibuster when all it is is an objection to his motion to \nproceed without having the right to offer any amendments. So it is an \nimportant tool but not the way most people think of it--to delay and to \ntalk things to death. That is not what has happened here. In most \ncases, the majority leader has filed a cloture motion on a Friday and \nwe voted on it on Monday, so no time of the Senate has been taken in \nthe intermediate time period.\n  I know there is a narrative that the Senate has not been able to get \nanything done during the past couple of years, but it is not because of \nsome unprecedented use of the filibuster. As I said, have you seen \nMembers down here talking hours on end about a particular issue or all \nthrough the night or whatever? No, you have not seen that. That was \nkind of done in a bygone era, when Strom Thurmond was here and some \nothers, but it has not been done.\n  We have not done a budget in 3 years. That has been a sore point \namong a lot of people. You cannot filibuster the budget. So is the \nreason we have not done a budget because there has been a filibuster? \nAbsolutely not, because the rules don't permit a filibuster of the \nbudget.\n  There are a lot of misconceptions here. I hope my colleagues will \ntake a deep breath, step back. Those who came from the House of \nRepresentatives, as I did, remember what it was like when you were in \nthe minority in the House. Essentially you had no rights. Is that the \nway you want it to be here? Because someday you are going to be a \nminority in the Senate. This body will change majorities.\n  In any event, whether we are talking political majorities or not, as \nI mentioned with respect to the Presiding Officer from the same State \nas the late Robert Byrd, his State did not always have the power to be \nheard because it is a small State, as is mine. So it doesn't matter \nwhether you are Republican or Democratic, your constituents have a \nright to be heard. Our current Senate rules protect that right on \nbehalf of our constituents, and I believe it would be a grave error for \nthe current Members of this body or those who take office next year to \nconclude that because they have been frustrated sometimes in what they \nwanted to accomplish, it is worth it to just brush the minority aside \nand say: Because I couldn't get everything I wanted, I was frustrated \nwith your desire to offer amendments, I am going to take that right \naway from you by changing this rule in this way.\n  I think it would be regretted later in time. I think the reaction \nwould be the same as occurred with regard to the so-called Gang of 14 \nwhen this nuclear option was considered several years ago. I think most \npeople in this body now say they were wise people who brought us back \nfrom the brink of this precipice. Had we gone over that, this body \nwould not be the same as it is today and we probably would be \nregretting that decision greatly.\n  I urge my colleagues, who I know in good faith are frustrated at \ntheir inability to do exactly what they want to do because they are in \nthe majority, to just stop and reflect on the damage this would do to \nthis institution, how they would feel if they were in the minority. \nMembers of my party are going to be pretty hard to convince we should \ngo back to the rule the way it is today if the rule is changed to our \ndisadvantage. That is really starting a nuclear war--from a \nparliamentary point of view, I mean. It is not a good idea for anybody, \nleast of all for the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues who are considering this to be open to \nalternatives, have an open mind, be willing to think this through, talk \nit through, to have a congenial debate on the floor about the \npossibilities, and eventually, I suspect, as has happened so many times \nin this great body, reasonable positions have prevailed--maybe after a \nlot of unreasonable ones were proposed, but generally we have come to \nthe right conclusions. We have done so because we respect each other's \nrights. That has produced the best legislation in the 230 years of our \ncountry's history.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first I wish to thank my colleague from \nArizona for not just his remarks during the last few minutes but for \nhis service here. I think everyone on our side knows the Senator from \nArizona has strongly felt views, many times different than many of \nours, but that they are sincere, they are heartfelt, they are \nhonorable, and that they are not ``political,'' and I very much \nappreciate that.\n  Let me say a few things, though, about these rules changes. The \noverwhelming fact that hovers over this Chamber is that it is broken. \nNobody disagrees with that. The Senate is broken. This great, wonderful \ninstitution that has had such a legendary history--perhaps the greatest \nlegislative body the world has ever seen--is dysfunctional. None of us \ndisputes that. We have to start from there. How do we change it so it \nis no longer dysfunctional?\n  My colleague the Republican leader says, Well, it is personalities or \nit is character or whatever. That explanation doesn't wash. The amount \nof good character in this body is probably no different--no more, no \nless--than the amount of good character in previous Senates that were \nfar more functional. I would argue that good character is pretty high. \nBy and large, we respect our colleagues as individuals and as Senators \non both sides of the aisle and across the aisle. So it is an easy way \nout to say, Change character. I guess when one says ``change \ncharacter,'' they mean change their character. The bottom line is that \nthe Senate is broken and we cannot maintain the status quo.\n  I wish to quote my great colleague from Michigan Senator Stabenow--I \nhope she won't mind--from a meeting we had this morning. She talked \nabout a constituent she had who said, When are you going to change the \nrules? The constituent said, You sound like somebody who has suffered \nfrom spousal\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\nabuse and keeps suffering from it and suffering from it and suffering \nfrom it and says they can't change it. Of course that person can change \nit and of course we can change things.\n  What we are trying to do on this side is come up with some changes \nthat will make the Senate flow better but, at the same time, preserve \nthe essential character of the Senate. If we were to propose a rules \nchange that would say we need 51 votes for everything, we would be no \nmore, no less, than the House of Representatives. There are some on our \nside, frankly--I think my colleague from Iowa at one point--who have \nargued, Let's move the number down to 55. We are not doing that. The \nrules changes we are entertaining are done with preserving the \ncharacter of the Senate and making sure an individual Senator's rights \nare protected and that the rights of the minority are protected and the \nplace is not stampeded by majority votes. In the House, they can have a \nmajority of one and still pretty much get their way. In the Senate that \nwouldn't happen, even if we had 55 or 58 or even 60 Senators with the \nchanges we have proposed.\n  So let's look at them. There have been attempts to not change the \nrules but, rather, to sort of come to some degree of comity between the \nparties. I know because under Leader Reid's direction, I was involved, \nand under Senator McConnell's direction, Senator Alexander was \ninvolved. Two years ago, when there was an attempt to do rules changes, \nit was particularly Senator Alexander, for whom I have enormous respect \nin the same way I have respect for Senator Kyl, who proposed that \ninstead of changing the rules we try to work things out better. There \nis a basic rule here in the Senate which is that the majority gets to \npropose the agenda. That is an enormous privilege and an enormous \nadvantage. We get to set the agenda in the committees and on the floor. \nBut the minority has the right to offer amendments which either poke \nholes in what we have proposed or even talk about other subjects \nbecause we don't have a rule, as they do in the House, where just about \neverything has to be germane. So Senator Alexander and I attempted to \ndo that. We said, on the one hand Republicans will not block motions to \nproceed, and let us go forward and debate bills, and on the other hand \nwe would allow a reasonable amount of amendments--germane and some not \ngermane--to the bills that came up.\n  Well, obviously, it failed early on in the Senate. The basic \ngentleman's agreement didn't work. It is our view the agreement fell \napart when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle said they will \nnot allow the President's nominee for the CFPB, the Consumer Financial \nProtection Board, to move forward. She will now join us in the Senate \nand discuss rules changes, in one of the ways that history works in \nstrange ways now. So we said we would allow some amendments. They said, \nNo, we are not letting her come up, period. That was against the \nspirit, at least, of the agreement. I am sure if my colleague from \nTennessee were here, he might have a different interpretation, but at \nleast that is ours. But the overall point is the so-called gentleman's \nagreement fell apart early in the Senate, never to be resurrected.\n  It is our belief on our side that we should allow amendments from the \nother side, but they should not be abused. There should not be 50 of \nthem. They should not talk about everything under the Sun. Yes, there \ncan be some nongermane amendments--we understand what those are all \nabout--but it shouldn't be a piling on. It is our view, frankly, that \nthe goal of many of the other side was simply to obstruct whatever \nhappened here, to show that the government didn't work, in hopes that \nthere would be an electoral advantage to that argument and people would \nchange the Senate majority. Well, it didn't happen. So now there is a \nnew opportunity.\n  Our colleagues on the other side say the only reason we filibuster is \nbecause you guys fill the tree. Well, let's look at the numbers. In the \nlast Senate--in this Senate up until now--there have been 19 tree \nfillings by Leader Reid. There have been 110 cloture motions. That is 6 \nto 1, a little less than 6 to 1, more than 5 to 1, less than 6 to 1. \nSo, clearly, the filibuster--the use of the motion to proceed to \nprevent us from getting on a bill unless it has 60 votes--has far \nexceeded the number of times the leader has filled the tree. It has \nbeen done on things that aren't even amendable, including judges, \nappointments. There couldn't be objections that we wouldn't allow \namendments on those things. You can't amend: Let's have half the judge \nbe nominated to the sixth circuit or let's have the Assistant Secretary \nof State only have these powers. That doesn't happen. So even on those \nthings, there have been filibusters. We asked right now--I think there \nare about 20 judges pending--to move them. No, we are going to \nfilibuster. Yesterday, a sportsmen's bill, which has a lot of \ndissension on our side and probably has more agreement on the other \nside than this side, was filibustered. This goes on and on and on.\n\n  So the rules changes we are proposing will not prevent the minority \nfrom exercising its rights, from being able to offer amendments, and, \nin fact, from filibustering. The goal here is simple: Use the \nfilibuster sparingly, not 110 times in a session of Congress. Even in \nthe days of the great southern barons and the civil rights debates \nwhere the people from the South regarded filibuster as their only \nweapon to stop something they strongly--in my opinion very wrongly--\ndisagreed with, it was used a handful of times only on the major \ndebates of the time. Now the filibuster is used for everything, \nincluding district court judges, offering small, minor amendments.\n  What we basically want to do, as some have proposed, led by the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley, and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nUdall, is say, If a Member wants to have a filibuster, they have to \ntalk; they can't just have one person get up and say ``I object'' and \nthen we need 60 votes or the bill doesn't come up. What will that do? \nIn my opinion, that restores the proper balance to the Senate. If a \nMember has to talk--not just one person but everybody who is against \nit--a Member is only going to be able to sustain that filibuster on \nmajor issues. No doubt the other side would have had the ability to \nsustain--even if we went 24 hours, 7 days a week--they would have \nenough passion and enough enthusiasm and enough bodies that they would \nfilibuster the health care bill. Probably they would do the same on \nSupreme Court Justices, as would we if we were in the minority, if we \nvehemently disagreed with a proposal. But if a Member has to be on the \nfloor and actually filibuster as opposed to just invoking the rules, \nthey will use it sparingly because they cannot sustain it for every \namendment or every minor bill or, frankly, for bills that have a large \namount of support. We know there is a small number of our colleagues \nwho are much more focused on offering their own amendments or stopping \nthe whole Senate. We can name them from the other side of the aisle. \nBut under this rule, they would have to get more support than just four \nor five people to do it over and over, and it wouldn't happen. So then \nthe filibuster would be used as it should be. We are not saying no to \nfilibustering. We are not suggesting going back to 51 and simple \nmajority rule. It would be used on major issues where there is a real \ndivision and a lot of passion and strong feeling and conviction as \nopposed to simply trying to block everything and tie this place in a \nknot.\n  When filibusters would decline and there would be no motions to \nproceed that would be debatable, what would happen? I guarantee my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that more amendments would be \nallowed to be offered because we wouldn't be in this tit-for-tat \nsituation. Would we have unlimited amendments? No. Would it be that \nevery time we have a bill we have to debate a passion of a single \nSenator from a single State over and over and over? No. But would there \nbe plenty of amendments and would the minority not being able to \nfilibuster most bills have sort of high ground, whomever that minority \nis, that amendments should be offered? Absolutely.\n  The bottom line: We cannot do nothing. There is too much at stake in \nour Nation to have the Senate paralyzed once again. The House is a \npartisan body. It passes a lot of things in a very partisan way. The \nSenate must still be the cooling saucer envisioned by the Founding \nFathers, by George Washington and James Madison. There must\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\nbe the ability where the ``passions of the people'' cool in this \ngovernment, and it resides in the Senate. The changes we have proposed \ncontinue that tradition but prevent--mitigate strongly against, if not \ntotally prevent--paralysis, which is where we are right now.\n  Remember: 110 cloture motions. And that will happen again in the next \nsession, the next Congress, in the Senate, if we don't do something to \nchange it. The idea, once again, of just blaming this person or that \nperson is not seeing the larger problem that needs change and \ncorrection. The proposals that I believe this side will make--and we \nhaven't yet discussed them in our caucus--will return the Senate to the \nway it was envisioned by the Founding Fathers: a body where minority \nrights have much greater strength than the majority, but a body where \nbipartisan compromise is encouraged, not discouraged.\n  So to my colleague from Arizona I say: We are open to suggestions, \nbut suggestions that say ``you just change your ways'' we would say \nback aren't going to reduce the gridlock. I believe Senator Alexander \nand I and Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, when we proposed this \ngentlemen's compromise 2 years ago and didn't change the rules, all had \nthe best of intentions, but it failed. We have our reason for why it \nfailed and they may have another, but it is indisputable that it \nfailed. We have to look at something new. I hope my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, if they don't agree with the proposals we are \nlikely to make, will have their own suggestions but suggestions that go \nbeyond just change the personalities, change the individuals, whatever.\n  In conclusion, this is a wonderful body. I have served in it for 14 \nyears. I respect it, I revere it, and I still love, with all the \ndysfunction, coming to work Monday morning, which is a test for me in \nlife. But our country has so many issues and so many problems and needs \nthe Senate to lead and needs a Senate that is not paralyzed in \ngridlock. Without changing the rules, I fear we will have a repeat of \nthe last 2 years, where each side blames the other and nothing gets \ndone.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I know we have several colleagues on \nthe Senate floor who want to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with \nthe remarks of my colleague from the great State of New York, and I \nlook forward to working with him and the entire Senate to find ways in \nwhich the Senate can continue to do the important work the public has \nasked us to do.\n\n\n                         Wind Energy Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this morning again to speak to the importance \nof extending the production tax credit, otherwise known as the PTC, for \nwind energy. I wish to mention that the production tax credit has been \nused on many occasions to promote other kinds of energy development, \nincluding natural gas. The production tax credit for wind, \nparticularly, is set to expire at the end of December and, as a result, \nthousands of hard-working middle-class families in Colorado and across \nour country who currently work in this important energy industry are at \nextreme risk of losing their jobs.\n  In fact, many of these workers have already been laid off as \ncompanies brace themselves for the expiration of the PTC. To put it in \nstark terms, the potentially bright future of a quintessentially \nAmerican industry is uncertain unless we act as soon as possible.\n  I have come to the floor now some 22 times to discuss the wind energy \nindustry, and when I do so I highlight the positive effects the PTC has \nhad on one individual State. I have had the great opportunity and \nprivilege of speaking about the wind energy industry in the Presiding \nOfficer's State, the State of Montana, and today I want to take the \nopportunity to talk about the Wolverine State. Michigan is another \nremarkable illustration of how the PTC has revitalized manufacturing \nand created good-paying jobs while providing the State with clean \nenergy.\n  We have seen improvement in the Nation's economy, but many families \nand businesses across our country are still struggling to make ends \nmeet. This has been especially true in Michigan, a State that has one \nof the Nation's highest unemployment rates and a sluggish manufacturing \nbase. This is all as a result of the tough economic times we have \nexperienced over the last 4 years.\n  But if we look at Michigan, the wind industry saw an opportunity in \nMichigan. Michigan is known for its highly skilled workforce, and so \nthe wind industry took root in Michigan, took advantage of this \nworkforce, and now we see that in Michigan there is significant \nmanufacturing of wind turbines occurring there. That has reinvigorated \nMichigan's industrial base, and it has aided in the recovery of the \nState's economy.\n  If we think about it, thousands of parts go into each car \nmanufactured in Michigan, and wind turbines--from the towers to the \ncells to the blades--are no different. Someone told me recently that \nsomething in the order of 8,000 parts go into a wind turbine. So if we \nthink about that, the skills of these hard-working Michigan workers \ntranslate into the development, the engineering, the construction, and \nthe manufacturing required for wind turbines, which then in turn \nprovides the State of Michigan and the local communities with thousands \nof new jobs and billions of dollars in investment.\n  We can see all the green circles on the map of Michigan I have in the \nChamber that identify the places in which this manufacturing is \noccurring. This is in large part as a result of targeted Federal \nincentives, such as the production tax credit.\n  I would like to highlight further some of the many benefits of the \nwind energy industry in Michigan. There are at least 40 facilities that \ndevelop and produce various components for the wind energy industry, \nand that supports about 5,000 jobs. Furthermore, wind projects have \ncontributed over $7 million in property tax payments to local \ngovernments; and that is money that helps fund schools, infrastructure, \nand other vital community services.\n  So the State is building the towers and the blades and the cells so \nthat we can harvest the wind. Michigan is taking advantage of that \nopportunity as well. They are ramping up their deployment of this \ntechnology to harvest the wind because the wind energy manufacturing \nsector is located there. So it is a virtuous cycle, if you will.\n  In 2011, Michigan more than doubled its power production from wind \nenergy, and it is on pace to increase its capacity by another 50 \npercent this year. That would include the completion of the State's \nlargest wind farm, the Gratiot County Wind Project, which is located in \nthe middle of the lower peninsula. This project itself not only created \nover 250 construction jobs and 15 permanent maintenance and operations \njobs, it also doubled the tax base of the local schools. This has \ncreated a positive ripple effect on all these communities that has been \nnoticeable and powerful.\n  Moreover, there are currently enough wind projects under construction \nin Michigan to nearly double the current wind power production in the \nState, with even more potential developments in the works. The point I \nam making is that the key is the production tax credit when it comes to \nthese projects and, most importantly, the jobs they create.\n  There remains a vast untapped potential when it comes to wind energy \nin the State. In fact, the National Renewable Energy Lab estimates that \nMichigan has enough wind power potential to meet 160 percent of the \nState's current electricity needs. The extension, therefore, of the PTC \nis essential to the continued development of Michigan's wind resources, \nwhich will create good-paying American jobs, aid local communities, and \nbuild a clean energy economy.\n  So it is pretty simple. The production tax credit, the PTC, equals \njobs, and we need to pass it and extend it as soon as possible.\n  How do we do that? Well, if we want that bright future to be \nrealized, we need to work together and extend the wind PTC now. It is \ncommon sense. It has bipartisan support. It has bicameral support. We \nneed to extend it now, as soon as possible. The PTC has not only aided \nin the growth and expansion of our manufacturing economies in States \nsuch as Michigan, but it has also shown us that America can\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\nand, frankly, must outcompete China and the other countries that are \ntrying to develop their own wind energy industry.\n  So let's come together. Let's find a path forward. Let's pass an \nextension of the wind PTC as soon as possible. The longer we wait, the \nlonger we do not act, it puts the significant economic strides we have \nseen in States such as Michigan and all around the country at risk, and \nit substantially inhibits future job growth. We simply cannot afford to \ncede this promising new energy technology and energy future to \ncountries such as China.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Udall for his work \nbringing attention to this important issue.\n  To me, this issue is simple: Alternative energy, including wind \npower, is not only a vital component of our environmental protection \nefforts, but to growing our economy and creating jobs for the middle \nclass.\n  Michigan is the State that put the world on wheels. Through \ninnovation and dedication, entrepreneurs, engineers, and Michigan \nworkers combined their efforts not just to revolutionize \ntransportation, but to create an explosion of manufacturing employment \nthat helped create and sustain the American middle class.\n  Today, a new generation of Michigan innovators is harnessing the \npower of wind, the promise of biofuels, the power of advanced \nbatteries. Earlier this year, I visited a wind farm in Breckenridge, \nMI, that is a marvel of technology, as far removed from the farmstead \nwindmills of days past as a jet fighter is from the Wright Brothers' \nplane. That wind farm is a textbook example of how the advance of \ntechnology is helping Michigan's economy, enabling us not just to \nrecover from the setbacks of the past, but to lead us into a brighter \neconomic future.\n  Wind power is an important part of that advance. It is a rapidly \ngrowing sector of our State's electrical generating system. Wind-\ngenerating capacity more than doubled in 2011, and projects under \nconstruction or in the development pipeline could increase capacity \ntenfold or more. The more power we generate from wind, the more \naffordable, clean energy is available to our State and Nation.\n  Michigan also has an important role in building advanced wind-\ngeneration equipment, not just for our State, but for the United States \nand the world. Roughly 40 Michigan facilities are engaged in this \nbusiness, many of them businesses that have turned expertise developed \nin the automotive industry to this new and growing field. Already wind \nis responsible for hundreds of good manufacturing jobs, and the \npotential is nearly as limitless as the wind itself.\n  That is why renewal of the production tax credit is so important. The \nPTC has been an important factor in helping this new industry grow. If \nit is allowed to expire at the end of the year, it would not only \nhamper efforts to generate more clean energy for Michigan homes and \nbusinesses, but also dampen the potential for new manufacturing jobs \ntied to wind power. That is not a good outcome for our environment, for \nMichigan families or for the American economy.\n  So again I thank Senator Udall for his focus on this issue. I hope as \nwe work to address the many pressing issues we must resolve before the \nend of the year, we can resolve this one as well, and maintain the \nmomentum of clean energy to help our environment and our economy.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Colorado, Senator \nUdall, for speaking on this important issue, and for his constant \nadvocacy of the wind production tax credit.\n  We have entrepreneurs right now in Michigan and all across the \ncountry who are working hard to invent our clean energy future.\n  I am thinking of companies like Ventower in Monroe, that just opened \ntheir 115,000-square-foot wind turbine tower manufacturing facility \nlast year.\n  They have hired 150 people to build those huge wind towers that you \nsee along the highway. These are good-paying jobs of the future.\n  Energetx Composites is another company in Michigan that used to \nmanufacture luxury yachts. They took their experience with light-weight \nmaterials and now they are producing the blades for the wind turbines, \nand they have also hired workers in Michigan.\n  Astraeus Wind and Dowding Industries are doing the casting work and \nmanufacturing the hubs that allow those blades to turn and produce \nenergy. These are huge items--some as big as a house--and they need \npeople to build them, and ship them, and that means jobs of the future \nin Michigan.\n  It also means a future that we can hand down with pride to our \nchildren and our grandchildren. It is a future with a strong middle \nclass. It is a future where the American dream is alive and well.\n  We have been through tough times in Michigan, but wind power has been \na bright spot. This year, we more than doubled our wind capacity in \nMichigan.\n  We now have more than 200 turbines running in places such as Gratiot, \nHuron, Misaukee, and Sanilac Counties.\n  We have another nearly 300 turbines coming online in the Thumb area--\none of the areas of strongest growth in the State. And all of that \ndevelopment means thousands of jobs in Michigan that depend on wind \nenergy technology.\n  But if Congress doesn't act by December 31, those businesses will see \ntheir taxes go up. To raise taxes on the innovative companies creating \nthe jobs of the future? That doesn't make sense. That is why it is so \ncritical that we extend the wind production tax credit.\n  At a time when our companies are competing with other countries over \nthis technology, we cannot turn our backs on them.\n  China is spending millions of dollars every single day to beat us on \nclean energy. They are investing in companies, building plants, and \nmaking every effort to lead the world in this technology.\n  We are in a race, and we cannot afford to lose.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass an extension of the wind production tax \ncredit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to spend a couple \nmoments talking about the work we have to do between now and the end of \nthe year. There are various ways to describe this, but it is usually \ndescribed under the broad umbrella terminology called the fiscal cliff. \nSome debate the use of those words, but there is no question that we \nhave very difficult decisions to make in the next couple of weeks.\n  My primary concern--and I think this is a concern that is widely \nshared in the Senate and across the country--is, What will all this \nmean for middle-income families? What will their tax rates be? What \nwill their near-term economic security be? And what can they expect for \ntheir families and for the communities within which they live, \nespecially at this time of year? A lot of families are not just \npreparing for the new year and what will happen, they are also trying \nto make decisions about spending, about holiday shopping, about \ninvestments, about priorities in which they have to invest in their own \nlives.\n  We know from some of the data, when it comes to debating what will \nhappen to middle-income families and their tax rates, the positive side \nof extending those tax rates for middle-income families. We also know \nthe downside of not getting that work done, not extending them.\n  Just to give two examples, the Congressional Budget Office says \nextending the tax rates for the middle-class would boost gross domestic \nproduct by 1.3 percent and would increase jobs by 1.6 million. So those \nare two very positive impacts if we can get the agreement, which I \nthink we can arrive at working with Democrats and Republicans to do \nthis, to extend the tax rates for middle-income families. So GDP up by \n1.3 percent if we get the work done to extend those middle-class tax \ncuts, and increasing the number of jobs by 1.6 million.\n  Another way to look at this is from the negative side of it as well, \nthe consequences of not getting this work done to extend middle-income \ntax rates.\n  Mark Zandi, an economist who is widely quoted across the country and\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\nby many of my colleagues in the Senate--I am not quoting, but this is a \nsummary--says that the economic impact of ending these tax cuts, not \ngetting an agreement, would reduce gross domestic product by $174 \nbillion.\n  We do not want to do that. That would be a very bad result for \neveryone. So whether we read the CBO numbers or we talk to economists \nor read about their assessments or we talk to CEOs, they all agree we \nhave to deal with both the tax rate question for middle-income families \nas well as making sure we are avoiding the across-the-board cuts, which \nI will get to in a moment.\n  So there is much to do to solve our year-end challenge, and we \ncertainly have more challenges in 2013. But it is basically about \ngetting our fiscal house in order. Part of that is spending cuts, part \nof that is getting more revenue, and, as well, even as we are getting \nour fiscal house in order, dealing with various tax challenges along \nthe way.\n  We should point out that there has been a lot of progress made. I \nwill just give two examples of that. We know when the national job \nnumbers were announced in October, part of the reporting that was done \nby the Bureau of Labor Statistics was that we had an October number, \nbut then we had a September and an August number that was revised \nupward, thank goodness. When we combine the August, September, and \nOctober job growth numbers, it means in those 3 months we created more \nthan 500,000 jobs across the country. I should say the economy created \n500,000 jobs. The exact number is about 511,000 jobs. So that is a \nmeasure of progress.\n  I was just looking at some housing assessments. We are releasing a \nreport or a summary of some data this week in the Joint Economic \nCommittee.\n  Just to give you two examples on housing progress: The number of \nprivately owned housing units that were started last month increased by \n31,000 units to 894,000 units at an annual rate. What that means is it \nis up about 3.6 percent. That is good news, maybe even better news \nbecause we want to get the assessment of people in the trenches. One \nbit of good news on housing is that confidence among homebuilders rose \nagain in November. That will also be part of that report.\n  So it is an increase in jobs the last couple months, more economic \ngrowth, more progress, more momentum and good information or good news \non housing. The problem is it is not good enough. We are not creating \njobs fast enough. The pace of the recovery needs to accelerate. It is \nnot moving fast enough for us to fully recover. I like to say and many \nhave used this analogy: We have been in a ditch. We have been down in a \npretty deep hole. We have been climbing out the last couple years, but \nwe are not out yet fully. We will be out and have a full recovery when \nwe see those job numbers increase.\n  So these decisions we make on tax policy, on the end-of-the-year \nagreements we have to reach, are vitally important to continue that \nprogress, and, in fact, to move or accelerate the job growth numbers \neven faster.\n  As I mentioned before, part of this is not just about tax rates, it \nis also about reducing spending. Fortunately, there is a track record. \nDespite all the rancor and partisanship in Washington, there is also \nanother story of bipartisan progress that was made over the last couple \nyears by agreeing to spending cuts.\n  We agreed to a little less than $1 trillion of spending cuts over the \nnext 10 years. So it shows we can come together. The main point I \nstarted with is on middle-income families. We need to give middle-class \nAmericans certainty by the end of the year. Frankly, we should do it \neven before the end of the year. We should do it in the next couple \ndays or weeks. We can do that by saying to our friends in the other \nbody, the House of Representatives: Pass the bill we passed in the \nSenate which gives tax certainty, a continuation of tax breaks to 98 \npercent of taxpayers.\n  We should do that because it will provide some certainty for the end \nof the year and for going into next year. I have an additional point to \nmake about that as it relates to the payroll tax cut. We came together \nlast year, late 2011 into 2012, as we had done a year earlier, to cut \nthe payroll tax, to reduce that tax so most workers, most families in \nthis country would have about $1,000 extra to put in their pockets, \nmore take-home pay that they could spend on their priorities and invest \nin the priorities of their own families, whether it is making a \npurchase for that family, whether it is paying for education, whether \nit is just getting from point A to point B, putting gas in the car. \nWhatever it is that family decides to use those extra dollars for, it \nhas had an enormously positive impact--122 million households were \npositively impacted by that payroll tax cut.\n  What it means in terms of jobs--about 400,000 jobs created. So one of \nthe reasons we can say we are making progress in developing some \nmomentum behind the job creation numbers is because of the payroll tax \ncut that was put in place in 2012. We know the kind of progress we are \nmaking, the kind of certainty we want for middle-income families can be \nbadly undermined if we do not get an agreement not only on tax rates \nbut also on this across-the-board indiscriminate cut that would take \nplace if we do not have a bipartisan agreement.\n  This is known by that fancy term ``sequester'' or the other term \n``sequestration.'' What that means, and I am not sure many people heard \nthat terminology before a year or two ago--but what that means is \nacross-the-board cutting. Some people say: That sometimes makes sense. \nIn my family, in my business or when we have to make a decision, \nsometimes we have to cut spending across the board.\n  Unfortunately, if we do not make cuts that help our economy grow, we \nwill badly injure our ability to grow the economy in the near term and \nin the future. So we all agree cuts have to be made. The question is, \nHow do we do that? Do we make cuts that are smart and that help us grow \nor do we make cuts that are indiscriminate, without any kind of a \nstrategy behind them?\n  Fortunately, I think there is agreement that across-the-board cuts, \nwhether they are defense cuts which will impact jobs or whether they \nare nondefense cuts which will also impact the economy, do not make a \nlot of sense. It does not make sense to say all cuts are equal; \ntherefore, medical research should be cut in the same way an \ninefficient program should be cut. That does not make sense. I think \nmost Americans understand that.\n  We have to get an agreement to avoid those automatic cuts. I think we \ncan. I think Democrats and Republicans agree it would be the wrong \napproach to allow that to happen. I think we can get agreement on that. \nWhat we need is a balance. Just as when any family has to make a \ndecision about their own budget or about their own spending priorities, \nthey need a balance. Obviously, the balance is two parts; one is \nrevenue and one is spending. So we need to get that balance in place. \nWe also need, in order to achieve that kind of balance, Democrats and \nRepublicans to be willing to work together--compromising, not getting \neverything you want but getting enough of an agreement that we can move \nthe country forward.\n  Despite all the problems, I have a high degree of confidence we can \nget an agreement. Folks will come together and compromise. Part of that \nstarts with putting in place an agreement, which is already one element \nto the compromise. That is not just voting on but having the agreement \nthat says: Let's have certainty right now for middle-income families.\n  Everyone agrees, with very limited exception, that we should extend \ntax rates--keep the tax rates the same for about 98 percent of the \nAmerican people. There is broad agreement on that. Some on the other \nside do not want to have a conclusion to that because they want to have \na debate about what happens to the wealthiest among us, the very top \nincome earners, roughly about 2 percent of income earners.\n  But look, we have agreement on the other 98 percent. So what I would \nsay is whatever it takes to give meaning or integrity to the vote we \nhad in the Senate to get an agreement here but also encourage the House \nto vote to say: Let's give middle-income families the certainty \nthey deserve, let's just say we are going to agree, Democrats and \nRepublicans, that 98 percent of taxpayers across the country are going \nto have their tax rates continue.\n\n  Then we can have a big debate after that about what happens to the\n\n[[Page S6921]]\n\nwealthiest among us. I think it makes sense, at a time of high deficits \nand a debt problem that will confront us for years, that we have some \npart of that revenue come from the wealthiest among us. People across \nthe aisle might disagree with that. We can have a big debate about \nthat. But let's put in place, in law, the kind of certainty middle-\nincome families should have. I think we can do that. So let's get in \nplace an agreement for the 98 percent, and then we will have a big \ndebate about the wealthiest 2 percent. Let's get in place tax rates \nthat will allow us to do that.\n  I think a little history is instructive. We know that in the 1990s \nand the 2000s, we know there is, according to the data, no relationship \nbetween lower marginal rates for the wealthiest among us and faster \naccelerated economic growth. I emphasize no relationship because I \nthink some have made the case.\n  Two examples. During the Clinton administration, to address the \ngrowing budget deficit at the time, which was not as severe as today, \nbut it was a pretty substantial deficit, the top marginal tax rate was \nraised. It went up on the wealthiest individuals. The economy grew at \nthe fastest rate in a generation and more than 22,000 jobs were added.\n  So that is what happened during President Clinton's two terms in \noffice. During the following 8 years, the top marginal rate was \nlowered--not raised but lowered--for the wealthiest individuals. The \neconomy never regained the strength of the previous decade, the 1990s. \nJob growth slowed and wages stagnated, leaving middle-income families \nespecially vulnerable when the great recession began toward the end of \n2007.\n  That is some of the history. That is part of the foundation or \nundergirding for the debate we are going to have on tax rates. This is \nnot a lot of theory or a lot of maybes. We have data and information \nand kind of a track record trying it two different ways, the way we \ntried this under President Clinton and the way we tried it under the \nnext administration. I think that is instructive.\n  Finally, I would say that for all the challenges we have, for all the \ndisagreements we have, I think most people in the Senate, no matter who \nthey are--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--whether they were \nrunning for office this year or not, all heard the same message. They \nall heard maybe two basic messages from people. At least that is what I \nheard in Pennsylvania, all across the State, for longer than 2012 but \ncertainly most fervently with a sense of urgency this year.\n  Here is what I heard, a two-part message: Do something to create jobs \nor do more to create jobs, move the economy faster. No question, I \nheard that over and over. Soon thereafter, within seconds of saying \nthat, families or taxpayers whom I ran into across the State would say \nto me: You have to work together with people in the other party to get \nthis done.\n  You know why they say that. That is not some unreal expectation that \nthe American people have of us. It makes a lot of sense. Because in \nevery family out there, whether it is in Pennsylvania or across the \ncountry, in every business, small business or larger business, in every \none of those circumstances, in a family or in a business, those \nindividuals have had to sit down over the last couple years especially, \nwork out differences, set priorities, set goals, reduce spending \nsometimes, make investments they knew they needed to make to grow their \nbusiness or to create more economic certainty for their family.\n  They have had to do that. All they are saying to us is just take a \nlesson from the life of a lot of families in America. Sit down, set \npriorities, work on coming together, and get an agreement. I think we \ncan do that. Despite all the differences, I think both parties \nunderstand the urgency of those questions, whether it is the tax rates, \nwhether it is across-the-board spending cuts, which would be \nindiscriminate and harmful, whether it is what we do about individual \nprograms, what we do in the near term to reduce deficit and debt.\n  We have to come together, as families have to come together, and make \nagreements with people whom we are sometimes disagreeing with or not \ngetting along with every day of the week and make decisions that \nbusinesses have to make almost every day of the week or at least every \nmonth on their spending, on their priorities and on their investments.\n  I think we can do that. I know we have to do that.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the state of the \nongoing negotiations to avert the fiscal cliff.\n  So far there has been little progress reported at the negotiating \ntable. Since the President's very productive meeting with the \nbipartisan leaders from the House and Senate on November 16, the \nsubsequent staff talks have produced no breakthroughs. Republicans in \nthe room are not yet acknowledging the need to let tax breaks for the \nvery wealthiest Americans expire, nor are they offering the kind of \nreasonable reforms to entitlement programs that Democrats can be \nexpected to support.\n  But despite this impasse, as Leader McConnell described it on the \nfloor yesterday, I am optimistic we can still get a deal by Christmas. \nI detect a great deal of progress being made beneath the surface. You \nonly need to turn on television these past couple of days to observe \nthe signs of this progress.\n  For nearly three decades, a rightwing Washington lobbyist has exerted \na stranglehold on mainstream Republicans over the issue of taxes, \nthreatening political retaliation against any lawmaker who dared to \nvote for any fiscal solution that asked the wealthy to pay their fair \nshare. But in the 3 weeks since the election, one Republican after \nanother has been rebuking this lobbyist for his uncompromising stance \non taxes. Republicans in both the House and Senate are deciding they no \nlonger want to be married to this pledge. Republicans are saying they \nwant a divorce from Grover Norquist. That alone is a leading indicator \nthat a fiscal deal is within reach. Both sides are still far apart and \ndiscussions over the next few weeks will be difficult. But with each \nnew Republican disavowing Grover Norquist, the chance of a deal rises \nsharply.\n  First there was Saxby Chambliss, an honorable Member of this body and \na charter member of the Gang of Six, who has spent the last 2 years \ntrying to negotiate a bipartisan compromise in the best of faith. \nSenator Chambliss is a signer of the Norquist pledge, but he went on \nTV--not somewhere else but down in Georgia--last week and bravely said:\n\n       I care about my country more than I do about a 20-year-old \n     pledge.\n\n  Then on ABC this past Sunday, Lindsey Graham said:\n\n       The only pledge we should be making is to each other to \n     avoid becoming Greece.\n\n  On the very same program, my friend from New York, Congressman Pete\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nKing, said the pledge no longer applied because, ``the world has \nchanged. And the economic situation is different.''\n  These were just two interviews with George Stephanopoulos. But \nsometimes progress on the Sunday news shows can foreshadow progress in \nthe negotiating room. In fact, these comments by Senators Chambliss, \nGraham, and Congressman King appear to have started a trend.\n  Yesterday, Senator Corker echoed their sentiments. He released his \nown fiscal plan, which contains $1 trillion in new revenues. Asked \nwhether his inclusion of revenues puts him at cross purposes with \nGrover Norquist, Senator Corker said:\n\n       I'm not obligated on the pledge. The only thing I'm \n     honoring is the oath I take when I serve, when I'm sworn in \n     this January.\n\n  Senator Murkowski said similar things yesterday. Even Senator \nSessions showed hints of compromise when he said, about the pledge:\n\n       We've got to deal with the crisis we face. We've got to \n     deal with the political reality of the President's victory.\n\n  And then this morning, the vaunted Wall Street Journal editorial page \neven seemed to distance itself from Mr. Norquist. Of the need to \ncompromise with President Obama, the Journal counseled:\n\n       This is where Mr. Norquist can give some ground. If taxes \n     are going up anyway because the Bush rates expire, and \n     Republicans can stop them from going up as much as they \n     otherwise would, then pledge-takers deserve some credit for \n     that.\n\n  We disagree with the forms of revenues that most of these Republicans \nhave in mind. Many of the Republicans expressing openness to revenues \nwant to pursue them only through tax reform next year. And even then, \nthey are only willing to consider limits of deductions as opposed to \nrate increases on the very wealthy.\n  Democrats, on the other hand, believe that even if Republicans want \nto kick tax reform into 2013, a significant downpayment on revenues \nmust be enacted before January 1. And we further believe that the \nfairest, most straightforward way to make that downpayment on revenues \nis by decoupling the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. Limiting deductions \nis a necessary revenue-raising component of a grand bargain, but it \ndoes not and cannot replace the need for restoring the Clinton-era \nrates for the top two tax brackets. Republicans are not quite there yet \nin terms of acknowledging this, but they are moving slowly in the right \ndirection.\n  As the Washington Post reported this weekend, for the first time in \ndecades there is a bipartisan consensus in favor of asking the wealthy \nto pay a little more to reduce the deficit. The question is how to do \nit. This is an encouraging development. It suggests that Republicans \nare slowly absorbing one of the lessons of the 2012 election which is \nthat elections continue to be won in the middle, and victories will \nremain elusive for any party that caters to special-interest groups \nthat occupy either the far left or the far right.\n  Over the years the Democratic Party has wrestled with the same issues \nRepublicans are facing. When I was elected to Congress in 1981, crime \nwas ripping apart my district. I came to Washington with the goal of \nworking to pass new laws to crack down on crime. Lo and behold, I found \nthat the Democratic Congress at the time was literally outsourcing the \ndrafting of crime legislation to the ACLU. I have great respect for the \nviews of civil libertarians. But at that time, the activists' motto \nwas, Let 100 guilty people go free lest you convict 1 innocent person. \nThat view was far outside the mainstream, but it dominated our party's \nthinking on crime for better than a decade. Our party suffered for it. \nWe didn't snap out of it until President Clinton passed the crime bill \nin the 1990s. After that, we won back the trust of moderate, middle-\nclass voters.\n  I know the echo chambers some of our Republican colleagues are in and \nI know how difficult it is. But if history shows anything, after \nsuffering some bad losses at the polls earlier this month many \nRepublicans are now realizing the need to snap out of it on taxes.\n  Grover Norquist has had a good run. It has lasted far longer than 15 \nminutes. But his stringent views make him an outlier now. It is not \nunlike what happened to his longtime friend Ralph Reed, who steered the \nRepublican Party too far right on social issues in the 1990s and is \nhardly heard from anymore.\n  Mr. Norquist will likely not be departing the scene anytime soon, but \nperhaps he could switch his focus to immigration. He makes a lot of \nsense on the need for a comprehensive immigration reform bill, and I \nwould be first to work with him on that. But as the events of the last \nweeks show, on taxes, Grover Norquist is out on an island.\n  In conclusion, I salute my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho have disavowed his group's pledge. I will encourage others to do \nthe same. The more who do, the closer we will come to a bipartisan \nagreement on our fiscal problems.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to proceed to executive session for the purpose of \nthe consideration of treaty document 112-7, the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that prior to the clerk reporting the motion, \nSenator McCain be recognized, and when he finishes that I be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think my colleagues and I who have been \nhere for a while remember one of the more moving moments that we \nexperienced in our service here, and that was the signing of the \ndisabilities law on the White House lawn. Bipartisan members of the \ndisabled community were there. The President of the United States, \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, and so many others were there. One of the \nprime individuals who was largely responsible was our beloved leader at \nthat time, Bob Dole, a man who epitomized, in my view, how a disability \ncan be overcome to go to the highest levels of American Government.\n  I freely admit that I love Bob Dole. I listen to him. I appreciate \nhis leadership. I think the majority leader would agree that we \nappreciated his bipartisanship during a great deal of his time.\n  I hope my colleagues will, before deciding to vote, at least listen \nto the letter that was addressed to all of us by Senator Bob Dole which \nwe received yesterday:\n\n       As you may know, tomorrow the Senate will vote on the \n     Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD. \n     Unfortunately, I am currently at Walter Reed and so cannot \n     call you personally, but wanted to connect with you via e-\n     mail on this time sensitive matter and ask for your help. I \n     hope you will support this important treaty.\n       The CRPD is the first international treaty to address \n     disability rights globally. It is an opportunity to advance \n     the great American tradition of supporting the rights and \n     inclusion of people with disabilities on a global basis. \n     Ratification of the CRPD will improve fiscal, technological, \n     and communication access outside the United States, thereby \n     helping to ensure that Americans--particularly many thousands \n     of disabled American veterans--have equal opportunities to \n     live, work, and travel abroad. It will also create a new \n     global market for accessibility goods.\n       The CRPD is supported by a number of individuals and \n     groups, including 21 veterans groups, 26 faith-based \n     organizations, over 300 disability organizations, and the \n     Chamber of Commerce. Your vote would help to reaffirm the \n     goals of equality, access, and inclusion for Americans with \n     disabilities--both when those affected are in the United \n     States and outside of our country's borders.\n       I would greatly appreciate your support of the CRPD.\n       God bless America, Bob Dole.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Senator McCain is absolutely right. Those of us who served \nwith Bob Dole revere Bob Dole. He is such a stalwart figure in the \nhistory of America. He has all the qualities of a leader that I admire \nand certainly wish I had. He has a great sense of humor. No one who has \never served in the Senate has ever had a better, quicker sense of humor \nthan Bob Dole, and he used it to perfection.\n  He called me a few days ago. He is at Walter Reed not for a checkup; \nhe is there because he is infirm. He is sick. We should do this for \nmany reasons, not the least of which is to recognize what a great \nleader Bob Dole is and has been for our country.\n  I ask the clerk to report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] moves to proceed to \n     executive session to consider treaty document No. 1127.\n\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\n\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report the treaty.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Treaty Document No. 112-7, Convention on the Rights of \n     Persons with Disabilities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senators Kerry and Lugar are managing this \nmost important treaty. We are now in executive session. We are going to \ntake a couple of hours to see who wants to offer amendments. Senator \nLugar, Senator Kerry or their staffs should be contacted to indicate \nwhat, if any, amendments they wish to offer. So that being the case, we \nhope that by, let's say 5 o'clock, we will have an idea what the \nuniverse of amendments, if any, would be.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be a period of debate only on the \ntreaty until 5 p.m. today, with that time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the proponents and opponents, and that time actually \nbe controlled by Senators Kerry and Lugar, and that I be recognized at \n5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just reiterate--I think Senator \nBarrasso is here and Senator Lee, and others; Senator Kyl is also \nhere--we look forward to working over the course of the next few hours \nwith our colleagues to try to come to some understanding of the \namendments here.\n  One of the things that we promised--and Senator Reid has altered his \napproach to this in order to try to accommodate our colleagues--is to \nmake certain we are not closing people out and there is no effort to \ntry to limit the debate.\n  I do think, by virtue of the work done in committee and otherwise, \nthere is a limit to where we need to go in terms of amendments. So I am \nperfectly happy--together with Senator Lugar--to work with our \ncolleagues with respect to a reservation or an understanding or a \ndeclaration that they believe needs to be tweaked. We will see what we \ncan do with respect to the number of amendments we want to bring.\n  Let me just say to my colleagues that this treaty should not be \ncontroversial. Senator Robert Dole, President George H.W. Bush, former \nRepublican Attorney General Richard Thornburg, and current colleagues \nSenator Barrasso, Senator Moran, and others have all supported and \nbelieve we ought to move forward with this treaty in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n  I would say to my colleagues that in the wake of the election, this \nis the first legislative effort we are making on the floor of the \nSenate. It would be my hope that we could reflect that we heard the \nAmerican people, who asked us to do their business and to not fall into \nthe pattern of partisan divide, of gridlock that has so characterized \nthe Senate over the course of the last few years. This is our \nopportunity to prove that the exceptionalism we are all proud to talk \nabout with respect to our country is defined by our doing exceptional \nwork.\n  This is an opportunity to do that. We have an opportunity to rise \nwith common purpose and make a difference, not just here in the United \nStates, frankly, but most predominately make a difference in the rest \nof the world as to how people with disabilities are treated. I believe \nthe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is an \nopportunity for us to embrace the truth in legislating and to separate \nourselves from ideological and/or partisan efforts to distort that \ntruth or to prevent, actually, an alternative reality, which is what \nhappens in some cases.\n  Our colleagues, I am told, want to approach this in good faith. We \nwelcome that. We look forward to sitting down with them, working \nthrough what amendments we think we should vote on, and perhaps we can \neven work together to tweak one of the understandings or declarations \nin an appropriate way. We would like to make progress. I believe we can \nget this done. It will be a good moment for the Senate when we do.\n  I know we have not always agreed on all the issues and certainly not \neven with respect to this treaty. What I ask of my colleagues is this: \nThose who oppose this or who are inclined to oppose it, I would say \nstep back and take a look at this treaty and measure the report \nlanguage, the report the committee put out, and measure the transmittal \nletter of the President of the United States and the Secretary of \nState, and what they have said to the Senate is really at stake in this \ntreaty.\n  I ask my colleagues before they come to the floor to carefully check \nthe factual foundation of this treaty because we have continually heard \nsome outside groups characterizing it in ways that simply do not meet \nthe facts, that do not withstand scrutiny when measured against the law \nof the United States or international law or the law of the States. \nThis treaty does not require any change whatsoever to American law. \nNone. Zero. There is no impact on American law. There is no ability in \nthis treaty for anybody to gain some new right here in the United \nStates. No individual, American or foreign, gains any access to the \ncourts in an effort to litigate some component of this treaty because \nthe treaty specifically denies people any access to the courts. It is \nwhat is called--it is not self-executing. As a consequence of not being \nself-executing, it gives no right to any litigation.\n  So the obvious question from somebody might be, well, why do we want \nto do it then? What is the benefit to us? The benefit is very \nsignificant in terms of our diplomacy, in terms of the rights of \nAmericans when they travel abroad, Americans with disabilities.\n  Now, our bottom line--I think our shared bottom line--Senator Lugar, \nSenator McCain, Senator Barrasso, Senator Moran, and others who support \nthis treaty believe this will extend the protections to millions of \ndisabled Americans when they leave our shores.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid for being willing to bring this treaty \nto the floor at this moment in time when there is obviously a lot on \nSenators' minds, a lot of business before the Senate. But I believe \nthis treaty will be deemed to have the requisite votes ultimately to \nshow that this is, in fact, in the best interests of our country.\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\n  This treaty has been described as a modest treaty, but the impact of \nSenate ratification is actually far from modest. The impact will echo \naround the world. Why? Because the United States of America is the \nworld's gold standard with respect to the treatment of people with \ndisabilities.\n  This has been a long journey for us in the United States. We have \ngone through many different steps leading ultimately to the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, of which we celebrated the 20th anniversary. Our \nown colleague, Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa, was the leader on that \nlandmark piece of legislation, together with my former colleague \nSenator Ted Kennedy. They moved this country forward in great steps so \nthat we welcomed people with disabilities into mainstream America.\n  The impact of this treaty is to take that gold standard and extend it \nto countries that have never heard of disability rights or that have \nnever changed their laws to accommodate people with disabilities. This \nwill have a profound impact. Most significantly, it will have a \nprofound impact on those who have served our country, those 5.5 million \ndisabled American veterans who may want to travel abroad, work abroad, \ngo to another country to study, who will as a result of this gain \nlifestyle benefits and accommodations they otherwise might never have.\n  Now, 125 nations have already signed this treaty and are living by \nit. We have not. We were the principal architect. Our laws are the \nmodel. But once again the United States has been holding back while \nother countries fill the vacuum we have left behind.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues a statement by Senator Bob Dole, \nwho was as deeply committed to this cause as Senator Ted Kennedy, and \nhe was committed to the original Americans with Disabilities Act. \nSenator Dole today, as we know, is in Bethesda Hospital. I do not know \nif he is listening at this time. I met with him not so many months ago. \nWe talked about this and other issues. He is a great patriot. He was a \ngreat leader here in the Senate. I think his words ought to be listened \nto by our colleagues. Here is what he says:\n\n       It was an exceptional group that I joined during World War \n     II, which no one joins by personal choice. It is a group that \n     neither respects nor discriminates by age, sex, wealth, \n     education, skin color, religious beliefs, political party, \n     power or prestige. That group, Americans with disabilities, \n     has grown in size ever since. So, therefore, has the \n     importance of maintaining access for people with disabilities \n     to mainstream American life, whether it's access to a job, or \n     education, or registering to vote.\n\n  Senator Dole went on to say:\n\n       U.S. ratification of the [Convention on the Rights of \n     Persons with Disabilities] will improve physical, \n     technological and communication access outside the U.S., \n     thereby helping to ensure that Americans--particularly, many \n     thousands of disabled American veterans--have equal \n     opportunities to live, work, and travel abroad.\n\n  In testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee this year, \nSpecial Adviser for International Disability Rights at the State \nDepartment Judith Heumann recounted in personal and searing terms why \nthis issue is so important. She drew from the experience of her own \nlife.\n\n       . . . As a child, I did not have the benefit of accessible \n     communities, inclusive schools, or accessible transportation. \n     Without even simple curb cuts, I wheeled in the streets \n     amongst oncoming traffic. I could not ride our buses and \n     trains. I was not allowed to go to school until I was 9 years \n     old, and then received poor quality education, segregated \n     from the rest of my peers. When I applied for my first job as \n     a teacher, I was initially denied my certification simply \n     because I could not walk.\n\n  Today she is advocating on behalf of the State Department for this \ntreaty. She summed up her interests in this compelling way. She said:\n\n       U.S. citizens with disabilities frequently face barriers \n     when they travel, conduct business, study, serve, reside or \n     retire overseas. With our extensive domestic experience in \n     promoting equality and inclusion of persons with \n     disabilities, the United States is uniquely positioned to \n     help interested countries understand how to effectively \n     comply with their obligations under the Convention . . . \n     However, the fact that we have yet to ratify the Disabilities \n     Convention is frequently raised by foreign officials, and \n     deflects from what should be center stage: how their own \n     record of promoting disability rights could be improved.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Though I take great pride in the U.S. record, it is frankly \n     difficult to make best use of the `bully pulpit' to challenge \n     disabilities rights violations on behalf of Americans with \n     disabilities and others when we have not ratified the \n     Convention.\n\n  America's history--all of its history--has been marked by the long \nstruggle for equality. It is a struggle that ought to inspire all of us \nto fight on behalf of many others whose voices too often are ignored or \nforgotten. Maybe the movie about Lincoln today would really rekindle in \na lot of Americans that best sense of what is worth fighting for and \nwhat is worth achieving in public life.\n  For me, that vision of fighting for those people whose views are \nignored or forgotten means having and holding on to a vision of a \nsociety that really works for the common good, where individual rights \nand freedoms are connected to our responsibilities to each other. All \nAmericans have an inherent right to be treated as equal citizens of our \nNation. But the historic march toward a better, fairer America can only \ncome about if we are willing to make those less fortunate than \nourselves the focus of our work. And this is a march that goes on for \nall of us, and it must go on because without it nothing changes.\n  One thing is clear: The disabilities convention is not an issue that \npits Republicans against Democrats--Senator Lugar is here, Senator \nMcCain, and others--nor is it an issue that should divide us along any \npartisan lines. The Foreign Relations Committee approved this treaty in \na strong bipartisan vote on July 26, and that marked the 22nd \nanniversary of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  I am grateful to the majority leader, former Majority Leader Dole, \nand to President George Herbert Walker Bush, who joined a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators, whose names I have listed, in advocating for this \nimportant cause. I think our former colleague Senator Kennedy would be \nvery proud if he could see us coming together today in support of a \nconvention just as we did two decades ago with the ADA.\n  This treaty is personal to many Members here, to Senator Durbin, to \nSenator Harkin, to Senator Lugar, and others. Members from both sides \nof the aisle have worked hard to bring us to the floor today. I believe \nthe questions have been answered. I think the report and the Record \ncould not be more clear. The only question that remains is whether we \nare going to be remembered for approving the Disabilities Convention \nand reconnecting with our best traditions or finding an excuse to delay \nand defy our core responsibility as Senators.\n  I have received countless letters and heard from nearly 300 \norganizations on this issue. There is a long list--and I am not going \nto read all through those 300--every single major military organization \nsupports this treaty; the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Air \nForce Women Officers Association, the American GI Forum, the Blinded \nVeterans Association, the Division for Early Childhood of the Council \nfor Exceptional Children Disabled American Veterans, the Military \nOfficers Association of America, the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States, the National Military Family Association, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, and then a long list, Veterans for Common Sense, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, Veterans of Modern Warfare, Vietnam Veterans \nof America, countless other faith-based associations, the Methodist \nGeneral Board of Church and Society, the United Church of Christ. You \ncould run through a huge number of faith-based organizations, a huge \nnumber of human rights and rights organizations from all over our \ncountry. I urge Senators to check with the rights organizations and \nothers in their own States. Almost every State in the Union--the \nKentucky Protection and Advocacy Association, the Michigan Protection \nand Advocacy Services. You could run a long list of people who believe \nthe time has come.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the full list of these supporters \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           USICD Support List\n\n       Ability Chicago.\n       Access Alaska Inc.\n       Access Living.\n

Mr. President, across the developing world, persons with \ndisabilities face remarkable indignities and prejudice on a daily \nbasis. They are prevented from attending schools, they are subject to \ndiscriminatory hiring practices, they are often unable to enter a \npublic building, unable to safely cross a street, unable to even ride a \npublic bus. There are an estimated 650 million people in the world \ntoday who live with a disability. Some 36 million of our fellow \nAmericans are disabled, and veterans are filing disability claims at an \nunprecedented level. There is a challenge in these statistics, and it \nis a challenge to the decency and humanity of every Member of the \nSenate.\n  When a disabled child in a developing country is killed at birth \nbecause of their disability, that is a challenge to every single one of \nus, as Americans and as citizens of the world.\n  When a pervasive cultural stereotype forces disabled people to \nabandon their dreams and toil away in crushing poverty, it should \noffend the sensibilities of everybody in the Senate, and we have a \nchance to do something about that. When our wounded warriors are \nprevented from living, working, studying, or traveling abroad because \nof a lack of basic physical access, that violates our sacred oath.\n  I urge my colleagues to go to the report and read the testimony of \npeople who have talked about how things have changed in certain \ncountries because countries signed on to this treaty to try to reach \nthe American gold standard. Each of these episodes that denies people \nthose opportunities takes a little piece of our humanity.\n  I think our identity, I think our exceptionalism is personally on the \nline in this vote. I know some have said we don't need this treaty. \nSome have even argued it requires a change in law when it doesn't \nrequire any change in the law.\n  To paraphrase Senator Moynihan, who reminded us often, everybody is \nentitled to his or her opinion, but you are not entitled to your own \nfacts, I simply say to my colleagues, there are basic facts with \nrespect to this treaty, and we will argue them over the course of the \nnext hour and perhaps days.\n  I want to share the most important facts right upfront. I said this \nearlier, and I am going to repeat it. This treaty--I hope we won't hear \nthis debate on the floor of the Senate, because the text, the legal and \ndocumentary text of the report language and the treaty and the \ntransmittal language and the interpretations of the Justice Department \nall make it clear, this treaty does not require any change in American \nlaw. None. Testimony from everybody, including former Republican \nAttorney General Thornburgh, makes that clear.\n  In addition to that, to make certain we address the concerns of our \ncolleagues so that we reinforce that notion, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee included additional, multiple reservations, understandings, \nand declarations in the resolution of advice and consent, including one \nthat ensures that the treaty cannot be relied on as a cause of action \nin State or Federal courts. When we ratify this, we will ratify it with \na clear understanding that there is no right of action in America's \nState or Federal courts.\n  We have also heard the argument that the convention could somehow \nchange U.S. domestic law with respect to abortion. Again, let me make \nit as clear as I know how: This is absolutely, positively, factually \ninaccurate. The convention does not mandate or prohibit any particular \nmedical procedure, heart surgery, brain surgery, abortion, or anything \nelse, and we made that crystal clear in the understandings of \nratification.\n  What it does require is something very simple. It requires that \ngovernments do not discriminate against the disabled in anything that \nthey do allow or prohibit. If you allow a procedure, you must allow it \nfor the disabled and the nondisabled alike. If you prohibit a \nprocedure, you must prohibit it for the disabled and the nondisabled \nalike. That is all this treaty does, but it is powerful and critical to \nthose millions of people who are discriminated against otherwise. The \nForeign Relations Committee included language in the resolution of \nadvice and consent to clarify what I just said.\n  Some have also tried to make the argument that the disabilities \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\ncreated by this treaty--there is a committee that is created--is \nsomehow going to intrude on the lives of Americans. Again, our good \nPresident John Adams once said that facts are stubborn things. Well, \nthey are stubborn, they don't go away. The facts are that this treaty, \nin this committee that it creates, has no power, except to make a \nreport to put people on notice so they can then consider what they \nmight want to do. It doesn't require any action, it doesn't compel any \naction, it has no authority to do so. It simply sheds the light of day \non what may or may not be happening somewhere so people can then nudge \nand push and jawbone and use the pressure of public scrutiny to \nhopefully change behavior.\n  By terms of the treaty, this committee has exceedingly limited \npowers. It can simply accept and review a country report and make a \nrecommendation. That is it--that recommendation--nothing else.\n\n  The fact is, here in the United States we are blessed because we \nalready live up to the principles of this treaty. Our laws, including \nthe ADA, are more than sufficient to compel compliance with this treaty \nfrom day one. That is why nothing is going to change here at home \nexcept for those people with disabilities who can turn to their family \nand say, you know, I can go take that job over here or I can travel \nover there or I could go study over there, because the standards are \ngoing to rise and people will be able to do that.\n  For decades, I am proud to say, the world has looked to the United \nStates as a leader on disability rights, and it is hard to believe that \nactually some people are now beginning to question our resolve on \nsomething that we were the leader on. That is disappointing, I think, \nto everybody who has been affiliated with this effort over the years.\n  Let me quote John Lancaster. John is a disabled Vietnam veteran who \ntestified in support of this treaty and who challenged us all to do the \nright thing. His words are stark and simple. He said:\n\n       As someone who volunteered and laid my life on the line for \n     freedom, rights, dignity . . . now to have this whole debate \n     that we're not willing to espouse [the Disabilities \n     Convention] to the rest of the world? That we're not willing \n     to walk the talk in international circles? To step up to the \n     forum and advocate . . . We aspire to what's in this \n     Convention. That is what we are about as a nation: including \n     people, giving them freedom, giving them rights, giving them \n     the opportunity to work, to learn, to participate. Isn't that \n     what we are about? Isn't that what we want the rest of the \n     world to be about? Well, if we aren't willing to say that is \n     a good thing and to say it formally, what are we about?\n\n  That is a powerful statement from a man who served his country.\n  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is more \nthan a piece of paper. It is not an empty promise. It is a reflection \nof our values as a nation. It is a lever, it is an inspiration, it is a \ndiplomatic tool. It creates the ability to change life for people in \nmany other countries, and that is what America is about.\n  John Lancaster closed out his testimony saying:\n\n       From a veteran perspective, I think we have much to gain \n     from the improved accessibility of the world. Today some \n     disabled soldiers and Marines remain on active duty in spite \n     of their disability, continuing to serve their country. These \n     servicemembers should be afforded the same rights outside the \n     United States as they enjoy here. For a disabled veteran \n     working abroad, the adoption of disability rights and \n     implementation of disability laws allows them to do their \n     jobs more effectively and reaffirms what they served for: \n     liberty and the opportunity to participate.\n\n  He closed by saying we have a moral obligation to one another to \nserve our great country and to show what we represent to all mankind.\n  When he returned from Vietnam, John struggled for years with \nenvironmental obstacles, employment discrimination. I think we owe it \nto him and to millions of Americans facing a similar plight today to \nfulfill our constitutional responsibilities and get the job done.\n  When George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act into \nlaw, he did so with the hope that it was going to foster full and equal \naccess to civic, economic, and social life for people with disabilities \nin America. Senator Kennedy, who played an important role, said, ``This \nact has the potential to become one of the great civil rights laws of \nour generation . . . It is a bill of rights for the disabled, and \nAmerica will be a better and fairer nation because of it.''\n  That was the spirit that animated the passage of the ADA, and it is \nthe same spirit that has inspired a bipartisan group of Senators to \nwork tirelessly to pass this convention.\n  For far too long persons with disabilities have been left in the \nshadows or left to fend for themselves. We must resolve again as \nSenators and as citizens to fight for our principles. It isn't a \nquestion of time. It is a question of priorities--a question of \nwillpower, not capacity. This treaty reflects our highest ideals as a \nnation, and now is the time to act.\n  In closing, I say to colleagues: When there is an opportunity for \nchange, America must be there to help--to keep faith, and to use our \nvoice to support those who are striving for reform.\n  This really is one of those moments the Senate was intended to live \nup to--and it demands leadership and a willingness to find the common \nground.\n  If discrimination against persons with disabilities is to stop--and \nit must--then we must stop it. We all know that restoring the full \nmeasure of rights to persons with disabilities is not just a lofty \ngoal. It's a core value here at home and an imperative abroad. But it \nis not enough to know how things ought to be. Our job is to ask how we \ncan make them so.\n  After all, if the American people said anything in this election \nyear, it is that Members of Congress need to work not just on their \nside but side by side. It is the only way we can fully complete our \nconstitutional duties. It is the only way--in a divided country, at a \ntime of heightened partisan tensions--that ideology will yield to \ncommon sense. And it is the only way that we will approve the \ndisabilities convention and live out the truth behind those timeless \nand inimitable words: that all of us are created equal.\n  I yield to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the chairman of our committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, has expressed the case well \nand strongly. Let me say in simplicity that as we enjoyed hearing of \nthe rights of persons with disabilities, we have learned that \nessentially the United States has an opportunity for leadership for an \nexpression of our idealism with regard to the care and treatment and \nconcern for disabled persons in our country and the world.\n  If we ratify this treaty, we will join with other nations who meet \nannually and will receive every 4 years reports from the various \ncountries that are involved as to the progress they have made. They \ncompare notes. They learn really how the disabled are treated. Our \nbelief is that we are the gold standard and that there are many \ncountries that would like to know technically how people are treated in \nthe United States and what sort of investment would be required in \nthose countries.\n\n  Having said that, we should also say, very frankly, that the \ncommittee or this governing aspect has no ability whatsoever to create \nlaw--either State, local, or Federal--in the United States of America \nor to compel Americans to do anything, literally. So we have an \nopportunity to be advocates of our idealism, and we have an opportunity \nto listen to others and perhaps to gain new insight in this body about \nhow, along with our fellows in the House, to proceed. I think that is \nvery important.\n  Now, having said all that, I would say that likewise the committee \ndid understand there are considerable anxieties in our country about \nthis situation. I would say it is conceivable the debate we have today \nwill illustrate that some Members of our body have valid concerns about \nthe convention. I think it is clear that we will cite again and again \nour domestic legislation, such as the ADA and the IDEA, which \nconstitutes the most comprehensive and effective standards to advance \nthe rights and provide equal opportunities for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  One of the arguments by the administration in support of Senate \nratification is that by becoming a member we will be able to increase \nour global credibility. It is argued this increased credibility with \nother countries will be beneficial in exporting and promoting\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\nstandards. The executive branch also argued that when officials have \nbilateral conversations advising other governments about improving \nstandards for their disabled citizens, officials often question why the \nUnited States is not a party now to the convention. Opponents of the \nconvention have argued we should only accede to the convention if it \nadvances the national interest of the United States, especially in an \narea where the United States is a global leader.\n  There have been questions raised regarding the binding nature of the \nconvention. The response has been that the convention is nonbinding, \nand the committee formed by the treaty has no compulsory authority. \nThis also addresses the concerns of opponents who have cited instances \nof overreach by such committees established by human rights treaties in \nthe past.\n  Most major veterans groups, as has been cited, and disability rights \ngroups have all written in support and, as a matter of fact, turned out \nby the hundreds for the hearings and the markup of this legislation in \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As I indicated, it would be \nvery important from the perspective of making the world a more \naccessible place for U.S. citizens, including disabled citizens and \nveterans who are disabled. And improving a global standard for all \nsegments of the disabled community should be our goal. Although \naccession to the treaty will not instantly achieve that goal, it may \nprovide another avenue through which we might achieve the goal.\n  I want to mention specifically now some technical aspects of our \ncommittee consideration. Article 34 of the convention creates the \ncommittee we have talked about--the committee on the rights of persons \nand disabilities. It consists of 18 persons, elected by state parties \nto the convention, and they are required to submit periodic reports to \nthe committee concerning measures taken to give effect to the \nobligations under the convention and the progress made in that regard. \nThe convention provides the committee shall make such suggestions and \ngeneral recommendations on the report as it may consider appropriate \nand shall forward those to the state party concerned. The committee \nrecommendations are advisory only and are not binding on the sate \nparties, including the United States of America.\n  Now, the United States has recognized the rights of individuals with \ndisabilities through constitutional and statutory protections--the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which has been cited. As such, \nmany of the general requirements of the convention for protection of \ndisability rights already exist in Federal law. The provisions of the \nconvention can be grouped generally into the following categories: \nAccessibility, education, equality, employment, and health.\n  Now, the committee closely reviewed the ``best interest of the \nchild'' standard as set forth in article 7 of the convention, including \nwhether the ratification of the convention by the United States could \nnegatively impact parental rights with respect to disabled children, \nincluding parents who opt for home schooling of disabled children. The \nDepartment of Justice testified unequivocally that parental rights \nwould not be hindered in any way.\n  In response to written questions for the record, Senior Counselor to \nthe Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eve Hill, stated:\n\n       In light of the Federalism and private conduct \n     reservations, among others, there would be no change to \n     Federal, State or local law regarding the ability of parents \n     in the United States to make decisions about how to raise or \n     educate their children as a result of ratification.\n\n  Mention has been made by the chairman about article 25 of the \nconvention. The state parties recognize that individuals with \ndisabilities have the same right as others to enjoyment of the highest \nattainable standards held. They must be offered the same range, \nquality, and standard of care that is available to other persons in \ntheir countries. Health care professionals must provide care on the \nsame basis they would provide if the individual seeking care did not \nhave a disability. Article 25 also prohibits discrimination based on \ndisability related to the provisions of health and life insurance.\n  The convention does not provide any additional or different rights on \nmatters of abortion. It also provides that people with disabilities not \nbe treated any differently than others. Existing U.S. rules on abortion \nwould still apply to U.S. citizens.\n  The administration has recommended the Senate include certain \nreservations, declarations, and understandings in any resolution of \nadvice and consent. The administration has stated, with the following \nreservations, understandings, and declarations; that the United States \nwould be able to implement its obligations under the convention using \nits vast existing network of laws affording protection to persons with \ndisabilities. Therefore--and I stress this--no new legislation would be \nrequired to ratify and implement the convention.\n  I shall not go through all the details of the reservations, but they \ndo specifically mention federalism: The convention shall be implemented \nby the Federal Government of the United States of America to the extent \nit exercises the legislative and judicial jurisdiction over the matters \ncovered therein and otherwise by the State and local governments to the \nextent that State and local governments exercise jurisdiction over such \nmatters.\n\n  I would say, secondly, there is nonregulation of certain private \nconduct. This is a reservation suggested by the administration, adopted \nby the committee. The Constitution and laws of the United States \nestablish extensive protection against discrimination, reaching all \nforms of government activity as well as significant areas of \nnongovernment activity. Individual privacy and freedom from government \ninterference in certain private conduct is also recognized as being \namong fundamental values of our free and democratic society.\n  The United States understands that by its terms the convention can be \nread to require broad regulation of private conduct. To the extent it \ndoes, the United States of America does not accept any obligation--any \nobligation--under the convention to enact legislation or take other \nmeasures with respect to private conduct except as mandated by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States of America.\n  I would mention, in addition to proposed reservations of the \nadministration adopted by the committee, there were numerous proposed \nunderstandings all of which were adopted by the committee. They protect \nessentially the first amendment of the United States, economic, social, \nand cultural rights in our country, equal employment opportunity, \nuniformed employees of the United States, military departments, and \ndefinition of disability. In other words, U.S. law, State and local \ngovernment law apply in all of these cases without exception and cannot \nbe countermanded by anything with regard to this treaty. Likewise, \nthere have been proposed declarations offered by the State Department, \nand these were adopted by the committee.\n  I would simply say, Mr. President, without reiterating each of the \nreservations, they all attempt to meet any conceivable objection or \nquestion raised by citizens of the United States who have testified, \nwho have written to the committee, or Members of this body who have \nvisited with members of the committee as we were preparing for this \nobligation today. This is a treaty, in essence, that states our \nidealism. We would be a part of an organization in which we have a \nforum to do that. We are under no obligation to adopt any of the \nsuggestions of the other committee members, although we will listen \nrespectfully to them.\n  As a matter of fact, the treaty is important because we have such a \ngold standard that others have simply raised the question: Why are you \nnot a part of a picture that might make this available, thoughtfully, \nto the rest of the world? And there is no good answer to that if in \nfact we espouse these ideals with regard to all of humanity and hope \nthey might be adopted by others. But, specifically, and one reason \nveterans organizations and other organizations trying to help the \ndisabled in our country advocate this treaty is that we would like to \nsee improvement in other countries.\n  Sometimes our warfighters, as a matter of fact, are forced by all \nsorts of conditions to live in other countries. We hope they are \nreceiving proper treatment, the best treatment. As a matter of fact, if \nthey have any sort of\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\nlife in those countries, we hope there is improvement for them. We \nhope, as they come back to America and then find it necessary to travel \nabroad again for any number of purposes, that the treatment for their \ndisabilities will be there and, hopefully, of the same quality. We need \nto be advocates of this convention, advocates for our veterans and for \nother Americans who have disabilities.\n  So for these reasons, Mr. President, I am grateful to the majority \nleader for bringing this legislation to the floor at this time. We are \nvery hopeful that at least the bipartisan debate we had in our \ncommittee and the strong vote for ratification will find at least some \nresonance in this overall debate in the Senate.\n  It has been a privilege on my part to work with our leader and to \nhave had an excellent set of hearings and to have enjoyed the comments \nof our veterans. There are many in this body who have served this \ncountry in the military services. They have distinguished records. I \nhad only a modest 3 years and 4 months of Active Duty after \nvolunteering for the Navy, but that was sufficient for me to learn what \nwas important for those with whom I was serving and those in veterans \norganizations, such as the American Legion, headquartered in \nIndianapolis, IN, about what is vital to the quality of life for those \nconstituents.\n  So I am hopeful we will have success in this effort tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana, not just \nfor his comments now but for his many years of leadership on these \nissues and for his wonderful partnership in all of this. I will have \nmore to say about that as the days go on, but we are going to miss his \nvision and wisdom over the course of the years.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be equally divided under the quorum call. I would hope \ncolleagues would come to the floor and use the time as they desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would like to recognize Senator Vitter on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                   Detention of Elton ``Mark'' McCabe\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to note grave concern on behalf of \na constituent of mine and his family. Elton ``Mark'' McCabe, a \nbusinessman from Slidell, LA, has been held against his will in the \ncustody of South Sudanese officials since October 14--for several weeks \nnow, going on a month, through Thanksgiving.\n  Mark McCabe was in Africa, South Sudan, with business partners \npursuing business opportunities, doing everything by the book, legally, \nethically, and apparently, for reasons we don't yet fully understand, \nbusiness competitors or business enemies of his had some sway with \nSouth Sudanese officials in a particular portion of the government with \nthe security force, and he was taken into custody. He was charged with \nvague, very serious crimes and has been held against his will for these \nmany weeks. I won't go into all the details, but it has been a long \ntorturous experience.\n  I have been on the phone constantly, virtually every day, with State \nDepartment officials, with the South Sudanese Ambassador to the United \nStates, with others, trying to demand basic due process and basic \njustice.\n  Things have gotten a little better in the last week, and a few days \nago there was a hearing before a judge regarding these trumped-up \ncharges. When the prosecution had basically no facts and no evidence to \npresent, the judge virtually laughed in their face with regard to this \nlack of a case. Nonetheless, the prosecution asked for 3 more days to \nget its house in order, to get its notes in order, possibly just to try \nto save face by dropping these trumped-up charges against Mr. McCabe \nrather than having them thrown out against their will by the judge. We \nhope that is the case, we pray that is the case, but we don't know yet.\n  The next hearing before this same judge is going to be this Thursday. \nSo I come to the Senate floor to urge that judge and the South Sudanese \nGovernment to do the right thing, to do justice and immediately release \nMark McCabe, who, again, has been held against his will, with no \nevidence, with no meaningful charges against him, since October 14.\n  I want to repeat what I said directly to the South Sudanese \nAmbassador to the United States. For many years we have built a strong, \npositive, bilateral relationship, but that relationship depends on \nappropriate trust between the parties and appropriate action. And we \nare looking at this case very seriously. We are looking at this case as \na test of their judicial system, as a test of their appropriate \nintentions. If this completely unjustified detention continues, I vow \nthat I will personally make sure there are consequences and \nrepercussions to that relationship because there should be. They have \nviolated basic fundamental legal and human rights of U.S. citizens.\n  I am hopeful based on what happened in South Sudan a few days ago, \nbut, to quote President Ronald Reagan, trust but verify. And we are \ngoing to verify one way or the other come Thursday. The matter is very \nsimple: Even though Mark McCabe has been held against his will for \nweeks and weeks, finally, at this late date, we fully expect this sorry \nstate of affairs to end on Thursday. And if these trumped-up, frivolous \ncharges continue, if he continues to be held against his will, I \npromise I will make those statements to the South Sudanese Ambassador \nring true. I promise I will follow up and take action because this is \nabsolutely outrageous.\n  I know we all join to pray for justice, to pray for Mr. McCabe's \nsafekeeping. He has a serious heart condition. Indications are that he \nactually suffered a mild heart attack while in the custody of South \nSudanese officials. So we pray for him, and we very much expect and \nlook forward to his quick return to his home in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise to support the ratification of \nthe U.N. Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities or, as it is \nknown, the CRPD.\n  First, I wish to thank Chairman Kerry of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee for his diligence and for his leadership on this issue. He \nhas carried it through the committee; he has brought it to the floor. \nIn fact, I was reminded earlier today, we were both on the committee \nback in the 1980s when we first started working on the Americans with \nDisabilities Act under the tutelage, really, of Senator Lowell Weicker, \nwho remains a great friend to this day and is still a great leader on \nthe issues of people with disabilities. So we go back that far working \ntogether on these issues.\n  I thank Senator Kerry for his great leadership in bringing us to this \npoint and, hopefully, the point being that we are going to ratify this \nwonderful treaty.\n  I thank Senator Lugar again for all of his efforts through so many \nyears on so many different issues, and on this issue especially, going \nback to the beginning of the Americans with Disabilities Act. If I \nmight divert from this just for one brief moment to thank Senator Lugar \nfor his leadership in making the world safer by getting rid of nuclear \nweapons in the Soviet Union. What a singular effort that has been. \nSenator Lugar has done much to make the world a better place for us and \nfor our kids and grandkids. So I salute him for his wonderful \nleadership in that area.\n  Senator McCain, of course, was here and worked with us on the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act back in 1989 and 1990. He was very much \ninvolved in it; Senator Durbin, Senator Barrasso, Senator Moran, \nSenator Udall, and\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nSenator Coons, I guess all of whom worked very hard to secure the \nratification of this important convention.\n  As the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions and as the lead Senate author of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, I want the United States to become a party to this \nconvention so we can apply the expertise we have developed under the \nADA and help the rest of the world remove barriers to full \nparticipation and to honor the human rights of citizens with \ndisabilities. One of my greatest joys in the Senate has been my work \nwith so many Senators on the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n  The ADA stands for a simple proposition: that disability is a natural \npart of the human experience and that all people with disabilities have \nan inherent right to make choices to pursue meaningful careers and to \nparticipate fully in all aspects of society. So thanks to the ADA, our \ncountry is a more welcoming place not just for people with a variety of \ndisabilities but for everyone.\n  Twenty-two years ago, on July 26, 1990, President Bush gathered \nhundreds of Americans with disabilities on the White House lawn for the \nADA signing ceremony, and here is what he said. It is wonderful.\n\n       This historic act is the world's first comprehensive \n     declaration of equality for people with disabilities--the \n     first. Its passage has made the United States the \n     international leader on this human rights issue.\n\n  Well, thanks to the ADA and other U.S. laws, America is showing the \nrest of the world how to honor the basic human rights of children and \nadults with disabilities, how to integrate them into society, how to \nremove barriers to their full participation in activities that most \nAmericans just take for granted.\n  Our support for disability rights inspired a global movement that led \nthe United Nations to adopt the CRPD. In fact, I might just add \nparenthetically that after the Americans with Disabilities Act was \nadopted, we had people from many countries come here. I can think of, \nfirst, Russia. Then it was Greece, Ireland, Great Britain, as well as a \nnumber of people from other countries who came here to learn what we \nhad done and then to pick it up and move forward in their own \ncountries. Our legal framework influenced the substance of the \nconvention and is informing its implementation in the 125 countries, I \nthink, that have ratified it along with the European Union.\n  My staff was involved in 2002 when the U.N. first broached this \nsubject of coming up with a convention and, in turn, provided to them \nthe substance of the Americans with Disabilities Act, its history, its \nprovisions, and what had been done from its adoption in 1990 until 2002 \nand the changes that it had brought about in our own country. So, \nreally, I think the Americans with Disabilities Act informed and laid \nthe basis for what the U.N. began to do in 2002 and completed in 2006.\n  So, again, I am very grateful for the leadership of Senator Kerry, \nSenator McCain, as well as Senator Dole, who I know is not able to be \nwith us right now, but I thank them for all of their support for the \nratification of the CRPD. I also appreciate that former President \nGeorge H.W. Bush, his White House Counsel Boyden Gray, Attorney General \nDick Thornburg, former Congressman Steve Bartlett, and Tony Coelho have \nall been actively supporting this ratification.\n  I am also grateful for the support from the U.S. business community, \nincluding, clearly, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Information \nTechnology Industry Council for ratification of this treaty. Because of \ntheir experience with the ADA, American businesses have developed \nexpertise they can apply in the global marketplace in a way that gives \nthem a competitive advantage. If we are a party to the convention, the \nU.S.-based companies with this expertise will be on much more solid \nfooting when they are seeking to help other countries write and \nimplement domestic legislation consistent with the convention and \nconsistent with U.S. standards for accessibility and equal opportunity.\n  Like the Americans with Disabilities Act, the CRPD enjoys widespread \nsupport in the disability, civil rights, business, veterans, and faith-\nbased communities. I could be off a little bit, but as of the writing \nof this statement we have letters of support from more than 250 \nAmerican disability organizations, 21 veterans service organizations--\nand I caught some of the comments made by our distinguished chairman, \nSenator Kerry, in talking about veterans and our wounded warriors as \nthey travel around the world and being able to access in other parts of \nthe world what they can access here in America; a very good point--and \n26 faith organizations also in support of the CRPD. These entities all \nrealize the critical importance of America's position as a global \nleader on disability rights. They want our country to have a seat at \nthe table and to share that expertise as the States Parties to the \nConvention work to implement it around the world.\n  I might add here, under the convention a committee will be \nestablished to assist and to help other countries in implementing and \nchanging their laws and conforming. If we are a party to this, we get a \nseat at the table. If we are not a party to it, we will not have a seat \nat the table. Why shouldn't we have a seat at the table? We have been \nthe world leaders. So by ratifying this convention, the United States \nwill be reaffirming our commitment to our citizens with disabilities. \nAmericans with disabilities should be able to live and travel, study \nand work abroad with the same freedoms and access they enjoy here in \nthis country. Again, as other countries that have been signatories to \nthis treaty grapple with how to change their systems and to make their \nsystems more accessible, we can be at the table helping them to \nimplement this treaty and to learn from our experience.\n  The administration has submitted reservations, understandings, and \ndeclarations that make clear that U.S. ratification will not require \nany change in U.S. law and will have no fiscal impact. The Senate \nForeign Relations Committee has modified these reservations, \nunderstandings, and declarations to address concerns that were raised \nin the committee markup.\n  Although U.S. ratification of the CRPD will not require changes in \nU.S. law and will not have a fiscal impact, I think it is very clear \nthat U.S. ratification will have a clear moral impact. It will send a \nsignal to the rest of the world that it is not OK to leave a baby with \nDown Syndrome on the side of the road to die, it is not OK to warehouse \nadults with intellectual and psychiatric disabilities in institutions, \nchained to the bars of a cell, when their only ``crime'' is having a \ndisability, it is not OK to refuse to educate children because they are \nblind, deaf, or use a wheelchair, it is not OK to prevent disabled \npeople from voting, getting married, owning property, or having \nchildren, it is not OK to rebuild infrastructures in Iraq or \nAfghanistan or Haiti or other war-torn or disaster-stricken areas \nwithout improving the accessibility of the infrastructure at the same \ntime.\n  Former President Reagan frequently talked about America as a city on \na hill, a shining example for the world of a nation that ensures \nopportunity and freedom for all its people. Thanks to our country's \nsuccess in implementing the ADA, advancing that law's great goals of \nfull inclusion and full participation, America, indeed, has become a \nshining city on a hill for people with disabilities around the globe. \nBy ratifying the CRPD, we can affirm our leadership in this field. We \ncan give renewed impetus to those striving to emulate us. We can give \nthem that renewed impetus by our example and by sitting down with them \nand working with them only if we are a signatory to this treaty.\n  Again, you think about American exceptionalism. We are a pretty \nexceptional country, when you think about it, in many ways. We are not \njust exceptional because we have the most tanks and guns and bombs and \nthings such as that, but we are exceptional in what we have done in \nterms of civil rights and human rights and to include all in our \nfamily--our family being our citizenship. We took great strides. \nAmerica has always been evolving as a country to expand civil rights \nand human rights, and one of the latest, of course, was to extend those \nrights to people with disabilities in our society, making sure people \nwith disabilities had all the rights and opportunities that anyone \nenjoys in our society.\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\n  It seems to me that this is the kind of exceptionalism we ought to be \npromoting around the globe. We ought to be proud. We should be proud of \nwhat we have done as a country in this regard. We should not be \nafraid--not be afraid--to join in a convention to extend to the rest of \nthe world what we have done here, basically, and to be helpful in \nmaking sure that other countries can also attain that kind of a \nstandard that does not exclude anyone because of a disability from \ntheir society.\n  I know there were some who were not part of the bipartisan vote to \nsupport ratification in the committee. I understand that. But my hope \nis that in the intervening time, in the course of Senate debate, we \nwill have addressed any remaining concerns, move forward with a strong \nbipartisan vote to provide our advice and consent, and pass the \nresolution supporting U.S. ratification of the CRPD with overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  When we voted on the ADA in 1990, it was a vote where only 6 people \nin the Senate voted against it--91 to 6. It was a historic law. My hope \nis we can achieve the same kind of strong bipartisan statement of \nsupport for the human rights of 1 billion people with disabilities \naround the world.\n  As to those of us who travel a lot around the world--maybe I see it \nmore because of my involvement in this issue--I cannot begin to \ndescribe how often it is people come up and ask us how we can help, \nhelp them change so that people with disabilities can have more access, \nbe more involved. Many times I have been to countries where someone \ncomes up and may not know of my involvement in this issue, but through \nthe course of conversation--maybe it is someone in business, maybe it \nis someone in government, in education--they mention this: They mention \naccessibility because they have a brother, a sister, a friend, someone \nwho has a disability, and they talk about how easy it is for them in \nAmerica to get around, to move around, to go to school, to do business, \nand they would hope that maybe their country could do the same. It \nhappens a lot. Here we are, we have the opportunity to be a key player \nin this global effort.\n  It was important for us as a country for the first 10 to 20 years to \nfocus on our own internal problems in terms of advancing the cause of \npeople with disabilities, when you think about all the changes that \nhave come about in the last 22 years. And now we take a lot of it for \ngranted in terms of accessibility, mobility, education, health care, \njob accessibility. It is just not unusual any longer to walk into a \nbusiness and see someone with a physical disability or an intellectual \ndisability working there. We kind of do not even think about it much \nanymore. We do not think about kids with disabilities mainstreamed in \nschools.\n\n  I remember when our oldest daughter was in grade school and IDEA was \njust coming into force and effect, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, and a child with a disability was integrated into the \nclassroom. There was this big hue and cry from a lot of the parents \nabout: Oh, this kid was going to be disruptive. And how are the other \nkids going to learn?\n  Well, we got through that. Now we have a whole generation, what I \ncall the ADA generation, kids who were mainstreamed in school, and kids \nwithout disabilities do not think anything about being their friends, \ngoing to a ball game with them, going to the theater with them, working \nalongside them. So we have this whole new generation where you do not \nthink about it any longer. It is a normal aspect of life.\n  That is not so in other countries. In other countries, it is still, \nquite frankly, a sign of disgrace when a family has a child with a \ndisability. Well, it is time to get over that. By being a country \nsigning on to this, we can help them in so many ways. It is not just \nkids or young people with physical disabilities; it is people with \nintellectual disabilities. For how long have we looked down on people \nwith Down Syndrome, for example, and said: Well, they cannot do \nanything? We segregate them in society. We send them to special \nschools. We give them occupations that do not challenge them. Now we \nhave broken that down. Now so many people with intellectual \ndisabilities, we find, can do a lot of things, and they can be \nchallenged. And, yes, they can do competitive employment. They do not \nneed sheltered workshops. They can be in competitive employment, with \njust a little support and a little training.\n  So many things have changed for the better in this country. It would \nbe a shame--be a shame--if all this good we have done through all \nsectors of society--the business community, government, transportation, \neducation; all these things we have done to make sure people with \ndisabilities are not discriminated against and they have full \nopportunities, all the opportunities that anyone else has in our \nsociety--it would be a shame to say that somehow we are not going to \nsupport a convention, an international convention that basically takes \nwhat we have done and says: Here, world, this is what we should be \ndoing globally.\n  To have 125 countries already signed up to it, and here we are--those \nwho took the leadership in this area, everyone from the White House to, \nas I say, the Chamber of Commerce, that was supportive of the ADA, the \nbusiness community that worked so hard on this--it would be a shame if \nwe did not ratify this and become players in this and have a seat at \nthe table to help the rest of the world attain what we have attained in \nthis country.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, and so many others, \nSenator McCain and others--I am probably forgetting to mention \nsomeone--but so many people who have worked so hard to bring this issue \nto this point.\n  I have to believe--yes, I know there are some Senators who have some \nproblems, and I do not question anyone's motives or anything like that. \nI think some people do have, maybe, some concerns about this. \nHopefully, through the amending process, we can allay those concerns. I \nhope we get resounding--resounding--support for the ratification of \nthis treaty and show the world that we are proud of what we have done, \nand we want to join with the rest of the world in making sure they too \ncan advance and progress and have the same kind of support and \naccessibility and opportunity for people with disabilities as we have \nhad in America.\n  Again, I thank my colleague and my classmate and my longtime friend \nSenator Kerry for his leadership on this issue, and I hope we have a \nresounding, overwhelming vote, just as we did for the Americans with \nDisabilities Act 22 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa and I want \nto comment quickly before I yield the floor to the Senator from \nMinnesota. I also have a unanimous consent request.\n  I heard the Senator pay appropriate tribute to Senator Lugar for his \naccomplishments in terms of making the world safer. I say to my friend, \nwithout any question whatsoever in reserve that the accomplishment of \nthe ADA is one of those singular moments in the career of any U.S. \nSenator and it made the world better here at home, and a lot of other \nplaces if we get this done. The Senator from Iowa helped set that gold \nstandard, so I thank him for that and for the pleasure--there are only \nthree of us left from our class, so it is good to stand up with him \ntoday, and I appreciate it enormously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time for debate only on the treaty \nbe extended until 6:30 p.m., with the time equally divided as provided \nunder the previous order; further, that at 6:30 p.m., the majority \nleader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I rise to discuss the importance of the Convention on \nthe Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I wish to thank Senator Kerry \nand Senator Lugar for their outstanding leadership on this important \ntreaty, as well as Senator Harkin, my neighbor to the south, for all he \nhas done for people with disabilities.\n  For many years I have served on the advisory board of Pacer, which is \none of the Nation's greatest organizations for parents of kids with \ndisabilities, and saw firsthand what so many families go through every \nday, the incredible courage and the love they show for\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\ntheir children and the inspiration so many people with disabilities \nbring to our country.\n  To paraphrase Minnesota's own ``happy warrior,'' Hubert Humphrey, the \nmoral test of a government isn't just how it treats the young, the \nhealthy, and the able bodied, it is also how it treats the sick, the \nelderly, and the disabled--those in need of a little extra support.\n  That may be the moral test of a government, but I believe it is also \nthe moral test of a people and the moral test of a country. Today, I \ncall on all my colleagues to vote to ratify the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities for two simple reasons. First of \nall, ratifying this treaty is about protecting the rights of U.S. \ncitizens who are living with disabilities overseas.\n  Right now, thousands of Americans with disabilities, including our \nmen and women in uniform, live, work, study, and travel abroad. I \nbelieve these Americans deserve the same rights and protections they \nwould enjoy if they were living in the United States. This treaty is \nabout ensuring those rights and protections.\n  Second, ratifying this treaty is about advancing a core moral value \nwe all share as Americans, the idea that all people are created equal \nand that we are all endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable \nrights. Our country has long led the world as a beacon for equality and \nhuman dignity. This treaty would elevate our role in promoting human \nrights around the globe.\n  These are American values, but they are especially near and dear to \nmy heart as a Senator from Minnesota, where we have a long and proud \ntradition of working to ensure that people with disabilities have \naccess to the same basic resources and opportunities as everyone else. \nAfter all, it was the Minnesota Ramp Project that introduced a new \nAmerican model for building statewide standardized wheelchair ramps.\n  We are the State that sent Paul Wellstone to the Senate, where he \nfought long and hard for mental health parity, something that finally \npassed in the Senate and was signed into law after he died--but it was \nsigned into law. We are home to some of the most innovative centers for \nthe disabled in the country, including Pacer, that I already mentioned, \nthe Courage Center, and ARC.\n  We even have one of the most accessible baseball stadiums in the \ncountry. We are looking forward to a better season for the Twins next \nyear, and we are so proud of our new stadium and how accessible it is \nfor people with disabilities. In many foreign countries, not even \nschools and hospitals can meet these standards for people with \ndisabilities. When a person is not even able to get an education or \naccess to health care they need because of a disability, that is a very \nbig problem.\n  Even more troubling is the fact that some foreign countries lack laws \nfor protecting the disabled against discrimination, meaning they have \nno recourse after being denied a job or an education or the use of \npublic services. Remember, these inequities do not just affect foreign \ncitizens, they affect Americans who are living in those countries.\n  So this is what is at stake: protecting our own citizens when they \ntravel to other countries and extending the values of equality and \njustice we so cherish in our own country. It is important to note that \nratifying this treaty will not require any changes to U.S. law, nor \nwill it impact American sovereignty, nor will it incur costs to \ntaxpayers.\n  It has been endorsed by every major disabled person's rights \norganization, every major veteran's service organization, the Chamber \nof Commerce, and several Republican and Democratic administrations. \nProtecting the rights of the most vulnerable among us is not a partisan \nissue. It is an issue of decency and an issue of dignity. I believe it \nis an issue we must all stand behind as Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to ratify this treaty and move us forward in \nadvancing the rights of disabled people around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I wanted to thank the Senator from \nMinnesota so much for taking time to come over. I know she did not \nintend to earlier, but she cares about the issue and took the time to \ncome and share her thoughts with us. We are very appreciative. We \nobviously hope the Twins do whatever they want, second only to the Red \nSox in the future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, before us for advice and consent is the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the CRPD. I \nsupport the treaty and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport it.\n  In America, I do not believe anyone considers someone with a \ndisability to have any less rights or protections than people without \ndisabilities. I would suggest this reality is partly due to our values \nbut also due to bipartisan efforts to codify in law that persons with \ndisabilities are afforded equal access and protection from \ndiscrimination.\n  Over 22 years ago members of both parties came together to pass the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. It is not only the law of the land but \nit is the template for the CRPD in countries around the world that are \nmoving to update their laws. Both the ADA and the ADA amendments of \n2008 were passed with wide bipartisan margins. They are examples that \nfrom time to time we can engage in a bipartisan effort in this body.\n  In many countries accessibility to public spaces is not available to \npersons with disabilities. They are still discriminated against or cast \naside in societies across the globe. Horrifically, infanticide occurs \nin many countries where children are born with disabilities. Protecting \nthe rights of persons with disabilities, all persons, is not a \npolitical issue, it is a human issue.\n  Regardless of where in the world a disabled person strives to live a \nnormal, independent life, where basic rights and accessibilities are \navailable, disability rights and protections have always been a \nbipartisan issue. Ratifying this treaty should be no different.\n  Senator Durbin and I and Senator Kerry began months ago--with Senator \nHarkin, Senator Lugar, many others. We had been discussing months ago \nhow we could work together in a bipartisan manner and build support for \nratification of the treaty.\n  As I mentioned, we have worked closely with Senators Moran, Barrasso, \nCoons, Tom Udall, Harkin, and others. I wish to thank them for their \nsupport and efforts to get us to this point. Senator Kerry deserves \nspecial recognition for scheduling a Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing and a markup that favorably reported the measure out of the \ncommittee. I also wish to thank the majority leader for scheduling this \ntreaty for consideration today.\n  I think my colleagues should appreciate that this treaty is supported \nby over 300 disability organizations, at least 21 U.S. military \nveterans service organizations, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and many \nother organizations. It is not an accident that literally every \nveterans organization in this country supports this treaty because it \nis our veterans, many of whom are coming home as we speak, who will \nlive and travel abroad and will benefit from this treaty.\n  As I have been traveling around the world where conflict is ever \npresent, I have seen that so many people will benefit from the \nprinciples embodied in the treaty. So I would argue this effort is \nprobably more important today in the world than it has been in the \npast. Another strong supporter of this treaty is one of my closest \nfriends and heroes, Bob Dole. As you know, Bob has dedicated nearly his \nentire life to this country, through his military service and, \nfollowing that, many years in public service.\n  He has dedicated the past several months to encourage support in the \nSenate for this treaty. Earlier, I read a statement from Bob. I would \nlike to mention some parts of the statement. I will point out rather \npoignantly he says:\n\n       It was an exceptional group I joined during World War II, \n     which no one joins by personal\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\n     choice. It is a group that neither respects or discriminates \n     by age, sex, wealth, education, skin color, religious \n     beliefs, political party, power, prestige. That group, \n     Americans with disabilities, has grown in size ever since. \n     So, therefore, has the importance of maintaining access for \n     people with disabilities to mainstream American life, whether \n     it is access to a job, an education, or registering to vote.\n\n  I will not go through Bob Dole's entire statement. I would point out \nthere are still thousands and thousands and thousands of his comrades \nwho came home disabled in some respect--Bob, of course, in the most \npainful way. We all recall, with some nostalgia and appreciation, that \nhe and our other wonderful hero Senator Inouye spent time in the same \nhospital following World War II going through very difficult periods of \nrehabilitation, a friendship that was forged there that has lasted ever \nsince.\n  I can assure you there is nothing Bob Dole would want more than to be \nhere on the floor of this Senate delivering his own speech before the \nSenate and urging colleagues to consider this treaty based on facts and \non our values that ensure, protect, and advance the rights of persons \nwith disabilities, whether on U.S. soil or around the globe where we \ncan make a difference.\n  I received a letter today from--it is very difficult for me to \npronounce his name, but I will try--from one individual, Chen \nGuangcheng. He is an individual who is a blind Chinese activist who \nrecently came to the United States of America thanks to the efforts of \nmany of the leaders in our administration, including the Secretary of \nState.\n  I wish to quote from his letter. This is an individual who is blind, \nwho fought for human rights in his country, in China, and now, thank \nGod, is in the United States of America. His letter says:\n\n       Dear Senators, I am writing you to personally ask for your \n     support for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \n     Disabilities. As you know, my work on civil rights began with \n     trying to ensure that people with disabilities in my home \n     country of China were afforded the same rights as everyone \n     else. The CRPD is making this idea real in significant ways \n     around the world. Today, worldwide there are over 1 billion \n     people with disabilities, and 80 percent of them live in \n     developing countries. Disability rights is an issue that the \n     world cannot afford to overlook.\n       When the United States enacted the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act over twenty years ago, the idea of true \n     equality for people with disabilities became a reality. Many \n     nations have followed in America's footsteps and now are \n     coming together under shared principles of equality, respect, \n     and dignity for people with disabilities as entailed in the \n     CRPD. The U.S.--which was instrumental in negotiating the \n     CRPD--can continue to advance both its principles and issues \n     of practical accessibility for its citizens and all people \n     around the world, and by ratifying the treaty, so take its \n     rightful place of leadership in the arena of human rights.\n       As I continue my studies in the United States, it is a \n     great pleasure to now learn firsthand how the U.S. developed \n     such a comprehensive and strong system of protection for its \n     citizens with disabilities. I am so hopeful that you will \n     support ratification and allow others to benefit from these \n     triumphs. Thank you for your leadership.\n\n  That is a very moving letter from a man who risked his very life, a \nman who is blind but still risked his life for the freedom of others, \nincluding rights in his country for individuals with disabilities.\n  There is a letter we have from former Attorney General Dick \nThornburgh and White House Counsel Boyden Gray. They wrote to the \nForeign Relations Committee to address issues being raised by \nopponents, particularly homeschool advocates who believe parental \nrights to homeschool or make decisions for their children will be \nimpaired. I take it that my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, \naddressed this aspect of the concerns the homeschoolers have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I might just say to my colleague, the resolution \nactually does address it, but I have not, so I think it would be \nimportant, if the Senator wishes to address that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Here is what they wrote, the former Attorney General--I \nhave been blessed to live and know many Attorneys General, but I think \nall of us on both sides of the aisle would agree that Dick Thornburgh \nranks up there at the top. This is what they write concerning the issue \nof homeschooling:\n\n       Nothing in this treaty prevents parents from homeschooling \n     or making decisions for their children. This treaty embraces \n     IDEA, the ADA, and all of the disability nondiscrimination \n     legislation that has made the United States a leader on \n     disability rights. The specific provisions on women and \n     children state that women and children with disabilities \n     cannot be the victims of illegal discrimination--as is the \n     case under U.S. law. Furthermore, the CRPD recognizes and \n     protects the important role of the family and specifically \n     protects children from being separated from their parents on \n     the basis of a disability. We take a back seat to no one in \n     our defense of the rights of parents to raise their children \n     or in our support for our federalist system of government \n     with sovereignty at both the Federal and State levels of \n     government.\n\n  Some opponents are also suggesting that somehow the U.S. law or \nexisting parental rights would be impacted by supporting the treaty. \nAttorney General Thornburgh and White House Counsel Gray address this \nas well:\n\n       We understand that some are claiming that changes in U.S. \n     law would be necessary to implement the obligations the U.S. \n     will undertake as a result of ratifying the treaty, or that \n     the RUDs that the Senate will approve will not have the force \n     of law. Such claims are not correct and, quite simply, \n     extraordinary. When the U.S. Senate attaches conditions to \n     its consent to a treaty, they are binding on the President, \n     and the President cannot proceed to ratify a treaty without \n     giving them effect. The Senate has a long tradition of \n     careful consideration and frequent adoption of limited RUDs, \n     as is the case here. Any claims that such limited conditions \n     do not have the force of law, or are inconsistent with the \n     object and purpose of a treaty on disabilities that U.S. laws \n     inspired in the first place, is contrary to the long-held \n     position articulated by the Senate--regardless of which party \n     is in control (and in spite of whatever theories that may \n     momentarily exist in academic circles).\n       Administrations of both parties have also uniformly held \n     this view. In 1995 the U.S. stated that ``reservations are an \n     essential part of a State's consent to be bound. They cannot \n     simply be erased. This reflects the fundamental principle of \n     the law of treaties: obligation is based on consent. A State \n     which does not consent to a treaty is not bound by that \n     treaty. A State which expressly withholds its consent from a \n     provision cannot be presumed, on the basis of some legal \n     fiction, to be bound by it.''\n       Furthermore, the CRPD protects the critical role of the \n     family by specifically recognizing the role of parents in \n     raising children with disabilities, and prohibits the \n     dissolution or separation of families because one or both of \n     the parents are persons with disabilities. Article 23, \n     entitled ``Respect for home and family,'' provides that \n     ``children with disabilities have equal rights with respect \n     to family life,'' that nations ratifying the treaty have an \n     obligation to ``undertake to provide early and comprehensive \n     information, services, and support to children with \n     disabilities and their families, and that ``(i)in no case \n     shall a child be separated from parents on the basis of a \n     disability of either the child or one or both of the \n     parents.'' Finally, the CRPD will provide much-needed \n     protection in other countries where there is no provision for \n     birth certificates or birth registration for children with \n     disabilities. In particular, it will help protect against the \n     horrible practice of infanticide of children born with \n     disabilities--a practice that can be facilitated through the \n     denial of birth certificates or registration to disabled \n     babies.\n\n  Every action we have ever taken on disability policy has been \nbipartisan. Being able to live independently is a basic human dignity \nwe support, and it is a value we can help advance internationally by \nsupporting this treaty.\n  I would like to say in closing that I thank both of my colleagues, \nSenator Lugar and Senator Kerry.\n  I think we might think just for a moment, in conclusion, about the \nfact that there are various conflicts going on around the world. In \nSyria, we have seen 40,000 killed, and I don't know how many--100,000, \n200,000 who have been wounded, many of them innocent women and \nchildren, because of the ferocity and barbaric conduct of this \nconflict. I don't know how many people today in China are subject \nto infanticide because there is not a birth certificate available. And \nwe know that practice, not only in China but in other parts of the \nworld--a lot of it in Asia--goes on. We live in a very troubled and \nturbulent world. Not only will we have the normal, usual situation--and \nI mean normal--there are people who are born with disabilities from \ntime to time. I have had the honor of knowing children, as all of us \nhave, and there are no more loving and caring people in the world than \nour children and our citizens who have disabilities. There are going to \nbe a lot more because of the conflicts that are going on in various \nplaces in the world. They might deserve our special attention because \nthey are living in countries that will have a lot less of the rule of \nlaw, a lot\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\nless ability to care for them, particularly in the short term. Whether \nit be Libya, whether it be Syria, whether it be Iraq, or whether it be \nAfghanistan, all of these countries, we are going to have citizens who \nhave been the victims of the violence of war. I believe the best thing \nwe can do for them in the short term is take whatever action we can to \nsee that they are not discriminated against, that they receive the same \nprotections we guarantee our Americans with disabilities, and that they \nare afforded an opportunity to live full and beautiful lives.\n\n  Finally, I would like to say that my two friends and I have been \naround this place for quite a while--in the view of many, perhaps too \nlong--but the fact is that one of the highlights of our shared \nexperiences was on the lawn of the White House when a guy, Holmes \nTuttle--remember one of the leaders of the disabilities movement, Mr. \nTuttle--and others from the disabilities community were there, and the \nPresident of the United States at the time, President Herbert Walker \nBush, and our beloved Bob Dole were there. It was a great moment for \nall of us. It was a great moment for America. It was all of us doing \nsomething, contributing in a small way to make better the lives of \npeople who otherwise may have had great challenges in having the kinds \nof lives we want every American citizen to lead.\n  I believe that this treaty, this action is an adequate and important \nfollowup because I don't think there is anybody who denies--yes, there \nare problems with any legislation of the sweeping magnitude and scope \nof the ADA, but I don't know of anybody who doesn't believe it was a \nmagnificent success and an enormous contribution to making the lives of \nour citizens with disabilities better than they otherwise would have \nbeen. So wouldn't we want that same thing to happen to everyone in the \nworld? Wouldn't we want these children who are going through such \ndifficult times in their lives and wouldn't we want those who have been \nwounded and maimed to have an opportunity for a better life? Wouldn't \nwe want to, as Americans, be proud that we blazed the trail with the \nADA in a really remarkable shift and change and an act of almost \nmiraculous benefit to so many of our citizens, wouldn't we want that \nalso to apply to the other citizens of the world? I think most of us \nwould, and I think most of the American people who are paying attention \nto this believe that. That is why so many of our veterans organizations \nare in support. That is why so many in the disabilities community are \nin support. That is why there are so many charitable organizations that \nare in support.\n  So I again thank both of my colleagues and tell them that I certainly \nhope we can convince all of our colleagues that one of the nicest \nthings we could do as a Christmas present for people around the world \nis to ratify this treaty.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from Arizona. \nI thank him for his comments just now, but most importantly I really \nappreciate his extraordinary leadership on this issue and a lot of \nhuman rights issues, issues of conscience. He speaks with a very \nimportant voice, and I think he knows I am always happier when he is \nworking with me than against me on any issue on the floor. I know he \nused to pride himself in his fight occasionally with Senator Kennedy, \nbut he also prided himself enormously when they were able to get \ntogether and work together.\n  I have certainly enjoyed the many things Senator McCain and I have \ndone together--most notably, I think, joining hands across a certain \nbelief divide to help end the war in Vietnam, the real war that kept \nraging in the minds of a lot of people, and that was a 10-year journey \nwe made together. I am certainly proud of that and grateful to him.\n  But I want to come back to this treaty for a moment and Senator \nMcCain's efforts on it. I would say to my colleagues who have raised in \nthe minority report a couple of concerns--and none of us are dismissive \nof those concerns--every Senator has the right to express their \nbeliefs, but I can't think of a Senator more compelled. He has been the \nranking member and chair of the Armed Services Committee and for years \nhas been one of the leading voices on defense issues and now the \ndefense of our Nation. Everybody knows his record in terms of personal \nservice. I think there is no Senator who comes to the floor arguing \nmore consistently the prerogatives of the United States of America with \nrespect to defending our Nation and upholding the Constitution.\n  I would ask my colleagues who are finding some reason to doubt this \ntreaty or to have some sense that it presents a threat to our country \nto take appropriate note of Senator McCain's fervent commitment to this \nand to the comments he made about former Attorney General Dick \nThornburgh. I knew the Attorney General when he was Attorney General. I \nhave enormous respect for him and for his career, and I think Senator \nMcCain was 100 percent correct when he quoted him in the record as \nsaying that nothing in this treaty will require any initiative by the \nUnited States to change a law or to reduce any capacity of our courts \nto uphold the Constitution of the United States. I think he did an \nimportant service in his comments with respect to that. I thank him for \nhis contribution. Our fight is not over. We have some work to do in the \nnext days, and I look forward to working with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join the chairman in thanking John McCain \nfor his testimony, his courage, his eloquence, and his mention of those \non our side of the aisle who have historically fought for the disabled. \nThat is a very important fact today, and his presence, his strength and \ndetermination are very inspiring. We appreciate so much his support.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask \nthat time be logged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are in the process of considering the \nratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities. The United States has led the world in creating the legal \nframework, building an infrastructure and designing facilities that \nensure inclusion and opportunities for those living with disabilities.\n  This year the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, under the \nleadership of Chairman John Kerry and ranking minority member Senator \nRichard Lugar, celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act by favorably reporting the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities on a strong bipartisan basis. I want to \npersonally thank Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar for moving the treaty \nthrough the committee process. It was a hectic time--campaigns were \ngoing on--but they made a point of making certain we brought this issue \nforward.\n  A personal thanks to my friend Senator John McCain, who is on the \nSenate floor at this moment, for making this a bipartisan effort. I \nalso want to thank Senators Barrasso, Harkin, Tom Udall, Moran, and \nCoons for their bipartisan support and dedication to the passage and \nratification of this important treaty.\n  Now is the time for the full Senate to affirm our Nation's leadership \non disability issues by ratifying this important treaty. We should do \nso with the strong bipartisan support that has always characterized the \nefforts we have had on disabilities.\n  The support for this treaty is extremely broad and deep and \nbipartisan. It is supported by 165 disability organizations, including \nthe U.S. International Council on Disabilities, the American \nAssociation of People with Disabilities, the Disability Rights \nEducation and Defense Fund, and the National Disability Rights Network.\n  In addition, it is supported by 21 different veterans groups, \nincluding the Wounded Warrior Project, the American Legion, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  President George H.W. Bush, who signed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act into law, has called for ratification\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\nof this treaty. But there has been no more passionate advocate--and I \nam so honored that he would consider devoting his energies and good \nname to our effort for ratification of the treaty--than Senator Bob \nDole, a lifelong advocate for disability rights. We need to pass this \ntreaty in a tribute to Bob Dole for his life of service to the State of \nKansas and to the Nation, as well as his heroic efforts on behalf of \nthe disabled in the Senate.\n  These organizations and people of different backgrounds have come \ntogether to support ratification of the treaty because they know it is \ncritical for those living with disabilities in the United States and \naround the world. Thanks to the ADA and similar laws, the United States \nhas been so successful providing opportunities, accessibility, and \nprotection of the rights of those living with disabilities that our \nNation is already in full compliance with all terms of the treaty. \nBefore transmitting this treaty, the Obama administration conducted an \nexhaustive comparison of the treaty's requirements to current U.S. law. \nHere is what they found: The United States does not need to pass any \nnew laws or regulations in order to fully meet the terms of the treaty. \nThe fact that we have already met or exceeded the treaty's requirements \nis a testament to our Nation's commitment to equality and opportunity \nfor the disabled.\n  But there are still important reasons to ratify this treaty. There \nare more than 5\\1/2\\ million veterans living with disabilities in the \nUnited States. They travel all over the world, often with their \nfamilies. Ratifying this treaty will help move toward the day when \nwherever they travel they will be treated with accessibility, with the \nkind of respect that every person would expect to have in traveling \naround the world.\n  Ratifying this treaty will also give the United States a seat at an \ninternational table that we currently can't occupy. The United States \ncan sit at the table on disability rights worldwide and provide \nguidance and expertise based on our experience and leadership. It just \nstands out like a sore thumb our country hasn't ratified this treaty \nwhen over 120 other nations have.\n  This treaty would also level the playing field for American \nbusinesses. American businesses have invested time and resources to \ncomply with the ADA. Businesses in some countries are not required to \ncomply with similar standards. Compliance with the treaty levels the \nplaying field by requiring foreign businesses to meet accessibility \nstandards similar to those of the United States. It will open new \nmarkets for new technologies when it comes to disability.\n  Mr. President, I know you have been a visitor at Walter Reed and \nBethesda Naval Center, and you have seen our returning veterans, many \nwho come home after losing a limb. They go through a period of the best \nrehabilitation, and then they are brought into a laboratory with the \nlatest technology.\n  A new Congresswoman from Illinois, named Tammy Duckworth--I am so \nproud of her election victory on November 6--lost both legs in Iraq \nwhen she was piloting a helicopter that was shot down. She was a member \nof the Illinois National Guard, and there was a question whether she \nwould even survive the terrible incident where a rocket-propelled \ngrenade was fired into the fuselage of her helicopter. She survived and \nhas since used Walter Reed Hospital and Bethesda to make certain that \nshe has the very best new prosthetic legs. They were good enough to \ncarry her through a campaign successfully, and now she will be sworn in \nto the U.S. House of Representatives in just a few weeks.\n\n  That kind of technology is being developed for our veterans, as it \nshould be. Ultimately, it will be available to everyone across the \nUnited States and around the world. As companies make this new \ntechnology enabling amputees a full life, this technology becomes a \npart of the export of the United States. So there are opportunities \nhere for the United States, as other countries comply with the treaty \nand develop new prosthetics and other things for their disabled, to \nhave some business opportunities with new and good ideas. American \nbusinesses will be able to export their expertise and their products in \nnew markets serving the hundreds of millions of people living with \ndisabilities around the world.\n  Let me tell you why it is important for us, even though our standards \nare good and high in helping the disabled, to worry about those with \ndisabilities in other countries. There are estimates that 10 percent of \nthe world's population lives with disabilities. Not only do these \npeople courageously live each day, they live with many challenges and \nhurdles that could be removed with the right laws and policies that are \ncontained in this convention.\n  It is hard to believe, but 90 percent of children with disabilities \nin developing countries never attend school. Less than 25 percent of \nthe countries in the United Nations have passed laws to even prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. Studies indicate that women \nand girls in developing countries are more likely than men to have a \ndisability.\n  Unemployment is dramatically higher for those living in other \ncountries with disabilities. This treaty will help provide the \nframework so countries around the world can help their own citizens \nwith disabilities live productive, healthy lives. Just like we did by \nenacting the ADA 22 years ago, ratifying this treaty will send the \nworld a message that people with disabilities deserve a level playing \nfield.\n  While this treaty will ensure inclusion and access for those living \nwith disabilities, it is also important to note what the treaty will \nnot do. The treaty will not require the United States to appropriate \nany new funding or resources to comply with its terms--not a single \ndollar. The treaty will not change any U.S. law or compromise U.S. \nsovereignty. The treaty will not lead to any new lawsuits because its \nterms do not create any new rights, and it cannot be enforced in any \nU.S. court. For families who choose to educate their children at home, \nthe treaty will not change any of the current rights and obligations \nunder American law. I was pleased that in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee they adopted an amendment I worked on with Senator DeMint, a \nbipartisan amendment, to further clarify this issue.\n  I also want to address the issue of abortion, which was raised \nyesterday by one of our former colleagues. Leading pro-life groups, \nsuch as the National Right to Life Committee, confirm the treaty does \nnot promote, expand access or create any right to an abortion.\n  When we tried to move this treaty earlier this year, some objected on \nthe basis the Senate shouldn't ratify a treaty during a lameduck \nsession. Well, we did a little study. I want to note for the record \nthat since 1970, in the last 42 years the Senate has ratified at least \n19 treaties during lameduck sessions. There is no procedural or \nsubstantive justification for not ratifying this treaty which has broad \nbipartisan support and could mean so much to those living with \ndisabilities.\n  Thanks to decades of bipartisan cooperation, our country embodies the \nworldwide gold standard for those living with disabilities.\n  In closing, I again salute Senator Bob Dole. He has been on the phone \nand working it, and I hope in tribute to his Senate career we will \nratify this treaty.\n  I also want to salute a former colleague of mine from the U.S. House \nof Representatives, Tony Coelho. Tony was the whip of the Democratic \ncaucus when I was first elected, and he has been an amazing advocate \nfor the disabled throughout his public career in the House and ever \nsince. He came to me and asked to help in this effort, and I was happy \nto say yes to Tony, as I did so many times when I served with him in \nthe House.\n  I want to add one other person--Marca Bristo. Marca is the leading \ndisability advocate in the city of Chicago. This wonderful young woman \nwas tireless in her wheelchair, wheeling from office to office, begging \nMembers and their staffs to consider voting for this treaty. If and \nwhen we pass it--and I hope that is soon--I am going to remember Marca \nand Tony, and certainly Senator Dole, for all the work they put into \nthis.\n  When the Senate ratifies this treaty, we can be proud our coworkers, \nfriends, family members, and courageous veterans will soon enjoy the \nsame access and opportunity when they travel abroad that they have come \nto expect right here in the United States.\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to \nvote for the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities.\n  I have the honor of serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nand was present during the hearings we had with regard to the \nratification of the treaty. I listened to the witnesses who testified \nand listened to all the arguments that always have been made about \ntreaties. I must tell you, it was overwhelmingly supportive of the \nratification of the treaty.\n  I want to acknowledge the work of Senator Lugar, who is on the floor. \nHe has been a real champion on basic human rights issues and advancing \nit through treaties on which the United States has taken leadership. I \napplaud his unstinting commitment to advancing the rights of people \nwith disabilities.\n  I also want to acknowledge our chairman Senator Kerry, and the work \nhe has done in regard to this treaty; Senator Harkin, and many others, \nhave been involved in the United States' participation in this treaty. \nTo put it directly, we were responsible for this treaty moving forward \nbecause the United States has been in the leadership of protecting \npeople with disabilities. The way we treat people with disabilities is \na civil rights/human rights issue.\n  We know the history of America was not always what it is today, and \nwe know the struggles people with disabilities have had in getting \naccess to services that we sometimes take for granted.\n  Many years ago I visited our State institution for children with \ndevelopmental disabilities. I saw in one large room literally 100 \nchildren receiving no care at all, most of them not clothed. I knew we \ncould do better in this country, and today our access to health \nservices for people with disabilities is remarkably better.\n  I remember when if you had a physical disability and were confined to \na wheelchair, it was basically impossible to get use of public \ntransportation. We have changed those policies in our country, \nrecognizing that every American has the right to basic services. I \nremember when it was difficult for people to get public education in \ntraditional schools if they had disabilities. We have changed those \nlaws in America. We have changed our public accommodation laws. We have \nchanged our employment laws. We have led the world in saying that it is \na basic right, and people with disabilities have the same protections \nas every one of us.\n  I am proud of the progress we have made here in the United States. I \nwas part of the Congress in 1990 that passed the Americans With \nDisabilities Act. I am very proud to be part of the Congress that \npassed that law. I remember two of our colleagues who have been in the \nforefront of this work: Senator Dole, whose name has been mentioned, \nhas been one of the great leaders in this body in protecting the rights \nof people with disabilities, and Congressman Tony Coelho, with whom I \nserved in the other body, the House, took on a leadership position to \nbring to the public attention for us to do what was right for people \nwith disabilities.\n  The United States has provided international leadership. The year \nafter we passed the Americans With Disabilities Act, my colleague in \nthe House, Congressman Steny Hoyer, took that effort in the United \nStates internationally. In 1991, in the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, we passed the Declaration on the Rights of \nPersons With Disabilities because of the U.S. leadership. It is now \nknown as the Moscow Document. We have provided international \naspirations to make sure that we treat people with disabilities as we \nwould treat anyone else.\n  We have in America the strongest protections of any country. We have \nimproved our laws. We have led the world in providing the right legal \nframework, the right policies, and the right programs so people with \ndisabilities can gain access to all services.\n  The ratification of this treaty is particularly important to the \nUnited States. I say that because it further demonstrates our \nleadership on this issue. We have added language in this treaty; we \ndon't have to change any laws if we ratified this treaty. We are in \nfull compliance. There is no need for America to take any further \nsteps. All this treaty ratification does is reaffirm America's \nleadership on this issue and provides protection for our citizens \ninternationally. We made that very clear with amendments we added to \nthis treaty during the committee markup. We don't have to change any \nlaws. Yet it helps U.S. citizens abroad. The rights of the disabled \nshould not end at our border. They should have the same protections \nwhen they travel to another country or when they work in another \ncountry or when they temporarily live in another country. We want to \nmake sure American citizens are treated fairly.\n  A witness testified at our hearing on the ratification of this treaty \nabout how she was in a wheelchair in another country and she was not \npermitted to use her wheelchair to get access to an airplane. That is \nwrong. This treaty will protect an American who happens to be in \nanother country and who happens to have a disability to make sure that \nperson can get reasonable access to transportation, reasonable access \nto public accommodations, and that the person is not discriminated \nagainst because of her or his disability. This helps advance globally \nthe basic human rights of people with disabilities. Other countries \nwill learn from the United States. Until we ratify, we can't \nparticipate in the international discussions taking place to protect \npeople with disabilities. Yet we have the most advanced laws. By our \nratification of this treaty, we are in a position to help other \ncountries advance the rights of people with disabilities, and that is \nexactly what we should be doing in America.\n\n  Our Nation was founded on the principle that we are all created equal \nand each of us has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness regardless of our abilities. Ratifying this treaty is a \nstrong act of diplomacy and a symbol of America's continued commitment \nto equal justice for all. The history of our Nation has been the \ncontinued expansion of rights, opportunities, and responsibilities to \nmore and more Americans. It is in our interests and in the interests of \nall humankind to see that the expansion happens in other countries as \nwell.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to vote for the ratification of this \ntreaty. It is the right vote to take for the United States. Standing up \nfor basic human rights is right. It is right to protect our citizens \nwhen they travel internationally. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nratification.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        House and Senate Action\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I just wished to address two things. \nThe first is that we are having a continuing discussion about the \nbudget of our country and about the taxes of our country and indeed \nabout the unfair and often upside down nature of our current Tax Code \nthat allows people making hundreds of millions of dollars a year to pay \na lower tax rate than a family who earns $100,000 a year.\n  In the context of that discussion, there is one thing that I think we \ncan do right now that would be important and helpful to the vast \nmajority of Americans, indeed to 98 percent of American families and 97 \npercent of American small businesses; that is, to assure them that \ntheir taxes are not going to go up on January 1.\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\n  Assuming we cannot get to a budget agreement before January, then \nautomatically all the Bush tax cuts will end. The Senate has actually \npassed a law that will allow those tax cuts to be curtailed, to be \nprotected for families who earn $250,000 a year and less. That bill has \npassed the Senate. It is now over at the House awaiting action by the \nHouse.\n  The Republican-controlled House is in a position, anytime the Speaker \nchooses to call up that bill, to pass a guarantee of protection from \ntax increases that will protect 98 percent of American families and 97 \npercent of American small businesses. I think they should do that. It \nis simply awaiting their action. There is nothing more we can do in the \nSenate. We have already passed that bill. It is one step away--Speaker \nBoehner allowing it to be called up and having it voted on--from \nbecoming law and protecting 98 percent of families and 97 percent of \nsmall businesses from a tax increase on January 1.\n  There is a real likelihood we will have to go beyond January 1 \nbecause so many of our colleagues have sworn that oath to Grover \nNorquist that they will not let taxes go up. He maintains the Bush tax \ncuts should last into eternity and anything above that would be a tax \nincrease and violate the pledge.\n  So we may have to wait until January 1, until the actual expiration \nof the Bush tax cuts vitiates that baseline and allows Republicans to \nenter into the very same deal they could have before, only now it is a \ntax decrease from the current rate that would presumably not get them \nin trouble with Mr. Norquist versus a tax increase from his--I think at \nthis point--illogical and irrational projection of the Bush tax cuts \ninto the indefinite future. So I call on our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives to pass that bill and give the vast majority of \nAmericans relief from whatever uncertainty there might be about going \nbeyond the January 1 deadline.\n  The second issue I wished to address is to respond briefly to my \nfriend from Arizona Senator Kyl, who spoke about the filibuster and the \nrules changes that are being discussed in this Chamber. He spoke this \nmorning. I had the chance to watch a good part of his remarks on the \ntelevision.\n  I wanted to respond in a couple ways. First of all, I have the \nhighest regard for Senator Kyl. We worked closely together trying to \nget a cyber security compromise. We worked together years ago on the \nimmigration compromise. I have seen him in action on the Senate floor. \nHe is very able. When he has reached an agreement with his colleagues, \nhe is unshakeable and his word is good. I think very highly of him, \nalthough we do not agree politically on a great number of issues.\n  But I did, in an atmosphere of great respect for him, wish to respond \nin a couple ways. The first is that I believe, at least, that there is \na difference between what we are considering with this rules change and \nthe so-called nuclear option that was threatened were respect to \njudges.\n  The reason I think that is the case is that I have read the old \nopinions from previous Presiding Officers in the Senate and Vice \nPresidents in the past who have said that the way the Senate rules work \nis that although we are a continuing body, the way in which the rules \ncontinue from Senate to Senate is that we are impliedly readopting the \nrules as soon as we take any business under the rules each new session.\n  The House behaves differently. The House has new rules each session. \nIt is an entirely new reelected body each session. So they have to open \nby creating a new set of rules and adopting them. They do that at the \nbeginning of every session. We virtually never do that. The rules \ncontinue. How is it that the rules continue? The ruling is that that \ncontinue because they are deemed to continue as soon as the Senate \ntakes action under those rules, whatever it is. As soon as they take \naction under those rules at the beginning of a session, those rules are \nthen deemed to be back in place, and we do not need to readopt them.\n  But that does mean, at the beginning of each session, there is an \nopportunity, under the Constitution, to change the rules by a simple \nparliamentary majority of 51. I do not think that is breaking the rules \nto change the rules. That is part of the rule. That is how the rules \nactually work in the Senate, at least that is my belief and my opinion.\n  Given that, I think arguing that this is somehow breaking the rules \nor the same as the nuclear option is not quite accurate. This and the \nnuclear option share the similarity of allowing the Senate to proceed \nwith a simple majority. They do share that similarity. But this is \ndifferent because we can only do that one early, first moment, as each \nnew Senate comes into session. Some could say that is actually there as \na safety valve for situations just like this where one party is \nconsistently, regularly determinedly abusing a rule, but because the \nother party cannot get to 67 votes, they cannot change or correct the \nrule to restore the Senate to its proper behavior.\n  I would note that I think there is virtually nobody in this Chamber \nwho thinks the Senate is operating the way the Senate should. We have \nhad literally hundreds of filibusters, and they are not the old-\nfashioned filibuster people remember from ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington,'' when Senator Jefferson Smith stood at a desk, probably \nabout there in their mockup of the Senate floor, and talked himself to \nexhaustion, reading from the Bible, reading from the Constitution. He \nmay have even read from the dictionary. I remember there was an old \nreporter up in the press gallery speaking about this. He talked about \nit being one of the great examples of American democracy, one lone \nSenator able to speak until he is exhausted on a point that matters to \nhim.\n\n  People may have been frustrated by that kind of filibuster, but there \nwas at least a kind of nobility to it. The filibuster of today is very \ndifferent. It is a threat from the minority party to bombard something \nwith amendments so it cannot be managed on the floor. It is a threat to \nfilibuster, to which the majority leader has to respond by filing \ncloture, and when the majority leader is forced to file cloture, the \nminority gets the benefit. They get 30 hours of debate.\n  Of course, as we have seen in the Senate, that 30 hours of debate is \nnever used. It just consumes 30 hours of floor time, most of it spent, \nas the distinguished Presiding Officer and I and others who preside in \nthe Senate notice, in quorum calls, in endless deadly quorum calls with \nthe poor old clerk having to call off the names slowly and quietly in \nthe Chamber and nothing going on.\n  People who are looking at this on C-SPAN and who dial into the Senate \nvery often see that nothing is going on. That nothing going on is \nusually the hallmark of the modern filibuster. It is a colossal waste \nof time. It is intended to be a colossal waste of time. Because if we \ndo that hundreds of times, as our minority has, multiply those hundreds \nof filibusters by 30 hours each, and they have ruined thousands of \nhours of Senate floor time.\n  That disables this institution, and it puts the majority under \nimmense pressure to do the basic business of passing appropriations \nbills, the very simple operations of government. Very often we hear our \ncolleagues on the other side criticize that we have not passed those. \nThose are complaints that are made with real crocodile tears because it \nis the consistent, relentless filibuster that puts the Senate in a \nposition where it does not have floor time to do that work.\n  I think, first of all, that what we are proposing is slightly \ndifferent than the nuclear option, even though it shares that \ncharacteristic of getting to 51 votes, that it is unique to the rule \nfunction of the Senate, that it happens just that once, and that one \ncould argue it is a safety valve that protects against situations like \nthis.\n  My second point is this is not a good situation for the Senate. We \nwaste immense amounts of time. The filibuster is used constantly. It \nused to be that Senators filibustered bills that they violently \nopposed. Now the minority filibusters everything. How often have we had \nthe experience that something is filibustered and we finally break the \nfilibuster and when we actually get to the vote on the actual merits of \nthe bill, it passes with 95 or 98 Senators supporting it.\n  What do we conclude if you filibuster something that 98 percent of \nSenators are going to support when it finally gets to the floor? We can \nonly conclude\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\nthat it is being used to obstruct and delay. There is too much of that. \nWe have too much business to be done. So I do not think there is \nanybody who can say the Senate is working in a way that it should under \nthe present practices. If it takes changing a rule to change those \npractices, I think it will be better for everyone.\n  I also wish to point out that nobody is saying there should be an end \nto the filibuster. What we are saying is those who want to filibuster \nshould carry the burden of being on the floor expressing their concerns \nand actually doing the filibuster. It is one of the great frustrations \nof those who have to defend against the filibuster that very often the \nmembers of the minority party do not even have to show up for the vote. \nThe rule of the filibuster is that we have to get to 60 votes or it \nfails.\n  Whether the vote is 60 to 1 or 60 to 40 does not matter. So we get \nthrown into having to show up and vote on filibusters, and the minority \nparty does not even have to be here. We have heard a Senator say: Well, \nyou know, you guys, you will be here on Monday because you have this \nvote you have to take. But we do not have to be here, so I am not \ncoming back.\n  We have had Senators who have actually forced a vote on cloture \nthemselves go away when it came time for the vote, go home, and the \nrest of us had to be here to do it at that point. The filibuster is \njust being used to harass colleagues and to create difficulty, and I \nthink that is a real problem and that it is worth pressing through it.\n  Another concern that Senator Kyl raised is that people's voices would \nbe silenced if the majority leader had the authority to go directly to \na bill without allowing for amendments. Two points on that: First, I, \nfor one, am perfectly open to a rule change that provides for some kind \nof an amendment process. As the majority leader said earlier, we have \nour proposal out there, where is yours? If we are going to negotiate, \nmake a counterproposal. If the counterproposal contains a requirement \nthat certain amendments be considered, a certain number of amendments--\ngermane amendments, one would hope--I think that is something that a \ngreat number of Senators on our side would look at with sympathy and, \nperhaps, with approval.\n  That is an argument. I don't think it is a sufficient one because I \ndo believe we can address that question, every question.\n  I would conclude, because I see the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire here, that I think this is an issue we can work out and that \nwe can work out together. I think we can make the Senate a better \nplace, a place where there is more actual debate and more progress and \nmore gets accomplished rather than just this relentless filibuster, \nthis filibuster at all times, of all bills, all appointments, over and \nover, nonstop, completely jamming up this body and creating these \nenormous periods of delay while we go through procedural hoops and \naround procedural circles. We should be better than this, and the \nAmerican people deserve better than this.\n  I hope this discussion about changing the rules moves us from where \nwe are right now--which is just wrong; it just isn't working--to a \nplace where we can be a Senate again that requires people who want to \nfilibuster to get up on their feet in this Chamber and say what they \nhave to say until they are exhausted. So be it. I think that would be \nan improvement on the matters where I would feel strongly enough to \nfilibuster, and I am confident that I would be willing to take that \nstep in the event we were someday in the minority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes on \nthe topic of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today as not just the Member from \nDelaware but also as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nto speak to the topic before us of the convention and whether the \nUnited States should ratify a convention on the rights of persons with \ndisabilities.\n  Our country has long been a global leader in recognizing and \nprotecting the basic rights, the human rights of all people, including \nthose with disabilities, and of working hard to be at the forefront of \na global movement to improve access to the basic and essential aspects \nof productive daily life for those with disabilities. Today we have the \nopportunity to help extend those rights, the same rights that disabled \nAmericans have to other people around the world. If we have that \nopportunity to promote freedom and human rights, why wouldn't we ensure \nthese protections that apply to Americans apply to them abroad as well \nand to others, some of the nearly 1 billion fellow citizens of the \nworld who live with disabilities.\n  This treaty that is before us today was adopted by the United Nations \nin 2006 with 153 nations as signatories and so far 116 as ratifying \nparties. It has been 6 long years that the United States has not joined \nas a ratifying party. This treaty has passed with strong bipartisan \nsupport through the Foreign Relations Committee by a vote we took back \nin July after hearings, and it is been nearly 6 months since that vote. \nYet this treaty, sadly, faces opposition on the floor of the Senate.\n  This Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was \nnegotiated during the Bush administration, and it enjoys strong \nbipartisan support. I am proud to join Senators McCain, Barrasso, \nMoran, Durbin, Harkin, Udall, and many others who have been advocating \nfor its passage since March. It would, as has been said, not require \nany changes to U.S. law and would have no impact on our Federal budget. \nIt would instead promote U.S. business interests by creating a level \nplaying field for U.S. companies by equalizing accessibility \nrequirements that foreign businesses must meet, and it would create new \nmarkets for innovative U.S. businesses with expertise in standards and \ntechnologies that would help ease the lives of those with disabilities. \nAt least as importantly, it would promote access, mobility, and \ninclusion for disabled Americans abroad, especially wounded veterans.\n  Last but not least, it would protect the right of families to \nhomeschool their children if they choose to do so, a topic on which my \noffice received many concerned calls from constituents. We heard \ndirectly from the Justice Department during our hearing on the Foreign \nRelations Committee on this convention that ratification of this treaty \nwill not in any way erode the rights of parents with disabled children \nto educate their children at home if they so choose.\n  In short, Mr. President, ratification only benefits the United States \nand protects Americans. The world has long looked to us as a global \nleader, as a moral compass, as a defender of freedom and human rights. \nIn my view, we owe a great debt to many who have served in this Chamber \nbefore us, including, principally among them, Senator Bob Dole, who, \nalong with many others, led the initial fight for the ratification of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  The least we can do for people with disabilities all around the world \nis to step to the plate, to ratify this Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities without delay. It is my hope this Senate, in \na bipartisan way, can come together in the spirit of unity to protect \ndignity and human rights for all.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the ratification of \nthis most important treaty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor about 5 minutes on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I am here to join my colleagues, as I had the great \npleasure of being in the chair for a while this afternoon to hear some \nof the expression of support for the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities. It was very eloquent, and it was bipartisan. \nI begin by thanking Senators Kerry and Lugar for their efforts in the \nForeign Relations Committee to not only pass the treaty in committee \nbut to bring it to the Senate floor for this consideration.\n  I certainly support ratification of the Disabilities Convention \nbecause it is\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\nthe right thing to do and because it puts the United States back where \nwe belong: as leaders of the international community and defending, \nprotecting, and promoting the quality of rights of all people in our \nworld, regardless of their situation. From equality and \nnondiscrimination to equal recognition before the law, to access to \njustice, this convention touches on all these issues that Americans \nhave long held near and dear to our hearts.\n  Ratifying this convention would reaffirm our leadership, leadership \nthat was established under the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act \nlegislation that this Congress passed in 1990. This was the first of \nits kind, domestic legislation that addressed the barriers faced by \nindividuals with disabilities. It sent a message to the world that we \nwould support the principles of equal treatment and nondiscrimination \nwith respect to those with disabilities.\n  I want to recognize Senator Tom Harkin for his leadership in getting \nthat legislation passed, and it had strong bipartisan support when it \nwas passed back in 1990. That legislation still stands as a model for \nthose who want to replicate our commitments and defend the rights of \nthe disabled in their countries.\n  I have had a personal opportunity to see what a difference the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act could make in the lives of people, to \nsee the impact this convention could have around the world, because I \ngrew up before ADA was passed and my grandmother was disabled. She \ncouldn't speak or hear. I remember in those days, when she would come \nto visit us--which wasn't very often because she lived a long way \naway--we didn't have any technology to allow her to watch television or \nto answer the phone, the kind of technology that now is available as \nthe result of passing the ADA, technology that I would hope, along with \nthe human rights that come with passing this convention, will soon be \navailable to people in all parts of the world.\n  We in the United States are already the gold standard when it comes \nto defending the rights of the disabled. So why would we not want to \ndemonstrate to the world our intention to continue to fight for those \nless fortunate?\n  This treaty is not only about ending discrimination against people \nwith disabilities around the world, it is also about protecting the \nmillions of U.S. citizens who travel or live abroad. Ratification will \nprovide the United States with a platform from which we can encourage \nother countries to adopt and implement the convention standards and to \nwork to end discrimination against people with disabilities.\n  Let me just respond to some of the concerns we have heard, and some \nof these have been addressed already. I want to talk about what the \ntreaty does not do.\n  It in no way, shape, or form infringes on America's sovereignty as a \nnation. It does absolutely nothing to change American law. The treaty \ndoesn't impose any legal obligations on the United States, and these \nfacts were confirmed by the U.S. Department of Justice during our \nconsideration of the measure.\n  The convention has overwhelming support from across the political \nspectrum. Over 165 disability organizations support the treaty, as do \n21 major veterans and military service organizations, including the \nVFW, the American Legion, and the Wounded Warrior Project. I can't \nimagine why, at a time when more of our warriors are returning home \nwith injuries and disabilities, we would not want to stand in support \nof ensuring their rights and protections at home and around the globe.\n  In closing, I want to quote from John Lancaster, who is a disabled \nveteran and the former executive director of the National Council on \nIndependent Living, which is one of the oldest disability grassroots \norganizations run by and for people with disabilities. Mr. Lancaster \ntestified at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in support of the \ntreaty. I think his message was one of the most powerful, and it is one \nthat I hope all of our colleagues will heed in thinking about \nconsideration of this treaty.\n  At the hearing he said:\n\n       I'm appalled with some of the conversation that has been \n     going on here today.\n\n  He was referring to some of the testimony at that hearing. He said:\n\n       As a veteran and as someone who volunteered, laid my life \n     on the line for freedom, rights, dignity, and now, to have \n     this whole debate that we're not willing . . . to walk the \n     talk in international circles? To step up in a forum where \n     they advocate these things and to say ``We're not afraid to \n     sign this thing?''\n       We aspire to what's in this convention. This is what we are \n     about as a nation--including people, giving them freedom, \n     giving them rights, giving them the opportunity to work, to \n     learn, to participate. Isn't that what we're about? Isn't \n     that what we want the rest of the world to be about? Well, if \n     we aren't willing to say this is a good thing and to say it \n     formally, what are we about, really?\n\n  I think Mr. Lancaster put it very powerfully, and I couldn't agree \nmore with his assessment. This is exactly what we are about as a \nnation. We should ratify this treaty. We should remind the world why \ndefending the rights of the disabled is a principle that should be at \nthe heart of every civil society.\n  Mr. President, I hope when we get to the vote on this convention we \nwill see the required votes to ratify this treaty and send to the \nentire world Mr. Lancaster's message.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the 112th Congress returns after the \nelection, we should consider this important question: Have we done our \nshare to help prevent gun violence? Statistics from the Brady Campaign \nto Prevent Gun Violence give a clear answer--no. Almost 100,000 people \ndie as the result of gun violence in America every single year. This \nstatistic includes 12,000 people who are murdered, 18,000 who commit \nsuicide, and 20,000 under the age of 20. On average, 270 people are \nshot in the United States every single day.\n  Our society faces an epidemic of gun violence. Consider stories that \nhave gone largely unreported in recent months: Near Chicago, a 16-year-\nold was shot twice in the head while riding in a car on her way home. A \nstaff member on a prominent university's medical campus accidentally \ndischarged his handgun at work and injured two people. And on election \nday, a parolee in California walked into the plant where he worked, \nmethodically murdered two of his coworkers, and wounded another two \nbefore shooting himself.\n  Stories like these flash across newspapers for a few days or weeks, \nand then the national spotlight moves on. But we cannot forget that \nwhile reporters may leave, the tragic effects of gun violence linger. \nThey forever alter the lives of good, talented young people, like \nAshley Moser, who lost her 6-year-old daughter in the horrific movie \ntheater attack in Aurora, CO. She is partially paralyzed now and faces \nsignificant health problems and medical bills. But even after this \nnightmare, Congress did nothing to prevent guns from falling into the \nhands of would-be killers.\n  Congress has the power to act to prevent more of these tragedies. We \ncan take up and pass legislation like S.32, which would prohibit the \npurchase of the same types of high-capacity magazines that allowed the \nshooter in Aurora to hurt so many people, so quickly. We could enact \nS.35, the Gun Show Loophole Act of 2011, which would close the ``gun \nshow loophole'' by requiring\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nall gun sellers at gun shows to conduct a Brady criminal background \ncheck on prospective purchasers. We could take up and pass S.34, the \nDenying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2011, \nwhich would close the ``terror gap'' by authorizing the Attorney \nGeneral to deny the transfer of a firearm when an FBI background check \nreveals that the prospective purchaser is a known or suspected \nterrorist. These are commonsense measures that would protect the \nAmerican people by reducing firearm violence in our society.\n  Mr. President, it was over a month ago that a woman named Nina \nGonzalez stood at the second Presidential debate and asked President \nObama and Governor Romney a simple question: What would they do to keep \nassault weapons out of the hands of criminals?\n  So, as the 112th Congress returns, we have some important unfinished \nbusiness. There are few tasks before us more important than enacting \nmeasures that would help prevent tragedies like the ones occurring far \ntoo often around our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6940-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Sergeant Joseph A. Richardson\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Nation has lost a brave patriot who \ndied defending freedom. Sergeant Joseph A. Richardson, who grew up in \nAlgona, IA, was killed during a patrol in Paktika province, Afghanistan \non November 16, 2012. He was clearly an accomplished, professional \nsoldier as evidenced by his numerous awards, including: the Bronze Star \nMedal, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with \nCampaign Star Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, \nNATO Ribbon, and the Combat Infantry Badge.\n  SGT Richardson's family released a statement that described Joe as \nsomeone who ``lived his life full of energy and with passion for \neverything he did.'' They also said that, ``He loved his job; he loved \nfighting for his country and our freedom.'' In fact, he demonstrated \nthis by re-enlisting for six more years in the Army shortly before his \nuntimely death. His love of country and willingness to serve marks \nJoseph Richardson as one of our nation's finest citizens, and his noble \nsacrifice immortalizes him among the ranks of our most honored war \ndead. We owe SGT Richardson and all those like him who have fallen in \nthe name of liberty our infinite gratitude.\n  We ought also to remember his family in our prayers, including his \nwife Ashley, his mother, Ginette, his father, Greg, and many other \nfamily and friends who will feel his loss very deeply. As those closest \nto Joseph Richardson remember the life of their loved one, it is \nincumbent on all Americans to preserve his memory and to reflect on the \nenormous price he and other like him have paid to preserve our free way \nof life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6940-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6940-S6942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VERMONT'S CITIZEN OF THE YEAR, ANTONIO POMERLEAU\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce will \nrecognize the philanthropic contributions of a longtime Vermonter: \nAntonio Pomerleau. Businessman, community developer, humanitarian all \nthese terms apply to one of Vermont's most celebrated citizens. As I \nsaid in a statement to the Senate earlier this month, Marcelle and I \nare also fortunate to call him family.\n  But Tony's family extends beyond the Pomerleaus. It has come to \nencompass the State of Vermont, and his generosity has touched the \nlives of thousands of Vermonters.\n  This weekend, The Burlington Free Press published a story about \nTony's legacy. His is a quintessential success story. From stockboy to \neconomic magnet, Tony has become one of Vermont's most prominent \nbusinessmen. Along the way, he has donated millions of his own money to \nhelp Vermonters recover in the wake of such natural disasters as \nTropical Storm Irene, to help renovate and restore mobile home parks \nfor residents, and, notably, to celebrate the contributions and \nsacrifices of the many members of the Vermont National Guard and their \nfamilies.\n  Few Vermonters have had such a footprint on Vermont's economic and \nsocial landscape. Antonio Pomerleau's contributions make him a \nVermonter of the Year in 2012, but his legacy will benefit generations \nof Vermonters to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that The Burlington Free Press article, \n``Tony Pomerleau: The Art of the Dealmaker,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [The Burlington Free Press, Nov. 25, 2012]\n\n                Tony Pomerleau: The Art of the Dealmaker\n\n                           (By Candace Page)\n\n       Newport--Tony Pomerleau leans on his cane and steps into \n     Mill River Furniture on Main Street, just in time for its \n     grand opening ceremony. A dozen people converge on him, \n     filings drawn to a magnet.\n       The mayor greets him. City councilors introduce themselves. \n     Two local reporters quiz him about the fate of the city's \n     only grocery store if plans go forward to redevelop his strip \n     mall into a hotel and convention center. The head of the \n     downtown association calls him over for a ribbon-cutting \n     photo. ``We need you Tony, right in the middle,'' she says.\n       The 95-year-old, white-maned shopping center king of \n     Vermont is in his element, back in his native town with a \n     captive audience. He holds court for nearly an hour while the \n     furniture store owner whose event this is left in the \n     background.\n       ``I was 12 when I started work here,'' Pomerleau begins by \n     recalling his days as a stockboy and window dresser when this \n     building was a J.J. Newberry's five-and-dime. ``I had a knack \n     for windows. This is where I started my success. I learned \n     the customer has to see the merchandise if you want to \n     sell.''\n       Today, he owns the building. ``I put $400,000 into it to \n     fix it up,'' he says, his words carrying the French-Canadian \n     inflection he has never lost.\n       He jokes that store owner Skip Gray was ``kinda chicken'' \n     about moving to Main Street from a much smaller store in the \n     Pomerleau shopping center. His eyes sparkle. He laughs along \n     with the audience at his own jokes.\n       In a voice graveled by age, he detours into stories that \n     have become his stock in trade. The anecdotes reel off as if \n     from a tape recorder, told and retold in almost exactly the \n     same words.\n       ``It's not what you pay for something, it's what you can \n     get for it,'' he tells the cluster of people, citing a real \n     estate deal 40 years in the past. ``I made $237,000 in 90 \n     days'' he says of a tract of farmland bought, subdivided and \n     sold for three times what he paid.\n       He laments the just-announced closing of the Eveready \n     battery plant in St. Albans. The company's problem, he says \n     with finality, is that they didn't change with the times by \n     developing new products.\n       ``You gotta do something different from the other fellow,'' \n     he says. ``There's a time limit on everything--except me.'' \n     The line draws a chuckle from his clutch of listeners, as it \n     always does.\n       Grace, the youngest of Pomerleau's 10 children, glances up \n     from browsing among bedroom sets.\n       ``He does love an audience,'' she says.\n       `See the smoke coming out?'\n       On a late November night, the outside of Pomerleau's big \n     house on DeForest Heights in Burlington is a neon carnival of \n     Christmas.\n       Light-bulb-lit reindeer charge across the west lawn pulling \n     a sleigh of presents. Shoulder-high candy canes stick from \n     the north lawn. Christmas lights cling to the eaves and \n     swathe the trees in all directions.\n       Pomerleau opens the door for guests and pads down a hallway \n     in his slippers to point through the windows of his home \n     office.\n       ``That's a new one this year,'' he says with childlike \n     pleasure, pointing to a lighted train on the north lawn.\n       ``See, the wheels go around,'' he says, as lights on the \n     train blink to mimic movement. ``See the smoke coming out \n     there. Isn't that cute?'' More lights blink.\n       As a very young child, Pomerleau spent four or five years--\n     the time varies in the telling--in a kind of iron corset \n     after a bad fall when he was two. His father's Barton farm \n     burned. The family moved to Newport. The Depression struck. \n     His father's grocery burned.\n       In his telling, young Tony went to work barely out of \n     elementary school, making deals, subcontracting the mowing of \n     lawns and washing of cars to other kids or out-of-work men \n     and taking a hefty cut of the pay.\n       His stories of childhood Christmases are happy ones, of \n     horses and sleighs lined up outside the church for midnight \n     Mass, the bells as the sleighs jingled home, the sound of \n     carols.\n       But there is another memory as well. He walks into the \n     living rooms and leans against the piano, its top invisible \n     under the rows of photos of his children.\n       ``I was 12 or 13. One day I heard my father say to my \n     mother, `This is the first Christmas I can't afford any \n     presents.' I went down to the bank and took out $25--that was \n     money in those days--to give him.''\n       ``I came from nothing,'' he often says, setting the \n     backdrop for stories of his successes.\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\n       The big living room where an army of kids once played seems \n     empty on a pre-Thanksgiving evening. Country station WOKO \n     plays loudly on the radio.\n       In the kitchen, an aide is helping Pomerleau's 93-year-old \n     wife, Rita, with her dinner. Alzheimer's disease has slowly \n     claimed her.\n       ``It's the worst damn disease,'' he says. She speaks very \n     little, but still holds his hand and kisses him, he says.\n       ``Come back tomorrow night,'' he says as he ushers out his \n     visitors. ``We're putting up more lights. It's going to look \n     even better.''\n       `This business doesn't happen by itself'\n       Antonio B. Pomerleau made his first million before he was \n     45 and has made millions more since. His supermarket-anchored \n     strip malls dot nearly two dozen towns in Vermont and upstate \n     New York. He and his son Ernie have a staff of 25 to help run \n     their real estate businesses.\n       But here is the patriarch, spending a sunny November \n     afternoon in the artificial light of a windowless Newport \n     bowling alley two hours drive from his Burlington home, \n     talking intently and at length to a tenant whose lease \n     payment cannot amount to more than loose change in the \n     Pomerleau business.\n       There are gumball machines along the wall, a Nascar-themed \n     light over the pool table and an echoing feel to the place. A \n     lone father and son hurl heavy balls down one of the 10 \n     lanes.\n       ``How's it going?'' Pomerleau asks as he lowers himself \n     carefully into a plastic chair beside a row of bowling balls.\n       ``About like last year,'' Yvan Parenteau, the alley's \n     owner, says.\n       ``That wasn't too good,'' Pomerleau says.\n       In fact, the business is struggling. Parenteau has trouble \n     making the rent. He is worried about his fate if the mall is \n     converted to a convention center. Pomerleau makes no \n     promises, only says no deal has been signed yet. ``I never \n     skin a bear until I've shot it,'' he's been telling everyone \n     he meets today.\n       After an hour, Pomerleau pushes himself up and says \n     goodbye. He climbs into his Mercedes for the trip back to \n     Burlington.\n       ``Now you see my life. This business doesn't happen by \n     itself,'' he says of his real estate empire.\n       He lists communities where bowling alleys, some of which he \n     built, have closed. Changing times, he says. He has adjusted \n     Parenteau's rent, allowing him to pay more in the winter, \n     less in summer. He has suggested prize-giving gimmicks to \n     draw in customers, and arranged for the bowling alley to have \n     a more prominent sign on the road. Later, Parenteau will say \n     of Pomerleau, ``You couldn't have a better landlord.''\n       Still, Pomerleau says, ``If he can't pay the rent, he won't \n     be here next year.''\n       `I'm the boss'\n       A stairlift descends almost noiselessly from the third \n     floor at Follett House, the elegant 19th-century Burlington \n     mansion the Pomerleaus saved and restored as their offices. \n     Tony Pomerleau climbs off the lift, which he has used since a \n     knee injury.\n       ``Hello, hello, hello,'' he greets a visitor and leads the \n     way into his office. He is surrounded by signs of success, \n     from the million-dollar view of Lake Champlain outside the \n     window, to the picture of himself with President Reagan.\n       He rises each day, puts on a suit and tie and goes to the \n     office. He takes business calls over breakfast and into the \n     dinner hour.\n       The Pomerleau family owns shopping centers in 18 Vermont \n     communities and four in New York. Most are strip malls \n     anchored by a supermarket. They are small by comparison with \n     a University Mall or the Williston big-box stores. \n     Pomerleau's single largest holding is the Shelburne Road \n     Plaza in Burlington, valued at $14.6 million.\n       ``What the hell would I want a mall for?'' he says. ``I \n     make a lot of money the way I do things.''\n       He spotted the attraction of shopping malls early, \n     understood the importance of location, pinched pennies, \n     negotiated hard with his lenders, gave up higher rents for a \n     percentage of a store's gross.\n       He has transferred ownership of many of his holdings to his \n     children, about $50 million worth, he says. Ernie Pomerleau, \n     65, runs the day-to-day operations of the family businesses \n     and does many of his own deals.\n       So what is the elder Pomerleau's role?\n       ``I'm the boss,'' Tony Pomerleau insists. ``I'm doing deals \n     every day . . . moving that furniture store to Main Street in \n     Newport. I got the Merchants Bank moving into my building in \n     South Burlington . . . lots of deals.''  \n       His speech occasionally stutters. ``And and and so so so . \n     . .'' he growls. It's not clear whether he's lost his train \n     of thought, or is simply determined to hold the floor until \n     he's ready for the next sentence.\n       He still calculates dollars and cents in his head and \n     appears never to have forgotten a number.\n       ``Now Price Chopper,'' he begins, and outlines precisely \n     what the CEO of the grocery chain expected to gross at a new \n     store in Champlain, N. Y., and what Pomerleau told him he \n     would gross--and just how wrong Price Chopper was and just \n     how right Tony Pomerleau was: many million dollars right--\n     ``but don't put that in the paper,'' he says of the exact \n     figure he names. ``Price Chopper wouldn't like it.''\n       ``I make more money today than I ever made in my life, and \n     I don't need it. I give it away,'' he says. ``I'm not old, \n     I'm here every day making all kinds of deals. Everybody has a \n     time limit--except me.''\n       No regrets, no failures, no mistakes\n       It is a long drive from Burlington to Newport and back. \n     Grace drives, but her father is in control.\n       ``Turn here,'' he says. As the miles pass by: ``Don't go \n     that way . . . go this way . . . don't miss the turn . . . \n     keep going, I'll show you where to stop.''\n       It's a long enough trip for dozens of familiar anecdotes \n     starring Tony Pomerleau: The ``$237,000 profit in 90 days'' \n     story. The ``I probably opened the first self-service \n     supermarket in the country'' story. The ``how I beat two \n     sharp guys from Boston in a real estate deal and made a \n     couple million'' story.\n       The car passes White's Tree Farm on Vermont 15 in Essex. \n     Hundreds of tiny Christmas trees grow in long rows.\n       ``There's a guy looking 20 years ahead,'' he says and notes \n     that he recently bought 18 acres across from the family's \n     expanding shopping center in Milton. Sometime in the future \n     ``it'll be worth two, three times what I paid.''\n       ``There's a time limit on everything--except me,'' he says.\n       A reporter, probing, asks about him about failures, deals \n     that didn't work out.\n       ``I don't remember any,'' he says. Earlier, it was \n     suggested that his proposal for high rises on the Burlington \n     waterfront--rejected by the city in the early 1980s--might be \n     considered a failure. He brushed the thought aside.\n       Big regrets in his 95 years?\n       ``No regrets,'' he says.\n       His biggest mistake?\n       There is a long pause.\n       ``The toughest was the wholesale business, but I made a \n     success of it,'' he says.\n       `I'm not quite as young as you'\n       It's 8:30 in the morning when Pomerleau walks into the \n     conference room at the Shelburne town offices. Town Manager \n     Paul Bohne and Selectman Al Gobeille stand up. They greet him \n     enthusiastically.\n       Around this town, Pomerleau is the hero of the moment. The \n     future of the little Shelburnewood mobile home park in the \n     center of town has been in limbo for nearly a decade as the \n     park's owner tried to sell.\n       Pomerleau stepped in earlier this year. His wife's two \n     caregivers live at Shelburnewood and asked him for advice. \n     They were worried about the future of their modest homes.\n       He decided to buy the mobile home park, replace the aging \n     and inadequate water and sewer lines and give the park it to \n     its residents. He will retain another six acres of the 18-\n     acre parcel for possible future development.\n       It is one of many acts of charitable giving that have \n     become a bigger part of what people know about Pomerleau. \n     There are the annual children's Christmas parties in \n     Burlington and Newport, the party for 1,200 Vermont National \n     Guardsmen and their spouses. There have been million-dollars \n     gifts to St. Michael's College, the YMCA and to a fund to \n     help mobile home residents rebuild after last year's tropical \n     storm.\n       He is scornful of businesspeople who, their fortunes made \n     in Vermont, move their official residence to Florida to avoid \n     higher taxes. ``It's wrong,'' he'll say. ``You made your \n     money here and Vermont needs you. I pay very big taxes and I \n     never complain.''\n       Now, he sits down with Bohne and Gobeille.\n       ``First of all, I never went into a deal in my life knowing \n     I was going to lose money,'' he says. ``The main reason I'm \n     doing this, these people didn't know where the hell they were \n     going to go.''\n       He's in the driver's seat. He has agreed in principle to \n     give the town a right-of-way for a new road through the \n     Shelburnewood property. The town has a change in \n     configuration to suggest. Bohne and Gobeille deploy \n     arguments.\n       Pomerleau immediately makes clear he is not interested. \n     Making changes would mean a longer time line for getting the \n     project done.\n       ``This would cause a lot of delay and I'm not quite as \n     young as you,'' he tells them.\n       ``You've got another 10 years,'' Gobeille joshes.\n       ``Oh no question, no question,'' Pomerleau says and changes \n     tack. ``No question your idea is good, but I don't want to do \n     it. I don't want to delay it for those people. It would kill \n     them.''\n       Bohne and Gobeille make one more pitch, then accept his \n     refusal and drop their proposal.\n       Pomerleau repeats his objections anyway, one last time.\n       ``For me, I think I'd rather stay with my plan. I might \n     live another 10 years. Five, no question, but 10. . . .''\n       `Everybody has a time limit'\n       Pomerleau pushes open the gate in the wrought-iron fence \n     that surrounds the family plot at Resurrection Park Cemetery \n     in South Burlington. ``Plot'' seems an inadequate word for \n     this cemetery within a cemetery.\n       A colonnade of pointed cedars leads to a backless facade \n     modeled on a Greek temple, its columns also recalling those \n     at Follett House.\n       ``I like columns,'' he says. He guides two visitors past \n     the statue of the Virgin Mary, past a bird bath, granite \n     planters, stone benches, all carefully swathed in plastic for \n     the winter. The flowers are beautiful in summer, he says.\n       ``This was all my idea. I didn't ask anybody. Didn't want \n     them to tell me what to do,'' he says. He jokes, ``My kids \n     would probably put me in the woods.''\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\n       ``This is my father here, and my mother,'' he says, \n     stopping by a row of five stones where he has moved the \n     bodies of his parents, an uncle and an aunt. In an opposite \n     line are the stones for the two daughters, Anne Marie and \n     Ellen, he lost to cancer.\n       ``Go over there,'' he says, ``Look at that one.'' In a \n     little nook off the main lawn, sits a stone for Jay Lefebvre, \n     the family's housekeeper of 40 years.\n       ``I told her before she died, you are part of the family, \n     you are going to be here with us,'' he says.\n       He walks slowly toward the line of columns that serves as a \n     dramatic backdrop. He climbs up three steps. Here, at the \n     head of the family, a bit above them all, a pair of massive, \n     polished slabs are set in the ground. Pomerleau's name is \n     carved on one, his wife's on the other.\n       The man who constantly jokes that St. Peter has forgotten \n     him has nevertheless prepared.\n       But Tony, one of his visitors asks, what about ``everybody \n     has a time limit--except me''?\n       ``This is just in case,'' he says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6942-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6942-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJOR ALISON KAMATARIS\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I want to honor my Air Force \nlegislative fellow, active duty MAJ Alison ``Babs'' Kamataris. For the \npast year, Babs has been an invaluable member of my legislative team.\n  Babs has served with honor and distinction in the United States Air \nForce for nearly 15 years. She is an accomplished Air Force \nintelligence officer--representing the best our military has to offer. \nHer career has included a tour in Turkey and two tours in South Korea, \nas well as six deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. In Congress, she \nhas been a critical asset to my legislative team, where she has used \nher tremendous knowledge and experience to help me in my efforts to \nserve those who serve us, and ensure that our brave servicemembers have \nthe resources they need to carry out their missions and protect our \ncountry.\n  Babs was a natural fit for our office. She grew up in Belmont, NH and \nattended Norwich University in Vermont. She possesses that rugged, \nhardworking, do-it-yourself attitude for which Granite Staters are \nknown. We also share a personal connection as Air Force families. Not \nonly has Babs served our country in the Air Force with distinction, but \nher husband has too. Like my husband Joe, Babs' husband Andy is an A-10 \npilot. In fact, Andy deployed to Afghanistan for 4 months this year \nwhile Babs worked in my office and served as a conscientious mother to \nher beautiful 3-year-old daughter, Taylor. Babs and her family deserve \nour deep admiration and gratitude for their service to our country.\n  As Babs' tenure in our office comes to a conclusion, we are sad to \nsee her go. We will always consider Babs and her entire Air Force \nfamily as part of our team. Babs will continue to serve our Nation well \nin positions of increasing responsibility. I look forward to watching \nher career closely. Babs and Andy are truly the best our country has to \noffer. I and my staff wish her the very best in her next assignment and \nbeyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6942-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DUANE BEESON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend the renowned attorney Duane Beeson, who is being \nhonored this year with the Peggy Browning Fund Award in recognition of \nhis tireless efforts and outstanding achievements on behalf of working \nmen and women in the San Francisco Bay area.\n  As senior partner in the law firm of Beeson, Tayer & Bodine, Duane \nBeeson is one of the Nation's leading practitioners of public and \nprivate sector labor law, including representation of employee benefit \nplans. He is a member of the California State Bar, the Supreme Court of \nthe United States Bar, and several United States District Courts and \nCourts of Appeal Bars.\n  Duane Beeson was born in Berkeley, CA in 1922 and graduated from \nBerkeley High School, where he met his future wife, Coni. After serving \nin the U.S. Army in the European theater in World War II, Duane \ngraduated summa cum laude from Lafayette College and earned his LL.B. \nat Harvard Law School in 1948.\n  Following law school, Mr. Beeson served as clerk for Judge William E. \nOrr at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and was \nan instructor at the University of San Francisco Law School. As a \nleading expert on labor law, he has also taught at Hastings College of \nthe Law, George Washington Law School, the University of California \nExtension, and the University of San Francisco Labor Management School.\n  In 1950, Mr. Beeson moved to Washington, DC, where he worked for 11 \nyears as an attorney for the National Labor Relations Board, handling \nappellate and Supreme Court litigation. In 1961, the Beesons had the \nopportunity to return to their beloved California when Duane was hired \nby Joseph Grodin, the great labor lawyer and later California Supreme \nCourt Justice, to represent teachers unions in the Bay area. Mr. Beeson \nbecame a partner in the firm, which was then known as Brundage Neyhart \nGrodin & Beeson and is now Beeson, Tayer & Bodine.\n  In the 1970s and 80s, Joe Grodin and Duane Beeson led their firm into \nthe areas of employment benefits covered by ERISA and related fields in \nwhich labor organizations are involved. More recently, the firm has \nbecome active in employment law of all kinds--including mediation and \nnegotiation-facilitation services along with representation of \nindividual employees in wage and hour, discrimination, harassment, and \nother types of cases--and has also developed a specialty in education \nlaw as an outgrowth of representing teacher unions.\n  I have known and respected Duane Beeson for many years, since my \nhusband Stewart went to work at Duane's firm as a young attorney. As \nDuane turns 90 and is honored with the Peggy Browning Fund Award, it is \nmy pleasure to salute and celebrate his long and distinguished career \nrepresenting the working people of California. He is truly one of a \nkind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6942-4", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6942-S6943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. KNOX MELLON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the extraordinary service of Dr. Knox Mellon who is retiring \nfrom the California Missions Foundation after 8 years as its executive \ndirector. Though he will be missed, his contributions to the field of \nhistoric preservation will benefit generations to come.\n  Dr. Mellon has had a long and distinguished career in the field of \nhistoric preservation. In 1977, he was appointed as California's first \nprofessional State Historic Preservation Officer by Governor Jerry \nBrown. He served in that position until 1983 and then branched out on \nhis own, starting Knox Mellon and Associates, a consulting firm \nspecializing in historic preservation, oral history, historic research, \nand strategic planning. Dr. Mellon's firm worked on a number of \nhistoric buildings in Southern California, including the Downtown \nCentral Library in Los Angeles, Los Angeles City Hall, the Beverly \nHills Hotel, and the L.A. Coliseum. During the same time, Dr. Mellon \nalso found time in his busy schedule to serve as an Adjunct Professor \nof History at the University of California, Riverside, as well as the \nDirector of the Mission Inn Foundation. In 2000, Dr. Mellon was \nappointed to a second term as California's State Historic Preservation \nOfficer, this time by Governor Gray Davis. In 2004, he retired from \nState service and became the executive director of the nonprofit \nCalifornia Missions Foundation.\n  Founded in 1998, the California Missions Foundation is the only \norganization dedicated solely to the long-term preservation and \nrestoration of California's 21 missions. Early in Dr. Mellon's tenure \nas executive director, we worked together with Congressman Sam Farr and \nSenator Dianne Feinstein to pass the California Missions Preservation \nAct. At a 2005 event to celebrate this new law, Dr. Mellon eloquently \ndiscussed the historic value of California's missions, which are the \nmost visited historic attractions in the State:\n\n       The missions are California's Pyramids. They are a part of \n     our past. They help symbolize the nation's western \n     beginnings. Of all the institutions that define California's \n     heritage, none has the historic significance and emotional \n     impact of the chain of Spanish missions that stretch from San \n     Diego to Sonoma. The missions are an important part of the \n     state's cultural fabric and must be preserved as priceless \n     historic monuments.\n\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\n\n  During Dr. Mellon's tenure as executive director, the California \nMissions Foundation received a number of grants to preserve and restore \nCalifornia's missions, including four grants from the Department of \nInterior totaling $2.28 million. With those funds, the California \nMissions Foundation was able to repair some of the extensive earthquake \ndamage at Mission San Miguel; complete a seismic retrofit at Mission \nSan Luis Rey; and stabilize buildings and preserve artwork and \nartifacts at the Carmel and Santa Barbara missions.\n  California's residents and visitors alike benefit from Dr. Mellon's \nhard work, expertise, and vision each time they visit one of \nCalifornia's beautiful and historic missions.\n  I thank Dr. Mellon for his service to the State of California, and \nwish him and his wife Carlotta the very best as they embark on the next \nexciting phase of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6943-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING RUTH SINGER MEYERS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise in memory of my dear \nfriend Ruth Singer Meyers, who died in Los Angeles last month after a \nbrief but valiant fight with cancer.\n  Ruth was a philanthropist, a community leader, and a champion of \nIsrael and a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. She was also a kind, \nwarm, and caring human being who had countless good friends and deeply \nloved her husband, children, and grandchildren.\n  Born Ruth Lazarus in Wilmington, DE, Ruth moved to California as a \ngirl with her family. After graduating from Beverly Hills High School \nand UCLA, she married and had two sons, Rick and Anthony. When her boys \ngrew up and went off to college, Ruth dedicated herself to charitable \nwork, the Jewish community, and Israel.\n  Ruth's energy, dedication, and fundraising abilities were legendary \nin charitable circles. She served on the Board of Governors of Cedars-\nSinai Hospital, the Board of Directors of the Venice Family Clinic, the \nInternational Board of Governors of Tel Aviv University, and the \nNational Board of the United Jewish Appeal. As missions chairman for \nthe Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, she led dozens of community trips \nto Israel. She also served as the Los Angeles chairman of the American \nIsrael Public Affairs Committee and became a national officer in the \norganization.\n  On behalf of the people of California, who have benefited so much \nfrom Ruth's life and work, I send my deepest gratitude and condolences \nto her husband, Mickey Meyers, as well as her sons and grandchildren. I \nknow they and many others will miss this wonderful woman, as will I. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6943-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MAL MOORE\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nthe athletic director for the University of Alabama, Mal Moore.\n  Coach Moore was born in Dozier, AL in 1939. He was recruited and \nawarded an athletic scholarship by the legendary coach Paul ``Bear'' \nBryant. He played for the Crimson Tide from 1958-1962, including on the \nundefeated 1961 national championship squad--ranked #1 by the \nAssociated Press and considered by many to be one of the best ever. He \ngraduated from the University of Alabama in 1963, and began his \ncoaching career as an assistant at Montana State.\n  Having displayed leadership that clearly impressed Coach Bryant, \nCoach Moore was hired away from Montana State to serve as a graduate \nassistant at his alma mater, where he received his master's degree. \nFrom there he embarked on a highly successful 31 year coaching career, \nwhich included stints at Notre Dame, the NFL and for national \nchampionship teams under both Coach Bryant and Coach Gene Stallings at \nAlabama. In 1999, he was named the Crimson Tide's athletics director, a \nposition he still holds.\n  Coach Mal Moore is a champion. He has been a part of nine national \nchampionships--1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, 1979, 1992, 2009 and \n2011--with the first coming as a player, the next six during his \ncoaching career and the most recent two during his time as athletics \ndirector. During his tenure as athletic director, Alabama has gone on \nto win seven national championships in four different sports: football \nin 2009 and 2011; gymnastics under Coach Sarah Patterson in 2002, 2011 \nand 2012; women's golf in 2012 and women's softball in 2012.\n  In addition to the success the university has seen on the fields, \ncourses and arenas under Coach Mal Moore, he has transformed the \nUniversity of Alabama's athletics program, improving the University for \nall students and student-athletes. Coach Moore has raised more than \n$200 million for capital improvements to make the Capstone's facilities \namong the best in the Nation; improving Bryant-Denny Stadium, Coleman \nColiseum, John and Ann Rhoads Softball Stadium as well as the soccer \nand tennis stadiums. His efforts to improve student-athlete academics \nhave led the Crimson Tide to high graduation rates and have made \nAlabama athletes among the most competitive academically.\n  Coach Moore's sizable contributions to University of Alabama \nathletics and academics have been noticed and recognized by the \nUniversity of Alabama, the State of Alabama and nationally. In 2007, \nthe Alabama football building was renamed the Mal M. Moore Athletic \nFacility. The Alabama Sports Hall of Fame named Coach Moore the \nDistinguished Alabama Sportsman in 2007 for his efforts as athletics \ndirector, and inducted him into the Hall of Fame in 2011. Recently, the \nNational Football Foundation recognized Coach Moore with the John L. \nToner Award, which is presented annually by the foundation to an \nathletic director who has demonstrated superior administrative \nabilities and shown outstanding dedication to college athletics and \nparticularly college football.\n  Coach Mal Moore has been part of the University of Alabama and \nCrimson Tide football as a student-athlete, coach and administrator for \nmore than 50 years. He has left an indelible mark at the Capstone, and \nhis leadership will be felt by Alabama students and staff for \ngenerations to come.\n  It's a pleasure and honor for me to recognize a great leader, a great \nathletic director and a great man from the heartland of my State of \nAlabama. I look forward to enjoying the fruits of his labors for years \nto come.

Res. 601\n\n       Whereas, in 1934, the United States Ambassador to Albania \n     Herman Bernstein wrote that ``there is no trace of any \n     discrimination against Jews in Albania, because Albania \n     happens to be one of the rare lands in Europe today where \n     religious prejudice and hate do not exist, even though \n     Albanians themselves are divided into three faiths'';\n       Whereas, in 1938, approximately 300 Albanian Jews lived in \n     the Republic of Albania, and more than 1,900 escaped to \n     Albania from Nazi-occupied Western Europe and the former \n     Yugoslavia during World War II;\n       Whereas Albanians in Albania and Kosova, based on their \n     unique history of religious tolerance, considered it a matter \n     of national pride and tradition to help Jews during the \n     Holocaust, and due to the actions of many individual \n     Albanians, the entire native and refugee Jewish community in \n     Albania during World War II survived the Holocaust;\n       Whereas Albanians sheltered and protected Jews in Albania \n     and in Kosova, even at the risk of Albanian lives, beginning \n     with the invasion and occupation of Albania by Italian \n     fascists led by Benito Mussolini in 1939;\n       Whereas, after Nazi Germany occupied Albania in 1943 and \n     the Gestapo ordered Jewish refugees in the Albanian capital \n     of Tirana to register, Albanian leaders refused to provide a \n     list of Jews living in Albania, and Albanian clerks issued \n     false identity papers to protect all Jews in the country;\n       Whereas, in June 1990, Jewish-American Congressman Tom \n     Lantos and former Albanian-American Congressman Joe DioGuardi \n     were the first United States officials to enter Albania in 50 \n     years and received from the Communist Party leader and \n     Albanian President Ramiz Alia a thick file from the archives \n     containing hundreds of news clippings and personal letters \n     sent by Jews to their Albanian rescuers after World War II, \n     but that the Communist government prevented from being \n     delivered for 45 years;\n       Whereas Congressman Joe DioGuardi, upon returning to the \n     United States in June 1990,\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\n     sent the file for authentication to Elli Streit in Tel Aviv \n     for delivery to appropriate officials at Yad Vashem, the \n     Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority, in \n     Jerusalem;\n       Whereas Josef Jakoel and his eldest daughter, Felicita, \n     both Albanian Jews, led the emigration of almost all Albanian \n     Jews to Israel in 1991 as the Communist regime was \n     collapsing;\n       Whereas Yad Vashem has designated 69 Albanians as \n     ``Righteous Persons'' and Albania as one of the ``Righteous \n     among the Nations'';\n       Whereas, based on the information authenticated by Yad \n     Vashem, Jewish-American author and philanthropist Harvey \n     Sarner published ``Rescue in Albania'' in 1997 to call \n     international attention to the unique role of the Albanian \n     people in saving Jews from the Holocaust;\n       Whereas, in October 1997, the Albanian American Civic \n     League and the Albanian American Foundation began the \n     distribution of 10,000 copies of ``Rescue in Albania'', with \n     forewords by Congressmen Tom Lantos and Benjamin Gilman, to \n     bring to the attention of the Jewish people and their leaders \n     the plight of Albanians in Kosova living under a brutal \n     occupation at the hands of Serbian dictator Slobodan \n     Milosevic, in order to forestall another genocide in Kosova;\n       Whereas, in a statement at the ``Salute to Albanian \n     Tolerance, Resistance, and Hope: Remembering Besa and the \n     Holocaust'' held by the Albanian American Civic League and \n     the Albanian American Foundation in 2005 on the occasion of \n     the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death \n     camps, Dr. Mordechai Paldiel, then Director for the Righteous \n     at Yad Vashem, commemorated the heroism of Albanians as ``the \n     only ones among rescuers in other countries who not only went \n     out of their way to save Jews, but vied and competed with \n     each other for the privilege of being a rescuer, thanks to \n     besa'', the code of honor that requires an Albanian to save \n     the life of anyone seeking refuge, even if it means \n     sacrificing one's own life;\n       Whereas, in 2006, Shirley Cloyes DioGuardi, Balkan Affairs \n     Adviser to the Albanian American Civic League and Executive \n     Director of the Albanian American Foundation, published \n     ``Jewish Survival in Albania & the Ethics of `Besa' '' in the \n     journal of the American Jewish Congress to document the \n     saving role of Albanians and how that role was revealed, in \n     spite of the Communist effort to suppress it;\n       Whereas, on December 2, 2008, Arslan Rezniqi and his son, \n     Mustafa, were the first Kosovar Albanians recognized by Yad \n     Vashem's ``Righteous among Nations Department'', for leading \n     400 Jewish families from Decan, Kosova, into safety in \n     Albania;\n       Whereas Arif Alickaj, the Secretary of the Municipality of \n     Decan, risked his job and his life helping the Rezniqis \n     rescue Jews in Nazi-occupied Kosova by issuing false identity \n     papers to ensure their safe passage to Albania and who, like \n     so many Albanians from Kosova and Albania, died before Jewish \n     survivors could validate his role at Yad Vashem;\n       Whereas Shirley Cloyes DioGuardi addressed the 2010 \n     International Oral History Association Conference in Prague, \n     and brought Leka Rezniqi, the grandson of Mustafa Rezniqi, to \n     join her in revealing the ``underground railroad'' between \n     Albanians in Kosova and Albania that was essential to the \n     rescue of Jews; and\n       Whereas Albania is the only nation in Europe that had more \n     Jewish residents after World War II than before World War II: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people of Albania and Kosova for \n     protecting and saving the lives of Jews who either lived in \n     Albania or sought asylum there during the Holocaust;\n       (2) commends Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' \n     Remembrance Authority, in Israel for recognizing Albanians, \n     who took action at great risk to themselves to protect Jews \n     during the Holocaust, for their humanity, courage, and \n     heroism;\n       (3) reaffirms, on the 100th anniversary of Albania's \n     declaration of independence in 1912, its support for close \n     ties between the United States and Albania and between the \n     United States and Kosova, which declared its independence in \n     2008; and\n       (4) commends the officers, boards of directors, and members \n     of the Albanian American Civic League and the Albanian \n     American Foundation for their unstinting work, since 1989, to \n     bring the plight of the Albanian people and the unique \n     historic connection between Albanians and Jews to \n     international attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE SUBMITTAL TO CONGRESS OF \n                   THE HOMELAND DEFENSE HEDGING POLICY AND \n                   STRATEGY REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81; 125 Stat. 1340) \n     requires a homeland defense hedging policy and strategy \n     report from the Secretary of Defense.\n       (2) The report was required to be submitted not later than \n     75 days after the date of the enactment of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, namely by \n     March 16, 2012.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense has not yet submitted the \n     report as required.\n       (4) In March 2012, General Charles Jacoby, Jr., Commander \n     of the United States Northern Command, the combatant command \n     responsible for operation of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system to defend the homeland against ballistic \n     missile threats, testified before Congress that ``I am \n     confident in my ability to successfully defend the homeland \n     from the current set of limited long-range ballistic missile \n     threats'', and that ``[a]gainst current threats from the \n     Middle East, I am confident we are well postured''.\n       (5) Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) \n     is intended to augment the currently deployed homeland \n     defense capability of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system against a potential future Iranian long-range missile \n     threat by deploying an additional layer of forward-deployed \n     interceptors in Europe in the 2020 timeframe.\n       (6) The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \n     has testified to Congress that, although the intelligence \n     community does ``not know if Iran will eventually decide to \n     build nuclear weapons'', it judges ``that Iran would likely \n     choose missile delivery as its preferred method of delivering \n     a nuclear weapon''. He also testified that ``Iran already has \n     the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle \n     East, and it is expanding the scale, reach, and \n     sophistication of its ballistic missile forces, many of which \n     are inherently capable of carrying a nuclear payload''.\n       (7) The 2012 Annual Report to Congress on the Military \n     Power of Iran by the Department of Defense states that, in \n     addition to increasing its missile inventories, ``Iran has \n     boosted the lethality and effectiveness of its existing \n     missile systems with accuracy improvements and new \n     submunitions payloads'', and that it continues to develop \n     missiles that can strike Israel and Eastern Europe. It also \n     states that ``Iran has launched multistage space launch \n     vehicles that could serve as a testbed for developing long-\n     range ballistic missiles technologies'', and that ``[w]ith \n     sufficient foreign assistance, Iran may be technically \n     capable of flight-testing an intercontinental ballistic \n     missile by 2015''.\n       (8) Despite the failure of its April 2012 satellite launch \n     attempt, North Korea warned the United States in October 2012 \n     that the United States mainland is within range of its \n     missiles.\n       (9) The threat of limited ballistic missile attack against \n     the United States homeland from countries such as North Korea \n     and Iran is increasing.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report \n     required by section 233 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2012 is necessary to inform Congress on \n     options to protect the United States homeland against the \n     evolving ballistic missile threat, including potential \n     options prior to the deployment of Phase 4 of the European \n     Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense should comply with the \n     requirements of section 233 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 by submitting the \n     homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report to \n     Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2963.

LIMITATIONS ON BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT \n                   ACTIVITIES AND CRITERIA FOR CERTAIN DECISIONS \n                   INVOLVING SUCH ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2012, the Department of Defense requested additional \n     rounds of defense base closure and realignment in 2013 and \n     2015.\n       (2) There have been five rounds of defense base closure and \n     realignment (BRAC) in the last 25 years (1988, 1991, 1993, \n     1995, and 2005).\n       (3) Congress has not approved additional rounds of base \n     closure and realignment to occur after 2005, and recognizes \n     that the 2005 round incurred substantial costs that will not \n     be offset by savings for nearly two decades.\n       (4) According to the Government Accountability Office, \n     implementation of the 2005 round of defense base closure and \n     realignment cost $35,100,000,000, or approximately \n     $14,100,000,000 more than was estimated by the 2005 Base \n     Closure and Realignment Commission.\n       (5) Furthermore, the Government Accountability Office has \n     determined that the 2005 round of defense base closure and \n     realignment will take 17 years before taxpayers realize net \n     savings from the round.\n       (6) On March 8, 2012, defending the President's request for \n     additional rounds of defense base closure and realignment in \n     testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the House \n     of Representatives, Dr. Dorothy Robyn, Deputy Undersecretary \n     of Defense for Installations and Environment, asserted that \n     the Department of Defense would close military installations \n     using non-BRAC authorities, stating that ``if Congress does \n     not authorize additional BRAC rounds the department will be \n     forced to use its existing authorities to begin to realign \n     and close bases''.\n       (7) The Department of Defense may close or realign bases \n     only if a round of defense base closure and realignment is \n     carried out in compliance with sections 2687 and 993 of title \n     10, United States Code.\n       (8) Section 2687 of title 10, United States Code, contains \n     ambiguous language, leading the Department of Defense to \n     pursue significant closures and realignments without \n     congressional approval or an authorization for a round of \n     defense base closure and realignment.\n       (9) Sections 2687 and 993 of title 10, United States Code, \n     contain single action limits on reductions that are too \n     easily circumvented by cumulative actions.\n       (10) As demonstrated by BRAC and other closure and \n     realignment actions, base closures and realignments can have \n     significant effects on Department of Defense functions, \n     current and future operational capabilities, and on host \n     communities and States.\n       (11) Recommendations for closures and realignments should \n     be carried out only with the consent of Congress, which has \n     the constitutional responsibility to ``raise and support \n     Armies,'' ``provide and maintain a Navy,'' ``make Rules for \n     the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,'' \n     and ``provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the \n     Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be \n     employed in the Service of the United States''.\n       (b) Limitations on Base Closure and Realignment \n     Activities.--Section 2687 of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``at which at least 300 \n     civilian personnel are authorized to be employed'';\n       (B) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:\n       ``(2) any realignment with respect to any military \n     installation involving a reduction in the number of military \n     and civilian personnel authorized to be employed at such \n     military installation at the time the Secretary of Defense \n     notifies Congress under subsection (b) of the Secretary's \n     proposal to close or realign such installation by more than \n     the lesser of--\n       ``(A) 100;

and\n       (iii) by striking ``to which clause (1) or (2)'' and \n     inserting ``to which paragraph (1) or (2)''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) by striking ``referred to in such subsection'';\n       (B) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by striking ``or the Secretary of the military \n     department concerned'';\n       (ii) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as \n     subparagraphs (B) and (D), respectively;\n       (iii) by inserting before subparagraph (B), as redesignated \n     by clause (ii), the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(A) a justification for the proposed action;'';\n       (iv) in subparagraph (B), as so redesignated, by striking \n     ``;

and'' and inserting a \n     semicolon; and\n       (vii) by inserting after subparagraph (D), as so \n     redesignated, the following new subparagraphs:\n       ``(E) an estimate of the number of military, civilian, and \n     contractor personnel affected by the proposed action; and\n       ``(F) a plan to provide support for affected communities; \n     and''; and\n       (C) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:\n       ``(2) Congress has enacted legislation expressly \n     authorizing the action.'';\n       (3) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) by striking ``shall not apply to the closure'' and \n     inserting the following: ``shall not apply--\n       ``(1) to the closure'';\n       (B) by striking ``or a military emergency.'' and inserting \n     ``or a military emergency; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) to the relocation from a military installation of \n     personnel or functions that are required to support the \n     deployment of members of the armed forces, provided that such \n     personnel and functions are returned to the military \n     installation after the deployment.'';\n       (4) in subsection (d), by striking ``(1) After the \n     expiration'' and all that follows through ``(2) Nothing in \n     this section'' and inserting ``Nothing in this section'';\n       (5) in subsection (e)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``and any public land \n     under Bureau of Land Management control that is withdrawn and \n     reserved for military training and testing'' after \n     ``including any leased facility'';\n       (B) by amending paragraph (3) to read as follows:\n       ``(3) The term `realignment' includes any action or \n     combination of actions within a 4-year period that reduces or \n     relocates functions and military or civilian personnel \n     positions, but does not include a reduction in force \n     resulting from a reduction in military end strength levels or \n     a reduction in total civilian personnel levels.'';\n       (C) by striking paragraph (4); and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(4) The term `closure' includes any action or combination \n     of actions that results in the elimination of all active \n     functions at a military installation, the elimination of all \n     military and civilian personnel positions at a military \n     installation, or the placement of a military installation \n     into non-active status.''; and\n       (6) by adding at the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(g) For purposes of this section, the component bases of \n     a joint base shall be considered as independent military \n     installations, and not collectively as a single military \n     installation.\n       ``(h) For purposes of this section, any leased space in \n     which more than 300 combined military and civilian personnel \n     are housed shall be considered to be an independent military \n     installation, and shall not be considered part of a larger \n     military installation. Functions and personnel located at a \n     leased space may be transferred to another leased space \n     located within 50 miles or to the nearest military \n     installation located within 50 miles notwithstanding any \n     limitations in this section.''.\n       (c) Criteria.--Not later than March 31, 2013, the \n     Comptroller General of the United\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\n     States shall submit to the congressional defense committees a \n     report including objective criteria to be used by the \n     Department of Defense to make decisions relating to \n     realignments of units employed at military installations that \n     are not covered by the requirements of section 2687 of title \n     10, United States Code, and closures of military \n     installations that are not covered by such requirements.\n       (d) One-Year Moratorium on Certain Actions Resulting in \n     Personnel Reductions.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), no \n     action may be taken before October 1, 2013, that would result \n     in a military installation covered under paragraph (1) of \n     section 2687(a) of title 10, United States Code, to no longer \n     be covered by such paragraph.\n       (2) National security waiver.--The Secretary of Defense may \n     waive the prohibition under paragraph (1) if the Secretary \n     certifies to the congressional defense committees that is in \n     the national security interests of the United States.\n       (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the \n     amendments made by this Act may be construed to authorize a \n     round of defense base closure and realignment.\n       (f) Prohibition on Use of Funds.--None of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated by this Act may be obligated or \n     expended to consider a round of defense base closure and \n     realignment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3007. Mr. SESSIONS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 3254, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2013 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NEGOTIATING CONCESSIONS \n                   WITH TERRORISTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has a longstanding policy of opposing \n     negotiations with terrorists and terrorist organizations on \n     concessions of any kind, including ransom demands, prisoner \n     releases, and hostage exchanges. This longstanding policy has \n     been repeated by numerous administrations over the past four \n     decades.\n       (2) For example, at an August 4, 1975, meeting between \n     President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \n     and President of Yugoslavia Josip Tito, Secretary Kissinger \n     explained that the United States' ``position is, as it has \n     always been, that we refuse to negotiate and to pay ransom in \n     these cases. We do this in order not to encourage the capture \n     of other Americans for the same purpose.''\n       (3) In his comments to President Tito, Secretary Kissinger \n     explained the basis for the United States' policy, as well as \n     his expectation that the United States would never change \n     this no-negotiation policy: ``The American Government will \n     always refuse to negotiate because that is the only way we \n     can keep demands from being made upon us.''\n       (4) In the same conversation, President Ford said, ``It's \n     our strong feeling that if we were to breach this hard line \n     that we take there would be no end to the demands being made \n     upon us. We have to be tough and that is right in the long \n     run.''\n       (5) On January 20, 1986, President Ronald Reagan issued \n     National Security Decision Directive Number 207, which \n     prohibits negotiations with terrorist organizations regarding \n     the release of hostages.\n       (6) National Security Decision Directive 207 sets forth in \n     unequivocal terms the United States' ``firm opposition to \n     terrorism in all its forms'' and makes clear the government's \n     ``conviction that to accede to terrorist demands places more \n     American citizens at risk. This no-concessions policy is the \n     best way of protecting the greatest number of people and \n     ensuring their safety.''\n       (7) National Security Decision Directive 207 continues to \n     say: ``The [United States Government] will pay no ransoms, \n     nor permit releases of prisoners or agree to other conditions \n     that could serve to encourage additional terrorism. We will \n     make no changes in our policy because of terrorist threats or \n     acts.''\n       (8) Department of State Publication 10217, which was \n     released in similar formats by the administrations of George \n     H.W. Bush in 1991 and Bill Clinton in 1994, espouses the same \n     no-concessions policy and makes clear the United States \n     ``will not support the freeing of prisoners from \n     incarceration in response to terrorist demands''.\n       (9) On April 4, 2002, President George W. Bush said, \n     ``Terror must be stopped. No nation can negotiate with \n     terrorists, for there is no way to make peace with those \n     whose only goal is death.''\n       (10) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while serving in \n     the United States Senate, wrote in 2007 that the United \n     States ``cannot negotiate with individual terrorists; they \n     must be hunted down and captured or killed''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States Government should firmly maintain its \n     longstanding policy against negotiating with terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations on any concession or demand; and\n       (2) any abandonment or weakening of this policy would \n     endanger the safety of United States citizens, including \n     members of the Armed Forces, and increase terrorist \n     kidnappings, hostage demands, and murders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3008.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3642.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3642) to clarify the scope of the Economic \n     Espionage Act of 1996.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \npass this simple, commonsense legislation to clarify a provision of the \nEconomic Espionage Act and thereby help protect American businesses and \nAmerican jobs.\n  The Economic Espionage Act makes it a crime to, among other things, \nsteal a trade secret knowing that the theft will hurt the owner. This \nis an important protection for American businesses, which often choose \ntrade secret protection over other forms of intellectual property \nprotection.\n  A recent decision of the Second Circuit in United States v. Aleynikov \ncasts doubt on the reach of the statute. A jury in that case found the \ndefendant guilty of stealing computer code from his employer. The court \noverturned the conviction, holding among other things that the trade \nsecret did not meet the interstate commerce prong of the statute, even \nthough the defendant had copied the stolen code from his office in New \nYork to a server in Germany; downloaded the code to his home computer \nin New Jersey; then flew to his new job in Illinois with the stolen \nsource code in his possession; and the code was used in interstate \ncommerce.\n  The court held that the Economic Espionage Act provision applies only \nto trade secrets that are part of a product that is produced to be \nplaced in interstate commerce. Because the company's proprietary \nsoftware was neither placed in interstate commerce, nor produced to be \nplaced in interstate commerce, the law did not apply--even though the \nstolen source code was part of a financial trading system that was used \nin interstate commerce every day.\n  The clarifying legislation that the Senate will pass today corrects \nthe court's narrow reading to ensure that our federal criminal laws \nadequately address the theft of trade secrets related to a product or \nservice used in interstate commerce. It is a straightforward fix, but \nan important one, as we work to ensure that American companies can \nprotect the products they work so hard to develop, so they may continue \nto grow and thrive. I urge the House to act quickly to pass this \ncommonsense legislation.\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3642) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 602\n\n       Whereas, on June 25, 1950, the Communist Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea began the Korean War by invading \n     the Republic of Korea with approximately 135,000 troops;\n       Whereas nearly 1,800,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces served along with the forces of the Republic of Korea \n     and 20 other Allied nations in the Korean theater of \n     operations to defend freedom and democracy in the Korean \n     Peninsula;\n       Whereas, during the Korean War, 36,574 people from the \n     United States died and 103,284 people from the United States \n     were wounded in some of the most horrific combat and weather \n     conditions in the history of warfare;\n       Whereas almost 60 years have passed since the signing of \n     the cease-fire agreement at Panmunjom on July 27, 1953, and \n     the Korean Peninsula still technically remains in a state of \n     war;\n       Whereas the Korean War has for many years been a \n     ``Forgotten War'' for people in the United States;\n       Whereas Korean War veterans deserve to be recognized by the \n     people of the United States for their honorable and \n     courageous service in defense of democracy and freedom during \n     the Korean War;\n       Whereas the tide of communism on the southern \\1/2\\ of the \n     Korean Peninsula was halted, liberty triumphed over tyranny, \n     and the Republic of Korea has developed into a modern and \n     prosperous democracy because of the selfless sacrifice of the \n     Korean War veterans;\n       Whereas the people of the United States and the Republic of \n     Korea are eternally grateful to the Korean War veterans;\n       Whereas the history of the Korean War should be included in \n     the curriculum of schools in the United States so that future \n     generations never forget the sacrifices of the Korean War \n     veterans and what those veterans accomplished;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense 60th Anniversary of the \n     Korean War Commemoration Committee will implement a national \n     campaign to honor the Korean War veterans, remember those \n     Korean War veterans still counted among the missing in \n     action, and educate the people of the United States \n     concerning the ongoing relevance of the Korean War; and\n       Whereas the commemorative campaign will include ceremonies \n     in the United States and the Republic of Korea in recognition \n     of the beginning (June 25, 1950) and the armistice ending \n     hostilities (July 27, 1953), as well as a national media and \n     outreach campaign for Veterans Day 2012 to honor the Korean \n     War veterans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates 2012-2013 as the ``Year of the Korean War \n     Veteran'';\n       (2) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the Korean War; and\n       (3) honors the contributions and sacrifices made by the \n     Korean War veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6979-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.
